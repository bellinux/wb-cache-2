5000|$|Hillside or {{embankment}} {{models are}} usually installed {{in one of}} two ways. It can be installed in an existing hill/embankment or dirt is built up around a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>unit</b> forming a hill around it. The door can be set at an angle or vertically. There can be steps leading into the unit, or it can be installed to where the floor is level with the ground outside. The embankment storm cellar can be made from concrete, steel, fiberglass, or any other structurally sound material or composite and is usually installed in a hill or embankment, leaving only the door exposed. In some cases they can hold an entire neighborhood or town as with a community shelter. More often though, they are built to hold one or two families, specified as a residential shelter. All underground [...] "storm or tornado" [...] shelters must be properly anchored.|$|E
40|$|Inadequate {{sanitation}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of water pollution and consequently illness in many underdeveloped countries, including South Africa and, specifically, the Eastern Cape Province, where cholera has become endemic. As modern wastewater treatment processes are often energy intensive and expensive, they are not suitable for use in these areas. There is thus a need to develop more sustainable wastewater treatment technologies for application in smaller communities. The integrated algal ponding system (IAPS) was identified as a possible solution to this wastewater management problem and was investigated for adaptation to local conditions, at the Rhodes University Environmental Experimental Field Station in Grahamstown, South Africa. The system was monitored over a period of nine years, with various configuration adjustments of the high rate algal pond (HRAP) unit operation investigated. Under standard operating conditions, the system was able to achieve levels of nutrient and organic removal comparable with conventional wastewater treatment works. The mean nitrate level achieved in the effluent was below the 15 mg. l- 1 South African discharge standard, however, nitrate removal in the IAPS was found to be inconsistent. Although the system was unable to sustain chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal to below the 75 mg. l- 1 South African discharge standard, a removal rate of 87 % was recorded, with the residual COD remaining in the form of algal biomass. Previous studies in the Eastern Cape Province have shown that few small wastewater treatment works produce effluent that meets the microbial count specification. Therefore, in addition to the collation of IAPS data from the entire nine year monitoring period, this study also investigated the use of the HRAP as an independent unit operation for disinfection of effluent from small sewage plants. It was demonstrated that the independent high rate algal pond (IHRAP) as a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>unit</b> operation could consistently produce water with Escherichia coli counts of 0 cfu. 100 ml- 1. The observed effect was related to a number of possible conditions prevailing in the system, including elevated pH, sunlight and dissolved oxygen. It was also found that the IHRAP greatly enhanced the nutrient removal capabilities of the conventional IAPS, making it possible to reliably and consistently maintain phosphate and ammonium levels in the final effluent to below 5 mg. l- 1 and 2 mg. l- 1 respectively (South African discharge standards are 10 mg. l- 1 and 3 mg. l- 1 in each case). The quality of the final effluent produced by the optimisation of the IAPS would allow it to be used for irrigation, thereby providing an alternative water source in water stressed areas. The system also proved to be exceptionally robust and data collected during periods of intensive and low management regimes were broadly comparable. Results of the 9 year study have demonstrated reliable performance of the IAPS and its use an appropriate, sustainable wastewater treatment option for small communities...|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. In {{order for}} {{developers}} to provide reasonable engineering services {{as well as}} a liveable dwelling unit within the existing housing subsidy, a substantial increase in residential density is required. Increased urban densities will decrease engineering services costs due to a greater sharing ability. This study was undertaken in order to quantify the benefits of urban densification on engineering services. The financial problems of Local Authorities in South Africa due to the entrenched culture of non-payment for services, is causing a rapid decline in the sustainability of engineering services due also to low, or non-existent maintenance. The "housing" currently delivered, its nature and continued sustainability are being severely criticized. Few differences exist between the housing currently being delivered and those provided under the previous government. Houses are provided in areas on affordable land normally far from the work place. The type of housing being constructed consists mostly of the single storey, <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> <b>units</b> on separate erven. These types of developments encourage urban sprawl, require very expensive engineering services and discourage the establishment of an economic public transport system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to analyze the performance of <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> air-cooled condensing <b>unit</b> in a confined space under hot and humid environment. The performance is measured based on the on coil temperature, which determines the capability of air cooled condenser to operate under limited air circulation as this will affect the final outcome of performance of the evaporator unit (cooling coil). The work was initially carried out based on a single condenser unit and using the validated computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model to investigate a multi-storey building. From the result, the size ofa confined space of 2 m X 3. 3 m X 1 m for 6 storey building with 4 meters protruding wall is sufficient to maintain the on-coil temperature within 10 °C against the ambient temperature of 33. 5 °C. The outcome of the research {{can be used as}} a guide for designing a space for condenser to be installed outside the building...|$|R

40|$|Background High quality {{evidence}} on the cost-effectiveness of planned birth in alternative settings (at home, in a midwifery unit or an obstetric unit) has been lacking, and is a priority area for maternity policy. Aim To provide evidence about {{the efficiency of the}} configuration of maternity care in England and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative settings for intrapartum care for ‘low risk’ women, thereby providing guidance for commissioners, clinicians and for pregnant women and their families. Methods A literature review of existing evidence was followed by four stand-alone empirical studies using different methods to determine the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of alternative settings for intrapartum care. Data from the Birthplace in England Programme of Research were analysed to explore whether there are differences in the efficiency of maternity units when they are stratified according to the type and scale of unit. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to estimate the short-term cost-effectiveness of different planned settings for birth for ‘low risk’ women and to develop a template for the design of decision-analytic models to estimate life-long cost-effectiveness for the mother and baby dyad. Findings The larger obstetric units (OUs) tended to be more efficient than the smaller OUs. Less than half of free-standing midwifery units (FMUs) were operating at full efficiency. The cost of intrapartum and after birth care, and associated related complications, was less for births planned at home, in a <b>free</b> <b>standing</b> midwifery <b>unit</b> (FMU), or in an alongside midwifery unit (AMU) compared with planned births in an obstetric unit (OU). Planned birth in a FMU or in an AMU compared with an OU will generate incremental cost savings but with uncertainty surrounding the outcomes for the baby. Planned birth in all non-OU settings generated incremental cost savings and improved outcomes for mothers. For ‘low risk’ women having a second or subsequent birth, planned birth at home was found to be the most cost-effective option. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
