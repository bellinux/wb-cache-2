40|$|In {{the frame}} of the European TOPPS project (Train the Operator to prevent Pollution from Point Sources), 200 on farm audits and 300 tele {{interviews}} were performed in the Yser catchment area. The objective was to determine the critical points for point source pollution within the spraying process and to inform advisors, intermediaries and farmers on practical measures and achievable solutions to reduce the contamination of the surface water by Plant Protection Products (PPP) due to point source pollution. For the on <b>farm</b> <b>auditing,</b> the Aquasite tool (Arvalis-France) was used. This audit was performed on 100 farms in the Flemish Yser catchment and on 100 farms at the French side. This audit reveals the weak points in infrastructure and technology on the farm in relation to the spraying process. Next, 150 tele interviews were held in the respective catchment areas. These interviews assess the awareness and behaviour of the farmers on point source pollution. The strength of these studies is in giving a view on the real situation on the farms with respect to spraying. The critical points and risks for point source pollution were similar for both regions. Especially the filling and mixing of the sprayer, internal and external cleaning of the sprayer and the management of the waste fraction need specific training, demonstration and advice. However, there is a large difference in the risk perception of point source pollution between farmers {{on both sides of the}} border. The transgressing approach of the Yser catchment allows to make a comparison between both regions and allows to assess in which way the legislation had part in explaining the differences between the regions as the agriculture in both regions is similar. Also, the results stress the importance of trainings and sensibilisation at a regional scale. status: publishe...|$|E

Increasing demands for cost-effectiveness in <b>farm</b> <b>audits</b> {{can be met}} by introducing risk-based principles. This implies targeting subpopulations with {{a higher risk of}} poor process standards. To select <b>farms</b> for an <b>audit</b> that present higher risks, a statistical analysis was conducted to test the relationship between the outcome of <b>farm</b> <b>audits</b> and bulk milk laboratory results before the audit. The analysis comprised 28, 358 <b>farm</b> <b>audits</b> and all conducted laboratory tests of bulk milk samples 12 mo before the audit. The overall outcome of each <b>farm</b> <b>audit</b> was classified as approved or rejected. Laboratory results included somatic cell count (SCC), total bacterial count (TBC), antimicrobial drug residues (ADR), level of butyric acid spores (BAB), freezing point depression (FPD), level of free fatty acids (FFA), and cleanliness of the milk (CLN). The bulk milk laboratory results were significantly related to audit outcomes. Rejected audits are likely to occur on dairy farms with higher mean levels of SCC, TBC, ADR, and BAB. Moreover, in a multivariable model, maxima for TBC, SCC, and FPD as well as standard deviations for TBC and FPD are risk factors for negative audit outcomes. The efficiency curve of a risk-based selection approach, {{on the basis of the}} derived regression results, dominated the current random selection approach. To capture 25, 50, or 75 % of the population with poor process standards (i. e., audit outcome of rejected), respectively, only 8, 20, or 47 % of the population had to be sampled based on a risk-based selection approach.

40|$|Over recent years, {{economic}} development, policy changes, {{new technologies}} and population growth have been motivating farmers in Thailand to intensify and commercialize their production activities. As part of this agricultural commercialization and intensification process, Thai upland farmers have adapted their farming practices to increase crop production and productivity levels. This thesis clearly demonstrates {{that there is a}} positive relationship between land use intensification/commercialization and the use of chemical-based pest management activities, i. e. farmers have increasingly relied on the use of chemicals for the protection of their crops. As part of the agricultural intensification and commercialization process, concerns about the potentially negative impact of pesticide use is often downplayed, while the benefits of pesticide use in terms of improved crop returns ignore the indirect costs they also incur. This has also led to a situation in which local farmers do not always use pesticides in an appropriate way; they tend to overuse and misuse the chemicals, to avoid losses among their high-value crops. Due to farmers limited awareness of and lack of protection against the potential dangers inherent in chemical pesticide use, they still use pesticides which contain cheap compounds such as the herbicides Paraquat and Glyphosate. The application of these chemicals is restricted {{in a number of other}} countries, but these represent two of the three most commonly used pesticides in the study area. The survey described here sought to provide evidence that agricultural commercialization in Thailand over recent years has led to a reduction in the variety of pest management practices applied, and that many Thai farmers have become completely dependent on the use of agrochemicals, expecting that this approach will fully prevent any losses in crop yields. In this context, it can be observed that farmers have become locked into using chemical pest control methods, creating a situation in which attempting to control one risk through the increasingly heavy and exclusive use of pesticides, has led to a number of other, new risks developing. This research also reveals that market prices, pests and diseases have become the dominant risks affecting farm performance within the Thai commercial farm sector, while among Thai subsistence farmers the loss of family labor is of key concern. The farmers in the study area have a variety of attitudes towards risk, and differences in expected rates of return influence the types of risk protection tools used. The findings show that agricultural commercialization is associated with a rapid adoption of synthetic pesticides and an exponential growth in the quantity of pesticides applied per hectare. As the risk management strategies used by commercial farmers are mostly aimed at crop protection, they use large quantities of synthetic pesticides to manage crop pests and diseases. The present research also finds that the effectiveness of pesticide use increases significantly as levels of commercialization increase. Pesticide use is perceived as increasingly useful in this process, being considered an essential factor for raising agricultural output and farm income. However, there is a need to pay more attention to the potentially adverse effects of pesticide use on human health and the environment and to improve producers level of understanding of the risks involved in pesticide use, which will help them make better decisions regarding the risks and consequences involved. A number of studies have suggested that pesticide regulations in Thailand should be better enforced, that consumer demand for certified products should be encouraged, and that training on food safety should be offered to farmers. The Thai government has reacted to these calls by introducing policies and projects aimed at the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices; however, these policies have not been promoted effectively, and so have not fixed the core problem. The Q-GAP program is a good example of this. This thesis reveals that Thai upland farmers still do not understand the logic behind the program introduced, and so lack any motivation to follow sustainable farming practices. This situation is made worse by the lack of any effective program implementation and follow-up activities, such as <b>farm</b> <b>auditing.</b> The Q-GAP program has been implemented with a strong focus on <b>farm</b> <b>auditing</b> and residue testing, and little focus on the positive consequences of a reduction in pesticide use levels. The program also does not provide farmers with suitable alternatives to manage their pest problems. Certified farmers continue to almost entirely depend on synthetic pest control. In principle, under the program farmers are encouraged to practice integrated pest management (IPM) methods in order to achieve Q-GAP certification. But it was found that a considerable number of farmers were not familiar with the term IPM and have a limited understanding of the approach. IPM offers alternative pest management methods to farmers and also takes into account traditional pest control methods, not just the use of pesticides. Therefore it could have a positive role to play in helping to reduce pesticide use. However, in reality, the promotion of integrated pest management methods is not enough in isolation. As this thesis shows by means of an ex-ante assessment of pesticide use reduction strategies with the MPMAS simulation package, the use of a combination of measures, such as the promotion of IPM through financial adoption incentives combined with the introduction of a sizeable sales tax on pesticides, could lead to a very substantial reduction in pesticide use  by up to 34 % on current levels, without adversely effecting general farm income levels. Thus, policymakers should promote alternative pesticide use reduction strategies by combining pesticide taxation with the introduction of integrated pest management methods, the application of a price premium on safe agricultural produce or the introduction of subsidies for bio-pesticides. Furthermore, there is a need to raise farmers awareness about pesticide risks and to increase investment in the diffusion of integrated pest management practices. Thai upland farmers might be willing to introduce more sustainable agricultural methods if they were to fully understand the consequences of pesticide use on their health and the environment, as well as know more about the biology, behaviors and physiology of the pests themselves. Building knowledge is critical in this regard. To achieve this, there needs to be more interaction between researchers, extension workers and farmers, plus more policy options introduced to support farmers in their transition to a more market-oriented production environment. Wirtschaftliche Entwicklung, politischer Wandel, die Verfügbarkeit neuer Technologien und ein rasantes Bevölkerungswachstum haben zur Intensivierung und Kommerzialisierung der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion in Thailand beigetragen. Als Teil dieses Prozesses haben die thailändischen Bergbauern ihre Anbaupraktiken angepasst um Produktion und Produktivität zu steigern. Diese Forschungsarbeit zeigt eindeutig, dass ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen der Intensivierung der Landnutzung und dem Einsatz chemisch ausgerichteter Schädlingsbekämpfungsmaßnahmen besteht. Kleinbauern in Thailand verlassen sich in zunehmendem Masse auf synthetische Pflanzenschutzmittel. Im Verlauf der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung und Kommerzialisierung werden Bedenken über die negativen Auswirkungen des hohen Pestizideinsatzes oftmals heruntergespielt, während bei der Bewertung des Nutzens für Ernteerträge die externen Kosten vernachlässigt werden. Mitunter auf Grund dieser Situation verwenden die Bauern vor Ort Pestizide auf unangemessene Weise. Übernutzung und fälschlicher Gebrauch sind weit verbreitet um Ernteausfälle bei Kulturpflanzen von hohem Produktionswert zu vermeiden. Die Bergbauern, welche die Pestizide regelmäßig einsetzen, steigern stetig die ausgebrachten Mengen. Auf Grund des begrenzten Bewusstseins gegenüber und trotz des Mangels an Schutz vor den potenziellen Gefahren der Pestizidnutzung, kommen billige toxische Präparate, wie Paraquat und Glyphosat, häufig zum Einsatz. Wohingegen die Anwendung dieser Chemikalien in anderen Ländern reglementiert und beschränkt ist, gehören Sie im Untersuchungsgebiet zu den meist verwendeten Pestiziden. Die für diese Arbeit durchgeführte Umfrage weist nach, dass die Kommerzialisierung der Landwirtschaft in Thailand in den vergangenen Jahren die Vielfalt der verwendeten Schädlingsbekämpfungsmaßnahmen verringert hat und dass viele Bauern in Thailand sich ausschließlich auf den Einsatz von Agrochemikalien verlassen. Dies geschieht in der Erwartung dadurch Ernteausfälle vollständig vermeiden zu können. In diesem Zusammenhang, ist ein sogenannter Lock-In-Effekt zu beobachten. Dabei entsteht eine Situation, in der die eigentliche Kontrolle von Risiken durch verstärkten und heftigen Pestizideinsatz eine Reihe anderer Risiken mit sich bringt. Durch diese Forschungsarbeit tritt zutage, dass in der kommerziellen Landwirtschaft in Nordthailand neben Marktpreisen, Schädlinge und Pflanzenkrankheiten zu den bestimmenden Risikofaktoren für die Leistungsfähigkeit kleinbäuerlicher Betriebe gehören. Für Subsistenzbauern spielt das Risiko Arbeitskräfte zu verlieren eine Schlüsselrolle. Die Bauern, die Teil dieser Untersuchung sind, weisen eine Vielzahl an Einstellungen und Schutzmechanismen gegenüber Risiken auf. Diese werden vom zu erwarteten jeweiligen Betriebsergebnis beeinflusst. Anhand der Untersuchungsergebnisse wird ersichtlich, dass die Kommerzialisierung der Landwirtschaft mit einer rasanten Übernahme synthetischer Spritzmittel und einem exponentiellen Anstieg der pro Hektar ausgebrachten Pestizidmengen einhergeht. Da Strategien des Risikomanagements der kommerziell orientierten Betriebe hauptsächlich zur Vorsorge gegen Pflanzenschäden dienen, werden dort große Mengen von Spritzmitteln eingesetzt. Die vorliegende Forschungsarbeit stellt fest, dass die Wirkung des Pestizideinsatzes sich erhöht mit dem Grad an Kommerzialisierung. Im Verlauf der Kommerzialisierung werden Spritzmittel von den befragten Bauern als zunehmend nützlich und als unentbehrlicher Faktor für steigende Erträge und Einkommen betrachtet. Es ist jedoch von Nöten, dass auch Gesundheits- und Umweltaspekte vermehrt berücksichtigt werden. Das Verständnis der Produzenten bezüglich der Risiken, welche die Nutzung von Pestiziden mit sich bringt, kann dabei helfen die mit der Nutzung verbundenen Risiken und Konsequenzen auf ausgewogenere Weise zu betrachten. Etliche Studien legen nahe, dass Vorschriften zu Pestiziden in Thailand besser durchgesetzt, die Verbrauchernachfrage nach zertifizierten Erzeugnissen gestärkt und Schulungen für Bauern zu Lebensmittelsicherheit und Handhabung von Pestiziden angeboten werden sollten. Die thailändische Regierung hat auf diese Forderungen mit der Einführung politischer Maßnahmen und mit gezielten Projekten zur Förderung nachhaltiger Anbaupraktiken reagiert. Diese wurden jedoch nicht mit Nachdruck vorangetrieben und konnten bisher das Kernproblem nicht beheben. Der von der Regierung eingeführte Q-GAP Standard ist ein Beleg dafür. Diese Dissertation offenbart, dass den Bergbauern in Nordthailand die Logik der Vielzahl an Programmen oftmals schwer verständlich ist. Dies wird durch die mangelnde Effektivität der Umsetzung und des Monitorings, wie z. B. der Betriebsprüfung, verschlimmert. Der Q-GAP Standard wurde mit einem Schwerpunkt auf Betriebsprüfung und Rückstandsanalyse ins Leben gerufen, wobei die betriebliche Reduzierung des Spritzmitteleinsatzes und die damit verbundenen positiven Effekte zu wenig Bedeutung erhalten. Der Standard bietet den Landwirten keine geeigneten Alternativen zur Schädlingsbekämpfung an. Zertifizierte Betriebe verlassen sich nach wie vor fast ausschließlich auf synthetische Pflanzenschutzmittel. Im Prinzip werden Bauern dazu ermutigt für die Erlangung der Zertifizierung integrierten Pflanzenschutz (IPM) zu praktizieren. Aus der vorliegenden Untersuchung wurde jedoch ersichtlich, dass der Begriff IPM und der damit verbundene Ansatz zur Schädlingsbekämpfung vielen mit dem Standard versehenen Bauern unbekannt ist. Unter Berücksichtigung traditioneller und anderer Pflanzenschutzmethoden bietet IPM den Bauern eine Vielzahl an Schädlingsbekämpfungsalternativen zur ausschließlichen Pestizidnutzung und könnte somit zur Reduzierung des Spritzmitteleinsatzes beitragen. Die Verfügbarkeit von IPM für kleinbäuerliche Betriebe allein ist allerdings nicht ausreichend. Im Rahmen dieser Forschungsarbeit wurde mit dem Agenten-basierten Simulationsmodell MPMAS eine Evaluierung verschiedener Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien durchgeführt. Diese zeigt, inwiefern es möglich ist durch ein Maßnahmenbündel aus Einführung von IPM Praktiken, Pestizidsteuer, gestaffelt nach Toxizität, und finanziellen Anreizen zur Übernahme von IPM das Niveau des Spritzmitteleinsatzes in der Landwirtschaft in Nordthailand erheblich zu senken. Gemäß den Simulationsergebnissen kann eine Reduktion von bis zu 34 % erreicht werden, ohne dass dadurch das allgemeine Einkommensniveau der Agenten negativ beeinträchtigt wird. Entscheidungsträger sollten eine nachhaltigere Landwirtschaft durch ein Bündel aus Reduktionsmaßnahmen fördern. Zudem besteht die Notwendigkeit das Bewusstsein der Bauern bezüglich der Risiken des verstärkten Pestizideinsatzes zu schärfen und Investitionen in die Verbreitung von integrierten Schädlingsbekämpfungsmethoden zu erhöhen. Es gilt das Wissen der Bauern über die gesundheitlichen und ökologischen Konsequenzen des übermäßigen Pestizideinsatzes auszubauen, ebenso wie deren Wissen über die Biologie und das Verhalten von Schädlingen. Um dies zu erreichen, muss, neben den richtigen Impulsen aus der Politik, welchen einen Übergang zur einer nachhaltigen marktorientierten Landwirtschaft erlauben, das Zusammenspiel von Forschung, landwirtschaftlicher Beratung und kleinbäuerlichen Betrieben erleichtert werden...|$|E

A linear mixed model with the method of restricted maximum likelihood was conducted to study whether the total bacterial counts (TBC) of bulk milk were lower during the periods before and after the dairy <b>farm</b> <b>audit.</b> Results showed that TBC values were 2 to 6 % lower (i. e., 0. 010 to 0. 026 log cfu/mL) for a period from 1. 5 to at least 6 mo after an audit.

The TBC values increased with a higher level of attention points. Furthermore, the farms rejected based on the audit results had the highest average TBC values and the approved farms had the lowest values.

It was concluded that the possible risks of spread of animal diseases among farms due to the removal of carcasses mainly {{has to do with}} the entrance of the place from where the carcasses are collected by the driver of the truck, the contact of the grab of the haulier with the cadaver container or place and driving with the haulier which is not fully closed. The true size of the risk of spread of disease is unknown and is probably different for each pathogen. Strict hygiene measurements by the driver and farmer can reduce the risk of spread of animal diseases due to cadaver removal. According to the interviewees at the expert assessment session, the odour nuisance at the rendering plant due to carcasses is mainly caused by bacterial conversion of proteins. Cooling of carcasses contribute to the slowing down of the conversions. No unambigious answer could be obtained as to the cooling temperature: not lower than - 7 °C because of the processing at the rendering plant and preferably not higher than 5 °C. Frequent removal of carcasses from the farms and a quick handling at the rendering plant may also reduce odour nuisance at the rendering plant.

Small family farm operation is part of the Island's way of life. However, the dairy industry in North America is undergoing significant structural change. Statistics show a significant decline in the small dairy farms industry, while the number of large operations has been increasing. Advantages for large operations include purchasing energy in large quantities with better price margins and the inherent economy of scale created by such breaks. One strategy for small-scale farms to become competitive is to reduce their energy-related operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This can be achieved through taking energy efficiency steps, reducing overall energy consumption and generating energy through renewable energy resources and technologies.

This PIM is transformed to specific models, like an XML model, a Java interface model and a DDL model for databases. Transformations to other languages are possible and a transformation to an OWL model is under development. The objective is to keep the specification of agricultural objects independent of the technology used for implementation. Care is taken that content of other models like ISO 11783 - 10, AgroXML, Edaplos, Inspire and most recently ADAPT, is mappable to drmAgro. The result is a public available platform independent reference model which is and will be in continuous development. It is set up with a generic package and branch specific packages like crop production, greenhouse production and animal husbandry. Crop production covers a wide range of use cases like planning and reporting of fieldwork, providing advice, soil sampling and analyses, application of crop growth models, scheduling of <b>farm</b> operations, <b>auditing,</b> etc. This reference model is the basis for standardised SOAP/XML messages exchanged between farm management systems and advisors, processors and the government in the Netherlands. It is also the basis for REST/XML data exchange through the FIspace platform developed as an EU project. As mentioned above, there are different models intended as basis for standardised data exchange and many more proprietary interfaces defined. With globalisation of services in agriculture the need for one common basis will grow, while technology will continue to change. This requires a basis with clear semantics which is technology, platform, and independent. rmAgro has proven to be a solid basis for implementation of standardised data exchange through SOAP webservices in the Netherlands, and REST based message exchange in the FIspace project...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores economic {{impacts of}} food related illness on agricultural industries and models {{the performance of}} food safety programs on supply chain participants. Three stand-alone studies are dedicated to economic analysis on food safety issues from different approaches analytically, empirically, and in simulation. In response to recent outbreaks of food-borne illness, the fresh produce and fruit industries have adopted marketing agreements to ensure the consistency of food safety. Chapter 2 presents a theoretical framework and simulation analysis to illustrate farmers 2 ̆ 7 behavior on implementing Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs), and the design of monitoring strategies in setting marketing agreements. It reveals that, if the monitoring resources are not high enough to achieve full compliance on GAPs, the general rule is to allocate resources so that {{the total amount of}} decreased fraud in terms of safety effort is the same for all <b>farms.</b> When <b>auditing</b> resources are very low, the size effect is dominant and larger farms are inspected first; when auditing resources are large enough, the cost effect is dominant and smaller farms are inspected first. The optimal auditing probability for smaller farms increases faster than that for larger farms. Contracts now are widely used between processors and growers to specify product quality and safety attributes. Chapter 3 employs a multitask principal-agent model to analyze the optimal incentive structure in contract food production. It offers guidance on understanding contractual relations for both food quality and food safety, and how the inclusion of a traceability system influences the provisions of the contract. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Asia, Europe, and Africa have caused severe impacts on the broiler sector through production loss, trade restrictions and negative demand shocks. Chapter 4 presents a multimarket econometric model to conduct simulation analyses on the spread and market implications of a potential HPAI outbreak in U. S. broiler industry. It takes into account market power that might exist within the livestock and meat sectors and makes endogenous the optimal production conditions in the model system. Findings from the analysis imply that the HPAI shocks impact prices at different marketing levels unequally and change the price margin along the supply chain with the existence of market power. However, the change in the price margin is quite small in absolute value...|$|R

First, {{the introduction of}} a dynamic electricity pricing system, with peak and off-peak prices, will be a reality for 80 % of electricity consumers by 2020. The proposed pricing schedule intends to discourage energy consumption during peak periods (i. e., when electricity demand on the national grid is high) and to incentivize energy consumption during off-peak periods. If farmers, for example, carry out their evening milking during the peak period, energy costs may increase, which would affect farm profitability. Second, {{electricity consumption}} is identified in contributing to about 25 % of energy use along the life cycle of pasture-based milk. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to document electricity use per kilogram of milk sold and to identify strategies that reduce its overall use while maximizing its use in off-peak periods (currently from 0000 to 0900 h). We assessed, therefore, average daily and seasonal trends in electricity consumption on 22 Irish dairy <b>farms,</b> through detailed <b>auditing</b> of electricity-consuming processes. To determine the potential of identified strategies to save energy, we also assessed total energy use of Irish milk, which is the sum of the direct (i. e., energy use on farm) and indirect energy use (i. e., energy needed to produce farm inputs). On average, a total of 31. 73 MJ was required to produce 1 kg of milk solids, of which 20 % was direct and 80 % was indirect energy use. Electricity accounted for 60 % of the direct energy use, and mainly resulted from milk cooling (31 %), water heating (23 %), and milking (20 %). Analysis of trends in electricity consumption revealed that 62 % of daily electricity was used at peak periods. Electricity use on Irish dairy farms, therefore, is substantial and centered around milk harvesting. To improve the competitiveness of milk production in a dynamic electricity pricing environment, therefore, management changes and technologies are required that decouple energy use during milking processes from peak periods...|$|R

In grazed grasslands, {{the heterogeneity of}} urine patches distribution needs adapted sampling scheme in order to evaluate N-NO 3 - leaching risks. In such context, {{the aim of this}} paper is to define the accuracy that could be expected from the sampling scheme applied in this agro-ecosystem (one average sample including 30 core samples taken in the 0 - 30 cm soil layer) and the sampling scheme to be applied in order to reach a pre-defined level of standard error. The data bases mobilized were mainly 78 grasslands sampled in 2004 or in 2005 in 24 dairy farms and 8 grasslands sampled during four years (2004 to 2007) in the experimental site in Gembloux. Our results underlined the significant increase of the standard deviation with the concentration mean. So, the mean explained 63 and 49 % of the standard deviation increase observed, respectively, in 2004 and 2005. In such context, the sampling scheme applied in the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program (one composite sample of 30 core samples taken in the 0 - 30 cm soil layer) allowed to reach a precision of 10 kg N-NO 3 -. ha- 1 in 35 % of the grazed grasslands sampled. To shift to three composite samples per hectare allows reaching such an accuracy in 90 % of the parcels showing an average nitrite nitrogen content lower than 20 kg N-NO 3 -. ha- 1. For highest values, the samples number necessary to reach such a precision level increases quickly. In such context and in order to identify false positive parcels in <b>audited</b> <b>farms,</b> an important tolerance margin is defined around the threshold value. This value is defined yearly in farms integrating good practices in terms of nitrogen resources management. The use of alternatives indicators to evaluate N-NO 3 -. ha- 1 leaching risk is also evaluated...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, $ 5. 2 {{billion was}} spent on program {{management}} and supporting contractors in energy efficiency in the United States[1]. Funding for energy efficiency {{is expected to increase}} as the cost of power production rises. This report focuses primarily on energy efficiency available to dairy farms, located in the Northern Mid-West region of the United States. Dairy farms have seen sharp increases in feed prices, large fluctuations in milk prices, and a steady rise in electricity rates. Of these three, it is easiest for the farmer to lower energy consumption. Riverside Energy will enable farmers to realize maximum potential energy and cost savings by offering custom dairy energy audits. Riverside Energy is proposing to startup as a sole proprietorship energy efficiency company, focusing on the agricultural and industrial markets of Michigan, which was ranked most improved in energy efficiency in a recent study [2]. The primary revenue stream will be providing energy <b>audits</b> to dairy <b>farms,</b> which will help them to lower energy consumption, saving substantial money. The final deliverable from Riverside to the customer will be a detailed Dairy Audit Report, detailing the best ways to save energy, and the expected upgrade costs, dollar savings and payback (return on investment) for proposed upgrades. As the demand for energy increases, there is more and more pressure for electrical utilities to build new power plants. But it is more cost effective for utilities to pay energy consuming customers to use less energy than to build new power plants. This promotes the sale of energy efficient equipment and energy audits. For dairies, there are cash incentives to pay for a portion of auditing services, and for dairy equipment upgrades. This in turn promotes Riverside’s auditing revenue stream. The biggest challenge for Riverside will be to compete against established auditors in the Michigan area, which is a fragmented group of university programs, state programs, small companies, and electric utilities. Riverside hopes to differentiate by establishing itself as both agriculturally knowledgeable and highly skilled in detailed analysis. Five primary marketing strategies have been established, which include selling direct to farmers, presenting at trade shows, enrolling in the Michigan <b>Farm</b> Energy <b>Audit</b> Program, participating in utility incentive programs, and creating partnerships with dairy equipment vendors. The most promising will likely be dairy equipment vendor partnerships, because they have the highest amount of contact with dairies, strong generational relationships, and sell the efficient equipment that riverside will propose for upgrades. It is estimated that each audit will sell for between $ 1, 000 to $ 2, 000 dollars, and that there are a potential of 1, 900 dairies available for audits in the region. Riverside hopes to capture up to 67 audits per year, which would yield $ 120, 000 in sales per year, taking 4 years to ramp up to this sales level. Pro forma income statements predict a break even after 23 months, with estimated startup costs at $ 26, 700. Funding for this startup will be comprised of owner investment and a small bank loan. Riverside believes it has found a niche in the energy efficiency market through dairy energy audits. Though prospects are promising, further details on additional revenue streams and development of key relationships should be pursued before launch. Riverside could be ready for launch in 6 months to a year...|$|R
40|$|Water quality {{impairment}} {{is becoming}} an increasing problem in Canterbury, and throughout New Zealand. In North Canterbury, the Hurunui River {{has been associated with}} elevated nutrient levels. Not only are elevated nutrient levels a threat to the environmental and cultural values of the area, they also threaten the economic and social aspirations of the community. The community has aspirations to intensify land use in the catchment by increasing the area of irrigated land. To manage nutrient levels in the catchment and to ensure the goals of the community are realised the Hurunui and Waiau Regional Plan sets forth a requirement that an audited self-management (ASM) approach be applied in the region, which is identified in the Canterbury Water Management Strategy as a key tool for the management of water quality. This study investigates the application of an ASM approach in the Hurunui River catchment and by the use of semi-structured interviews seeks to identify the ASM features and institutional arrangements key stakeholders in the catchment are willing to support. The majority of the key features of an ASM approach are supported in the catchment including governance arrangements, <b>farm</b> environment plans, <b>audits,</b> enforcement mechanisms and effective communication measures. There were areas of divergence in the stakeholders’ opinions however, with differences relating to who administers the enforcement programme, and the public reporting of audit results. The institutional arrangements supported by the interview participants in the application of an ASM approach are compared to the design features outlined by Elinor Ostrom (1990). The majority of the institutional arrangements supported by stakeholders align with Ostrom’s features including: the freedom of resource users to make their own day-to-day choices; the desire for monitoring; the increasing severity of sanctions on those non-complying resource users; the need for conflict-resolution mechanisms; and that management collectives should retain the freedom to frame their own rules. An area which does not align with these design features was the hesitation of some organisation representatives to allow land users to have direct input into the rules governing the application of an ASM approach. The research identifies obstacles to the effective application of ASM. Specifically the issues of scientific uncertainty, the promotion of economic over environmental values, and the feeling of lack of involvement felt by some stakeholders, are identified as significant obstacles. To overcome these issues solutions are offered including further water quality monitoring, the promotion of further stakeholder interaction and the continuation of discussions to find an equitable solution to nutrient allocation concerns. Finally, the research presents several recommendations for the consideration of those undertaking the implementation of an ASM approach in the Hurunui River catchment and elsewhere, these include agreement upon the final boundaries for management groups, further investigation into management group governance and data management systems, ensuring audits are undertaken by fully trained and accredited auditors, ensuring that audit results are reported in a manner than generates corrective action, and providing opportunities for land users to frame the rules for an ASM approach...|$|R
40|$|The pig {{production}} in walloon region exists in different forms. The conventional production exists {{side by side}} with some productions of “differentiated qualities” that are encouraged as much by the European Union as by the Walloon Region. At the same time, the EU and the Walloon Region are imposing environmental limitations concerning the management of nitrogen, the respect to the residents… Differentiated quality and the respect of the environment seem to be linked implicitly, but no demonstration of this exists for the {{pig production}}. The object of the present survey was to compare the nitrogen balances, the atmospheric emissions and the distance of odour diffusion for the conventional production, organic production and the production "fermier". This is taking into account the real process performances of the farms, existing legislation, the opinion of a jury of experts on the relative importance of the atmospheric emissions of pig production and the political objectives of the Region they are situated in. This survey is based on 21 farms, which are organised into three categories. These <b>farms</b> have been <b>audited</b> with the software “Ecoferme”. The nitrogen fluxes and the nitrogen balance within these exploitations were simulated. The atmospheric emissions and the distance of odour diffusion were estimated as well. A jury of 16 experts was formed, which was composed of four poles: a scientific pole, a pole of public proxies and administrations, a pole of producers and a pole of the third party (citizens, neighbours, …). This jury was questioned according to a Delphi method (individually and repetitively) to assign a relative importance to the emissions of ammonia, greenhouse gases, molecular nitrogen and odour. The most important weighting was assigned to the odour diffusion, the emission of ammonia came next, then the emissions of greenhouse gas and finally the emission of molecular nitrogen got a weak weighting. Some criteria have been constructed to characterize the performances of the farms, which take into account of the spreading of organic nitrogen and the commitment taken by the Region to follow the protocols of Kyoto and Gothenburg. The comparison of the process performances was achieved by means of the method of multicriteria analysis Electre III, which was applied to the global averages. The relative ordering obtained was: organic production, production “fermier” and conventional production. However within every sample an important variability of the performances was observed. The same method applied within every sample enables the creation of subgroups, working according to the same specifications but with weak, middle and good performances. The application of the ordering method to the nine subgroups shows that the most effective exploitations of every system of production are classified as top of the class. Thus, on average, the production of differentiated qualities are more environmentally effective than the conventional production but the variability of the performances within a system of production is important and it is quite possible for the conventional exploitations to reach some results comparable to those of the best organic and “fermier” exploitations...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the outcome}} of a study to map the economic structure and organisation of two selected mango export chains from South Africa by applying selected supply chain analysis tools. The study is part of an inventory on the export of fresh fruit and vegetables commissioned by the European Commission under the Veg-i-Trade Project Work Package 1. The two selected chains were the Bavaria fresh mango and the Blue Skies freshly cut mango export supply chains. The study sought to understand how food safety and quality standards are shaping the structure and relationships in the two export chains given the prevalence of food scares and scandals. An inventory of the activities and the various actors along the mango export supply chains was made in order to identify the structure and functioning of the chains and the issues and constraints faced with the various quality and safety standards. The objective {{of the study was to}} identify the actors and the role they play, determine the governance structure and relationships and identify the quality management programmes and standards employed in the two selected export chains. In addition, the study sought to identify and analyse the different information exchange categories and use of information between the different links along the chains. A qualitative research approach that incorporates case study methodology was used as the inquiry strategy. Through this methodology, the investigation untangled the complexity of the mango export supply chains which is faced with the challenge of maintaining a chain that guarantees adherence to customer specifications and client needs. The study’s findings established that food safety and quality management standards are shaping the structure and organisation of the chains and their stringency has increased with a widened and deepened scope. In addition, the ability to adopt a standard is directly affected by the scale of business operation and standards are technical barriers to entry for small scale mango producers and exporters mainly because of the high certification and operational costs. In reaction to the standards, it was noted that Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are buyer-driven with a high degree of vertical coordination enforced by contracts. The two chains are modular with the use of and strategic positioning of category managers; a high degree of asset specificity and forward integration to reach their markets resulting in a shortened supply chain. Supply chain coordination is carried out on contracted logistics and cold chain services with regulatory functions provided by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the Perishable Product Export Control Board (PPECB) in South Africa and agricultural and health inspectors in the United Kingdom (UK). There is also product and process differentiation. It was also noted that compulsory certification of quality and food safety standards is the prerequisite to access export markets. The standards used in the Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and Global Good Agricultural Practice (Global GAP). These are used in conjunction with the British Retail Consortium (BRC), Fairtrade, Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI), International Food Standard (IFS) and Linking Environment And <b>Farming</b> (LEAF). Quality <b>audits</b> and inspections are carried out at each supply chain level to ensure safety and adherence to quality requirements. The supply chain actors carry out continuous quality assessment and one way to achieve this was through the application of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. Quality and safety standards have also resulted in improved traceability in the Bavaria and Blue Skies Mango export chains. Traceability systems in the Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are more automated though they are not harmonised, thus Paltrack, XsenseTM, Caretrace and TempTrip. Automated information systems used to share and exchange information are internet and email as well as barcodes which are used with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Manual information systems in use are mainly telephones, facsimile and mobile phones. It was also established that major issues and challenges in the Bavaria and Blue Skies mango export chains are a result of factors that affect mango perishability, mainly post harvest handling procedures thus packaging, transportation, storage, ripening and distribution. If not managed well, poor safety and quality management result in economic losses due to product rejections, product recall and cessation of buyer-supplier relationships.
