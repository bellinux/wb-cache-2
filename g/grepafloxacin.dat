5000|$|The {{preparation}} of quinolones bearing a substituent at position 5 {{is complicated by}} the greater electrophilic character of the 8 position. One scheme for resolving the problem consists in blocking access to position 8 by first adding a readily removable group to that center.The scheme starts with the conversion of the carboxylic acid in (1) to its dimethyloxazoline derivative (3) by reaction with the dimethyl ethanolamine (2). Lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) then removes a proton from the 8 position; treatment of that anion with trimethylsilyl iodide leads to the silylated intermediate (4). A second round of LDA then generates a carbanion at the only open position; reaction with methyl iodide leads to the corresponding 5 methyl derivative (5). Treatment of that product with cesium fluoride breaks the carbon-silicon bond, removing the silyl group; aqueous acid then hydrolyzes the oxazoline to afford the free acid (6). This last intermediate is then taken on to the quinolone (9) [...] by essentially the same scheme as that used to prepare difloxacin, with the difference that the chain elongation is by means of Grignard reagent of Ethyl bromoacetate. Treatment of (9) with 2-methylpiperazine proceeds by reaction at the less hindered of the two amino groups; saponification then affords <b>grepafloxacin</b> (10).|$|E

40|$|Human {{intestinal}} epithelial Caco- 2 cells, T 84 cells, and MDCKII cells transfected {{with human}} MDR 1, {{were used to}} investigate the mechanistic basis of transintestinal fluoroquinolone secretion. The fluoroquinolone <b>grepafloxacin</b> was secreted across Caco- 2 monolayers by a saturable process (Vmax= 16. 9 ± 3. 4 [*]nmol. cm− 2. h− 1). Net secretion was reduced by 2 -deoxyglucose/azide treatment to reduce intracellular ATP. <b>Grepafloxacin</b> inhibited [14 C]-ciprofloxacin (100 [*]μM) secretion across Caco- 2 monolayers (K 0. 5 = 0. 8 [*]mM), and concurrently increased the cellular accumulation of ciprofloxacin from the basal medium, indicating inhibition of export across the apical membrane. The unconjugated bile acid, cholic acid, was secreted across Caco- 2 monolayers, and this secretion was sensitive to inhibition by the MRP-selective inhibitor MK- 571, suggesting MRP 2 involvement. Secretion of cholic acid (10 [*]μM) across the apical membrane was also inhibited by <b>grepafloxacin</b> (K 0. 5 = 0. 3 [*]mM), but not by ciprofloxacin. In MDCKII-MDR 1 monolayers, net secretion of <b>grepafloxacin</b> was increased by 3. 5 fold compared with untransfected controls. Neither ciprofloxacin nor cholic acid showed net secretion in either MDCKII or MDCKII-MDR 1 monolayers, showing that in contrast to <b>grepafloxacin,</b> neither are substrates for MDR 1.

In intestinal tissue from SDRs mounted in Ussing chambers, the level of transport in the direction from the serosal layer to the mucosal layer was twofold greater than that in the direction from the mucosal layer to the serosal layer. This secretory transport of <b>grepafloxacin</b> was diminished by both probenecid, an MRP 2 inhibitor, and cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor. In intestinal tissue from EHBRs, the secretory transport of <b>grepafloxacin</b> was lower than that in intestinal tissue from SDRs and was inhibited by cyclosporine but not by probenecid. The absorption of <b>grepafloxacin</b> from intestinal loops in SDRs was {{in the order of}} duodenum > jejunum > ileum and was increased by cyclosporine but not by probenecid.

METHODS: Women aged 18 years or older attending 17 sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States who had clinical signs of mucopurulent cervicitis or who had a recent positive culture or nonculture test for Chlamydia trachomatis or who had contact with a male partner with a positive culture for C. trachomatis were enrolled into this randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical study. The diagnosis of chlamydial cervicitis was based on culture for C. trachomatis. Patients were randomized to receive a 7 -day course of treatment with either oral <b>grepafloxacin,</b> 400 mg once daily, or oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily. Response to therapy was assessed 3 - 8 days and 21 - 28 days after completion of treatment. The primary measure of efficacy was eradication of C. trachomatis at the 21 - 28 day follow-up visit. Clinical success, defined as improvement or complete resolution of the {{signs and symptoms of}} cervicitis, was a secondary measure of efficacy. RESULTS: Of the 451 female patients enrolled, 228 received <b>grepafloxacin</b> and 223 received doxycycline. In all, 154 / 451 (35 %) patients were evaluable at the 21 - 28 day follow-up (81 who received <b>grepafloxacin</b> and 73 who received doxycycline). Microbiologic and clinical success rates demonstrated the equivalence of the two treatments. The C. trachomatis eradication rates were 96. 3 % (78 / 81) and 98. 6 % (72 / 73) for patients receiving <b>grepafloxacin</b> or doxycycline, respectively.

40|$|In an open, randomized, six-period {{crossover}} study, the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin {{were compared}} after a single oral dose in 12 healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women). The volunteers received 250 mg of ciprofloxacin, 400 mg of gatifloxacin, 600 mg of <b>grepafloxacin,</b> 500 mg of levofloxacin, 400 mg of moxifloxacin, and 200 mg of trovafloxacin. The concentrations {{of the six}} fluoroquinolones in serum and urine were measured by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. Blood and urine samples were collected before and at different time points up to 48 h after medication. Levofloxacin had the highest peak concentration (Cmax, in micrograms per milliliter) (6. 21 ± 1. 34), followed by moxifloxacin (4. 34 ± 1. 61) and gatifloxacin (3. 42 ± 0. 74). Elimination half-lives ranged from 12. 12 ± 3. 93 h (<b>grepafloxacin)</b> to 5. 37 ± 0. 82 h (ciprofloxacin). The total areas under the curve (AUCtot, in microgram-hours per milliliter) for levofloxacin (44. 8 ± 4. 4), moxifloxacin (39. 3 ± 5. 35), and gatifloxacin (30 ± 3. 8) {{were significantly higher than}} that for ciprofloxacin (5. 75 ± 1. 25). Calculated from a normalized dose of 200 mg, the highest Cmaxs (in micrograms per milliliter) were observed for levofloxacin (2. 48 ± 0. 53), followed by moxifloxacin (2. 17 ± 0. 81) and trovafloxacin (2. 09 ± 0. 58). The highest AUCtot (in microgram-hours per milliliter) for a 200 -mg dose were observed for moxifloxacin (19. 7 ± 2. 67) and trovafloxacin (19. 5 ± 3. 1); the lowest was observed for ciprofloxacin (4. 6 ± 1. 0). No serious adverse event was observed during the study period.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of ciprofloxacin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae is low but steadily increasing, {{which raises concerns}} regarding the clinical impact of potential cross-resistance with newer fluoroquinolones. To investigate this problem, we utilized an in vitro pharmacodynamic model and compared the activities of gatifloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin to that of ciprofloxacin against two laboratory-derived, ciprofloxacin-resistant derivatives of S. pneumoniae (strains R 919 and R 921). Ciprofloxacin resistance in these strains involved the activity of a multidrug efflux pump and possibly, for R 919, a mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution in GyrA. Gatifloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin achieved 99. 9 % killing of both R 919 and R 921 in ≤ 28 h. With respect to levofloxacin, significant regrowth of both mutants was observed at 48 h (P < 0. 05). For gatifloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin, regrowth was minimal at 48 h, with each maintaining 99. 9 % killing against both mutants. No killing of either R 919 or R 921 was observed with exposure to ciprofloxacin. During model experiments, resistance to gatifloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin did not develop but the MICs of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin increased 1 to 2 dilutions for both R 919 and R 921. Although specific area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC 0 – 24) /MIC and maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) /MIC ratios have not been defined for the fluoroquinolones with respect to gram-positive organisms, our study revealed that significant regrowth and/or resistance was associated with AUC 0 – 24 /MIC ratios of ≤ 31. 7 and Cmax/MIC ratios of ≤ 3. 1. It is evident that the newer fluoroquinolones tested possess improved activity against S. pneumoniae, including strains for which ciprofloxacin MICs were elevated...|$|E
40|$|Fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants were {{selected}} from Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 8532 (F 77), and two GrlA mutants of F 77 (F 193 and F 194) with moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin and trovafloxacin. For mutants selected from F 77, moxifloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin</b> and sparfloxacin selected preferentially for mutations in gyrA (Glu- 88 →Lys). Ofloxacin and trovafloxacin selected most commonly for mutations in grlA, conferring substitu-tions for Ser- 80. Three mutants of F 77 were shown to have substitutions in both GrlA (Phe- 80) and GyrA (Lys- 88). Of the mutants selected from F 193 (GrlA Phe- 80), {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analysis of gyrA showed that 76 / 94 had a mutation at codon 84; those analysed in detail all had the substitution Ser→Leu. Two mutants selected with <b>grepafloxacin</b> contained the substitution Lys- 88. One mutant selected with trovafloxacin contained a novel mutation in gyrA substituting Gly- 82 →Cys. Of the mutants selected from F 194 (GrlA Tyr- 80), 6 / 8 had a mutation in gyrA codon 84; of which three contained Leu. The MICs of most agents for mutants selected from F 193 and F 194 were similar, irrespective of the mutation selected. No mutants had any changes in grlB, and only one had a mutation in gyrB giving rise to the novel substitution Asp- 437 →His.

CP 99, 219 yielded a MIC for 50 % of the strains tested (MIC 50) of 0. 25 micrograms/ml and a MIC 90 of 1. 0 microgram/ml, with 99. 6 % of the strains susceptible at a breakpoint of 2. 0 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin and <b>grepafloxacin</b> were less active (MIC 50, 4. 0 micrograms/ml; MIC 90, 32. 0 micrograms/ml and 2. 0 and 16. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively). Metronidazole was active against all gram-negative rods (MIC 90, 4. 0 micrograms/ml), but 31 % of the gram-positive anaerobes were resistant at > 8. 0 micrograms/ml.

40|$|Several new {{quinolones}} that exhibit enhanced {{in vitro}} activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae have been developed. Using a dynamic in vitro model, we generated time-kill data for ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, <b>grepafloxacin,</b> levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin against three isolates of quinolone-susceptible S. pneumoniae. Three pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated {{for each of}} the study agents (0. 1, 1, and 10 times the area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]). Target 24 -h AUCs were based upon human pharmacokinetic data resulting from the maximal daily doses of each agent. Ciprofloxacin was the least active agent against all three isolates. With regimens that simulated the human 24 -h AUC, ciprofloxacin resulted in an initial, modest decline in the numbers of CFU per milliliter; however, by 48 h the numbers of CFU per milliliter returned to or exceeded the starting inoculum. At the AUC, levofloxacin resulted in variable bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against the isolates. The remaining agents yielded bactericidal (99. 9 % reduction) activity by 48 h with regimens that simulated the AUC. At 0. 1 time the AUC ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin produced no inhibitory effect, <b>grepafloxacin</b> exhibited bacteriostatic activity, trovafloxacin had mixed static and cidal activities, and clinafloxacin and moxifloxacin caused significant reductions in the numbers of CFU per milliliter by 48 h. All six agents produced cidal activity at 10 times the AUC. In this dynamic in vitro model of infection, the quinolones demonstrated various degrees of activity against S. pneumoniae. The rank order of activity, with respect to bactericidal effect, was ciprofloxacin (least active) ≪ levofloxacin <b>grepafloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, and trovafloxacin > levofloxacin > clinafloxacin...|$|E
