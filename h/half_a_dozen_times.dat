5|$|The emperor penguin's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish {{are usually the}} most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes {{up the bulk of}} the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the glacial squid (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot sympagic fish like the bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up {{to the bottom of the}} ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> before surfacing to breathe.|$|E

500|$|After {{the initial}} excitement, audiences quickly diminished. Operagoers were nonplussed {{by the absence}} of big {{traditional}} arias and choruses. A contemporary critic summed it up: [...] "'Is this our Verdi?' they asked themselves. 'But where is the motive; where are the broad melodies... where are the usual ensembles; the finales?'" [...] By the time of Verdi's death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the international repertoire. The rising young conductor Arturo Toscanini was a strong advocate of the work, and did much to save it from neglect. As musical director of La Scala (from 1898) and the Metropolitan Opera (from 1908), he programmed Falstaff from the start of his tenure. Richard Aldrich, music critic of The New York Times, wrote that Toscanini's revival [...] "ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season. Falstaff, which was first produced here on Feb.4. 1895, has not been given since the following season, and was heard in these two seasons only <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> in all." [...] Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work, [...] "to connoisseurs it was an unending delight".|$|E

2500|$|A common {{story is}} that while an instructor, Caldwell disciplined Mannock for [...] "showboating" [...] in a DH2—and then chose the talented pilot for his squadron.

Caldwell also criticised Mannock for shooting two German airmen who had crash landed behind Allied lines. He wrote: [...] "The Hun crashed but not badly, and most people would have been content with this—but not Mick Mannock. He dived <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> at the machine, spraying bullets at the pilot and observer, who were still showing signs of life...On being questioned as to his wild behaviour after we had landed, he heatedly replied, 'The swines are better dead—no prisoners for me!'".|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{a railway}} line once ran through Potsdamer Platz itself.

There were gods and gods, and Jerry was not long in learning that {{in the hierarchy of}} the heaven of these white-gods on the Ariel, the sailorizing, ship-working ones were far beneath the captain and his two white-and-gold-clad officers. These, in turn, were less than Harley Kennan and Villa Kennan; for them, it came quickly to him, Harley Kennan commanded. Nevertheless, there was one thing he did not learn and was destined never to learn, namely, the supreme god over all on the Ariel. Although he never tried to know, being unable to think to such a distance, he never came to know whether it was Harley Kennan who commanded Villa, or Villa Kennan who commanded Harley. In a way, without vexing himself with the problem, he accepted their over-lordship of the world as dual. Neither out-ranked the other. They seemed to rule co-equal, while all others bowed before them.|$|R

Who can say what might happen if I were to fling that cupboard door open in presence of my wife? I smoke less than I used to do; for if I were to buy my cigars by the box I could not get them smuggled into the house.

So I get <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> at <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Perhaps you will sympathize with me when I say that I have had to abandon my favorite brand. I cannot get Villar y Villars that look like Celebros, and my wife is quicker in those matters than she used to be. One day, for instance, she noticed that the cigars in my case had not the gold ribbon round them, and I almost fancied she became suspicious. I explained that the ribbon was perhaps a little ostentatious; but she said it was an intimation of nutty flavor: and now I take ribbons off the Celebros and put them on the other cigars. The boxes in which the Celebros arrive have a picturesque design on the lid and a good deal of lace frilling round the edge, and she likes to have a box lying about. The top layer of that box is cigars in gold ribbons, placed there by myself, and underneath are the Celebros. I never get down to the Celebros.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} of the series, Ikkou is able to release a powerful but uncontrollable power when confronted with intense lust. He is 16 years old. Each time, {{in the aftermath of}} his [...] "awakening," [...] he will bear a face of lust, and will [...] "attack" [...] Chitose or the other nuns, who respond by running from him and attacking him. In some episodes he is struck by the other characters more than <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>times</b> before the midway point of an episode (for instance, in episode one he was hit 21 times in the first five minutes.) Sometimes he brings it on himself, and sometimes he's the victim of misunderstanding. His character is, essentially, the center of slapstick. Ikkou seems not to enjoy his life at the temple (at least {{at the beginning of the}} series) and often complains that he is missing out on his youth. He seems not to have chosen the monastic life and resents the work given to him. He is also the least educated on Buddhist doctrine of all the characters in the show, excluding (possibly) those who are part of the laity. Indeed, he does not seem to have good grades in school nor does he seem to participate in any particular club at school, claiming that his duties at the temple prevent him from having enough time. However, while his fellow novices also have chores, they do not seem prevented from taking on school and hobbies. The head nun of Saienji (Jotoku) believes this is because he is lazy. In his defense, he does seem to be hired out for more temple errands than the other nuns, possibly because he is male and therefore stereotypically better suited to manual labor.|$|R
