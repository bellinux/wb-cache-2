5|$|The {{inclusion}} of a television in the original version would <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> many readers. The BBC had only introduced television to Britain in the late 1930s (suspended entirely until 1946) and Belgium would not have television until 1955.|$|E
5|$|She did, however, receive great {{support from}} the working class, the unions, and the Peronist Women's Party. The {{intensity}} of the support she drew from these groups is said to <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> even Juan Perón himself. Fraser and Navarro write that the wide support Evita's proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important {{to members of the}} Peronist party as Juan Perón himself was.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Sulley are {{led away}} by the CDA, and are {{expelled}} from the university {{as a result of}} their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the scare games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck, claiming they were the first students to <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> her. The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually working their way up to join the Scarer Team and setting the events of Monsters, Inc. in motion.|$|E

5|$|Tilings with {{translational}} symmetry in {{two independent}} directions {{can be categorized}} by wallpaper groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m wallpaper group and one is in p4m. Tilings in 2D with translational symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation {{can be used to}} describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.|$|E
5|$|When Tosca arrives {{looking for}} her lover, Scarpia artfully arouses her jealous {{instincts}} by implying {{a relationship between the}} painter and the Marchesa Attavanti. He draws Tosca's attention to the fan and suggests that someone must <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> the lovers in the chapel. Tosca falls for his deceit; enraged, she rushes off to confront Cavaradossi. Scarpia orders Spoletta and his agents to follow her, assuming she will lead them to Cavaradossi and Angelotti. He privately gloats as he reveals his intentions to possess Tosca and execute Cavaradossi. A procession enters the church singing the Te Deum; exclaiming 'Tosca, you make me forget even God!', Scarpia joins the chorus in the prayer.|$|E
25|$|On the {{transfer}} deadline {{day for the}} new season, 31 August, West Ham seemed to <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> world football when speculation mounted {{that two of the}} most promising young footballers in the world would be joining on permanent move. Carlos Tevez announced on his website that he and Javier Mascherano would be joining West Ham from Brazilian club Corinthians. West Ham confirmed shortly afterwards that not only had they signed the two Argentinians, but that they had signed on permanent deals. West Ham reportedly had to beat off competition from some major European clubs to sign the two young players.|$|E

25|$|D.C. {{closed out}} {{the regular season}} in Orlando knowing {{that they would be}} hosting the play-in round match four days later so long as the Montreal Impact did not win at New England, so it {{probably}} should not <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> anyone that Coach Olsen started a line-up made of entirely of reserves and a few players returning from lengthy injury spells. Not surprisingly, Orlando City dominated the match, winning 4-2, despite United goals by Saborio and Igboananike, who notched his first goal for United, with Büscher assisting on both goals. Montreal fell to defeat to the Revolution, however, so D.C. would host the Impact in the mid-week play-in match.|$|E
25|$|Chappell, the {{grandson}} of Victor Richardson, had no doubt been weaned on tales of the Bodyline tour by his grandfather, {{one of the few}} Australian batsmen to fight it out with Larwood and his support bowlers. Forty years later, {{and it was time to}} pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage. One can only hope that the reaction of Vic Richardson – a combative, but essentially a cheerful, sporting cricketer – would <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> Chappell.|$|E
25|$|The concert made {{international}} headlines, led {{to one of}} {{only five}} Time magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician, and resulted in an album produced by George Avakian that would become the best-selling LP of Ellington's career. Much of the music on the vinyl LP was, in effect, simulated, with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under rehearsed. The band assembled {{the next day to}} re-record several of the numbers with the addition of artificial crowd noise, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year, and Ellington's collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man.|$|E

25|$|However, the first-place Mavericks were {{defeated}} {{in six games}} by the 8th-seeded Golden State Warriors, which is regarded by some {{as one of the}} biggest upsets in NBA history, while others don't consider it an upset at all. The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. Former NBA champion and All-Star legend Bill Russell stated in his NBA.com blog that he didn't consider it to be an upset, since Golden State was 3–0 vs. the Mavericks in the regular season. On the year, the Mavericks went 67–12 against the rest of the league and 0–3 against Golden State, giving credibility to Russell's belief that the Warriors' win shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> NBA fans. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson, the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks until he stepped {{down at the end of}} 2005–06, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006–07 mid-season.|$|E
500|$|In London, Edmund Kean was {{the first}} Hamlet to abandon the regal finery usually {{associated}} with the role in favour of a plain costume, and {{he is said to}} <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> his audience by playing Hamlet as serious and introspective. In stark contrast to earlier opulence, William Poel's 1881 production of the Q1 text was an early attempt at reconstructing the Elizabethan theatre's austerity; his only backdrop was a set of red curtains. Sarah Bernhardt played the prince in her popular 1899 London production. In contrast to the [...] "effeminate" [...] view of the central character that usually accompanied a female casting, she described her character as [...] "manly and resolute, but nonetheless thoughtful ... thinks before he acts, a trait indicative of great strength and great spiritual power".|$|E
500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average, {{claiming}} that while it was not bad, it was not great either. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more clever than painful. Adam Buckman of the New York Post commented on the crude language used by the characters, and found there was nothing new that could <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> him with watching the episode. Ray Richmond of The Hollywood Reporter found that despite The CW's decision not to send out screeners to critics, the pilot was [...] " [...] so horrible after all". Richmond praised the actors and writers, especially returning actor Garth, whom he found looked [...] "terrific" [...] and acted well.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, {{it seems likely that}} Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> or shocked him. Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from Haverford College, where Coates studied as an undergraduate. The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent. Coates chose to exchange The Swimming Hole for the [...] "less controversial genre scene" [...] of Eakins' The Pathetic Song—today housed in the Corcoran Gallery of Art— and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 1945, 43-year-old Josephine Ross {{was found}} dead in her {{apartment}} at 4108 North Kenmore Avenue, Chicago. She had been repeatedly stabbed, and her head was wrapped in a dress.

2500|$|The Home Office had the {{responsibility}} of dealing with any civil emergency matter which might arise, and Newsam took personal charge {{as chairman of the}} official committee on emergencies. In 1953 the storm tide of the North Sea caused severe flooding along the East coast; Newsam controlled the direction of all the resources of the government in repairing sea defences and homes, including taking charge of very large numbers of troops who provided an emergency workforce. Rab Butler wrote that he [...] "had almost literally taken charge of the country" [...] and [...] "secured achievements that would <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> Canute".|$|E
2500|$|An {{attendee}} at the 1891 fungus foray was Alfred Watkins, subsequently {{to become}} {{a president of the}} club. Watkins was a keen photographer and archaeologist. In June 1921, whilst mapping old sites near Blackwardine, Watkins noticed some surprising alignments which suggested to him a series of prehistoric trackways marked by ancient landmarks some of which were still visible. Later that year, he delivered a talk to the club on [...] "Early British Trackways" [...] and after further researches published his thesis and his findings in The Old Straight Track (1925). His book was not well received by academics, but Watkins' theory of ley lines gained followers and a resurgence of interest in the 1970s, when it acquired a mystic dimension which would <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> Watkins himself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bare and}} empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the {{hostilities}} eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which {{had much to}} do with the vigour of Northern Mannerism and later Flemish Baroque painting, and many Gothic churches were given Baroque makeovers. In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and Dutch Golden Age painting concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as genre painting, landscape art and still-lifes, with results that might sometimes <b>have</b> <b>surprised</b> the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this [...] "was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic M. H. Abrams called [...] "art as such", first began to take shape", replacing a [...] "construction model" [...] where art theory concerned itself with how the maker created his work, with a [...] "contemplation model" [...] concerned with the effect of the finished work on a [...] "lone perceiver" [...] or viewer.|$|E
