25|$|Some taxonomic {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} over Pristiurus jensenii, described from Iceland by Bjarni Sæmundsson in 1922, which {{has traditionally been}} considered the same species as G. murinus.

However, an alternate possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data may have been confounded with a species of Apristurus. The placement of G. murinus within Galeus is problematic as it does not much resemble the more typical members of the genus. On the other hand, a 2005 phylogenetic analysis by Samuel Iglésias and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, found that G. murinus forms a clade with G. melastomus, apart from the clade of G. eastmani, G. sauteri, and G. gracilis.|$|E
25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters.

Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled.

25|$|Like Packman, George Duckworth {{uses the}} scene {{headings}} in the manuscripts {{to support his}} theory about unnamed Plautine characters. There are approximately 220 characters in the 20 plays of Plautus. Thirty are unnamed in both the scene headings and the text and there are about nine characters who are named in the ancient text but not in any modern one. This means that about 18% {{of the total number}} of characters in Plautus are nameless. Most of the very important characters have names while most of the unnamed characters are of less importance. However, there are some abnormalities—the main character in Casina is not mentioned by name anywhere in the text. In other instances, Plautus will give a name to a character that only has a few words or lines. One explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names have been lost over the years; and for the most part, major characters do have names.|$|E

500|$|According to Duff Hart-Davis, the British {{mercenary}} leader Jim Johnson {{had originally}} considered buying their own aircraft, a Lockheed Constellation 749. He then flew to Teheran {{to try to}} persuade the Iranians to do an air drop. Hart-Davis further claims that success was finally achieved by an adviser to the mercenaries, the MP Neil [...] "Billy" [...] McLean, who privately (without the British government's knowledge) flew to Tel Aviv to meet Moshe Dayan, defense minister, and Meir Amit, head of Mossad. According to [...] "Haaretz" [...] newspaper, Tony Boyle contacted David Karon, the head of the Middle East department in the Tevel (Cosmos) section of the Mossad, and met with IAF commander Ezer Weizman and his officers. It was decided that the airdrops would be made. Haaretz suggested the crew of the airdrops were British; while according to Hart-Davis the crew were Israeli (including the pilot named Arieh Oz), with Tony Boyle on board as an observer. Three decades after the war, former Mossad director, Shabtai Shavit, and Ariel Sharon both said Israel had been clandestinely involved in Yemen, though both remained vague concerning the nature and scale of the involvement. The airlifts were originally codenamed [...] "Operation Gravy", but were later renamed [...] "Operation Porcupine". The IAF's largest transport plane, a Stratofreighter, was recruited for the British operation. According to Jones, what is clear however <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercenary air drops to the royalists (code-named [...] "Mango") were organized by the British using an aircraft, which were contracted privately from IAF to the British mercenary operation and were either using Israeli air bases or Israeli transport planes themselves making the drops.|$|E
500|$|Assuming {{that not}} only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of {{evolutionary}} approaches {{to the problem of}} neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious — a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds — there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a comparative study is that the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologues can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al., <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major theories for the mammalian brain [...] also appear to be valid for the avian brain. The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch, Edelman and Tononi, and Cotterill [...] seem [...] to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity. Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologues have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles seems incompatible, since a structural homologue/analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains. The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{an article}} in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style:Cockburn's claim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quotes {{should not have been}} cited to their {{original}} sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: [...] "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged...." ...to which Cockburn responded:Quoting The Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing [...] "the original" [...] as opposed to the secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where [...] "the original" [...] means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage ("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled [...] "Citations Taken from Secondary Sources." [...] Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: [...] "'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted in") is generally to be discouraged, since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed."So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals. Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the language of Chicago's guidelines, cobbling together two separate discussions. On behalf of Dershowitz, Harvard Law School dean Elena Kagan asked former Harvard president Derek Bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism; Bok exonerated Dershowitz of the charge. In an April 3, 2007 interview with the Harvard Crimson, [...] "Dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last September to DePaul faculty members lobbying against Finkelstein's tenure." ...|$|E

In this case, the point of the greatest degree of improvement, or the smallest size of the head and legs, may be said to be undefined, but this is very different from unlimited, or from indefinite, in Mr Condorcet's acceptation of the term. Though I may not be able in the present instance to mark the limit at which further improvement will stop, I can very easily mention a point at which it will not arrive.
