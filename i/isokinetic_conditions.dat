First, initial fouling rates of four proprietary crude oils clearly exhibit an isokinetic temp. {{in the middle of}} their Arrhenius plot. A plot of natural logarithms of pre-exponential factors vs. apparent activation energies is linear, confirming the validity of the isokinetic temp. and indicating the presence of the compensation effect. Second, the initial fouling rates of Maya crude oil and styrene fouling systems become velocity-independent, thereby creating another <b>isokinetic</b> <b>condition,</b> at temps. of 274 DegC and 77 DegC, resp. The compensation effect is also obsd. in the Maya crude oil and styrene systems but here the linearity in the logarithms of pre-exponential factors with apparent activation energies is due to changes in velocity instead of changes in fluid type.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Isokinetic {{withdrawal}} of solution from research crystallizers {{is a key}} factor in obtaining a representative crystal-size distribution and is critical for correct analysis of the crystallization process to accurately determine crystallization kinetic parameters such as crystal growth rates, nucleation rates, breakage rates, and agglomeration rates. Isokinetic withdrawal, in turn, depends upon the characteristics of the flow field in the crystallizer. This research numerically simulated the fluid flow field in a small-scale (experimental) cylindrical round-bottomed, continuous-flow, cooling crystallizer, which was set up for analysis of kinetic parameters in sugar production. The commercial software “CFX 5. 5. 1 ” was employed to perform the 3 dimensional simulation with the finite volume method using an unstructured mesh. The impeller used for increasing the gross velocity of the solution inside the crystallizer was modeled using a momentum source. Seven momentum source strength values were used to perform the simulation. The results showed that the momentum source strongly increased the axial flow velocity but only slightly influences the overall flow pattern, except the flow near the outlet tube. The <b>isokinetic</b> withdrawal <b>condition</b> was achieved at a momentum source strength of about 25, 000 kg/m 2 /s 2. The <b>isokinetic</b> <b>condition</b> for the nuclei crystals was best for the research MSMPR, as it would make the particle size distribution in the product stream most accurate for the analysis of the nucleation and growth rates in the crystallizer. For larger particles, the settling velocity was required fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{kinetics}} of non-isothermal crystallisation is analysed both from a theoretical and experimental point of view. The most common equations {{used to describe the}} kinetics of non-isothermal crystallisation—the Nakamura and Ozawa equations—are analysed and discussed. The Nakamura equation is re-derived without invoking the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>condition,</b> and it is shown that this equation is valid only for non-isothermal crystallisation with instantaneous nucleation. It is also shown that the Ozawa equation for pre-determined nucleation is incorrect. A Tobin-type equation for non-isothermal crystallisation with instantaneous nucleation is also derived. The experimental problems related with the recording of data for this type of crystallisation are also analysed and discussed. As a further test of the validity of the theoretical models, and as a justification for the use of isothermal crystallisation data to model non-isothermal processes, the (timedependent) real sample temperature increase in nominally isothermal experiments was quantified. The isothermal process was then treated as a truly non-isothermal one, from the (low thermal conductivity) sample’s standpoint...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} concentrations and emission rates of particulate matter (PM) from mechanically ventilated livestock buildings were evaluated {{in a laboratory}} facility and in a swine-finishing barn. Concentrations of PM were measured inside the room (room sam-pling) and at the exhaust duct (exhaust sam-pling). Concentrations at the exhaust duct were determined using high-volume traverse downstream of the exhaust fan, low-volume traverse downstream of the fan, and fixed sampling upstream and downstream of the fan. The traverse methods, which served as the reference, were conducted under isokinetic conditions; fixed sampling was done under both isokinetic and sub-isokinetic conditions. Compared to the traverse method, both room sampling and exhaust sampling under sub-isokinetic conditions overestimated PM con-centrations.

40|$|Maximal torque, {{at several}} angular velocities, was {{measured}} to construct torque–velocity relationship. This {{led to the}} calculation of an index of maximal shortening velocity (VImax) at 10 % of maximal isometric torque. Two methods were then used to calculate musculotendinous (quick-release movements) and musculoarticular (sinusoidal perturbations) stiffness. In both cases, stiffness was linearly related to torque, and the slope {{was defined as a}} stiffness index (SI) : SIMT and SIMA, respectively. Maximal torques as well as VImax (p,. 05) were lower in EW compared with EM. Furthermore, SIMT and SIMA values were higher for EW than for EM (p,. 05). These results are interpreted in terms of possible differences in the muscle mass, fiber-type distribution, and tendons. They may also have implications for daily motor behavior. THE assessment of muscle mechanical properties inelderly women (EW) and elderly men (EM) is mostly limited to an evaluation of muscle contractility. For instance, EW tend to have smaller absolute strength values than EM, i. e., lower maximal voluntary torques at the same velocity or across a range of velocities under <b>isokinetic</b> <b>conditions</b> on elbow flexors and extensors (1) as well as knee flexors and extensors (2, 3).

Isokinetic strength was captured at a speed of 60 °/s and 150 °/s for all tasks.; For none of the assessed parameters a meaningful variation in PT during test days was observed. Relative reliability (ICC =  0. 85 - 0. 96) was excellent for all tasks. Estimates of absolute reliability as Coefficient of Variation (CoV) and Standard Error of Measurement (SEM in Nm/kg lean body mass) remained stable for isometric (6. 9 % < CoV < 9. 4 %; 0. 15  < SEM <  0. 23) and isokinetic mode (60 °/s: 3. 7 % < CoV < 8. 6 %; 0. 08  < SEM <  0. 24; 150 °/s: 6. 9 % < CoV < 12. 4 %; 0. 10  < SEM <  0. 31).

40|$|For {{static and}} dynamic {{conditions}} muscle {{geometry of the}} musculus gastrocnemius medialis of the rat was compared at different muscle lengths. The dynamic conditions differed with respect to isokinetic shortening velocity (25, 50 and 75 mm/s) of the muscle-tendon complex and in constancy of force (isotonic) and velocity (isokinetic) during shortening. Muscle geometry was characterized by fibre length and angle as well as aponeurosis length and angle. At high isokinetic shortening velocities (50 and 75 mm/s) small differences in geometry were found with respect to isometric conditions: aponeurosis lengths differed maximally by - 2 %, fibre length only showed a significant increase (+ 3. 2 %) at the highest shortening velocity. The isotonic condition only yielded significant differences of fibre angle (- 4. 5 %) in comparison with isometric conditions. No significant differences of muscle geometry were found when comparing isotonic with <b>isokinetic</b> <b>conditions</b> of similar shortening velocity. The small differences of geometry between isometric and dynamic conditions are presumably due to the lower muscle force in the dynamic condition and the elastic behaviour of the aponeurosis.

An isokinetic dynamometer was used to exercise the elbow flexors under isometric, slow (60 ° s− 1) and fast (210 ° s− 1) isokinetic conditions; surface electromyography was recorded from the belly of biceps brachii and the signal was synchronised with the dynamometer to determine EMD.

This paper outlines important principles to consider in conducting field-scale wind erosion studies and proposes strategies of field data collection for use in model validation and development. Detailed discussions include consideration of field characteristics, sediment sampling, and meteorological stations. The field shape used in field-scale wind erosion research is generally a matter of preference and in many studies may not have practical significance. Maintaining a clear non-erodible boundary is necessary to accurately determine erosion fetch distance. A field length of about 300 m may be needed in many situations to approach transport capacity for saltation flux in bare agricultural fields. Field surface conditions affect the wind profile and other processes such as sediment emission, transport, and deposition and soil erodibility. Knowledge of the temporal variation in surface conditions is necessary to understand aeolian processes. Temporal soil properties that impact aeolian processes include surface roughness, dry aggregate size distribution, dry aggregate stability, and crust characteristics. Use of a portable 2 tall anemometer tower should be considered to quantify variability of friction velocity and aerodynamic roughness caused by surface conditions in field-scale studies.

Changes in jump height and throwing velocity were also investigated. Material and methods. The study involved 13 handball players from a Polish second-league team. The measurements were performed four times: at the beginning of the preparation period, at the beginning of the season, at the end of the first part of the season, and at the end of the second part of the season. Torque was measured in isokinetic and isometric conditions. Jumping ability was tested using a piezoelectric platform, and throwing velocity was measured with a speed radar gun. Results. The study found statistically significant differences between the relative torque values of the knee extensors (p < 0. 002) and flexors (p < 0. 003) of the lead leg measured in <b>isokinetic</b> <b>conditions</b> between the first three measurements and the final one.

40|$|In {{this study}} a new passive, large {{particle}} impactor (PLPI) (PM< 10) {{was developed and}} evaluated in a wind tunnel. The PLPI {{is designed to be}} isoaxial and isokinetic to enable large particles sampling without bias. The PLPI can provide representative sampling without requiring a mass flowmeter controller or pump. The PLPI is especially useful for aerosol wind tunnel studies to evaluate particle generation techniques and characterize particle concentrations and spatial uniformity at the test location. The original passive impactor, developed in 1941 by May, was designed to sample particles larger than 30 micrometer at wind speeds greater than 3. 6 m/s. The PLPI improves on this original design. Its cut-off size is reduced to 13. 5 micro-meter at a wind speed of 3. 5 m/s. The PLPI is an open-design, flow-through impactor that enables near <b>isokinetic</b> sampling <b>conditions,</b> when directed towards the wind. Numerical simulations suggest that the PLPI has a sharp collection efficiency curve. In this study, the design of PLPI will be presented. Design parameters such as S/W, W/T, and W/P, where S is jet to plate distance, T is the length of throat, W is throat diameter, and P is plate diameter, were investigated using impaction theory and computation fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Results of the PLPI calibration in a wind tunnel using the Aerosol Particle Sizer (APS, TSI) will be presented. Copyright © 2007 by the American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR).

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing sample lines) to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing sample lines to achieve <b>isokinetic</b> sampling <b>conditions</b> according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the sample lines directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem. Selected examples of other measurement results for initial experimental characterization of the inlet will be discussed. In order to achieve better isokinetic sampling, further numerical flow simulations of the final inlet design for different aircraft altitudes and speeds are required to establish a final regulation of the sample air flow in each of the four sample lines based on pressure and temperature sensors in the inlet and aircraft data...|$|R
40|$|On-line {{measurement}} of pulverized fuel (PF) distribution between primary air pipes on a {{coal-fired power plant}} is of great importance to achieve balanced fuel supply to the boiler for increased combustion efficiency and reduced pollutant emissions. An instrumentation system using multiple electrostatic sensing heads are developed and installed on 510 mm bore primary air pipes of a 600 MW coal-fired boiler for the {{measurement of}} mass flow distribution of PF. An array of electrostatic electrodes with different axial widths is housed in a sensing head. An electrode with a greater axial width and three narrower electrodes are used to derive the electrostatic signals for the determination of PF mass flow rate and velocity, respectively. The measured PF velocity {{is used for the}} calibration of coal mass flow rate. On-plant comparison trials of the developed system were conducted under typical operating <b>conditions.</b> <b>Isokinetic</b> sampling equipment is used to obtain reference data to evaluate the performance of the system. Experimental data demonstrate that the developed system is effective and reliable for the on-line continuous measurement of PF mass flow distribution between the primary air pipes of the same mill...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} 5, 10 and 20 min of cold-water (14 °C) immersion on rectal and muscle temperature and neuromuscular function. Twelve cyclists performed four cycling time-to-exhaustion trials in hot conditions (40 °C and 40 %rh), followed 25 min later by cold-water immersion for 5, 10 or 20 min or 20 min in room temperature (24 °C; control). Rectal temperature was measured continuously, and muscle temperature was measured before, immediately after and 45 min after the time-to-exhaustion-test, as well as before and after water immersion. Sixty-second maximal voluntary isometric torque and isokinetic torque of the knee extensors were measured before, immediately after and 55 min after time-to-exhaustion-test. A greater rate of decrease in rectal temperature was observed in all water immersion conditions 45 - 80 min after time-to-exhaustion-test compared with control. Compared with control, muscle temperature 45 min after time-to-exhaustion-test was lower for all water immersion conditions; however, muscle temperature was lower for the 10 - and 20 -min conditions compared with 5 min. Isometric torque measured 55 min after time-to-exhaustion-test was lower for all <b>conditions.</b> <b>Isokinetic</b> torque was lower for all conditions immediately and 55 -min post-time-to-exhaustion-test. Of the durations measured, 5 min of cold-water immersion appeared as the most appropriate duration for reducing rectal temperature but limiting decreases in muscle temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} trunk and knee strength in practitioners of hard-style martial arts. An additional objective was to examine reaction times in these participants by measuring simple reaction times (SRT), choice reaction times (CRT) and movement times (MT). Thirteen high-level martial artists and twelve sedentary participants were tested under <b>isokinetic</b> and isometric <b>conditions</b> on an <b>isokinetic</b> dynamometer. Response and movement times were also measured in response to simple and choice auditory cues. Results indicated that the martial arts group generated a greater body-weight adjusted peak torque with both legs at all speeds during isokinetic extension and flexion, and in isometric extension but not flexion. In isokinetic and isometric trunk flexion and extension, martial artists tended to have higher peak torques than controls, but they were not significantly different (p > 0. 05). During the SRT and CRT tasks the martial artists were no quicker in lifting their hand off a button in response to the stimulus [reaction time (RT) ] but were significantly faster in moving to press another button [movement time (MT) ]. In conclusion, the results reveal that training in a martial art increases the strength of both the flexors and extensors of the leg. Furthermore, they have faster movement times to auditory stimuli. These results are consistent with the physical aspects of the martial art...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purposes}} of the present research were to compare the outcome after Achilles tendon rupture repair in two postoperative regimens, to compare Achilles tendon elongation in two postoperative treatment methods, to compare the effects of two postoperative methods on motor performance aspects such as simple reaction time, choice reaction time, speed of movement, foot tapping speed and coordination, to test the mechanical properties of the recently developed poly-L/D-lactide (PLDLA) sutures and Maxon® sutures when implanted in the Achilles tendons of rabbits, and to study the histological tissue reactions and biodegradation of these sutures under the same <b>conditions.</b> <b>Isokinetic</b> calf muscle strength scores at the last control check-up were excellent in 56 % of the patients in the early motion group, good in 32 %, fair in 8 %, and poor in 4 %, whereas the scores in the cast group were excellent in 29 % of cases, good in 50 % and fair in 21 %. The ankle performance scores were excellent or good in 88 % of the patients in the early motion group, fair in 4 % and poor in 8 %, whereas the scores in the cast group were excellent or good in 92 % of cases and fair in 8 %. No significant differences were seen {{between the two groups}} at 3 months and at the last control checkups with regard to pain, stiffness, subjective calf muscle weakness, footwear restrictions, range of ankle motion, isokinetic calf muscle strength or overall outcome. The complications included 1 re-rupture in the early motion group and 1 deep infection and 2 re-ruptures in the cast group. AT elongation occurred in both groups, but was somewhat less marked in the early motion group. The AT elongation curves rose at first and then fell slowly in both groups. The patients who had less AT elongation achieved a better clinical outcome. AT elongation did not correlate significantly with age, body mass index or isokinetic peak torques. The recovery of motor performance functions such as simple reaction time, choice reaction time, speed of movement, foot tapping speed and coordination did not depend on the two postoperative regimens. The motor functions of the operated leg had obviously recovered {{to the level of the}} non-operated leg 12 weeks after the operation. Sutures made of PLDLA were used successfully for Achilles tendon repair in rabbits. There was no significant difference between the in vitro and in vivo tensile strength retention of the sutures. By comparison with Maxon®, PLDLA was found to have a lower initial tensile strength but more prolonged strength retention. The breaking strength values of the Achilles tendons repaired with sutures of these types were not significantly different at 6 weeks. Intratendinous PLDLA sutures formed a thinner fibrous capsule during the 12 -week follow-up period than did Maxon® sutures of the same diameter. The suture materials had not been totally absorbed by 12 weeks...|$|R
