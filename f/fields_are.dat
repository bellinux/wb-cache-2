5|$|Differential <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> fields {{equipped}} with a derivation, i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field. For example, the field R(X), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> central to differential Galois theory, a variant of Galois theory dealing with linear differential equations.|$|E
5|$|Finite <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> {{also used}} in coding theory and combinatorics.|$|E
5|$|Global <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> in {{the limelight}} in {{algebraic}} number theory and arithmetic geometry.|$|E
50|$|Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>is</b> a {{neighborhood}} of St. Matthews, Kentucky. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> a Sixth Class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> incorporated on May 24, 1957. Broad <b>Fields</b> <b>was</b> dissolved on July 1, 2000 and annexed by St. Matthews on January 8, 2001. The population was 250 at the 2000 census.|$|R
50|$|A new {{football}}/soccer/baseball <b>field</b> <b>was</b> inaugurated in {{the spring}} of 2006. The football <b>field</b> <b>is</b> officially known as Jackie Jensen Field, while the baseball/softball <b>field</b> <b>is</b> dedicated to Mike Marcoulis, Sr., longtime coach and teacher.|$|R
40|$|When an {{electric}} <b>field</b> <b>is</b> applied on a topological insulator, {{not only the}} electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, but also the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated, vice versa. I designed topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer magnetic cloak, derived the electric field and magnetic field {{inside and outside the}} topological insulator and superconductor sphere. Simulation and calculation results show that the applied magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> screened by the topological insulator and superconductor bi-layer, and the electric <b>field</b> <b>is</b> generated in the cloaked region...|$|R
5|$|Tamely {{ramified}} {{extensions of}} both <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> in bijection to one another.|$|E
5|$|These <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> then packed, left to right, into a 32 bit container.|$|E

50|$|The Halibut <b>Field,</b> <b>is</b> an oil <b>field,</b> {{within the}} Gippsland Basin. The oil <b>field</b> <b>is</b> located {{approximately}} 64 km offshore of southeastern Australia. The total area of this <b>field</b> <b>is</b> 26.9 km2 and {{is composed of}} 10 mappable units.|$|R
50|$|Saltpond Oil <b>Field</b> <b>is</b> an oil <b>field</b> off {{the coast}} of Ghana. The <b>field</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} in 1970 by Signal-Amoco Consortium. The <b>field</b> <b>is</b> currently managed by the Saltpond Offshore Producing Company (SOPCL), Ghana's oldest producer of crude oil.|$|R
50|$|The name is new, as the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of}} {{two former}} fields, Koushk (discovered in 2000) and Hosseinieh (discovered in 2002). After {{researchers}} discovered that the two <b>fields</b> <b>were</b> actually connected, the <b>field</b> <b>was</b> renamed as the Yadavaran Field.|$|R
5|$|Hedgerows of {{hawthorn}} and blackthorn, {{which form}} {{the boundaries between}} the <b>fields,</b> <b>are</b> the principal habitat in these cultivated areas. They support many species of wild flowers, insects and birds, including dog rose, purple foxglove and wild violet as well as wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes.|$|E
5|$|Over 990 noted {{scholars}} {{from a variety}} of academic <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> Academy graduates, including 45 Rhodes Scholars and 16 Marshall Scholars. Additional notable graduates include 1 President of the United States, 2 Nobel Prize recipients, 52 astronauts and 73 Medal of Honor recipients.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> {{ubiquitous}} {{in mathematics and}} beyond, there are several refinements of the concept which are adapted {{to the needs of}} a particular mathematical area.|$|E
50|$|A newer {{track and}} {{football}} <b>field</b> <b>were</b> created {{with the new}} school. This <b>field</b> <b>is</b> actually {{on the opposite side}} of Highway 285. Access to the <b>field</b> <b>is</b> gained by way of an old railroad bridge spanning the highway. A new baseball <b>field</b> <b>was</b> also planned, but lack of funds and a decreasing enrollment rate had placed those plans on hold. As of late 2010 a softball <b>field</b> had <b>been</b> completed, but not the baseball field.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{rules of}} the {{distribution}} of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>were</b> carried out by numerical simulation. The distribution of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>was</b> got, and the effects of current intensity and frequency on the distribution of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by constructing three-dimensional finite element model and using ANSYS software which is a kind of commercial FEM analysis software. The results show that the intensity of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> proportional to current intensity, magnetic <b>field</b> <b>is</b> mainly localized in the surface region of liquid melt and there is a notable edge effect in the corner...|$|R
50|$|Although {{baseball}} was unofficially played in Pullen Park {{for many years}} - perhaps even before the land became a park - the officially sanctioned <b>field</b> <b>was</b> not created until the unofficial <b>field</b> <b>was</b> renovated in 1920. A second <b>field</b> <b>was</b> added later.|$|R
5|$|The {{best known}} <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, algebraic number fields, and p-adic <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.|$|E
5|$|After the {{planning}} approval was granted, local residents hired barristers to consider an appeal against the decision. The activation of {{the planning}} permission allowed solicitors {{on behalf of a}} group called Residents United Residents Association (RURA) to launch its Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, which challenged the council's decision making process. One of the original areas for appeal revolved around historic covenants on parts of the land, but the Charities Commission ruled that the <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> not charitable land.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E

5|$|Faversham Town F.C. {{were formed}} in 1884 and compete in Division One South of the Isthmian League. They have a 2000-seat stadium {{to the south}} of the town and are the only team besides the England {{national}} football team to wear the 3 lions badge. The King George V playing <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> all that remain of the Mount Field, which in 1876 hosted a first-class match between Kent and Hampshire County Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Former pupils, {{known as}} Old Citizens, who have {{attained}} eminence in various <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> prime minister H. H.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 52 astronauts who are alumni of the Academy, over 990 noted scholars {{from a variety of}} academic <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> Academy graduates, including 45 Rhodes Scholars and 16 Marshall Scholars. Additional notable graduates include 1 President of the United States, 2 Nobel Prize recipients, and 73 Medal of Honor recipients.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a pseudo-finite <b>field</b> F <b>is</b> an {{infinite}} {{model of the}} first-order theory of finite <b>fields.</b> This <b>is</b> equivalent to the condition that F is quasi-finite (perfect with a unique extension of every positive degree) and pseudo algebraically closed (every absolutely irreducible variety over F has a point defined over F). Every hyperfinite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> pseudo-finite and every pseudo-finite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> quasifinite. Every non-principal ultraproduct of finite <b>fields</b> <b>is</b> pseudo-finite.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rational}} number <b>field</b> Q <b>is</b> Hilbertian, because Hilbert's irreducibility theorem has as a corollary that the projective line over Q is Hilbertian: indeed, any algebraic number <b>field</b> <b>is</b> Hilbertian, {{again by the}} Hilbert irreducibility theorem. [...] More generally a finite degree extension of a Hilbertian <b>field</b> <b>is</b> Hilbertian and any finitely generated infinite <b>field</b> <b>is</b> Hilbertian.|$|R
50|$|Nahr Umr <b>Field</b> <b>is</b> an oil <b>field,</b> located {{north of}} Basrah, Iraq. Nahr Umr <b>Field</b> <b>is</b> proven to hold 6.6 {{billion barrels of}} {{recoverable}} reserve. The oil <b>field</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1948 by the Basrah Petroleum Company, an associate of the Iraq Petroleum Company.|$|R
5|$|In astrophysical plasmas, Debye {{screening}} prevents electric fields from directly {{affecting the}} plasma over large distances, i.e., {{greater than the}} Debye length. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, magnetic fields. This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of Debye lengths. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles {{are produced by}} electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field.|$|E
5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into <b>fields</b> <b>are</b> of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
50|$|LaMoy <b>Field</b> <b>is</b> a {{multipurpose}} {{facility to}} support Post's athletic programs and Sprint football team. The <b>field</b> <b>was</b> updated to a turf field in 2011.
