5|$|Through {{a series}} of miscommunications, Edward {{believes}} that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught over her apparent suicide attempt, Edward travels to Italy and attempts to provoke the Volturi (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive {{just in time to}} stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from committing suicide. Realizing that Bella is alive, Edward explains to Bella that he always loved her and only left to protect her. However, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her premonition, in which Bella has been transformed, with Aro, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks. Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay. Later, Jacob reminds Edward, the treaty Cullens and Quileutes made years before that they will not attack each other, as long as the Cullens do not feed on any humans, a necessity for Bella's transformation. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire after she marries him.|$|E
500|$|Legislation {{to authorize}} a change was debated in the Senate on April 30, 1917; Oklahoma Senator Robert L. Owen {{represented}} {{that the change}} was needed because the coins would not stack. [...] Wyoming Senator Francis E. Warren complained that the Mint had needed legislation to adjust coin designs {{in the past and}} it would be simpler if officials would ensure that coins would stack before releasing them into circulation. [...] Nevertheless, the bill passed. [...] The matter was brought up in the House of Representatives on June 25, led by Congressman Ashbrook, who told his colleagues both that the issued design was not true to the artist's concept, and that the coins would not stack well. [...] Debate in the House focused {{on the fact that the}} legislation gave the Mint until July 1918 to effect the change as Ashbrook had stated [...] that the Mint, having prepared the new design, was only waiting for the bill to pass to commence production. [...] One congressman offered an amendment to change the date to 1917, and others spoke <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> but they desisted when they realized that making a change would require the Senate to act again. [...] The bill passed the House, and became law on July 9, 1917. [...] In August, MacNeil wrote to Joyce requesting samples of the revised coin and expressing his pleasure it was being struck according to his design.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regard to}} the second question, Miller pondered the nature of Congressional consent. Congress could not be {{expected}} to explicitly give its consent to every single aspect of the proposed state constitution, Miller argued. And clearly Congress had intensively considered the proposed state constitution (which contained provisions for accession of the two counties in question), because Congress seriously considered the slavery question regarding the admission of the new state and required changes in the proposed constitution before statehood could be granted. This debate could only lead the Court to a single conclusion, Miller stated: [...] "It is, therefore, an inference clear and satisfactory that Congress by that statute, intended to consent to the admission of the State with the contingent boundaries provided for in its constitution and in the statute of Virginia, which prayed for its admission on those terms, and that in so doing it necessarily consented to the agreement of those States on that subject. There was then a valid agreement between the two States consented to by Congress, which agreement made the accession of these counties dependent on the result of a popular vote <b>in</b> <b>favor</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> proposition." ...|$|E
