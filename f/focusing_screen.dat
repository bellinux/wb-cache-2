25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use {{interchangeable lenses}} (1) with a proprietary lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system (2) is switched down (exact 45-degree angle) to direct {{light from the}} lens over a matte <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> (5) via a condenser lens (6) and a pentaprism/pentamirror (7) to an optical viewfinder eyepiece (8). Most of the entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.|$|E
25|$|It must be observed, however, that {{in order}} to find the real {{intensity}} ratio, the diameter of the actual working aperture must be ascertained. This is easily accomplished in the case of single lenses, or for double combination lenses used with the full opening, these merely requiring the application of a pair of compasses or rule; but when double or triple-combination lenses are used, with stops inserted between the combinations, it is somewhat more troublesome; for it is obvious that in this case the diameter of the stop employed is not the measure of the actual pencil of light transmitted by the front combination. To ascertain this, focus for a distant object, remove the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> and replace it by the collodion slide, having previously inserted a piece of cardboard in place of the prepared plate. Make a small round hole in the centre of the cardboard with a piercer, and now remove to a darkened room; apply a candle close to the hole, and observe the illuminated patch visible upon the front combination; the diameter of this circle, carefully measured, is the actual working aperture of the lens in question for the particular stop employed.|$|E

50|$|Although {{promoted}} as a feature, center-weighted metering was originally {{a consequence of}} the meter cell reading from the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> of SLR cameras. Light scatter from the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> and proximity of the meter cell caused fall off at the edges.|$|E
50|$|A basic DOF adapter {{usually has}} four {{components:}} a macro lens, an optional plano-convex lens, a translucent <b>focusing</b> <b>screen,</b> {{and finally a}} photographic lens of the user's choice. On camcorders without sufficient macro capability, a macro lens, preferably an achromatic doublet (to minimize chromatic aberration), is usually attached directly to the camcorder so that the camcorder can zoom in {{and focus on the}} <b>focusing</b> <b>screen.</b> Without the macro lens, certain camcorders would be unable to zoom in well enough to frame the entire <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> and still achieve sharp focus. The optional plano-convex lens is used to avoid vignetting in the image. The <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> is where the photographic lens image is projected. The screen must be placed at precisely the correct distance from the flange focal mount of whatever lens is being used (most popularly the Canon FD or Nikon F mount), referred to as the flange back distance. Finally, the front lens is a photographic or cinema lens that projects the image desired onto the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

50|$|Static (non-moving) {{adapters}} suffer greater {{image degradation}} from low-light situations because texture on the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> becomes more noticeable. The camcorder {{used in conjunction}} with the adapter must focus on the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> inside the adapter which is used as a projection surface. As a result, the camcorder also picks up the pits, dimples and/or specks in the material that give it its translucent properties. The solution to this problem is to shake, rotate or otherwise move the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> so that the texture of the screen is blurred. In a non-static solution such as this, the texture is only a problem at very high shutter speeds, where blurring is reduced.|$|E

(Note: In the earlier F/FS mount, Konica has similar screens with matte field and a central micro-diaprism dot, except for the highly valued and rare Konica F which not only had an interchangeable pentaprism, but also had the split image focus assist feature.) ...|$|R
