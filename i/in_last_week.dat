Kumar and Nisha Biswal (two senior U.S. officials) for {{representatives of the}} Indian government during a House hearing. He assured them that, as a U.S. representative, he would support all efforts to facilitate a better relationship between America and [...] "your country" [...] and [...] "your government." [...] Clawson continued on by heaping praise upon India while addressing Biswal and Kumar, apparently unaware of his confusion.Three days later, the incident was featured <b>in</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Week</b> Tonight by John Oliver; the clip of that show went viral and has recorded 3 million views. The incident lead to a wave of criticism across print, television & social media and the blogosphere. According to USA Today, Mr. Clawson later said, “I {{made a mistake in}} speaking before being fully briefed and I apologize. [...] I’m a quick study, but in this case I shot an air ball.” He was reported to have apologized to both Biswal and Kumar. Peter Beinart contributing editor at The Atlantic termed the incident as silly gaffe that is revealing of our society where whiteness is still a proxy for being American.|$|E

Oh, never mind; some of it was his at all events; there was no harm in taking that. Most likely he should be able to restore it four-fold when Colonel Carey made his present; or, if not, nobody knew exactly what was in Toby Fillpot; and after all very likely they would forget all about it; people could not think about pigs when Mamma was ill; or, maybe, he should go to join his ship, and hear no more of it. So he came home, and crossed the paddock just as the dinner-bell was ringing, opening the hall-door as the children were running across it to the dining-room.|$|E
