5|$|A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic <b>force</b> <b>would</b> then {{attack the}} 1st Bulgarian Army between Kožuf and Lake Doiran, {{preventing}} it from forming new defensive {{positions in the}} area. The initial advance would allow the Armée d'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep, Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic <b>force</b> <b>would</b> strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass.|$|E
5|$|Chaytor's <b>Force</b> <b>would</b> then {{attack and}} pursue the Fourth Army, {{intercept}} and capture the 4,600 strong garrison from Maan and capture Amman.|$|E
5|$|Defeats in late March {{already had}} the Azeri {{military}} evacuating civilians out of the region to the northern town of Yevlakh and Azerbaijan's second largest city, Ganja. The Armenians had assembled a force of several hundred men to enter Kelbajar from four different directions: Melkonian's own detachment of tanks and troops from Karabakh would attack from the southeast, one fifty-man unit {{from the town of}} Vardenis, Armenia would enter from the west; the third <b>force</b> <b>would</b> attack from the village of Aghdaban in the north, and the primary attacking <b>force</b> <b>would</b> come from the village of Narınclar.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} weeks of May 1919, allied {{warships}} entered {{the area to}} prepare for the operation. British Admiral Somerset Gough-Calthorpe was the primary commander for the operation involving British, U.S., French, Italian, and Greek forces. On May 11, 1919, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, the Commander of US Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters), came to Izmir from Istanbul on a battleship. The British <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> occupy Karaburun and Uzunada, French <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> occupy Urla and Foça, Greek <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> occupy Yenikale fortress.|$|R
50|$|The fleet {{problems}} were usually {{once a year}} exercises in which U.S. naval <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> engage in mock battles. One {{or more of the}} <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> play the part of a European or Asian navy. They were the culmination of the Navy's annual training maneuvers.|$|R
25|$|Crown <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> {{withdraw}} {{from most of}} Ireland.|$|R
5|$|In fact, in time , {{the body}} with no <b>force</b> <b>would</b> have reached a point, W, further from P than R. However, in the limit QW becomes {{parallel}} to SP. The point W is ignored in Newton’s proof.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the project}} cancellation, the President of the United States Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower noted that raising the F-108 {{interceptor}} <b>force</b> <b>would</b> have cost the U.S. taxpayer $4 billion.|$|E
5|$|According to the storyline for Ironside, {{ten days}} {{following}} D-Day, Allied forces would {{land in the}} Bordeaux region. This <b>force</b> <b>would</b> spend around twelve days establishing a bridgehead before advancing to meet formations supposedly part of an invasion of the Mediterranean coast of France (in reality these were fictional landings as well, part of another Bodyguard deception called Operation Vendetta). The supposed target of Ironside was {{the mouth of the}} Gironde estuary, with a landing site at Royan.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer <b>force</b> <b>would</b> need to be raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E
5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing the arriving <b>force</b> <b>would</b> threaten his lines of communication, ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian <b>force</b> <b>would</b> commit itself to a fight to the death.|$|E

5|$|In the Jordan Valley, Chaytor's <b>Force</b> <b>would</b> {{hold the}} {{occupied}} {{area and the}} right flank against attack by the Ottoman Fourth Army and prevent that force from withdrawing troops, which could be sent to reinforce the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills. When the Ottoman force began its withdrawal, they were to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridge.|$|E
5|$|July 1940to October 1943: A {{total ban}} on air operations, and {{a release of}} interned German {{aircraft}} and pilots, resulting from the encirclement of Swiss territory by the Axis, {{the implementation of the}} Réduit strategy, and recognition that the Air <b>Force</b> <b>would</b> be overwhelmed by the Germans in a sustained campaign.|$|E
5|$|Mallet {{traveled}} to Stockholm on 4 April {{where he met}} with Erik Boheman, the Swedish State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. During the meeting he presented the proposals for British reconnaissance flights and for the transport collaboration. The Swedish government rejected the former but accepted the latter. However, privately Boheman indicated that Sweden's air <b>force</b> <b>would</b> not pursue Allied planes in their airspace, and also that limitations of the transport collaboration meant it would have little benefit for the British.|$|E
50|$|In 1684, French naval <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> bombard Genoa for {{its support}} of Spain.|$|R
50|$|Should {{the attack}} prove {{successful}} at pinning {{the enemy in}} place and defeating its forces in battle, mechanized <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> break the flank and surround the enemy with infantry to consolidate the success. As the defender withdrew, mechanized cavalry and motorised <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> harass, cut off, and destroy his retreating columns which would also be assaulted by powerful aviation forces.|$|R

5|$|Maxwell, who {{had limited}} {{communications}} with his division headquarters, {{was concerned that}} his <b>force</b> <b>would</b> be cut off by fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese to land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.|$|E
5|$|Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, {{and planned}} an {{invasion}} of Siam itself. By October 1548, he had assembled another 12,000-strong force that also included about 400 Portuguese mercenaries led by Diogo Soares. The invasion <b>force</b> <b>would</b> have been equipped with the conventional weapons of the day: swords, bow and arrows and spears. The more elite members would also carry matchlocks or muskets. These early modern weapons having been introduced to the two kingdoms by the Portuguese a few decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|The French 7th Army was {{assigned}} to protect the northernmost part of the Allied front. It contained the 1st Light Mechanized Division (1re DLM), the 25th Motorised Infantry Division (25e Division d'Infanterie Motorisée, or 25e DIM) and the 9th Motorised Infantry Division (9e DIM). This <b>force</b> <b>would</b> advance to Breda in the Netherlands.|$|E

5000|$|If {{allowed to}} do so, these <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} restore {{the political and economic}} rule of capitalism; in other words, these <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> lead a society down a [...] "capitalist road". The term first appeared in Communist Party of China literature in 1965, but the idea was initially developed by Mao Zedong in 1956-1957, against what he saw as reactionary tendencies in the party.|$|R

5|$|The {{plan was}} straightforward: Vandamme and Saint Cyr {{would make a}} {{simultaneous}} attack on the Austrian right, and Soult's and Jourdan's main <b>force</b> <b>would</b> attack the Austrian center and left. Jourdan's plan, to attack four points of the opposition simultaneously, seemed to {{him to be the}} only reasonable action against a force with such numerical superiority.|$|E
5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational <b>force</b> <b>would</b> exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air <b>force</b> <b>would</b> be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E

50|$|The {{capture of}} Caloocan left American forces {{in control of}} the {{southern}} terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway, along with five engines, fifty passenger coaches, and a hundred freight cars. After consolidating control of Caloocan, the obvious next objective for American <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be the Filipino's capital at Malolos. However, General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> be deployed in its defense.|$|R
5000|$|This {{new policy}} {{replaced}} the previous [...] "catch and release" [...] policy {{which had been}} in place for more than a year, whereby U.S. <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> secretly detain suspected Iranian agents, and hold them for a few days. That policy was intended to intimidate Iranian emissaries without escalating tensions with Iran. U.S. <b>forces</b> <b>would</b> take DNA samples or retina scans from the Iranians, fingerprint and photograph them before letting them go.|$|R
