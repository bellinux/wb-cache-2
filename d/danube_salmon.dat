5000|$|The huchen ( [...] ) or <b>Danube</b> <b>salmon</b> (Hucho hucho) {{is a large}} {{species of}} {{freshwater}} fish in the salmon family of order Salmoniformes. It is the type species of its genus. [...] The huchen is endemic to the Danube basin in Europe where the remaining population is threatened by overfishing and habitat loss. Beyond the Danube basin it also occurs today in the Drava and lower Gail rivers (in Carinthia), Drina, Mur (in Styria) and Pielach rivers. Along the Inn, around the 30km-long rebuilt and renaturalized area around the Bavarian town of Mühldorf, the huchen has returned in recent years. It has been introduced elsewhere on the continent and in Morocco, {{but most of these}} populations are not self-sustaining. In historic times the huchen has also been found in the Dniestr basin. Sometimes it lives in big dam reservoirs on mountain rivers such as Lake Czorsztyn in Poland.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>salmon</b> or huchen (Hucho hucho, Linnaeus, 1758) is an {{endemic species}} in the Danube basin, being almost extinct in {{particular}} because of anthropogenic activities. The huchen has a special status throughout Europe, being listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and on Annexes II and V of the EU Habitat Directive and is a protected species in Romania. Molecular methods that use nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers are recommended in order to contribute for a better management of aquaculture activities and also to improve the measures for conservation of endangered species such huchen. Our study aims to evaluate several DNA-based methods for species identification of Hucho hucho from the wild and aquaculture. We proposed two methods focused on the mitochondrial genome (DNA barcoding and PCR-RFLP), {{and one on the}} nuclear markers (genotyping). Methods that analyse the mitochondrial genome are focused on the COI gene and D-loop/Cytb regions, while those that analyse nuclear markers are focused on microsatellites. Therefore, techniques such as PCR-RFLP, sequencing and genotyping gave results that were easily interpretable and could be recommended as powerful species detection methods with applicability in aquaculture and for restocking purposes...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on changes of fish populations in the river Dyje located at the {{national}} park Podyjí. These changes are caused mostly due to presence of two large dams (Znojemská and Vranovská dam) between which w the study locality is situated. There are also other factors affecting ichtyofauna composition as piscivorous predators, non-native species or restocking of particular target species. First information about the fish populations appeared in year 1921. In that years, the locality contained species, that are not present at the river site at the moment. Examples given: sturgeon (Acipenser ruthenus) and <b>danube</b> <b>salmon</b> (Hucho hucho). These species extincions were associated with interupted fish migration between locality and Donau river basin. On the other hand, new fish pecies (that are not-native to Czech Republic and were not observed before 1921) started to appear during following years. From the former fish population of type Barbus-Chondrostoma the type changed to Salmo-Thymallus. Most of this change was caused by regular restocking of the salmonids. Since 1993 there is evidence on new presence of tolerant fish species that do not necesarilly need cold, flowing water. There is high probability, that this appearance is caused by slowing down the river stream and also the heating of the water, {{that takes place in}} the dam...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The heavily {{degraded}} {{area of the}} Ljubljanica River corridor upstream and downstream of the Ljubljana {{urban area}} is an important habitat for the fragmented and heavily endangered populations of <b>Danube</b> <b>Salmon</b> (Hucho hucho), Danube Roach (Rutilus pigus) and Striped Chub (Leuciscus souffia). Nowadays the water level upstream of the weir on the Ljubljanica River is too low therefore during low flow conditions the main Ljubljanica River channel is not connected to its tributaries. This represents a great obstacle for the habitat connectivity along the river reaches which is worsened by the improperly working fish passes. To enable fish migration along the river concrete restoration measures were performed. The reconstructions of sill and two fish passes on the Ljubljanica River have been implemented and barrier’s lifting system on the weir was modernized. During the entire project fish monitoring is being performed in different ways. It helps us to evaluate if concrete restoration actions (restoration of sill, two fish passes and a barrier) were successful and if fish migration is improved. We follow fish migration with marking the fish with Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags. Regarding the location of catch we implant tags beneath transparent or translucent tissue combining different tag locations (dorsal fin, post ocular tissue) and colours (red and yellow). The success of restoration actions is monitored {{with the use of}} on line connected cameras installed on the fish passes. Records from the camera are analysed to evaluate number and type of fish using the fish pass. The data gathered from the fish monitoring will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} fish migration along the Ljubljanica and Sava River and will help to evaluate the project success...|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian Government {{financed the}} project GCP/BIH/ 003 /NOR “Support to Income Generation through {{establishment}} of a Fish Hatchery in Bosnia and Herzegovina”, worth one million US dollars, that includes {{the construction of a}} fish hatchery {{on the banks of the}} River Krusnica in order to create jobs and incomes for people living with disability in Bosanska Krupa. The hatchery is dedicated to producing local strains of brown trout (Salmo trutta m. fario), grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and <b>Danube</b> <b>salmon</b> (Hucho hucho) for re–stocking the natural waters of the Krusnica/Una River catchments (and larger Bosnia and Herzegovina and Danube basin), support the rehabilitation of fish populations and to help revitalize local tourism. The Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia (REU) of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), based in Budapest, Hungary implements the project in close collaboration with the Sport Fishermen’s Association of Krusnica, which currently has 351 members. A fish hatchery, a pilot Recirculation Aquaculture System (RAS) in the valley of the River Krusnica, is the first of its kind in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is suitable for production of 250, 000 to 450, 000 fingerlings annually. Five war invalids are employed at the hatchery continuously since fish production began in November of 2008. The production technology learned by the staff abroad was adapted to the local conditions. The hatchery is expected to be self–sustainable in its operation from sale of fingerlings. Since the hatchery activity has received wider publicity, anglers’ interest in the River Krusnica and River Una has increased. Further increase in the number of visitors is expected after restocking the fish into the river, since the bigger fish populations will attract more and more anglers...|$|E

40|$|Zadnje stoletje je sladkovodni ekosistem najbolj podvrţen človeškim posegom zaradi izkoriščanja vodne energije. Posledica posegov je, da so številne ribje vrste postale ogroţene in zaščitene z rdečimi seznami ali izginile. Zagotavljanje prehodnosti vodotokov je nujno za prehajanje rib, za ohranjanje ogroţenih in ostalih ribjih populacij. Ribe za svoje ţivljenje potrebujejo različne habitate za drst, rast, prehranjevanje, gibanje. Vsaka neprehodna ovira na vodotokih bi morala imeti urejen naraven, sonaraven ali tehnično grajen ribji prehod. Do izliva v reko Savo ima Ljubljanica kar nekaj neprehodnih ovir, zaradi katerih se je bistveno spremenila kvaliteta habitatov za ribe in tudi za ostale vodne organizme. V okviru projekta Ljubljanica povezuje – Obnovitev koridorja Ljubljanice in izboljšanje rečnega vodnega reţima je bila obnovljena ribja steza ob Plečnikovi zapornici na Ambroţevem trgu. Namen projekta je izboljšati in povezati habitate ciljnih ogroţenih vrst rib v Ljubljanici, to so sulec, platnica in blistavec, ki so zaščiteni z uredbami in pravilniki. V diplomski nalogi je predstavljena problematika prehajanja rib oziroma nefunkcionalnost ribje steze pred obnovo. Povzela sem obnovitvene ukrepe in izboljšave na stezi ter z meritvami pretoka in hitrosti vode na vtoku in v notranjosti ribje steze ugotavljali funkcionalnost le-te. Namen projekta Ljubljanica povezuje je tudi osveščanje ljudi o nujnosti vzpostavitve prehodnosti vodotokov za ribje populacije, tako iz spoštovanja do narave kot z vidika veljavne zakonodaje, ki narekuje obnovitev vseh obstoječih ribjih stez in gradnjo novih na območjih, kjer se bo posegalo v vodotoke.
