50|$|This {{accessory}} {{combined the}} Speed Equalizer {{with a single}} channel voltage doubler. A 555 Timing chip circuit drove a voltage doubler that would give each car a speed boost, but only in one lane change direction. from the inside lane to the outside lane. This actually made racing more unfair, because each car started in either the inside or outside lane parallel to each other. On the first trigger pull off the line, the outside lane car would automatically receive a speed boost, while the inside car would not. Only when the inner lane car changed lanes to the outside lane would it receive its voltage boost.Any car changing lanes from the outside lane to the inside lane would not receive boost. I think Ideal originally designed the super booster to provide boost for any lane change left or right, but cut the design in half to save on manufacturing and dropped the 2 extra circuits needed to produce a full boost effect. Since {{it was thought that}} the inner lane was always at a disadvantage to the outside line having the boost only help the car increase speed from the inside to outside lane change was supposed to make things fair. In reality it did not and required the player to bias the speed <b>Equalizer</b> <b>bar</b> more to limit a cheater using the outside wall centrifugal force to maintain top speed and not fly off the track.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2011, ARMTV {{announced}} a competition {{for children to}} design the official logo of the contest, which was due to be presented on 1 June. However, {{in the end the}} logo was designed by a professional teams from ARMTV, the EBU and Studio of Anton Baranov from Belarus, who also designed logo of Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2010 and was presented on 15 July 2011. The logo depicts <b>equalizer</b> <b>bars</b> {{in the shape of a}} mountain, hinting a toy version of the famous Mount Ararat. The graphics were made by an Icelandic called Guðmundur Þór Kárason who previously worked with the Icelandic children's show called LazyTown.

5000|$|A whippletree, or whiffletree, is a {{mechanism}} to distribute force evenly through linkages. The mechanism may also {{be referred to as}} an <b>equalizer,</b> leader <b>bar,</b> or double tree. It consists of a bar pivoted at or near the centre, with force applied from one direction to the pivot and from the other direction to the tips. Several whippletrees may be used in series to distribute the force further, such as to simulate pressure over an area as when applying loading to test airplane wings. Whippletrees may be used either in compression or tension. Whippletrees were also used for subtraction and addition calculations in mechanical computers. Tension whippletrees are used in artful hung mobiles, as the ones the artist Alexander Calder started to build in 1932.|$|R
