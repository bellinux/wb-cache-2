50|$|Lathyrus {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the <b>Grey</b> <b>Chi</b> (Antitype chi) and the Latticed Heath (Chiasmia clathrata), both recorded on meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), and Chionodes braunella.|$|E
50|$|Sedum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} <b>Grey</b> <b>Chi.</b> In particular, Sedum spathulifolium is the host plant of the endangered San Bruno elfin butterfly of San Mateo County, California.|$|E
50|$|Convallaria majalis {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} the <b>grey</b> <b>chi.</b> Adults and larvae of the leaf beetle Lilioceris merdigera are also able to tolerate the cardenolides and thus feed on the leaves.|$|E

The larva of this moth feeds on Lychnis species, as do some other Lepidoptera {{including}} Cabbage Moth (recorded on L. chalcedonica), <b>Grey</b> <b>Chi</b> and case-bearers of the genus Coleophora including C. albella (feeds exclusively on L. flos-cuculi) and C. leucapennella.|$|E

5000|$|Sow thistles {{are common}} host plants for aphids. Gardeners may {{consider}} this a benefit or a curse; aphids may spread from sow thistle to other plants, but alternatively the sow thistle can encourage the growth of beneficial predators such as hoverflies. In this regard sow thistles make excellent sacrificial plants. Sonchus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera including Celypha rufana and the broad-barred white, <b>grey</b> <b>chi,</b> nutmeg, and shark moths [...] The fly Tephritis formosa is known to attack the capitula of this plant.|$|E
