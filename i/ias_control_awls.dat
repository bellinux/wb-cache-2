40|$|The immune {{responses}} {{to a number of}} antigens are known to be under the control of immune response (Ir) genes which are linked to the H- 2 complex (1 - 3). These Ir genes are located in a chromosomal segment between the K and S regions of the H- 2 complex and this segment of chromosome 17 is designated the I region. Crossovers within the I region have permitted its division into three subregions, designated I-A, I-B, and I-C. By cross-immunizing between selected mouse strains, several laboratories have raised antibodies against/-region-associated (Ia) antigens (2 - 5). Whether these Ia antigens actually represent the Ir-gene product is still a matter of controversy. However, it was possible to detect <b>Ia</b> antigens <b>controlled</b> by loci (Ia- 1 and Ia- 3) which map in the I-A and I-C subregions (2 - 5). Recently, on the basis of Ia antigen studies, it has been possible to subdivide the I region into two additional subregions, namely/-J (6, 7) and I-E (8), which are marked by the Ia- 4 and Ia- 5 loci. The I-J subregion has stimulated great interest as it appears that the Ia antigens coded for by this subregion are expressed on suppressor T cells (6) and concanavalin A-reactive T cells (9), whereas the <b>Ia</b> antigens <b>controlled</b> by the other subregions appear predominantly on B lymphocytes (2 - 5). Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the I-J subregion also codes for determinants on soluble factors which suppress antibody responses (7). In previously published studies the <b>Ia</b> antigens <b>controlled</b> by the/-J subregion were detected by indirect methods (6, 7).

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} method for {{coordinating}} multi-robotic/multi-agent traffic control at intersections. The robotic agents (RA) move guided by a potential field along the lanes. At the intersections an intersection agent (<b>IA)</b> <b>controls</b> the flow of traffic by assigning priorities to the agents that {{are about to enter}} the intersection. The priorities are computed based on the density of RA in a lane and the flow rate of traffic in those lanes. The RAs integrate these assigned priorities into their potential field computations. The modified potential field computations help the RAs to move through the intersection avoiding colli-sions. An elegant mixed autonomy scheme is thereby achieved where the IAs decide upon the priorities at the intersection while the low level collision avoidance maneuvers are left with the individual RAs. This scheme preserves the distributed nature and the autonomy of potential field maneuvers while simultaneously balancing the computation load between the IA and RAs. We compare this method with a method where the RAs navigate the intersection without a superior direction from the IAs through priorities or when IAs direct the RAs based on priorities computed on a first come first served basis. We show performance gain over both these methods in simulations. Index Terms—Artificial potential field, Multi agent Systems, Intelligent Transportation System. I...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe transient, A-type K+ current (<b>IA)</b> <b>controls</b> the excitability of CA 1 {{pyramidal}} neuron dendrites by regulating the back-propagation of action potentials and by shaping synaptic input. Dendritic A-type K+ channels are targeted for modulation during long-term potentiation (LTP) {{and we have}} recently shown that activity-dependent internalization of the A-type channel subunit Kv 4. 2 enhances synaptic currents. However, the effect of changes in IA {{on the ability to}} induce subsequent synaptic plasticity (metaplasticity) has not been investigated. Here, we show that altering functional Kv 4. 2 expression level leads to a rapid, bidirectional remodeling of CA 1 synapses. Neurons exhibiting enhanced IA showed a decrease in relative synaptic NR 2 B/NR 2 A subunit composition and did not exhibit LTP. Conversely, reducing IA by expression of a Kv 4. 2 dominant-negative or through genomic knockout of Kv 4. 2 led to an increased fraction of synaptic NR 2 B/NR 2 A and enhanced LTP. Bidirectional synaptic remodeling was mimicked in experiments manipulating intracellular Ca 2 + and dependent on spontaneous activation of NMDA receptors and CaMKII activity. Our data suggest that A-type K+ channels {{are an integral part of}} a synaptic complex that regulates Ca 2 + signaling through spontaneous NMDAR activation to control synaptic NMDAR expression and plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Chronic immune {{activation}} (IA) {{is considered}} as {{the driving force}} of CD 4 (+) T cell depletion and AIDS. Fundamental clues in the mechanisms that regulate IA could lie in natural hosts of SIV, such as African green monkeys (AGMs). Here we investigated the role of innate immune cells and IFN-α in the <b>control</b> of <b>IA</b> in AGMs. AGMs displayed significant NK cell activation upon SIVagm infection, which was correlated with the levels of IFN-α. Moreover, we detected cytotoxic NK cells in lymph nodes during the early acute phase of SIVagm infection. Both plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cell (pDC and mDC) homing receptors were increased, but the maturation of mDCs, in particular of CD 16 + mDCs, was more important than that of pDCs. Monitoring of 15 cytokines showed that those, which are known to be increased early in HIV- 1 /SIVmac pathogenic infections, such as IL- 15, IFN-α, MCP- 1 and CXCL 10 /IP- 10, were significantly increased in AGMs as well. In contrast, cytokines generally induced in the later stage of acute pathogenic infection, such as IL- 6, IL- 18 and TNF-α, were less or not increased, suggesting an early <b>control</b> of <b>IA.</b> We then treated AGMs daily with high doses of IFN-α from day 9 to 24 post-infection. No impact was observed on the activation or maturation profiles of mDCs, pDCs and NK cells. There was also no major difference in T cell activation or interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression profiles and no sign of disease progression. Thus, even after administration of high levels of IFN-α during acute infection, AGMs were still able to <b>control</b> <b>IA,</b> showing that <b>IA</b> <b>control</b> is independent of IFN-α levels. This suggests that the sustained ISG expression and IA in HIV/SIVmac infections involves non-IFN-α products...|$|R

METHODS: Male hamsters were divided into 3 main groups, further divided in 3 subgroups: Two months: Group <b>Ia</b> <b>control</b> (n = 51) received filtered water, Group Ib (n = 49) received 10 % fructose solution instead of water, Group Ic (n= 8) received 20 % fructose solution instead of water. Four months: Group IIa control (n= 8), Group IIb 10 % fructose (n = 7), Group IIc 20 % fructose (FIIc, n = 7). Six months: Group IIIa control (n = 6), Group IIIb 10 % Fructose (n = 6), Group IIIc 20 % Fructose (n = 5). All groups were fed with the same laboratory diet. The animals were weighed every 2 weeks during the study period. On the final day of each experiment (61 st, 121 st, and 181 st day after the beginning of the study, respectively), the animals were weighed and anesthetized for blood collection to determine plasma glucose and insulin after at least a 12 -h fast. Ten animals of group Ia and 10 of group Ib were evaluated to determine changes in macromolecular permeability induced by ischemia/reperfusion as measured in the cheek pouch microcirculation. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the animals that drank the 10 % or 20 % fructose solution had significantly greater weight gain (P <. 001), fasting plasma glucose (P <. 001) Reperfusion, after 30 min ischemia, resulted in an immediate but reversible increase in postcapillary leakage (L) of 89. 0 ± 2. 0 L/cm² (group <b>Ia</b> - <b>controls),</b> and 116. 5 ± 4. 8 L/cm² (group Ib 10 % fructose), P <. 001.

CONCLUSION: The model might facilitate the study of basic mechanisms of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia affecting the microvasculature as demonstrated by the findings regarding ischemia/reperfusion after only 2 months of treatment...|$|R

Synaptic plasticity involves short- and long-term events, although the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not fully understood. The transient A-type K+ current (<b>IA)</b> <b>controls</b> the excitability of the dendrites from CA 1 pyramidal neurons by regulating the back-propagation of action potentials and shaping synaptic input. Here, we have studied how decreases in IA affect cognitive processes and synaptic plasticity. Using wild-type mice treated with 4 -AP, an IA inhibitor, and mice lacking the DREAM protein, a transcriptional repressor and modulator of the IA, we demonstrate that impairment of IA decreases the stimulation threshold for learning and the induction of early-LTP. Hippocampal electrical recordings in both models revealed alterations in basal electrical oscillatory properties toward low-theta frequencies. In addition, we demonstrated that the facilitated learning induced by decreased IA requires the activation of NMDA receptors containing the NR 2 B subunit. Together, these findings point to a balance between the IA and the activity of NR 2 B-containing NMDA receptors in the regulation of learning. © 2011 Fontán-Lozano et al.

Methods: We assessed a cohort of participants at risk with < 36 CAG repeats of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Outcome measures were the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor, cognitive, and behavior domains, Total Functional Capacity (TFC), and quality of life (Short Form- 36 [SF- 36]). This cohort was subdivided into IA carriers (27 - 35 CAG) and controls (< 27 CAG) and younger vs older participants. <b>IA</b> carriers and <b>controls</b> were compared for sociodemographic, environmental, and outcome measures. We used regression analysis to estimate the association of age and CAG repeats on the UHDRS scores. Results: Of 12, 190 participants, 657 (5. 38 %) with < 36 CAG repeats were identified: 76 IA carriers (11. 56 %) and 581 controls (88. 44 %). After correcting for multiple comparisons, at baseline, we found no significant differences between <b>IA</b> carriers and <b>controls</b> for total UHDRS motor, SF- 36, behavioral, cognitive, or TFC scores. However, older participants with IAs had higher chorea scores compared to controls (p 0. 001).

On the other hand, 1 -year follow-up data analysis showed IA carriers had greater cognitive decline compared to controls (p 0. 002).

The main advantages from the artificial Intelligent Agents (IA) are: - Self adjustabilty {{is an integral part}} of artificial <b>IA</b> based traffic <b>control</b> unit (both long (road works) and short term (accidents) changes are covered); - The, more flexible, traffic control unit can be optimised while the unit is operating. For self-evaluating, -optimising and-adjusting UTC we need a fully pro-active, realtime traffic control system. Such an UTC system requires monitoring system of traffic, a rule- or model-base for evaluation and adjustment, a model of the surrounds and an efficient diagnostic routine for both traffic light operations as well as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|When {{tested in}} the in vitro T-cell {{proliferation}} assay, H- 2 a cells are nonresponders to lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B; L-lactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 1. 1. 27) and to IgG 2 a myeloma protein. However, the cells can be converted into responders either by the addition {{to the culture of}} monoclonal anti-Ia. m 7 antibody or by the removal from the culture of Lyt- 2 + [T-lymphocyte-associated alloantigen (Lyt) - 2 positive] lymphocytes. In both instances, the responsiveness can be suppressed again by the addition to the culture of monoclonal antibodies to I region-associated (<b>Ia)</b> molecules <b>controlled</b> by the I-A subregion. These data suggest that, in some H- 2 haplotypes, the response to LDH-B and IgG 2 a is the result of interaction between the I-A and I-E subregions. The H- 2 a haplotype carries a responder allele at the I-A subregion but the responsiveness of H- 2 a cells is normally suppressed by T cells recognizing the antigen {{in the context of the}} I-E molecules. When the recognition of I-E molecules is blocked by an antiserum or when the cells capable of this recognition are removed, the H- 2 a cells become responders. These experiments demonstrate a nonresponder turned responder by antibody inhibition. They also demonstrate that the postulate of the I-B subregion is no longer necessary and provide additional evidence that the Ia molecules are the products of the immune response (Ir) genes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dectin- 1 is {{the major}} {{receptor}} for fungal beta-glucans on myeloid cells. We investigated whether defective Dectin- 1 receptor function, because of the early stop codon polymorphism Y 238 X, enhances susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis (IA) in at-risk patients. METHODS: Association of Dectin- 1 Y 238 X polymorphism with occurrence and clinical course of IA was evaluated in 71 patients who developed IA post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and in another 21 non-HSCT patients with <b>IA.</b> The <b>control</b> group consisted of 108 patients who underwent HSCT. Functional studies were performed to investigate consequences of the Y 238 X Dectin- 1 polymorphism. RESULTS: The Y 238 X allele frequency was higher in non-HSCT patients with IA (19. 0 % vs 6. 9 %- 7. 7 %; P <. 05). Heterozygosity for Y 238 X polymorphism in HSCT recipients showed a trend toward IA susceptibility (odds ratio, 1. 79; 95 % CI,. 77 - 4. 19; P =. 17) but did not influence clinical course of IA. Functional assays revealed that although {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} with defective Dectin- 1 function due to Y 238 X responded less efficiently to Aspergillus, corresponding macrophages showed adequate response to Aspergillus. CONCLUSIONS: Dectin- 1 Y 238 X heterozygosity has a limited influence on susceptibility to IA and may be important in susceptible non-HSCT patients. This is partly attributable to redundancy inherent in the innate immune system. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, the {{algorithm}} convergence is mainly affected by <b>IA</b> and power <b>control</b> in this research. The linear IA [23] {{is used in}} this paper which only requires a few calculation steps for precoding and decoding and cannot lead to serious signaling overhead. In order to satisfy the feasibility of linear IA, the number of antennas and users should be implemented appropriately. The iteration method is not our concern which has few differences with the linear method except for IA precoding and decoding. In terms of power control, the powers are iteratively modified by ΔP for the CUE target SINR. The solution will converge more quickly if ΔP is bigger, but the system will be unstable. We employ an abandon mechanism to guarantee convergence. If the number of iterations in an RB {{is more than a}} critical value, the corresponding communications are abandoned and reallocated. This mechanism can also prevent the system from signaling overhead.|$|R
40|$|A {{solid-phase}} radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) {{to measure}} antibody responses to Aspergil-lus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus antigens in invasive aspergillosis (lA) was devel-oped and compared with immunodiffusion (lD) and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). SPRIA detected 'significant elevations {{in levels of}} aspergillus antibody in 15 (790 / 0) of 19 patients with IA. Fewer patients with IA were positive by ID (five of 19) or CIE (four of 19). Only seven (8 %) of 58 subjects with other fungal or bacterial infec-tions were positive by SPRIA, as was one (5 %) of 20 by ID and CIE. Weak cross-reac-tivity between aspergillus and candida antigens was demonstrated by SPRIA. IgG levels in patients with <b>IA</b> and <b>control</b> subjects were equivalent. Thus, an antibody response to Aspergillus can be detected in {{a greater percentage of}} patients with IA by SPRIA than by ID or CIE. Although a few patients without aspergillosis had elevated levels of asper-gillus antibody, a rise in antibody level was specific for IA. Invasive aspergillosis is a significant cause of death in compromised hosts [1, 2]. Diagnosis is rarely made before death because clinical and radiographic manifestations are nonspecific and sputum cultures are usually negative. Serologic tests are of uncertain value in the diagnosis of this disease. Immunodiffusion (lD) is the most widely used method for measurement of antibody in all types of aspergillosis. Most patients with aspergil-lorna (90070 - 97070) and bronchopulmonary asper-gillosis (63070 - 70070) and a varying percentage of patients with invasive aspergillosis (0 - 88070) are positive by this test [3 - 19]. Other methods for measuring antibody, such as immunoelectro...|$|R
40|$|Individual genetic {{admixture}} estimates (IA) from European Americans (EAs) {{were computed}} in 7, 996 {{members of the}} Gila River Indian Community (Arizona). Parental populations for the analysis were European Americans and full-heritage Pima Indians. A logistic regression was performed on 7, 796 persons, to assess association of IA with type 2 diabetes. The odds ratio, comparing diabetes risk in full-heritage EAs with full-heritage Pima Indians, was 0. 329 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 225 – 0. 482). Proportional-hazards analysis was performed on 5, 482 persons who were nondiabetic at their first examination and 1, 215 subjects who developed diabetes during the study. The hazard risk ratio for IA was 0. 455 (95 % CI 0. 301 – 0. 688). Nondiabetic persons had significantly more European IA. In nondiabetic Pimans, multivariate linear regressions of quantitative predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus, including fasting plasma glucose, 2 -h post-load plasma glucose, and body-mass index, showed significant inverse relations with <b>IA</b> when <b>controlled</b> for sex and age. These results illustrate the ongoing evolution of populations by the mechanism of gene flow {{and its effect on}} disease risk in the groups with admixture. When the two parental populations differ in disease prevalence, higher or lower risk is associated with admixture, depending on the origin of the admixed alleles and the relative magnitude of the disease prevalence in the parental populations. These data also illustrate the strong genetic components in type 2 diabetes and are consistent with one susceptibility locus common to obesity and diabetes...|$|R
