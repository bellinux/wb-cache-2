5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units {{before they can be}} used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as <b>glycoside</b> hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides.|$|E

5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic <b>glycoside</b> as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale {{deconstruction of}} biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic {{approaches to the}} analysis of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as <b>glycoside</b> hydrolases. Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} apples contain {{small amounts of}} amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide {{compound}} known as a cyanogenic <b>glycoside.</b> Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E

30|$|Due the {{potential}} usefulness of phenylazonaphtol <b>glycosides</b> in processes mentioned above, {{we developed a}} methodology for preparing phenylazonaphtol <b>glycosides</b> under weak acidic conditions and the resulting azoic <b>glycosides</b> evaluated as β-galactosidase substrates with potential application as prodrugs for colon diseases.|$|R
25|$|It is {{now known}} that betalains are {{aromatic}} indole derivatives synthesized from tyrosine. They are not related chemically to the anthocyanins and are not even flavonoids. Each betalain is a <b>glycoside,</b> and consists of a sugar and a colored portion. Their synthesis is promoted by light.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{classified}} as a cyanogenic <b>glycoside</b> because each amygdalin molecule includes a nitrile group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion {{by the action of}} a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them. Neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a vitamin.|$|E
25|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, sucrose is {{broken down into}} its {{constituent}} monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, by sucrase or isomaltase <b>glycoside</b> hydrolases, which {{are located in the}} membrane of the microvilli lining the duodenum. The resulting glucose and fructose molecules are then rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. In bacteria and some animals, sucrose is digested by the enzyme invertase.|$|E

40|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} {{belonging to}} echinoderm are traditionally used as tonic food in China and other Asian countries. They produce abundant biologically active triterpene <b>glycosides.</b> More than 300 triterpene <b>glycosides</b> have been isolated and characterized from various species of sea cucumbers, which {{are classified as}} holostane and nonholostane depending on {{the presence or absence}} of a specific structural unit γ(18, 20) -lactone in the aglycone. Triterpene <b>glycosides</b> contain a carbohydrate chain up to six monosaccharide units mainly consisting of d-xylose, 3 -O-methy-d-xylose, d-glucose, 3 -O-methyl-d-glucose, and d-quinovose. Cytotoxicity is the common biological property of triterpene <b>glycosides</b> isolated from sea cucumbers. Besides cytotoxicity, triterpene <b>glycosides</b> also exhibit antifungal, antiviral and hemolytic activities. This review updates and summarizes our understanding on diverse chemical structures of triterpene <b>glycosides</b> from various species of sea cucumbers and their important biological activities. Mechanisms of action and structural–activity relationships (SARs) of sea cucumber <b>glycosides</b> are also discussed briefly...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glycosides</b> are of {{commercial}} interest for industry {{in general and}} specifically for the pharmaceutical and food industry. Currently chemical preparation of <b>glycosides</b> will not meet EC food regulations, and therefore chemical preparation of <b>glycosides</b> is not applicable in the food industry. Thus, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are a good alternative. However, until now the low yields obtained by enzymatic methods prevent the production of <b>glycosides</b> on a commercial scale. Therefore, high yields should be established {{by a combination of}} optimum reaction conditions and continuous removal of the product. Unfortunately, a bioreactor for the commercial scale production of <b>glycosides</b> is not available. The aim {{of this article is to}} discuss the literature with respect to enzymatic production of <b>glycosides</b> and the design of an industrially viable bioreactor system...|$|R
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include breast {{enlargement}} with other side effects generally {{due to an}} excessive dose. These side effects may include loss of appetite, nausea, trouble seeing, confusion, and an irregular heartbeat. Greater care is required in older people and those with poor kidney function. It is unclear whether use during pregnancy is safe. Digoxin is in the cardiac <b>glycoside</b> family of medications.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the diversity of 3D structures observed for <b>glycoside</b> hydrolases, glycosyltransferase have a much smaller range of structures. In fact, according to the Structural Classification of Proteins database, only three different folds have been observed for glycosyltransferases Very recently, a new glycosyltransferase fold was identified for the glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the NAG-NAM polymer backbone of peptidoglycan.|$|E
25|$|Lactase (also {{known as}} lactase-phlorizin {{hydrolase}}, or LPH), {{a part of}} the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a <b>glycoside</b> hydrolase involved in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers.

25|$|Iris {{rhizomes}} {{also contain}} notable amounts of terpenes, and organic acids such as ascorbic acid, myristic acid, tridecylenic acid and undecylenic acid. Iris rhizomes can be toxic. Larger blue flag (I. versicolor) {{and other species}} often grown in gardens and widely hybridized contain elevated amounts of the toxic <b>glycoside</b> iridin. These rhizomes can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or skin irritation, but poisonings are not normally fatal. Irises should only be used medicinally under professional guidance.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} {{glycosyl}} transfer {{can be a}} carbohydrate, <b>glycoside,</b> oligosaccharide, or a polysaccharide. Some glycosyltransferases catalyse transfer to inorganic phosphate or water. Glycosyl transfer can also occur to protein residues, usually to tyrosine, serine, or threonine to give O-linked glycoproteins, or to asparagine to give N-linked glycoproteins. Mannosyl groups may be transferred to tryptophan to generate C-mannosyl tryptophan, which is relatively abundant in eukaryotes. Transferases may also use lipids as an acceptor, forming glycolipids, and even use lipid-linked sugar phosphate donors, such as dolichol phosphates.|$|E
25|$|Digoxin {{elimination}} {{is mainly}} by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, {{which leads to}} significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs. Examples commonly used in patients with heart problems include spironolactone, verapamil and amiodarone. In patients with decreased kidney function the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd, calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different <b>glycoside,</b> such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days and is eliminated by the liver.|$|E
40|$|The Far Eastern sea {{cucumber}} Eupentacta fraudatrix is an inhabitant of shallow {{waters of the}} south part of the Sea of Japan. This animal is an interesting and rich source of triterpene <b>glycosides</b> with unique chemical structures and various biological activities. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate composition and distribution in various body components of triterpene <b>glycosides</b> of the {{sea cucumber}} E. fraudatrix. We applied LC-ESI MS (liquid chromatography–electrospray mass spectrometry) of whole body extract and extracts of various body components for metabolic profiling and structure elucidation of triterpene <b>glycosides</b> from the E. fraudatrix.
