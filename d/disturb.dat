40|$|Abstract: Tree {{condition}} {{and characteristics of}} natural regeneration of tree species was assessed in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Sampling was done in anthropogenically undisturbed, lightly <b>disturbed,</b> heavily <b>disturbed</b> and completely <b>disturbed</b> forest types. Nested plots measuring 25 x 30 m were established to assess tree size classes from seedlings (diameter 15 cm). Higher stem densities were found in undisturbed and lightly <b>disturbed</b> forest types compared to heavily or completely <b>disturbed</b> types. Tree species richness and diversity were highest in lightly <b>disturbed</b> forest. Acacia mearnsii, an introduced tree species in Uganda, was recorded in completely <b>disturbed</b> forest. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was highest in <b>disturbed</b> sites while regeneration from seeds was highest in undisturbed sites. High intensity human disturbance was associated with fewer signs of mammal damage. Damage to trees by physical agents and climber abundance increased with intensity of disturbance except in completely <b>disturbed</b> forest. High intensity human disturbance adversely affected tree species abundance, diversity and regeneration and increased the incidence of damage to trees. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was most important in heavily <b>disturbed</b> sites. Intensity of disturbance and slope influenced th...|$|R

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{disturbance}} were explored for red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Scottish Highlands, {{by studying the}} distribution, behaviour and diet composition of deer in areas that were <b>disturbed</b> or less <b>disturbed</b> by human recreation, in different habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) and {{at different times of}} year.   The human-caused predation risk hypothesis states that there are similarities between the responses elicited by wild animals towards human recreational disturbance and predation.   This hypothesis was tested by comparing behaviour during the recreation season (spring and summer) and the hunting season (autumn and winter). Deer densities were lower in <b>disturbed</b> areas than less <b>disturbed</b> areas throughout the year, although {{there was no difference in}} relative habitat use as a result of disturbance. Habitat selection was primarily influenced by season, with grasslands having higher deer densities during the spring and summer and heather moorlands having higher densities during the winter. Behaviour was monitored using scan sampling of groups.   The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher, resulting in a smaller number of deer feeding in <b>disturbed</b> than less <b>disturbed</b> areas during the recreational season.   Vigilance was higher in <b>disturbed</b> grassland and heather moorland than undisturbed woodland, while behaviour was similar in <b>disturbed</b> woodland and the less <b>disturbed</b> habitats.   In <b>disturbed</b> heather and woodland and in all less <b>disturbed</b> habitats, the majority of animals were standing while vigilant, whilst in <b>disturbed</b> grassland, lying was the main mode of vigilance.   Deer were more likely to be close together when vigilance levels were high.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{drifting}} accuracy of aerostatic bearings, the manufacturing errors effects on <b>disturbing</b> torque of aerostatic bearings is studied by using the finite element method. The finite element mathematic model of the major influence factors of <b>disturbing</b> torque is established. Then, the finite element equation in the gas film domain is solved and the <b>disturbing</b> torque {{in the presence of}} <b>disturbing</b> factors is calculated. The research focuses on elliptical error and prismatic error of journal and incline error of throttle slit. The setting angle of journal, incline position angle of throttle slit and radial eccentricity ratio which affect the <b>disturbing</b> torque is also studied. The results show that roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit affect the <b>disturbing</b> torque significantly, that is the greater roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit the greater <b>disturbing</b> torque. <b>Disturbing</b> torque is periodic function of setting angle of journal and incline position angle of throttle slit. Radial eccentricity ratio affects the <b>disturbing</b> torque, and there is specific radial eccentricity ratio makes <b>disturbing</b> torque to be extreme point or zero point. In the research, the theoretical <b>disturbing</b> torque value is compared with the experimental value of a certain aerostatic bearing, find that they are on the whole accordant with each other and then prove that the finite element model and the method use to solve the problem is correct. The research is of great significance for designing, manufacturing and assembling aerostatic bearings and for performance prediction of aerostatic bearings...|$|R

When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and <b>disturb</b> the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments.
