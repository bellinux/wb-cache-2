After Miraz's death, Prunaprismia was the second {{volunteer}} to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> world (with her child). Because of her repenting, Prunprismia and her child were promised a good life back in our world.|$|E
500|$|I {{think the}} {{standard}} of our cricket was really good. We were up to the mark in the finals. We lost as a team. There were a few errors in batting and bowling. We're not really unhappy or bogged down by it. We'll <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> hotel and enjoy it. That's what sport is all about. the response from our team was great. even the guys who didn't get a chance were completely behind the team. So the spirit was great." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died {{of liver}} failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Three days later, during Megadeth's {{performance}} at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated [...] "Peace Sells" [...] to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover {{version of the}} Black Sabbath's [...] "Never Say Die" [...] for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: [...] "I told [...] after Risk {{that we had to}} <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots and play metal, and he quit." [...] In January 2000, guitarist Al Pitrelli, formerly of Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, became Friedman's replacement.|$|E

60|$|So I <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> {{quarters}} and ruminated over things in general, and watched old Umslopogaas whetting his axe {{outside the window}} as a vulture whets his beak beside a dying ox.|$|R
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we got to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
500|$|For recording, the Doors hired Elvis Presley's bassist Jerry Scheff {{and rhythm}} guitarist Marc Benno {{to round out}} their sound, with Scheff, in particular, {{contributing}} on every track except [...] "L'America". Densmore characterized Scheff as [...] "an in-the-pocket man" [...] and praised how he [...] "allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison, and he slowed Ray down, when his right hand on the keyboards got too darn fast". By all accounts, Morrison– a huge Presley fan– was excited by Scheff's participation. In addition, Benno was asked to participate {{as a result of}} his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell. The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional-quality 8-channel recorder, and the album was finished in six days. Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as [...] "blues day", recording [...] "Crawling King Snake", [...] "Cars Hiss By My Window", and [...] "L.A. Woman". The album had a raw, live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards. Botnick explained, [...] "The overall concept for the recording session was to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> early roots and try to get everything live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible". Mixing was completed at Poppy Studios between February and March 1971, by which time Morrison had moved to Paris, France.|$|E

I wanted to try and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots. I {{wanted to make a}} link between the traditional and the contemporary in our own style." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> tent; {{but not to}} sleep. There is {{a mighty}} lot of {{excitement}} in turning out at night to be shot at, and Darius was {{the only member of}} our party who felt inclined to lie down.|$|R

60|$|The guide book prescribes, I think, no {{less than}} half a dozen churches in Cologne as a dose for the faithful; but we were {{satisfied}} with these three, and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> hotel.

60|$|We {{went out}} into what was Shakspeare's garden, where we were shown his {{mulberry}}--not the one that he planted though, but a veritable mulberry planted on the same spot; and then we <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> hotel very tired, but having conscientiously performed every jot and tittle of the duty of good pilgrims.|$|R

60|$|Still I {{observed}} {{that for all}} his confidence, Hans himself {{was the first to}} depart and with considerable speed.

6000|$|We {{had turned}} a neater trick on Seth Jepson than would have been {{possible}} had we <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> homes when the matter was first suggested, for now he might indeed give <b>our</b> names <b>to</b> the king's officers; but they would fail to find us in Boston town, and who could say when we had left? ...|$|R

If we have a police car behind us, odds are that we will be sampling the speedometer much more often than if a police car was not there.|$|R
5000|$|Talking to Capital FM, Josh Cuthbert said, [...] "This single, it's {{a really}} {{important}} one for us. It's finally the sound that I think suits us. We've <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> roots. On The X Factor we sort of stood on stage and just sang, {{and this is what}} we've done with this song. And we love it," [...] he added. [...] "It's written by a Grammy Award winner Nasri, so we're extremely lucky and we've been in safe hands with Nasri." [...] JJ Hamblett explained, [...] "It's basically we've <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> old roots, it's a different lane for Union J," [...] while Cuthbert added: [...] "We feel like there's no other bands out there that are doing what this sound is, I think this is what we're going to stick with." [...] George Shelley explained: [...] "We've helped a lot with this song and it does mean a lot to us, especially to me since I have a deep connection with the lyrics within it. I thought of this one girl while helping writing it".|$|R
60|$|It {{was upon}} my seeming intercession, {{that he gave}} consent to the boat's crew, who brought the ambassadors, <b>to</b> remain in <b>our</b> service, and set their statesmen on shore; and in the end, I told him {{that as far as}} about one hundred and fifty, or two hundred men, he should {{entertain}} whom he thought fit.

5000|$|... "We {{had these}} grand ambitions <b>to</b> change <b>our</b> process, {{we went up}} to Woodstock and jammed, but in the end, only one thing from that session, 'Strapped for Cash,' turned into an actual song.
