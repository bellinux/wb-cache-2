40|$|Electromagnetic phase {{measurement}} {{is a key}} measurement {{technology in}} optical communication {{as well as in}} microwave photonics. The present lecture re-examines recent progress in electromagnetic phase control and its relevance to future communication systems. Electromagnetic phase measurement and regulation techniques are presented while tracing a path through a communication system from transmitter (such as a frequency-stabilised laser) via transmission medium to an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>detector.</b> An understanding of phase noise at each step in the path and how it may affect frequency standards in optical and rf telecommunication systems is essential. TRANSMITTER After briefly recalling fundamental relations between phase and frequency noise, a description starts at the source transmitter, where much work has focussed on the optical noise of semiconductor lasers associated with their extensive application in optical communication, for instance by Agrawal and co-workers [l]- edge-emitting lasers, [2]- VCSEL.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{resonant}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>detector</b> {{to search for}} hidden-photon dark matter over an extensive range of masses. Hidden-photon dark matter {{can be described as}} a weakly coupled "hidden electric field," oscillating at a frequency fixed by the mass, and able to penetrate any shielding. At low frequencies (compared to the inverse size of the shielding), we find that observable effect of the hidden photon inside any shielding is a real, oscillating magnetic field. We outline experimental setups designed to search for hidden-photon dark matter, using a tunable, resonant LC circuit designed to couple to this magnetic field. Our "straw man" setups take into consideration resonator design, readout architecture and noise estimates. At high frequencies,there is an upper limit to the useful size of a single resonator set by 1 /ν. However, many resonators may be multiplexed within a hidden-photon coherence length to increase the sensitivity in this regime. Hidden-photon dark matter has an enormous range of possible frequencies, but current experiments search only over a few narrow pieces of that range. We find the potential sensitivity of our proposal is many orders of magnitude beyond current limits over an extensive range of frequencies, from 100 Hz up to 700 GHz and potentially higher.

40|$|The {{energy density}} of relic {{gravitational}} waves (GWs) emitted by primordial black holes (PBHs) is calculated. We estimate {{the intensity of}} GWs produced at quantum and classical scattering of PBHs, the classical graviton emission from the PBH binaries in the early Universe, and the graviton emission due to PBH evaporation. If nonrelativistic PBHs dominated the cosmological energy density prior to their evaporation, the probability of formation of dense clusters of PBHs and their binaries in such clusters would be significant and the energy density of the generated gravitational waves in the present day universe could exceed that produced by other known mechanisms. The intensity of these gravitational waves would be maximal in the GHz frequency band of the spectrum or higher and makes their observation very difficult by present detectors but also gives a rather good possibility to investigate it by present and future high frequency gravitational waves <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>detectors.</b> However, the low frequency part of the spectrum in the range f∼ 0. 1 - 10 Hz may be detectable by the planned space interferometers DECIGO/BBO.
