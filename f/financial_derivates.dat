40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on hedging foreign {{exchange}} risk, mostly in small and middle enterprises. Many companies are facing the problem of foreign exchange risk under the exigent circumstances of current financial crisis. The paper also provides analysis of current situation within Small and Middle Enterprises (SMEs) in the Czech Republic whether they are using <b>financial</b> <b>derivates</b> for hedging foreign exchange risk or not, and which ones. As a demonstration of one good hedging possibility, there {{is an example of}} real company and its data before and after using barrier options as the hedging instrument. The questioner survey was processed by basic statistical methods. This research outlines the issue of hedging, which could be either financially unattainable or much too difficult for many SMEs in the Czech Republic. The trend of CZK/EUR in 2012 gives opportunity for using <b>financial</b> <b>derivates</b> such as forwards, currency options and swaps to protect assets and liabilities against higher exchange rate volatility...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is bank centered which follows the continental model, where banks play {{a leading role}} {{and in the case}} of BiH it means the bank participation of over 80 %. The continental model assumes that banks are universal - financial supermarkets among others offer broadcasting services and sales of securities, finance and financial management. Previous research show that banks in BiH offer currency forwards, currency swaps and interest rate forwards which means that <b>financial</b> <b>derivate</b> market is organized as OTC market. Comparing to development countries, this market is not developed yet. The main reason can be found in the facts that BiH is a small country with economy in transition where non-financial firms are still not aware of the benefits in the use of these types of financial instruments and are focused on other ways of mitigating the risk. Also it is important to notice that most of the business operations are done in euro and because of the currency board regime, agency regulations on banks' net open position and a relatively small exposure to foreign currencies, except the euro, foreign exchange risk in BiH is low. Nevertheless, risk management is important for every firm so the main focus of this paper will be how BiH nonfinancial firms manage the risks that they are exposed to in terms of the use of <b>financial</b> <b>derivate</b> in their transactions...|$|R
40|$|Risks {{related to}} {{commodity}} price volatility {{are a major}} thread to actors in commodity chains, particularly to smallholder farmers in low income countries. Therefore, price setting and transmission within global commodity chains are of crucial importance from a developmental and distributional perspective. With the end of global price stabilization mechanisms in the 1980 s, financial derivative markets have taken over the central role in price discovery and risk management. This is also true for the case of coffee, being the agro-commodity with the highest trading volume on financial commodity exchanges. In this paper, the coffee commodity chain is assessed {{with a focus on}} Ethiopia, the largest coffee exporter in Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the crucial role of the coffee sector for exports and for millions of smallholders, price risks for Ethiopian and international actors are analyzed along two indicators - exposure to price risks and ability to mitigate price risks. Even though Ethiopia imposes strict regulations on local value addition in green coffee production, the use of a market-based price discovery system via the Ethiopian Commodity Exchange exposes local actors to highly volatile international coffee prices, but with limited access to risk management. This is in contrast to lead firms in the global coffee chain - international traders and roasters - which use various strategies to deal with and also profit from price risks, mainly interlinked to <b>financial</b> <b>derivate</b> markets...|$|R

The idea of excessive regulation would have stopped evolution and this concept wouldn’t be sufficient to take action against regulation and considering innovation as part of the risk (innovation isn’t a real positive fact in the banking sector, because this innovation has as its base point <b>derivate</b> <b>financial</b> instruments that have no real foundation), but the risk is an integrated part of capitalism.

40|$|The {{volatility}} and {{the uncertainty}} are extended {{in the global}} world, being favorised of the vast proportion {{of the internet and}} by the IT development. The volatility and the uncertainty are contributing to the apperance of the speculative movements that increase the posibilities of the price overestimation of some financial actives on the new markets. The overestimated and optimistic foretell on the flow of some stock exchange deeds, on the new markets, lead to the collapse of the flow and to the fast migration of the capital on the other markets, reason for which the economy of some countries or big areas could be destroied. Taking all this into account the development of the opperations with <b>derivated</b> <b>financial</b> instruments have offerd for the market participants bothe the posibility of hedging and a way of speculation.

40|$|Scince the 1990 ies a {{multiplicity}} of young technology firms tried to enter the new markets. Some MNE`s merged or established through spin-offs new competitive firms, SME `s often found themselves {{in the middle of}} a consolidation process, developing under a strong pressure of competition new ways of legal forms and management structures such as Management-buy-outs. Capitalization, raising of capital, managing and hedging risks have become a strategic factor of success to participate in the global innovation competition. This links the system of financial intermediaries with the production- and innovation system. Firms are raising capital from the financial markets to finance their innovation and production processes through credits, bonds, stocks, venture capital, private equity and other <b>financial</b> products (<b>derivates).</b> A successful transaction is dependent on a knowledge intensive, technology based and worldwide operating system of financial intermediaries. Through ratings, risk analysis, monitoring, information processing, pricing and further more tools financial intermediaries act in their role as middlemen centres. ?Intermediaries help markets to grow by creating products that form the basis of new markets. In turn, markets help intermediaries to innovate new more customized products by lowering costs of producing them? Merton and Bodie 1995, 26). The financial innovation spiral builds up complex structures within financial markets evolve. Today, after a fatal crash of the international financial markets and the bankruptcy of hundred of national and worldwide operating firms, this has left a strong mark on the international financial landscape map. New concepts of corporate governance with demand for a stronger transparency, information policy and risk control have to be developed for a future relationship between investors, financial intermediaries and the firms management. What consequences will follow? This paper will discuss these issues from a different perspective while concentrating on some systemic backgrounds of the financial system, which shape those complex interrelationships and put them into a dynamic process. In a first step the paper is introducing a functional approach to explain institutional changes within the financial systems. Followed by the second step, some consequences and trends for financial centres with regard to their structure, functions, participants and activities will be discussed. In a third step, I try to give a framework how a financial centre could be analysed. This will open up starting points for a future research of Innovation, Financial Industry and Space (IFIS) ...|$|R

There are several models that try to describe the behavior of yield curve plausibly. In most of the cases the models stem from probability theory and coincidence. These models are also means for assessment of <b>financial</b> <b>derivates</b> whose price de- pends on the interest rates movements. The work deals with three one-factor models which are analyzed into more details in the second chapter. The last chapter is about real-data calibration.

40|$|The {{world today}} {{is facing the}} most {{difficult}} and the most complicated crisis, starting {{from the time of}} the Great Depression. The crisis significantly emphasized the role of fiscal policy as important to increase the aggregate demand and to recover the financial sector. We are aware of the biggest coordination of monetary and fiscal policy until today, in which through aggressive monetary and fiscal measures was allowed quicker overcoming of the consequences of the crisis, taking corrective action in the financial architecture, adoption of new rules for the regulation of financial markets and financial institutions, and greater care in handling with complicated and modern <b>financial</b> <b>derivates.</b> The aim of this paper is to realize the most important aspect of the European crisis: the coordination of fiscal and monetary policy and their importance for the transition economies (including Eastern Europe and CIF members). Financial crises have a significant and permanent effect on these countries, lowering long-term output by about 17 percent. The effect is more important in smaller countries, with relative higher dependence on external financing, and in which the banking sector noticed more important financial disequilibria. We also found that fiscal policy measures have been the most efficient tools in dealing with the crises, while the role of monetary policy instruments has been rather blinded. Exchange rate resulted to be more a propagator than a crises absorber, while the IMF credit has been found to have positive (but not significant) impact on growth performance. Finally, the effect for the CEECs is much bigger than in the EU advanced economies, for which we found that financial crises lowers long-term output only by 2 percent. The necessity for fiscal adjustment is required step of fiscal authorities to stabilize the economy and to achieve financial stability and sustainable economic growth in the long term...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 68 - 71). Surveys {{of firms}} outside the property sector indicate {{the growth in}} the use of DCF methods such as the NPV and IRR methods to evaluate projects as compared to the use of such naïve methods as Payback and the Accounting rate of return. The growing convergence of theory and practice is indicated by the growing use of the NPV method. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the capital budgeting methods used to evaluate real estate development projects and to compare the results of a survey with the results of other studies. Further, recent developments in capital budgeting theory, indicate that the investment valuation tools such as the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (lRR), Payback Period (PP), and theAccounting Rate of Return (ARR) may fail to recognize flexibilities in real estate development projects. As a consequence, the discounted cash flow methods (DCF) may systematically undervalue strategic or large-scale real estate development projects. Two methods are introduced as an alternative to address the weaknesses of the DCF methods. Decision Tree Analysis (DTA) employs an approach to analyse flexibilities by creating a chain of possible options and allows alternative courses of action for management to adapt their initial strategies in order to capitalise on new opportunities or to minimise losses. Real Option Analysis (ROA) introduces the theory of valuing <b>financial</b> <b>derivates,</b> in particular call options, and allows the staging of the development. These instruments further introduce a risk management aspect, as call options have a limited down side and an unlimited upside. Each approach has advantages and shortcomings and should only be used in appropriate circumstances. DTA is suited for the analysis of the project specific risks. ROA on the other hand, is a superior tool when dealing with uncertainty. The thesis finds that that over 90 % of all respondents are using a combination of NPV and IRR methods most often to evaluate development opportunities. Interestingly, 85 % of all respondents are also using the payback period. Other methods used are the profitability index, residual value, free cash flow, economic value, and return on equity. Developers have adopted DCF methods such as NPV and IRR as the primary methods to evaluate projects rather than naïve methods such as Payback and ARR, although these latter methods remain in use. The use of decision tree analysis and real option analysis is very limited...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} the problem areas of trading in euro, while focusing on search for options of reducing costs related to euro account management and business transactions in an exporting company. In the theoretical part, various risks of international business are explained. The next chapter focuses on the foreign exchange risk management, followed by a chapter dedicated to hedging against the exchange rate risk, especially forwards, futures, swaps and options. In {{the conclusion of the}} literary review, the accounting of <b>financial</b> <b>derivates</b> and foreign exchange differences is listed. In the practical part of the thesis, data from a specific company with object in sewing textile products are used. This company exports its products in the European Union countries; therefore, the invoiced currency is euro. The company is assessed from a general point of view, with remarking the descending trend in the number of its employees, and using data from income statements. Further assessment of the company was done using benchmark, when the company was compared to four other companies with the same object, located in South Bohemia. The company placed fourth. Furthermore, the risks connected to the international business of the company ABC, a. s., are identified, with measures being suggested which could eliminate these risks and reduce costs related {{to the fact that the}} company is export-oriented. The next chapter is focused on the survey of bank institutions and exchange rate companies and, as a consequence, on analysis which options could be offered to the ABC, a. s., company and what are the costs related to these products. To reduce the payment costs in the ABC, a. s., company, two alternatives are suggested. In case the company manager is risk-aversive, the option of a well-established bank institution is offered. In the second case, when the manager is a risk-taker and would opt for a more profitable exchange rate, the foreign currency company would probably be the choice. Since the company does not hedge against the foreign exchange risk, the currency forward is suggested as the hedging instrument. In conclusion, the way how to account such currency forward is stated. This means that this thesis will in fact serve as an internal directive draft for accounting forward, to be used in practice...|$|E
