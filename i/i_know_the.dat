5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> case is desperate; but, sir, we {{must either}} quit {{the country or}} attack Mr. Hamilton. No time is to be lost. Were I sure of a reinforcement, I should not attempt it. Who knows what fortune will do for us? Great things have been {{effected}} by a few men well conducted. Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E

500|$|Chopra got a fifteen-day {{break from}} her other {{commitments}} {{to train for}} the film. She relocated to her bungalow in Goa, where she would train for five hours a day. After completing workouts, which included weights and circuit training, she insisted on training for boxing. Later, boxing was made {{a part of her}} daily workout. She was trained by Kom's coaches to learn her distinct boxing style. Chopra explained that she did not have to act like a boxer, but had to become one and said [...] "To learn boxing was a religion.

500|$|Speaking to {{his friend}} and I, Me, Mine editor Derek Taylor in 1979, Harrison said of the episode: [...] "I don't feel guilty or bad about it, in fact it saved many a heroin addict's life. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> motive behind writing the song {{in the first place}} and its effect far {{exceeded}} the legal hassle." ...|$|E

500|$|Craig {{was again}} {{the centre of}} media speculation, with some media likening his arrival to Bradman's first tour of England in 1930. Bradman had scored a world Test series record of 974runs in 1930, a mark that remains unsurpassed. At a {{reception}} {{at the start of}} the tour, British judge and cricket enthusiast Lord Birkett said [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> English as I think I do, every Mother in the land will pray for him." [...] During the tour he was presented with a birthday cake on television. However, the trip was unsuccessful in terms of batting.|$|E
500|$|Following her marriage, Kajol {{moved in}} with Devgan and his parents at the latter's ancestral house in Juhu. While media members speculated about a lack of {{compatibility}} between her in-laws and her, Kajol clarified that they were [...] "like parents to me" [...] and encouraged her to continue working in films. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgan with other Bollywood actresses, and have reported about an imminent divorce. Refuting the rumours, Kajol stated, [...] "I don't believe in those rumours because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> way this industry functions. [...] You cannot continue a marriage without the basic trust. Frankly, I don't care for such talk." ...|$|E

500|$|Sweet Smell of Success premiered in New York at Loew’s State in Times Square on June 27, 1957. Critical {{reaction}} {{was much more}} favorable. Time said that the movie was [...] "raised to considerable dramatic heights by intense acting, taut direction ... superb camera work ... and, above all, by its whiplash dialogue". Both it and the New York Herald included the film on their ten-best lists for 1957. The film's reputation improved over time, with David Denby in New York magazine calling it [...] "the most acrid, and the best" [...] of all New York movies because it captured, [...] "better than any film <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of Times Square and big-city journalism".|$|E
500|$|... "The Box" [...] was co-written by co-executive {{producer}} Josh Singer {{and executive}} story editor Graham Roland, while being directed by [...] veteran Jeffrey Hunt.

At San Diego Comic-Con International during the summer leading up to the season premiere, actress Jasika Nicole told the audience they would finally be able to see her character's apartment, which has previously been only alluded to in an early season two episode. She explained, [...] "It's really neat! [...] There's all these tiny little things that give you insight into how things are.

On 15 July, Chelsea confirmed {{the completion of the}} signing of Costa, who signed a five-year contract on a salary of £150,000 a week. On signing, Costa said, [...] "I am very happy to sign for Chelsea. Everybody knows it is a big club in a very competitive league, and I am very excited to get started in England with a fantastic coach and team-mates. Having played against Chelsea last season <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> high quality of the squad I am joining". Following the departure of former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, Costa inherited his number 19 shirt, the same number he wore at the 2014 World Cup for Spain and previously at Atlético.|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Veronica Mars {{features}} a different [...] "case of the week" [...] each episode, and the season-long mystery of Lilly Kane's murder. In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, I know how it was done, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Clooney and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel used various {{techniques}} when {{portraying the}} different decades of Barris's life. [...] "We thought {{in order to}} go back in time, most people remember things through film," [...] Clooney reasoned. [...] "I don't remember the 1950s [...] I wasn't around for them [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> 50s through Technicolor. Not Technicolor as it was shot, but Technicolor as it has faded now." [...] The filmmakers studied various films and magazine issues of that decade for inspiration on the color palette. Racking focuses were highly stylized for scenes set in the 1960s, similar to the Spaghetti Westerns of that era. Hand-held cameras were used for scenes set in the 1970s, an homage to the films of Sidney Lumet, Mike Nichols and Alan J. Pakula, primarily Klute (1971), Carnal Knowledge (1971), and The Parallax View (1974). Bob Fosse's All That Jazz also influenced Clooney's direction.|$|E
500|$|By mid-December 1861 Sherman had {{recovered}} sufficiently {{to return to}} service under Halleck in the Department of the Missouri. (In March, Halleck's command was redesignated the Department of the Mississippi and enlarged to unify command in the West). Sherman's initial assignments were rear-echelon commands, first of an instructional barracks near St. Louis and then {{in command of the}} District of Cairo. [...] Operating from Paducah, Kentucky, he provided logistical support for the operations of Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to capture Fort Donelson (February 1862). [...] Grant, the previous commander of the District of Cairo, had recently won a major victory at Fort Henry (February 6, 1862) and been given command of the ill-defined District of West Tennessee. [...] Although Sherman was technically the senior officer at this time, he wrote to Grant, [...] "I feel anxious about you as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> great facilities [...] have of concentration by means of the River and R Road, but [...] have faith in you—Command me in any way." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Uhura and Chekov {{question}} passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> answer to that... I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E
500|$|In late 1910, the new {{government}} introduced legislation to revoke the A's charter and confiscate the proceeds {{from the sale of}} bonds, which were still held by the province. [...] In introducing the bill, Sifton made no commitment as to what would be done with the funds once confiscated. [...] Many northern MLAs, including Cornwall and Cross, suspected that the Premier's plans for the money did not include construction of a northern railway, and opposed the bill on that basis. [...] Clarke re-surfaced in Winnipeg to deny Sifton's charge that the A had defaulted on any of its obligations, and Conservative leader Bennett opposed the confiscation out of stated respect for private property: [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property 'without due process of law'." ...|$|E
500|$|Wenger at {{the start}} of the season prioritised regaining the league title: [...] "I feel it is very {{important}} in our minds to do this and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> hunger is strong to do it," [...] and named Newcastle United and Liverpool, along with Manchester United and Chelsea, as Arsenal's main rivals for the Premier League. Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson asserted that his old club were favourites because they had the [...] "best players … If they all remain fit week-in week-out then they will not be beaten." [...] Glenn Moore of The Independent wrote of Arsenal's chances: [...] "They will be thereabouts, but unless Wenger finally puts his faith in youth, and the likes of Jérémie Aliadière, Jermaine Pennant and Phillipe Senderos repay him, they may lack the depth to sustain a title campaign." [...] Defender Sol Campbell however believed the squad was [...] "strong enough for the league and FA Cup", but doubted their chances of winning the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
