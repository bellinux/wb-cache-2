In order to provide year-round employment for his workers producing farm equipment, Mr. Allen sought to create a product that could be sold during the winter. His passion for sledding led him to develop a series of sleds and sled improvements. Allen was issued U.S. Patent number 408,681 on August 13, 1889 for the Flexible Flyer.|$|E
5000|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, a drill is a shallow furrow in which seeds or bulbs are placed during seeding. A drill is commonly created by dragging a hoe through {{the soil in}} a straight line, leaving a furrow of a centimeter or two for smaller seeds, or a deeper trench of several centimeters for flower bulbs and seed potatoes. It makes seeding faster than by individually burying seeds, and also facilitates the creation of straight rows. On a larger scale, for example, in planting potatoes, a tractor can pull a <b>furrower</b> implement that quickly creates drills that can be manually or mechanically seeded and covered.|$|E
5000|$|J. Hall's (1970) {{report on}} the state of site {{preparation}} in Ontario noted that blades and rakes were found to be well suited to post-cut scarification in tolerant hardwood stands for natural regeneration of yellow birch. Plows were most effective for treating dense brush prior to planting, often in conjunction with a planting machine. Scarifying teeth, e.g., Young's teeth, were sometimes used to prepare sites for planting, but their most effective use was found to be preparing sites for seeding, particularly in backlog areas carrying light brush and dense herbaceous growth. Rolling choppers found application in treating heavy brush but could be used only on stone-free soils. Finned drums were commonly used on jack pine-spruce cutovers on fresh brushy sites with a deep duff layer and heavy slash, and they needed to be teamed with a tractor pad unit to secure good distribution of the slash. The S.F.I. scarifier, after strengthening, had been [...] "quite successful" [...] for 2 years, promising trials were under way with the cone scarifier and barrel ring scarifier, and development had begun on a new flail scarifier for use on sites with shallow, rocky soils. Recognition of the need to become more effective and efficient in site preparation led the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests to adopt the policy of seeking and obtaining for field testing new equipment from Scandinavia and elsewhere that seemed to hold promise for Ontario conditions, primarily in the north. Thus, testing was begun of the Brackekultivator from Sweden and the Vako-Visko rotary <b>furrower</b> from Finland.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Electro-osmosys {{principle}} {{consists of}} {{the application of a}} direct current voltage to an anode-cathode system introduced into soil. The effect of this system {{consists of the}} mobilization of water particles from soil and their transport, in {{a very short period of}} time, from the anode to cathode. For the tilling machinery the anode may be a disc-knife and the cathode may be the working part (trash board, coulter knife, <b>furrowers,</b> etc). The soil water transported from the anode to cathode, on the tool-soil contact surface, in consequence, will produce a lubrication of an active surface and through this a great decreasing of the friction forces and implicit of the energy needed for displacing the tool through the soil. The energy needed for tilling the soil represents a great part of a total energy consumed for plants crop. When the soil is tilled by pulling or pushing of the tools for farming, a great part of the tilling energy is consumed for defeating the friction forces from the tool-soil contact surfaces. The active surface of the tilling tool may be properly chosen in order to minimize the frictions, respective the mechanic energies needed for tilling...|$|R
40|$|The {{heavy traffic}} of {{machines}} in no-tillage systems causes problems as soil compaction {{and loss of}} crops productivity. The objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the productivity of soybeans in reference to furrow openers and the levels of soil compaction in two crops. The experiment was conducted on Rhodic Hapludox by tracing random blocks with subdivided parcels. The soil bulk density levels were laid out in the parcels (1. 16, 1. 20, 1. 22, and 1. 26 Mg m- 3) and the <b>furrowers</b> in the sub-parcels (double disc and shanks). The resistance to penetration, depth of the furrow, mobilized soil area, final plant stands, height of plants, mean number of beans by pod, 1, 000 bean mass, number of pods per plant and productivity of the culture were evaluated. The resistance to penetration increased with the levels of soil compaction regardless of the farming year and up to a depth of 0. 20 m. In the first crop, higher productivity with the use of the shank was observed. In the second crop, the use of the shank resulted in an increase in depth of the furrow, mobilized soil, height of the plants and final stand of the plants, but this did not indicate an increase in productivity...|$|R
40|$|Warm season turfgrass species (like bermudagrass) {{seem to be}} very {{suitable}} to Mediterranean climate conditions. They also give an excellent wear resistance to the sport pitches. Transplanting of pre-cultivated warm season turgrass plants (similar to horticultural nursery) is a promising technique which can be efficiently used for turf conversion. It is based on the quick ground cover capacity of these species by means of stolons and rhizomes. Transplanting can be performed both in tilled and untilled soil. A working yard for the conversion of a professional football pitch was assessed in order to evaluate the performaces. The transplant was performed with a 4 -row mechanical transplanter which had been adjusted to work in the untilled mowed football pitch. The mechanical transplanter accommodates 4 back-seated operators and 4 walking operators who can manually transplant the plants in case of failure. The working speed of the tractor was less than 1 km h- 1, theoretical working time was about 15 h ha- 1, actual working time was 28 h ha- 1, thus the work efficiency was about 0. 52. Fuel consumption was about 28 kg ha- 1. Such a low efficiency was due to the difficulty of the operators to remove the plants from the trays and supply the transplanter’s delivery system. In this concern, an automatic transplanter was modified in order to work in untilled soil within a second specific trial. This machine had an automatic system for removing the plants from the trays, like the most advanced robotic transplanters for vegetable crops. Moreover, a specific system for plant deposition in untilled soil was developed by mounting a double disc in front of the <b>furrowers.</b> Plant deposition was tested and a maximum variation of 6 cm in the row was assessed with respect to the expected value. This gap is completely in accordance with this kind of crop...|$|R

Maximum amount of nitrogen (2. 57 %) and phosphorous (0. 32 %) of leaf obtained from treatment of seven (Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and <b>furrower)</b> and the highest amount of potassium of leaf equal 1. 72 % obtained from treatment of seven (Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 50 kg. ha- 1 urea, 10 t. ha- 1 animal manure and <b>furrower)</b> and treatment of six (Stalk shredder, plow, disc, 100 kg. ha- 1 urea and <b>furrower)</b> with amount of equal 1. 60 %.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to use organic fertilizers and decrease chemical fertilizers consumption to reach sustainable agriculture. Thus, to {{study the effects of}} manure incorporation methods, and integrated effects of poultry manure with chemical fertilizers on the grain yield and yield components of maize, an experiment was conducted in 2004 at the Agricultural Research Farm of Lorestan Weather Department, 30 kms northeast of Khorramabad. The treatments were arranged in a split plot layout based on randomized complete block design with four replications. The main plots consisted of incorporation of fertilizer with soil by <b>furrower</b> or disk. The subplots included T 0 : control (no consumption of fertilizer and poultry manure); T 1 : 200, 100, and 100 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively; T 2 : 80 % of T 1 + 4 ton ha- 1 of poultry manure; T 3 : 60 % of T 1 + 8 ton ha- 1 of poultry manure; T 4 : 40 % of T 1 + 12 ton ha- 1 of poultry manure; T 5 : 20 % of T 1 + 16 ton ha- 1 of poultry manure; and T 6 : 20 ton ha- 1 of poultry manure. The results showed that incorporation of fertilizer by <b>furrower,</b> compared with disk, led to significant increase in plant height, 1000 seed weight and grain and biological yields. However, there were not significant differences in the number of seed per ear and harvest index between the two fertilizer incorporation methods. Fertilizer treatments caused significant increase of the treats mentioned except for the harvest index. The interaction effects were not significant for any traits. T 5 treatment produced the highest grain yield, and was significantly different from T 0, T 1, T 3 and T 6 treatments. The differences between T 1 (chemical nutrition system) and T 6 (organic nutrition system) were not significant either. Effectiveness of integrated poultry manure and chemical fertilizers on maize yield components was higher than either poultry manure or chemical fertilizer. The results of this experiment indicated that incorporation of 16 ton poultry manure + 40, 20 and 20 kg ha- 1 N, P and K with <b>furrower</b> might be appropriate for maize prodution under conditions similar to this experiment...|$|E
40|$|Brazilian {{family farming}} has at its {{disposal}} planters whose furrowing mechanisms, whether disc or shank, require a large vertical force. In smaller planters, this is reflected in low efficiency when opening the furrow or in a high demand for mass (weight). Rotary furrowers require less vertical force for the same operation. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of rotary furrowers mounted on the powertrain of a walking tractor working under direct seeding, and compare them with shank-type furrowers using bibliographic data. The parameters used in the comparison were the depth and width of the furrow, the area of disturbed soil and the cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil after the operation. The experiment was carried out on wheat stubble that had lain fallow for six months. Twelve treatments were employed in a factorial design: three models of rotary furrowers, two values for revolutions per unit of linear displacement, and two forward speeds. The variable, cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil, was statistically affected only by the factor, <b>furrower.</b> However there was significant interaction between the factors, <b>furrower,</b> revolutions per metre and speed, for the variables of depth, furrow width and area of disturbed soil. The values obtained for the variables of width, depth and disturbed area in the cross-section of the furrows, with {{the three types of}} rotary furrowers driven by the powertrain of a walking tractor, were similar to those generated by shank-type furrowers...|$|E
40|$|In ridge plant systems, {{crops are}} planted into ridges formed during {{cultivation}} {{of the previous}} crop. Row cleaning devices on the planter push weed seed and residue lying on the soil surface from the ridge to the area between the rows, or row middles. The crop seed is planted into the old row in a cleanly tilled strip at a higher elevation than the row middles. A band application of herbicide behind the planter typically {{is used in the}} row for weed control. Crop cultivation controls weeds between the row and rebuilds ridges for the following year. Ridge plant systems are often lower in cost than other tillage and planting systems, but may not be suitable for all farming situations. Level or gently sloping fields, especially those having poorly drained soils, are well suited to ridge plant systems. The elevated ridge tends to shed the residue to the row middles, allowing earlier soil warming in the spring. This warming, combined with drainage from the ridge, allows soil in the ridge to be drier at planting time than unridged soils. Ridge planting is an excellent choice for soils that are often too wet for early spring tillage. Ridge plant systems help control erosion by leaving the soil covered with residue until planting. After planting, 30 to 50 percent of the initial residue may be left on the soil surface. Residue covered areas between the rows alternate with cleanly tilled strips in the rows. If planting is done correctly, the cleanly tilled strip will be higher than the residue covered areas, so that water drains from the row to the residue covered row middles. Ridge Cleaning Equipment Ridge planting equipment uses row cleaning devices to push residue and weed seed to the row middles where a crop cultivator can provide weed control. Removing the residue also enhances warming of the soil. Disk <b>furrowers</b> can be used to move some of the surface residue and weed seed to the row middle. In general, larger diameter disks will be more effective in moving residue and weed seed, and have less plugging problems than smaller diameter disks. Overlapping, notched-edge heavy duty versions are available to clean the ridge tops. The notched edges aid in keeping the disks rotating when operating at a shallow depth. The overlapping disks cut the residue without plugging and clear the row area behind the disks. To minimize side draft, the leading disk should be on the right for half the flowers and on the left for the other half. Some ridge planters use a wide sweep to clear the ridge top. The flat sweep operates at a shallow depth, sliding under the residue and moving residue, soil and weed seed to the row middle. Often some type of deflector shields or 2 ̆ 2 trash guards 2 ̆ 2 are used to move the residue, soil and weed seeds off the ridge top as they slide over the sweep. The horizontal disk is free to rotate and is designed to operate like a sweep, sliding under the residue and soil. Deflector shields keep the row area clean. The rotating action makes the disks self-cleaning and distributes wear {{around the perimeter of the}} disk rather than only on the leading edge. The row cleaning devices should be operated at a very shallow depth, removing less than l or 2 inches of the ridge top to keep the row higher than the residue covered row middles. This reduces the erosion potential in the cleanly tilled strips. After planting, the top of the ridge should be 3 to 5 inches higher than the row middle and shaped to shed water to the row middle. For erosion control, never allow the row area to be lower than the row middle after planting. Doing so can concentrate runoff in the cleanly tilled strips, which increases erosion in the row area on sloping soils when planting is up and down hill. Even if the field is relatively flat and has little erosion potential, creating furrows by operating the row cleaning device too deeply can cause sediment from runoff to be deposited in the row. When dry, these deposits can form a crust that a rotary hoe may not break because the row is lower than the row middles. Additionally, operating row cleaning devices too deeply places the crop seed in a cooler, wetter environment, which can slow germination and emergence. Operating row cleaning device too deeply is a common problem with ridge plant systems. The operating depth need to be only deep enough to keep residue and weed seed flowing away from the row area. Very little soil needs to be moved and it is not necessary to remove the previous crop root masses. In fact, removing the root masses can cause these problems: • The removed root masses may be run over by planter gauge wheels, causing non-uniform planting depth. • A void can be created in the soil where the root mass was removed and the planter may not be capable of placing and covering the seed properly when seeds are dropped into these voids. • At cultivation, root masses can plug the cultivator or be pushed back into the row, interfering with crop growth or harvest...|$|R

Field capacity of P 5 and P 6 with averagely 1. 67 ha. h- 1 was maximum. Field capacity of all drilling methods (P 3, P 4, P 5 and P 6) was significantly more than that of broadcasting methods (P 1 and P 2). The highest seed spacing uniformity (87. 2 %) was belonged to P 6 method and the lowest value (54. 7 %) was for P 1 method. By using drilling methods of P 3 and P 5 (or P 6) instead of P 1 method total cost was reduced 41 % and 29 % respectively. The results of variance analysis of data showed {{that the difference between}} planting methods in case of wheat grain yield and yield components was not significant. However, the seed rate had significant effect on some yield components.

40|$|Straw on sowing line modifies seed {{germination}} environment regarding temperature and water content. Given these considerations, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate different mechanisms for coverage mobilization on the sowing line and their effect on germination environment of maize seeds, mainly in relation to the dynamics of straw in the seedbed, water content and soil temperature. Treatments consisted on the combination of two mechanisms at front of furrow opener, composed of cutting disc and row cleaners, with three mechanisms behind the seed <b>furrower</b> for returning the soil, consisting of three covering mechanisms, commercial and prototype models. It was found that straw presence on the surface of sowing line contributed to germination of maize seeds, maintenance of temperature and soil water content. The cutting disc treatment, associated with prototype, introduced percentages of water content near the ones in bottom layer, and this soil water content was 29. 7 % with 93. 75 % of straw coverage and deeper seeding depth, granting better conditions for {{seed germination}}. However, the straw coverage removal on soil by the row cleaners and its low sowing depth caused water loss in the lines resulting in great reduction of the emergence speed index in maize seedlings...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate performance of different mechanisms regarding straw mobilization, employed in a no-till seeder. The experimental area was conducted on clayey soil under no-tillage with a large quantity of sorghum residue. The experiment was established in a randomized block design, as the treatments consisted of a combination of two mechanisms at front of the furrow opener composed of cutting disc and row cleaners, and three mechanisms behind the seed <b>furrower,</b> covering discs prototype model M 1, Spider and commercial model, with the combination of cutting disc and Spider model not being evaluated. We assessed the coverage permanence on soil index, vegetation mass on surface and inside the line. The treatment containing the row cleaner mechanism efficiently removed straw from the surface of sowing line as well as the return one acted on straw replacement. It was identified that use of the cutting disc at the front of seeder contributed to the increase of straw installation inside the line, three times more than in the row cleaner system when operating individually. Covering mechanism with row cleaners reduced straw inside the line and kept line covering similar to treatment of cutting disc operating alone...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Improving the {{efficiency}} of all agricultural operations has always been important for farmers and engineers. It {{is well known that}} the force required for cutting a soil using narrow blades is a function of soil and environmental physical properties, tool shape geometry and the tool’s surface characteristics like soil-tool adhesion and friction. Soil tool adhesion can reduce ploughing efficiency and quality. It may also halt the movement of tillage machines in more severe conditions. Adhesion can also disable some machine abilities, which can result in a significant reduction of machine performance. Adhesion of the soil to seed-bed preparation tools like furrowers can significantly affect the germination rate. Reducing soil tool adhesion of furrowers can reduce draft force and improve ploughing efficiency. Many researchers have worked on methods of reducing draft force by modifying the surface material and/or surface texture of the plough tools. A good prediction on draft force of a tool before producing it has always been important for farmers and engineers. There are some models for predicting the draft force of narrow blades in soil. McKyes-Ali’s model is widely used because of its accuracy and simplicity. Ultra-high molecular weight polythene (UHMW-PE) is a polymer with ultra-high weight and long molecular chains and is well known for its outstanding physical and chemical properties and self-cleaning abilities, which reduce soil-tool adhesion. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate usability of UHMW-PE coated <b>furrower</b> tines for draft force. Analytical and experimental investigations were carried out during the research. A comparison was conducted between the analytical and the experimental method. The results of this comparison can be used to determine reliability of the analytical model for predicting the draft force improvement caused by the surface modification on tines using different surface coatings. Materials and Methods Eight tines have been built. Four of them had a thick coating layer of UHMW-PE, and the other four were made of pure mild steel. Each set of the tines have been installed on a four shanked chisel plough chassis and then attached to a tractor. The draft force required for pulling the furrowers attached to the tractor has been measured by a simple load meter mechanism connecting two tractors. Draft force has been measured in two different speeds. Slip ratio of the tractor has been recorded. Each test has been repeated three times. McKyes-Ali’s proposed model for evaluating the draft force of narrow blades has been chosen to predict draft force of the traditional steel <b>furrower</b> tines and the surface coated ones. To drive the model, a computer program has been coded in the script environment of Matlab software. The model required some of the mechanical properties of the soil and the tool to operate. Specific gravity, cohesion and internal friction angle of the soil have been measured by routine laboratory methods. Soil-tool adhesion and friction of the mild steel and the UHMW-PE plates have been measured using the direct shear apparatus.

40|$|Na agricultura moderna, o custo operacional {{continua}} sendo decisivo no momento da seleção de máquinas e, ou, do sistema motomecanizado. Nessa atividade, o grande desafio continua sendo produzir com alta qualidade, dependência mínima de mão de obra e custo reduzido. O sistema de plantio direto está sendo cada vez mais utilizado, e a tendência é aumentar ainda mais. Nesse contexto, quantificar a energia demandada pelos diferentes tipos e modelos de semeadora-adubadora disponíveis no mercado é de suma importância para fabricantes, agricultores e demais interessados, que podem, além de aperfeiçoar o produto, selecionar aquele que proporcionará o melhor rendimento energético e, consequentemente, dará maior contribuição para reduzir os custos da produção agrícola. Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a demanda energética de um conjunto trator-semeadora-adubadora em diferentes velocidades de deslocamento e configurações de montagem de linha de plantio, bem como aplicar e avaliar o modelo matemático para predição de esforço tratório proposto pela American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE), na Norma ASAE D 497. 7 MAR 2011, por meio de comparação de resultados obtidos experimentalmente com os simulados. O experimento foi realizado no delineamento em blocos ao acaso com três repetições. Foram aplicados 10 tratamentos pela associação de cinco velocidades de deslocamento do conjunto mecanizado com duas configurações de montagem da linha de plantio, totalizando 30 unidades experimentais. As variações na configuração de montagem da linha de plantio foram decorrentes da utilização de dois tipos de mecanismo sulcador no sistema de deposição de adubo da semeadora-adubadora: disco duplo defasado e facão. Foram avaliadas as seguintes variáveis: velocidade de deslocamento; força e potência requeridas para tração da semeadora-adubadora; consumo horário e específico de combustível; volume médio e específico de solo mobilizado; consumo específico de combustível por volume de solo mobilizado; e energia requerida por volume de solo mobilizado. Concluiu-se que, para velocidades de deslocamento idênticas, a semeadora-adubadora equipada com o mecanismo sulcador tipo facão no sistema de deposição de adubo (configuração B) apresentou menor demanda energética que a semeadora-adubadora equipada com o disco duplo defasado (configuração A) para realizar o mesmo trabalho. Concluiu-se, também, que o modelo proposto pela norma ASABE (2011 b) para predição de força requerida na tração de implementos agrícolas mostrou-se eficiente para a semeadora- adubadora montada na configuração A, o que não ocorreu na configuração B. Operational costs {{has been}} being decisive for selecting machines and or mechanized {{systems in the}} modern agriculture. High quality production, minimum dependence on labor and reduced costs are the greatest challenges in this activity. The non-tillage system is being increasingly used, and the trend is to increase more and more. In this context, quantifying the energy required by different types and models of seeder available in the market {{is of paramount importance}} to manufacturers, farmers and other interested ones who may, besides improving the product, select one that will provide the best energy efficiency and give greater contribution to reducing the costs of agricultural production, as a consequence. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the energy demand of a seeder-tractor at different speeds and planting row mounting configurations, as well as to implement and to evaluate the mathematical model for predicting tractor effort proposed by ASAE D 497. 7 MAR 2011 Guidelines through comparison of experimental with the simulated results. The experiment was conducted in randomized block design with three replicates. It was used five displacement speeds obtained in function of the gear variations, changes in rotation of the axis of the tractor and two configurations of planting row mountings, totaling 10 treatments and 30 experimental units. Variations in configurations of the planting row mountings were caused by the use of two types of plow mechanism in the fertilizer deposition system of the seeder: unbalanced double discs and knife. The following variables were evaluated: displacement speed, force and power required to pull the seeder; time and specific fuel consumption; specific and total volume of displaced soil; specific fuel consumption per volume of displaced soil, and tractor driving wheel slip and energy required per volume of displaced soil. Based on the results, it was concluded that the seeder equipped with knife-type <b>furrower</b> system showed the best energy performance and the model for prediction of force required to pull agricultural implements proposed by ASABE (2011 b) was able to provide information for predicting the behavior of this variable when the planter was equipped with the unbalanced double discs <b>furrower</b> mechanism. It was concluded that, for identical displacement speeds the seeder-fertilizer equipped with the knife-type <b>furrower</b> mechanism in the fertilizer deposition system ("B" configuration) presented lower energy demand than the seeder- fertilizer equipped with the lagged double disc ("A" configuration) to accomplish the same task. It is also concluded that the model proposed by ASABE (2011 b) to prediction of power required in traction of agricultural implements showed to be able to offer to the seeder-fertilizer mounted in the A configuration the information for prediction of behavior of this variable. However, in the "B" configuration, the model did not showed to be able to supply such information...|$|E
40|$|Under {{irrigation}} and in double-cropping system, {{a large amount}} of plant residue remains after harvest that along with the limited time for residue decomposition and complete seedbed preparation, necessitates reduced tillage and special residue management. In the present study, the effects of various seedbed preparation methods on vegetative growth, yield components and seed and oil yields of sunflower (Euroflor hybrid) were studied in a barley-sunflower cropping system during 2001 at the Agricultural Research Station, Isfahan University of Technology. Three residue management treatments (standing, partly removed and burned) along with five tillage systems (moldboard + disk; chisel + disk; disk; moldboard and <b>furrower</b> as the minimum tillage) were laid out in a split-block design with three replications. Burning residue treatment significantly increased plant dry weight at various developmental stages and also head diameter. Number of seeds per head, 1000 seed weight, harvest index, and oil yield were non-significantly higher in the burned residue treatment. Seed yield was significantly higher in the burned and partly removed residue treatments. Moldboard + disk and chisel + disk treatments significantly produced higher plant dry weight at various developmental stages, head diameter and seed yield. Number of seeds per head, 1000 seed weight, harvest index, and oil yield were non-significantly higher in these treatments. Minimum tillage ranked the lowest for these traits. The results of this experiment indicate that chisel + disk treatment with the partly removed residues might be an appropriate seedbed preparation method in a barley-sunflower double planting under conditions similar to this experiment...|$|E
