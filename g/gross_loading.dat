40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the position of the rearfoot and the distribution of forefoot plantar pressures and skin callosities in rheumatoid arthritis. METHOD: Plantar pressures and callosity patterns were measured in 102 rheumatoid arthritis patients (120 feet with normal heel alignment and 84 feet with valgus heel alignment measured by goniometry) and in 42 (84 feet) age matched healthy adults. Peak pressures (kPa) were measured across the metatarsal heads in-shoe using an FScan system and the distribution of plantar callosities was visually mapped for each foot. RESULTS: Peak pressures were significantly greater at all but the first metatarsal head in the rheumatoid normal heel alignment and healthy adult groups than in the rheumatoid valgus heel group. The feet of both the rheumatoid normal heel group and the healthy adult group behaved the same, the highest peak pressures registering on the central metatarsal heads. However, only in the rheumatoid group were plantar callosities found at these sites. In the rheumatoid valgus heel group, lateral metatarsal heads were frequently non-weightbearing, producing <b>gross</b> <b>loading</b> patterns with a dominant medial distribution. Peak pressures were shifted to the medial fore-foot accompanied by a higher prevalence of callosities. The results, however, failed to establish clearly an association between peak pressures and callus formation. CONCLUSIONS: In rheumatoid arthritis there is an important interrelation between the rearfoot position and forefoot pressure sites...|$|E

40|$|The {{second part}} of a series of tests made in Langley tank no. 2 to {{determine}} the effect of varying design parameters of planing-tail hulls is presented. Results are given to show the effects on resistance characteristics of varying angle of afterbody keel, depth of step, and length of afterbody chine. The effect of varying the <b>gross</b> <b>load</b> is shown for one configuration. The resistance characteristics of planing-tail hulls are compared with those of a conventional flying-boat hull. The forces on the forebody and afterbody of one configuration are compared with the forces on a conventional hull. Increasing the angle of afterbody keel had small effect on hump resistance and no effect on high-speed resistance but increased free-to-trim resistance at intermediate speeds. Increasing the depth of step increased hump resistance, had little effect on high-speed resistance, and increased free-to-trim resistance at intermediate speeds. Omitting the chines on the forward 25 percent of the afterbody had no appreciable effect on resistance. Omitting 70 percent of the chine length had almost no effect on maximum resistance but broadened the hump and increased spray around the afterbody. Load-resistance ratio at the hump decreased more rapidly with increasing load coefficient for the planing-tail hull than for the representative conventional hull, although the load-resistance ratio at the hump was greater for the planing-tail hull than for the conventional hull throughout the range of loads tested. At speeds higher than hump speed, load-resistance ratio for the planing-tail hull was a maximum at a particular <b>gross</b> <b>load</b> and was slightly less at heavier and lighter <b>gross</b> <b>loads.</b> The planing-tail hull was found to have lower resistance than the conventional hull at both the hump and at high speeds, but at intermediate speeds there was little difference. The lower hump resistance of the planing-tail hull was attributed to the ability of the afterbody to carry a greater percentage of the total load while maintaining a higher value of load-resistance ratio...|$|R

Yet the accuracy of <b>gross</b> <b>loaded</b> motor performance and the levels of physical stress induced had not been methodically researched and was therefore investigated in this set of studies. Initially, the levels of truncal stress during the placement and removal of loads to and from a pigeonhole matrix were determined, which showed that truncal stresses were lower when handling {{to and from the}} central area of the matrix and increased significantly when handling loads to and from those boxes around the periphery. The variations in performance as well as truncal stress when handling to and from a pigeonhole matrix were examined in the next section of the work. The results confirmed the previous findings regarding truncal stress variation dependent upon position in the matrix, and also showed that there were significantly fewer placement contact errors in, the central area of the matrix than at the periphery. The placement of the load to the areas of the matrix which resulting in high truncal stress were observed to require the subject to adopt postures which involved shoulder rotation and/or lateral flexion, whilst only changes in truncal inclination and lumbar angle were made when placing loads to the lower stress areas. The effect of reducing inlet clearance between the load and the target box was found to reduce the level of performance, increase task duration, increase overall truncal stress, increase the post task heart rate and reduce both the peak and mean acceleration and the peak and mean force applied to the load. An inlet clearance of 10 cms was found be to critical for task performance. As the load size increased, the level of performance decreased even though the load weight was constant. Lifting and placing rectangular loads with their long axis orientated horizontally was found to result in better performance than when their long axis was orientated vertically.

The approach is based on wheel–rail rolling contact theory, vehicle–track dynamic theory and nonlinear programming theory. The changes in the rail profile were analyzed using an updating strategy that considers random irregularities in the railway track. The minimum average metal loss from the vehicle in terms of wear and grinding for the whole design cycle was regarded as the design objective, and discrete point coordinates on the rail were regarded as the design variables. A radial basis function was used to establish an approximate model, which formed an explicit function between design variables and design objectives.

The spray striking the flaps was not excessive and no appreciable wetting of the tail surfaces was noted.

Possible statistical dependencies among these parameters were evaluated and no substantial dependence was found except between the hourly NOx emission factor and the hourly capacity factor for all units. The relationship between the hourly NOx emission factor and hourly capacity factor was quantified using regression analysis. The residual error of the regression model was used to quantify the variability in hourly NOx emissions that cannot be explained by the capacity factor. Regression models were developed and compared for individual units and for the combined data for groups of units. Three criteria were used to evaluate the adequacy of grouping data. The statistical representation of emissions for the groups of similar units was comparable to that for any individual unit contained within the group to within approximately plus or minus 10 percent. Therefore, it was concluded that it was reasonable to group the data in these cases. For a specific unit, the variability in the hourly NOx emissions that cannot be explained by capacity factor was found to be- 25 to + 35 % at a 95 % confidence level.

40|$|A {{recurring}} question is: "What effects will art {{increase in}} the sizes of tires and axleloads have on pavements? " Concern has mounted {{in regard to the}} so-called "drop-axle " not having dual wheels or proportioned loading. Presently, {{there seems to be a}} trend toward wide tires in lieu of dual wheels. The wide tires first appeared on the front (steering) axle. This trend seemingly represents an attempt to respect the statutory limit of 600 pounds of load per inch of tire width but to violate the axleload or wheel-load limits (KRS 189. 222). Whereas a dual-wheeled, single, rear axle having 10 -inch wide tires would be limited to a <b>gross</b> <b>load</b> of 20, 000 pounds, 600 pounds per inch of tire width would be 24, 000 pounds. A tandem set of axles (8 tires) is limited to a gross of 34, 000 pounds; 600 pounds would be 48, 000 pounds. An advantage is demonstrated clearly when it is shown that a 34, 000 -pound, tandem axle is not any more damaging than a 18, 000 -pound, single axle having dual wheels. A great disadvantage arises when a single axle without duals (such as the steering axle or "drop-axle") is loaded heavily without increasing the width of the tires.

The proposed device makes use of split-type ailerons deflected +/- 60 deg on the outboard wing (left wing in a right spin). Tests made on a model which represented the airplane to a scale of 7 indicated that, if an uncontrollable spin is obtained in the design <b>gross</b> [...] weight <b>loading,</b> the device is not sufficiently effective to insure recovery,...|$|R
