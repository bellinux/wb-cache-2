40|$|Fetal {{heart rate}} (FHR) <b>decelerations</b> are the commonest {{aberrant}} feature on cardiotocograph (CTG) thus having {{a major influence}} on classification ofFHR patterns into the three tier system. The unexplained paradox of early <b>decelerations</b> (head compression — an invariable phenomenon in labor) being extremely rare [1] should prompt a debate about scientific validity of current categorization. This paper demonstrates that there appear to be major fallacies in the pathophysiological hypothesis (cord compression — baroreceptor mechanism) underpinning of vast majority of (variable?) <b>decelerations.</b> Rapid <b>decelerations</b> during contractions with nadir matching peak of contractions are consistent with “pure” vagal reflex (head compression) rather than result of fetal blood pressure or oxygenation changes from cord compression. Hence, many American authors have reported that the abrupt FHR <b>decelerations</b> attributed to cord compression are actually due to head compression [2 - 6]. The paper debates if there are major fundamental fallacies in current categorization of FHR <b>decelerations</b> based concomitantly on rate of descent (reflecting putative aetiology?) and time relationship to contractions. <b>Decelerations</b> with consistently early timing (constituting majority) seem to get classed as “variable” because of rapid descent. A distorted unscientific categorization of FHR <b>decelerations</b> could lead to clinically unhelpful three tier classification system. Hence, the current unphysiological classification needs a fresh debate with consideration of alternative models and re-evaluation of clinical studies to test these. Open debate improves patient care and safety. The clue to benign reflex versus hypoxic nature of <b>decelerations</b> seems to be in the timing rather than the rate of descent. Although the likelihood of fetal hypxemia is related to depth and duration ofFHRdecelerations, the cut-offs are likely to be different for early/late/variable <b>decelerations</b> {{and it seems to be}} of paramount importance to get this discrimination right for useful visual or computerized system of CTG interpretation. </p...|$|R

In 1998, the <b>deceleration</b> parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of the Hubble Constant is increasing over time.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of growth <b>decelerations</b> in children was studied {{in more than}} 16 000 two-to-four-month time intervals, ending at ages 6 through 59 months, during a multi-round survey in Kasongo. <b>Decelerations</b> were measured as changes in standard deviation scores which were compared with international and local weight-for-age, weight-for-height, arm-circumference-for-age and arm-circumference-for-height reference data. <b>Decelerations</b> were strikingly frequent, particularly at younger ages. An important number of <b>decelerations</b> was related to infection with measles which provokes initial wasting; later, recuperation was partly through increase of weight and arm circumference, and partly through delayed stunting. The measurement of growth <b>decelerations</b> has the advantage over isolated weight-for-age or arm-circumference-for-age measurements in {{that the impact of}} age-dependency-induced errors is largely eliminated.

In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury.

Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis include computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{interchanges}} {{were built}} along the turnpike, {{most of which}} were trumpet interchanges where all ramps merge at the toll booths; only the New Stanton, Carlisle and Middlesex interchanges did not follow this design. Lighting was installed approaching interchanges, along with acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> lanes. The road also featured guardrails, consisting of steel panels attached to I-beams. Large exit signs were used, and road signs had cat's-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night; billboards were prohibited. In September 1940, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that trucks and buses would be allowed to use the highway.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or <b>deceleration</b> of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the path of a projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E

5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or <b>deceleration</b> of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or <b>deceleration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{load borne}} by the two wheels varies not only with center of mass {{location}}, which in turn varies with the amount and location of passengers and luggage, but also with acceleration and <b>deceleration.</b> This phenomenon is known as load transfer or weight transfer, depending on the author, and provides challenges and opportunities to both riders and designers. For example, motorcycle racers {{can use it to}} increase the friction available to the front tire when cornering, and attempts to reduce front suspension compression during heavy braking has spawned several motorcycle fork designs.|$|E

40|$|During visual {{pursuit of}} a moving target, {{expected}} changes in its trajectory often evoke anticipatory smooth pursuit responses. In the present study, we investigated characteristics of anticipatory smooth pursuit <b>decelerations</b> before a change {{or the end of}} a target trajectory. Healthy humans had to pursue with the eyes a target moving along a circular path that predictably or unpredictably reversed direction and then retraced its movement back to the starting position. We found that anticipatory eye <b>decelerations</b> were often evoked in temporal expectation of target reversal and {{of the end of the}} trajectory. The latency of anticipatory <b>decelerations</b> initiated before target reversal was variable, had poor temporal accuracy and depended on the history of previous trials. Anticipations of the end of the trajectory were more accurate, more precise and were not influenced by previous trials. In this case, subjects probably based their estimate of the end of the trajectory on the duration just experienced before target motion reversal. These results suggest that anticipatory eye <b>decelerations</b> are based on the characteristics of the current or preceding trials depending on the most reliable information available...|$|R

5|$|The meteoroid's {{absolute}} magnitude (the apparent magnitude {{it would have}} {{at an altitude of}} 100km at the observer's zenith) was approximately−6 and did not vary significantly during the few seconds of observation. It traveled a distance of 409km in 9.8seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the <b>deceleration</b> caused by the friction of the atmosphere reached only 1.7m/s2 at the fireball's perigee (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D.W.Olson, R.L.Doescher and K.M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the <b>deceleration</b> was less than 0.5m/s2 except for a few seconds near perigee. This small loss of speed, 12m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's velocity vector due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see Orbit).|$|E
5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, tidal <b>deceleration</b> causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E
