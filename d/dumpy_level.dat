60|$|This van, driven {{and owned}} by Mrs. Dollery, was rather a movable {{attachment}} of the roadway than an extraneous object, {{to those who}} knew it well. The old horse, whose hair was of the roughness and color of heather, whose leg-joints, shoulders, and hoofs were distorted by harness and drudgery from colthood--though if all had their rights, he ought, symmetrical in outline, to have been picking the herbage of some Eastern plain instead of tugging here--had trodden this road almost daily for twenty years. Even his subjection was not made congruous throughout, for the harness being too short, his tail was not drawn through the crupper, so that the breeching slipped awkwardly to one side. He knew every subtle incline of the seven or eight miles of ground between Hintock and Sherton Abbas--the market-town to which he journeyed--as accurately as any surveyor could have learned it by a <b>Dumpy</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

50|$|The term <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> endures {{despite the}} {{evolution}} in design.A <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> is an older-style instrument that requires skill to set accurately. The instrument requires {{to be set}} level (see spirit level) in each quadrant to ensure it is accurate through a full 360° traverse.

50|$|A {{variation}} on the dumpy and one that was often used by surveyors, where greater accuracy and error checking was required, is a tilting level. This instrument allows the telescope to be effectively flipped through 180°, without rotating the head. The telescope is hinged {{to one side of}} the instrument's axis; flipping it involves lifting to the other side of the central axis (thereby inverting the telescope). This action effectively cancels out any errors introduced by poor setup procedure or errors in the instrument's adjustment. As an example, the identical effect can be had with a standard builder's level by rotating it through 180° and comparing the difference between spirit level bubble positions.An automatic level, self-levelling level, or builder's auto level includes an internal compensator mechanism (a swinging prism) that, when set close to level, automatically removes any remaining variation. This reduces the need to set the instrument truly level, as with a <b>dumpy</b> or tilting <b>level.</b> Self-levelling instruments are the preferred instrument on building sites, construction, and during surveying due to ease of use and rapid setup time.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dumpy</b> <b>level,</b> builder's auto level, {{leveling}} instrument, or {{automatic level}} is an optical instrument {{used to establish}} or verify points in the same horizontal plane. It is used in surveying and building with a vertical staff to measure height differences and to transfer, measure and set heights.|$|E
50|$|In 1832, English civil {{engineer}} William Gravatt, {{who had worked}} with Marc Isambard Brunel and his son Isambard on the Thames Tunnel, was commissioned by Mr. H.R. Palmer to examine a scheme for the South Eastern Railway's route from London to Dover. Forced to use the then conventional Y level during the work, Gravatt devised the more transportable and easier to use <b>dumpy</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
50|$|A digital {{electronic}} level is also set level {{on a tripod}} and reads a bar-coded staff using electronic laser methods. The height of the staff where the level beam crosses the staff is shown on a digital display. This type of level removes interpolation of graduation by a person, thus removing a source of error and increasing accuracy. During night time, the <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> is {{used in conjunction with}} an auto cross laser for accurate scale readings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> was {{developed}} by English civil engineer William Gravatt, while surveying the route of a proposed railway line from London to Dover. More compact and hence both more robust and easier to transport, it is commonly believed that dumpy levelling is less accurate than other types of levelling, but such is not the case. Dumpy levelling requires shorter and therefore more numerous sights, but this fault is compensated by the practice of making foresights and backsights equal.|$|E
50|$|Being a {{surveyor}} was not easy. The {{hours were}} long the {{time away from}} civilization was longer and the elements were unforgiving. A survey party generally consisted of up to 20 members which would include a party chief, chain men, a cook, people to saw trees, a recorder and people to turn angles. All travel was either on horseback or by foot. To begin surveying a party chief would have to buy approximately $400 worth of instruments. These instruments included an alidade, <b>dumpy</b> <b>level,</b> theodolite, Gunter's chain (which {{was replaced by a}} steel tape) and a solar compass or a vernier compass.|$|E

5000|$|Multi-context Plans {{as opposed}} to single context plans can be made of {{complete}} sites, trenches or individual features. In the United Kingdom, {{the scale of the}} plans is usually 1:20. They are linked to the site recording system by the inclusion of known grid points and height readings, taken with a <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> or a total station (see surveying). Excavation of a site by the removal of human made deposits in the reverse order they were created is the preferred method of excavation and is referred to as stratigraphic area excavation [...] "in plan" [...] {{as opposed to}} excavation [...] "in section". Plan and section drawings have an interpretive function as well as being part of the recording system, because the draughts-person makes conscious decisions about what should be included or emphasised.|$|E
5000|$|Tilting level, <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> or {{automatic}} level [...] are terms {{used to refer}} to types of leveling instruments as used in surveying to measure height differences over larger distances. It has a spirit level mounted on a telescope (perhaps 30 power) with cross-hairs, itself mounted on a tripod. The observer reads height values off two graduated vertical rods, one 'behind' and one 'in front', to obtain the height difference between the ground points on which the rods are resting. Starting from a point with a known elevation and going cross country (successive points being perhaps 100 m apart) height differences can be measured cumulatively over long distances and elevations can be calculated. Precise levelling is supposed to give the difference in elevation between two points 1 km apart correct to within a few millimeters.|$|E
5000|$|Apprenticed as a {{mechanical}} engineer in London from aged 15, after interview he worked with Sir Marc Isambard Brunel on the Thames Tunnel, and then designed bridges for the Calder and Hebble Navigation. Whilst surveying the route for the South Eastern Railway to Dover, he devised the more transportable <b>dumpy</b> <b>level,</b> which is now universally employed. He then supervised the northern engineering team under Isambard Kingdom Brunel on the Bristol and Exeter Railway, where the deployment of his [...] "curve of sines" [...] theorem speeded construction. Dismissed from the project in 1841, after losing money during the railway mania period, Gravatt helped to construct both the Craig telescope {{and a copy of}} the Difference machine, distinguishing himself in a number of papers submitted to the Institute of Civil Engineers. He died after being accidentally poisoned by an over dose of morphine by his nurse.|$|E
5000|$|The canal {{featured}} {{a number of}} innovations, and {{was referred to as}} an example for later engineering projects. The use of hydraulic cement to mortar the locks is the first known use of the material in North America. The route was surveyed using a Wye level (an early version of a <b>dumpy</b> <b>level),</b> again the first recorded use in America. At North Billerica, where the canal met the Concord River at the mill pond, a floating towpath was devised to handle the needs of crossing traffic patterns. Many early civil engineers, including several of Loammi Baldwin's sons, learned their trade working on the canal, and eventually educated a whole generation of engineers. Baldwin's son Loammi Jr., who worked on the canal, is recognized as the [...] "Father of Civil Engineering in America" [...] for his role in leading civil engineering projects and in educating a whole generation of civil engineers in the discipline.|$|E
5000|$|Single context {{recording}} {{was developed}} in the 1970s by the museum of London (as well as earlier in Winchester and York) and has become the de facto recording system {{in many parts of the}} world and is especially suited to the complexities of deep urban archaeology and the process of Stratification.Each excavated context is given a unique [...] "context number" [...] and is recorded by type on a context sheet and perhaps being drawn on a plan and/or a section. Depending on time constraints and importance contexts may also be photographed, but in this case a grouping of contexts and their associations are the purpose of the photography. Finds from each context are bagged and labeled with their context number and site code for later cross reference work carried out post-excavation. The height above sea level of pertinent points on a context, such as the top and bottom of a wall are taken and added to plans sections and context sheets. Heights are recorded with a <b>dumpy</b> <b>level</b> or total station by relation to the site [...] temporary benchmark (abbr. T.B.M).

40|$|Present {{study is}} on the interdependent nature of {{hydraulic}} parameters and morphometric variables of a bedrock river. In this study, using <b>dumpy</b> <b>level,</b> GPS, satellite images and some mathematical equations a data set on hydraulics and morphometric variables of a bedrock channel, named Bhatajhor, of eastern India was generated. That data set was used to (1) find out impulse-response relations between hydraulic variables (2) find out relations between morphometric variables and (3) find out relations between hydraulic and morphometric variables. Seven equations (5 – 11) were formulated based on this empirical study to the end. The seven empirical relations, most of which include only two variables, involve channel cross-section dimensions (area, width, mean depth, maximum depth, width/ depth ratio, hydraulic radius), slope and hydraulic variables (velocity, kinetic energy, stream power, Manning’s n factor, Chezy’s C factor and shear stress). Observation shows relatively higher coefficient of determination (R 2) between variables like velocity and Manning’s n factor (0. 67), velocity and Chezy’s C factor (0. 67), slope and τ (0. 89), w/d ratio and hydraulic radius (0. 53), slope and w/d ratio (0. 50) ...|$|E
