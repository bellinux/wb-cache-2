40|$|Metal <b>halide</b> perovskites {{have been}} brought to the {{forefront}} of research focus in solution-processable photovoltaics, with the device efficiency swiftly surging to over 22 % over the past few years. The state-of-the-art metal <b>halide</b> perovskites that have been intensively investigated include toxic lead, which potentially hampers their commercialization process. To address this toxicity issue, intensive recent research effort has been devoted to developing low-toxic metal <b>halide</b> perovskites and their derivatives for photovoltaic applications.

5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium <b>halides</b> change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many <b>halides</b> have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{works best}} for forming asymmetrical products if the <b>halide</b> reactants are somehow separate in their relative chemical reactivities.
