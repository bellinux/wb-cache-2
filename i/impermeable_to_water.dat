5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> and the main {{interface}} between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E

25|$|Gas vacuoles are membrane-bound, {{spindle-shaped}} vesicles, {{found in}} some planktonic bacteria and Cyanobacteria, that provides buoyancy to these cells by decreasing their overall cell density. Positive buoyancy is {{needed to keep the}} cells in {{the upper reaches of the}} water column, so that they can continue to perform photosynthesis. They are made up of a shell of protein that has a highly hydrophobic inner surface, making it <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> (and stopping water vapour from condensing inside) but permeable to most gases. Because the gas vesicle is a hollow cylinder, it is liable to collapse when the surrounding pressure increases. Natural selection has fine tuned the structure of the gas vesicle to maximise its resistance to buckling, including an external strengthening protein, GvpC, rather like the green thread in a braided hosepipe. There is a simple relationship between the diameter of the gas vesicle and pressure at which it will collapse - the wider the gas vesicle the weaker it becomes. However, wider gas vesicles are more efficient, providing more buoyancy per unit of protein than narrow gas vesicles. Different species produce gas vesicle of different diameter, allowing them to colonise different depths of the water column (fast growing, highly competitive species with wide gas vesicles in the top most layers; slow growing, dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers). The diameter of the gas vesicle will also help determine which species survive in different bodies of water. Deep lakes that experience winter mixing expose the cells to the hydrostatic pressure generated by the full water column. This will select for species with narrower, stronger gas vesicles.|$|E

50|$|The {{epidermis}} is {{the outer}} layer of cells covering the leaf. It {{is covered with}} a waxy cuticle which is <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> liquid <b>water</b> and water vapor and forms the boundary separating the plant's inner cells from the external world. The cuticle is in some cases thinner on the lower epidermis than on the upper epidermis, and is generally thicker on leaves from dry climates as compared with those from wet climates. The epidermis serves several functions: protection against water loss by way of transpiration, regulation of gas exchange and secretion of metabolic compounds. Most leaves show dorsoventral anatomy: The upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions.|$|R

40|$|Dehumidification is {{responsible}} for {{a large part of}} the energy consumption in cooling systems in high humidity environments worldwide. Improving efficiency is therefore essential. Liquid desiccants offer a promising solution for dehumidification, as desired levels of humidity removal could be easily regulated. The use of membrane contactors in combination with liquid desiccant is attractive for dehumidification because they prevent direct contact between the humid air and the desiccant, removing both the potential for desiccant carryover to the air and the potential for contamination of the liquid desiccant by dust and other airborne materials, as well as minimizing corrosion. However, the expected additional mass transport barrier of the membrane surface can lower the expected desiccation rate per unit of desiccant surface area. In this context, hollow fiber membranes present an attractive option for membrane liquid desiccant contactors because of their high surface area per unit volume. We demonstrate in this work the performance of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based triple-bore hollow fiber membranes as liquid desiccant contactors, which are permeable <b>to</b> <b>water</b> vapor but <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> liquid <b>water,</b> for dehumidification of hot and humid air...|$|R
50|$|Cistaceae {{have also}} optimally {{adapted to the}} {{wildfires}} that frequently eradicate large areas of forest. The plants cast their seeds in the soil during the growth period, {{but they do not}} germinate in the next season. Their hard coating is <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>water,</b> and thus the seeds remain dormant {{for a long period of}} time. This coating together with their small size allows these plants to establish a large seed bank rather deep in the soil. Once the fire comes and kills the vegetation in the area, the seed coating softens or cracks as a result of the heating, and the surviving seeds germinate shortly after the fire. This mechanism allows the Cistaceae to produce a large number of young shoots simultaneously and at the right time, and thus to obtain an important advantage over other plants in the process of repopulating the area.|$|R

40|$|GRAY showed (1932) {{that the}} "vitelline {{membrane}} " of the trout's egg is normally <b>impermeable</b> both <b>to</b> <b>water</b> and salts, while the tough "chorion " is freely permeable.

5000|$|Sclerenchyma is Greek word where [...] "Sclrenes" [...] means {{hard and}} [...] "chyma" [...] means infusion. This tissue {{consists}} of thick-walled, dead cells.

40|$|Plant cell {{walls are}} {{dramatically}} affected by suberin deposition, becoming an <b>impermeable</b> barrier <b>to</b> <b>water</b> and pathogens. Suberin {{is a complex}} layered heteropolymer that comprises both a poly(aliphatic) and a poly(aromatic) lignin-like domain. Current structural models for suberin attribute the crosslinking of aliphatic and aromatic domains within the typical lamellar ultrastructure of the polymer to esterified ferulate. BAHD feruloyl transferases involved in suberin biosynthesis have been recently characterized in Arabidopsis and potato (Solanum tuberosum). In defective mutants, suberin, even lacks most of the esterified ferulate, but maintains the typical lamellar ultrastructure. However, suberized tissues display increased water permeability, in spite of exhibiting a similar lipid load to wild type. Therefore, the role of ferulate in suberin needs to be reconsidered. Moreover, silencing the feruloyl transferase in potato turns the typical smooth skin of cv. Desirée into a rough scabbed skin distinctive of Russet varieties and impairs the normal skin maturation that confers resistance to skinning. Concomitantly to these changes, the skin of silenced potatoes shows an altered profile of soluble phenolics {{with the emergence of}} conjugated polyamines...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the {{invertebrates}} groups mentioned so far, {{insects are}} usually terrestrial, and exchange gases across a moist surface in {{direct contact with}} the atmosphere, rather than in contact with surrounding water. The insect's exoskeleton is <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> gases, including <b>water</b> vapor, so they have a more specialised gas exchange system, requiring gases to be directly transported to the tissues via a complex network of tubes. This respiratory system is separated from their circulatory system. Gases enter and leave the body through openings called spiracles, located laterally along the thorax and abdomen. Similar to plants, insects are able to control the opening and closing of these spiracles, but instead of relying on turgor pressure, they rely on muscle contractions. These contractions result in an insect's abdomen being pumped in and out. The spiracles are connected to tubes called tracheae, which branch repeatedly and ramify into the insect's body. These branches terminate in specialised tracheole cells which provides a thin, moist surface for efficient gas exchange, directly with cells.|$|R

40|$|When two aqueous {{solutions}} of unequal {{osmotic pressure}} are sepa-rated by a membrane permeable <b>to</b> <b>water</b> but relatively <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> the solutes, <b>water</b> tends <b>to</b> diffuse from the solution in which its con-centration is higher {{to that in}} which it is lower, until the difference in osmotic pressure is equalized. Such a system is known as an osmotic system. We are here concerned with the questions: Is the exchange of water between the cell and its environment subject to the laws of osmosis and of diffusion? Are the changes in the volume of the cell, which can be brought about by changing the external concentration of its medium, governed by the laws of osmotic equilibrium? Can the rate at which such changes take place be predicted from the laws of diffusion? The answer to these questions will be considered in the first and second section of this review. The third section will be devoted to an inti-mately related subject-the permeability of the cell <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> that is <b>to</b> say, the relative ease with which water enters or leaves the cell under the driving force of osmotic pressure. That the living cell does, in fact, behave as an osmotic system, is the view held by the great majority of observers today. This view implies that the cell acts as if it possesses a semipermeable membrane; i. e., a protoplasmic layer, which, in general while permeable <b>to</b> <b>water,</b> is more or less <b>impermeable</b> <b>to</b> many dissolved substances; also, that transfer of water between the cell and an anisotonic medium depends chiefly on the difference in osmotic pressure between cell contents and medium, and follows the laws of osmosis and diffusion. The contrary view, held by a minority, is that the cell possesses no semipermeable membrane and that swelling of cells in hypotonic solu-tions is due chiefly <b>to</b> imbibition of <b>water</b> by cell colloids. The present review will not attempt to decide between these opposing views in the case of all types of cells. The writers are prepared t...|$|R
