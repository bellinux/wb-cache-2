The effectiveness of the IRCM {{is determined by the}} ratio of jamming intensity to the target (or signal) intensity. This ratio is usually called the J/S ratio.

40|$|The {{auditory}} impression of sound sources is {{strongly influenced by}} the room, which, e. g., determines the apparent source width. What is more, typical sources are not omnidirectional, which also makes their orientation a strong influence. This influence, however, has only been investigated a little, although it can even change the perceived location of the source. To provide more insight, we performed extensive listening experiments inside our anechoic laboratory that {{is equipped with a}} 24 -channel loudspeaker playback to simulate both the <b>directional</b> <b>source</b> and the room. The <b>directional</b> <b>source</b> is described by two frequency-independent 3 rd order directivity designs in 36 different orientations, and the room is simulated by the two-dimensional 1 st and 2 nd order image source method.

40|$|Wave field {{synthesis}} (WFS) is {{a spatial}} audio reproduction technique that uses arrays of loudspeakers {{for the physical}} creation of the sound field of a virtual source. Besides basic source types such as monopoles, the reproduction of virtual sources with angle- And frequency-dependent directivity characteristics attracts increasing interest. While several synthesis approaches for <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> have been proposed in recent years, the corresponding audio signal processing has not been considered so far. However, since <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> typically require a nontrivial filtering operation for each combination of a virtual source and a loudspeaker, straightforward implementation creates major complexity and scalability problems. This paper proposes an efficient processing structure for rendering <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> using time-frequency signal processing. Integrating {{the building blocks of}} a fast convolution method into the WFS rendering algorithm enables the reuse of transform operations, resulting in significant complexity reductions. In this way, this paper demonstrates the advantages of time-frequency processing for a given rendering application by exploiting the performance characteristics of signal processing operations in the two domains.

40|$|Marine seismic source arrays are <b>directional.</b> <b>Source</b> {{directivity}} is used {{to attenuate}} coherent noise, but primary reflected data may be degraded. Source directivity is ignored in a standard processing sequence, so <b>directional</b> <b>source</b> signature deconvolution may be required. In the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) directional deconvolution method, a filter is calculated from far-field source signatures and {{is applied to the}} f-k transform of common-receiver gathers. Reflections on common-receiver gathers are often spatially aliased, and this causes practical problems with the technique. Directional deconvolution may also be performed in combination with prestack migration because the prestack Kirchhoff summation migration operator is a function of source take-off angle. The constant-offset section is deconvolved separately with a full range of filters for source signatures radiated in different directions; then the migration summation operator sums across the deconvolved sections, selecting the section which has been deconvolved for the correct source signature at each point. Physical model data, which were acquired over simple models using a <b>directional</b> <b>source,</b> are used to evaluate directional deconvolution assuming constant velocity. Reflector continuity and resolution are improved by using directional deconvolution. Directional deconvolution combined with prestack migration is extended to media in which the velocity varies with depth, and is applied to two datasets from the Southern North Sea. The second dataset, which has shallow steeply dipping reflectors, is improved by using directional deconvolution. Directional deconvolution may be combined with a Kirchhoff migration technique which assumes a linear velocity-depth model. Results are superior to conventional Kirchhoff migration because ray bending is honoured. Directional deconvolution cannot synthesise fully point-source equivalent data from data acquired with a source array without excessive noise amplification. Source arrays with a short in-line dimension should be used where possible. For data which have been acquired with a long source array, directional deconvolution is desirable...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for estimating lighting sources from a single image of a scene that is illuminated by near point light <b>sources,</b> <b>directional</b> light <b>sources</b> and ambi-ent light. We propose to employ a pair of reference spheres as light probes and introduce the difference sphere that we acquire by differencing the intensities of two image regions of the reference spheres. Since the effect by <b>directional</b> light <b>sources</b> and ambient light is eliminated by differencing, the key advantage of considering the difference sphere is that it enables us to estimate near point light sources including their radiance, which {{has been difficult to}} achieve in previ-ous efforts where only distant <b>directional</b> light <b>sources</b> were assumed. We also show that analysis of gray level contours on spherical surfaces facilitates separate identification of multiple combined light sources and is well suited to the dif-ference sphere. Once we estimate point light sources with the difference sphere, we update the input image by elim-inating their influence and then estimate other remaining light <b>sources,</b> that is, <b>directional</b> light <b>sources</b> and ambient light.

30|$|An azimuth {{steerable}} first-order superdirectional microphone response can {{be constructed}} by a linear combination of three eigenbeams: a monopole and two orthogonal dipoles. Although the response of a (rotation symmetric) first-order response can only exhibit a single null, {{we will look at}} a slice through this beampattern lying in the azimuthal plane. In this way, we can define maximally two nulls in the azimuthal plane which are symmetric with respect to the main-lobe axis. By placing these two nulls on maximally two <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> to be rejected and compensating for the drop in level for the desired direction, we can effectively reject these <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> without attenuating the desired source. We present an adaptive null-steering scheme for adjusting the beampattern so as to obtain this suppression of the two directional interferers automatically. Closed-form expressions for this optimal null-steering are derived, enabling the computation of the azimuthal angles of the interferers. It is shown that the proposed technique has a good directivity index when the angular difference between the desired <b>source</b> and each <b>directional</b> interferer is at least 90 degrees.|$|R

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 2, in a DMN scenario, the subset of microphone pairs that capture direct soundwaves emitted by a source is more useful for localization purposes. The microphones {{placed at the}} back of a <b>directional</b> <b>source</b> receive mainly reflections, and hence, do not provide a reliable contribution to deduce the location of sound emission. In the given DMN configuration, if two sources are frontal to separate subsets of microphone pairs, the weak source may result quite evident even without de-emphasis. However, ghost peaks can be generated as outlined in Section 2. These phenomena depend on the relative positions and orientations of the sources with respect to the sensors and a reliable model is hardly achievable due to its complexity and variability.|$|E

40|$|In {{binaural}} hearing aids, several beamforming algorithms can be used. These beamformers aim {{to enhance the}} target speech signal and preserve the binaural cues of the target source (e. g. with constraints on the target). However, the binaural cues of the other <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> as well the background noise are often lost after processing. This affects the global impression of the acoustic scene, and it limits the perceptual separation of the sources by the hearing aids users. To help the hearing aids users to localize all the sound sources, {{it is important to}} keep the binaural cues of all <b>directional</b> <b>sources</b> and the background noise. Therefore, this work is devoted to find the best trade-off between the noise/interferers reduction and the cues preservations not only for the directional interferers but also for the background noise based on selection and mixing processes.
