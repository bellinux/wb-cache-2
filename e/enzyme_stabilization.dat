40|$|Optical glucose biosensors {{are being}} {{developed}} for long-term monitoring in diabetic individuals. These sensors rely upon the enzyme glucose oxidase, and loss of enzymatic activity leads to a need for frequent recalibration and eventually sensor replacement. Current <b>enzyme</b> <b>stabilization</b> strategies are effective, but generally result in a large increase in size and exclusion from the solution-phase. This sacrifice of native properties precludes the stabilized enzyme from incorporation into the aforementioned sensing platform, which requires that the enzyme be homogenously distributed and entrapped within a hydrogel. It is this incompatibility which provides the motivation {{for the development of}} new non-traditional <b>enzyme</b> <b>stabilization</b> strategies. Toward that end, this work focuses on the development and characterization of three enzyme modification strategies, all of which are intended to stabilize enzyme activity while permitting incorporation into an optical biosensing hydrogel. The first approach involves glycosylation site-targeted covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) to glucose oxidase, which improves storage stability by 60 %. The second approach builds upon the first, but subsequent modification of the poly(ethylene glycol) -modified glucose oxidase is performed to further stabilize the enzyme. This approach improves long-term storage stability by an order of magnitude. The final approach involves encasement of the glycoenzyme within a shell of albumin, wherein the inert protein is attached at the glycosylation sites in an orthogonal manner. This technique result in highly thermostable enzyme, retaining greater than 25 times more activity than native glucose oxidase following exposure to buffer at 60 ?C. In summary, enzyme deactivation {{is expected to be a}} major barrier in the realization of long-term glucose sensing with fully implantable optical glucose biosensors, and this work represents a step towards overcoming that hurdle. Each enzyme modification strategy yields a stabilized enzyme under certain conditions, whether it be long-term storage, elevated temperature, or exposure to various solvents/additives. This work enables the stabilized enzymes to be incorporated into hydrogels for evaluation under simulated in vivo conditions, followed by in vivo evaluation. Finally, it is expected that these <b>enzyme</b> <b>stabilization</b> approaches will be advantageous in other applications as well, including in vitro diagnostics, tissue engineering, and therapeutic biologicals...|$|E

The research aims to produce a validated assessment tool which can be used to predict strength enhancement within a generalized statistical framework. The objective of the present study is to identify new materials for developing the assessment tool which supports enzyme based stabilization, as well as to identify the correct construction sequence for such new materials. A series of characterization tests were conducted on several soil types obtained from proposed construction sites.

The relative distances among all enzyme residues involved in immobilization has to remain unaltered during any conformational change induced by any distorting agent.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{begins with}} {{a brief review of}} {{theories}} and concepts that have influenced today’s view of <b>enzyme</b> catalysis: transition-state <b>stabilization,</b> entropy, orbital steering, proximity, and intramolecularity. The discussion then launches into the “spatiotemporal” model of enzyme catalysis in which fast intramolecular and enzymatic rates are ascribed to short distances that are imposed rigidly upon the reacting entities. An equation relating rate and distance is set forth, as are experimental and computational data supporting this rela-tionship. Finally, enzyme systems themselves are analyzed in terms of the distance parame-ter and the so-called “split-site ” model in which ground-state geometries play a crucial role. Among the many surprising conclusions is a transition-state stabilization by noncovalent forces (e. g., hydrogen-bonding) that are positioned far away from the actual transition-state chemistry. The model also confronts and dismisses the claim in classical enzymology that the ubiquitous enzyme-substrate complex is either inconsequential or inhibitory to the overall re-action rate...|$|R

Land plants even enlarged this spectrum of K+ utilization after having gone ashore, {{despite the fact that}} K+ is far less available in their new oligotrophic habitats than in sea water. Inevitably, plant cells had to improve and to develop unique transport systems for K+ accumulation and distribution. In the past two decades a manifold of K+ transporters from flowering plants has been identified at the molecular level. The recently published genome of the fern ally Selaginella moellendorffii now helps in providing a better understanding on the molecular changes involved in the colonization of land and the development of the vasculature and the seeds. In this article we present an inventory of K+ transporters of this lycophyte and pigeonhole them together with their relatives from the moss Physcomitrella patens, the monocotyledon Oryza sativa, and two dicotyledonous species, the herbaceous plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the tree Populus trichocarpa. Interestingly, the transition of green plants from an aqueous to a dry environment coincides with a dramatic reduction in the diversity of voltage-gated potassium channels followed by a diversification on the basis of one surviving K+ channel class. The first appearance of K+ release (Kout) channels in S. moellendorffii that were shown in Arabidopsis to be involved in xylem loading and guard cell closure coincides with the specialization of vascular plants and may indicate an important adaptive step...|$|R
40|$|Cupuaçu (Theobroma grandiflorum) is an Amazonian {{fruit with}} a {{pleasant}} aroma and flavor, {{which offers a}} great economic potential. Purée of cupuaçu pulp was pasteurized (70 and 90 °C), and stored for half a year at 18 and 38 °C. The pasteurization was effective in microbial and <b>enzyme</b> inactivation, and <b>stabilization</b> of the purée. Peroxidase enzyme was inactivated (polyphenoloxidase was not de tected in raw cupuaçu), some cupuaçu 'fresh notes' were lost, and the color changed slightly during pasteurization at both temperatures. Since, except for color, no significant quality differences were detected between samples processed at 70 °C and 90 °C, the pasteurization at 90 °C is recommended. The parameters that changed most during storage were the color, flavor, aroma and sugars. The purée got darker, especially at 38 °C, and the non-reducing sugars were converted into reducing sugars, while the total sugars remained constant. The final quality {{was determined by the}} storage tempera ture and not by the pasteurization temperature. The total color difference, TCD*, was well modeled by first-order reversible kinetics...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{systematic}} attempt to understand the roles of non-compatible osmolytes, i. e. solutes that have inhibitory effects on <b>enzymes,</b> in the <b>stabilization</b> of proteins against denaturing stress. Thermal denaturation of RNase A, holo-alpha-lactalbumin, apo-alpha-lactalbumin, lysozyme and metmyoglobin in the absence and presence of various concentrations of free basic amino acids was studied by observing changes in the absorption coefficients of these proteins. It has been observed that arginine and histidine destabilize all proteins {{in terms of the}} midpoint of the transition curve and Gibbs energy change on denaturation. Study of the heat-induced denaturation of the proteins in the presence of various concentrations of arginine at different pH values demonstrated that arginine binds to the denatured molecules. In contrast with the effect of arginine and histidine on protein stability, it was observed that the effect of lysine on proteins stability is unpredictable, i. e. it may have a stabilizing effect, no effect or a destabilizing effect on proteins during denaturing stress. The results of this study are considered from an evolutionary perspective...|$|R
