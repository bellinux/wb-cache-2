40|$|A basic coaxial mass driver {{has been}} {{constructed}} {{by a group}} of students to verify performance predictions in the acceleration range envisaged for the first lunar device. The bucket is guided by four copper tubes which also supply direct current excitation for its single aluminum coil, and is accelerated by twenty coaxial coils along a 2 m track, followed by a <b>deceleration</b> <b>section.</b> The coils are individually energized by electrolytic photoflash capacitors triggered by solid state switches on the basis of bucket position...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a concept}} for a ground-based flight-test facility, a large aeroballistic range capable of launching models {{large enough to}} permit the installation of significant amounts of onboard instrumentation. The large model size would also provide thick shock/boundary layers, thus providing the opportunity to measure flow-field properties via advanced offboard diagnostics. Current fabrication technology should permit {{the construction of a}} two-stage light-gas gun capable of accelerating 20 to 25 cm diameter models to velocities on the order of 6 km/sec. An electromagnetic launcher or a ram accelerator is considered as a potential means for achieving larger model sizes and/or greater launch velocities. Possible methods for obtaining and recording data are discussed as are the test chamber and model <b>deceleration</b> <b>section</b> requirements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRamp is an {{important}} part of the interchange. The ramp design concept based on the running speed is a new design idea of the highway and interchange. By analysis of the influence factors of the interchange ramp running speed, this paper formulates the orthogonal experiment, and collects 14 ramps, in total of 147 groups of the running speed as the samples, and then analyzes the characteristics of the running speed of the vehicles on interchange ramp. According to the change trend of the running speed, the ramp is divided into three sections: <b>deceleration</b> <b>section,</b> uniform section, acceleration section. This paper mainly analyzes the relationship between the interchange ramp running speed of the three sections and the influence factors; and then this paper builds the interchange ramp running speed prediction model of the three sections. At last, correlation test will be validated, and verify the applicability of the model...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the Princeton-M. I. T. second mass-driver is presented. Mass-Driver Two is a 13. 1 cm caliber system which uses a two coil superconducting bucket and a two-phase in quadrature drive system. Discrete drive coils are individually energized with timing supplied by position-sensing optical detectors. Intermediate energy storage is provided by sector capacitors which are recharged every half cycle by an external power source. A vacuum environment is provided for the superconducting bucket by a 4 inch ID glass pipe with the drive coils surrounding it. Magnetic flight is generated by eddy current repulsion from six copper guide strips lining the glass pipe. The length is 2. 5 meters equally divided between acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>sections.</b> Nominal acceleration is 5000 m/sec per sec giving a maximum bucket velocity of 112 m/sec. Regenerative braking is used to decelerate the bucket. Current densities of 25 sq cm are achieved in the superconducting bucket coils and are maintained by a cryogenic service station...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{most of the}} {{existing}} highway capacity manuals, level of service (LOS) of freeway weaving segments and ramp junctions is traditionally defined by the speed, volume or density in critical areas of merge, diverge and weaving manoeuvres. In that traditional concept several capacity values of different critical areas (merge, diverge, weaving) as well as upstream and downstream basic freeway segments within the influence areas are evaluated separately. In this paper, a new model which considers the total segment of freeway merge, diverge, and weaving as an entire object is introduced. A combined volume-tocapacity ratio is used for defining the LOS of the total segment. According to the probability and queuing theory, the volume-tocapacity ratio of the whole segment {{can be considered as}} a combination of volume-to-capacity ratios in the different critical areas under consideration. The parameters of the new model can be calibrated with field data. Those parameters are functions of the number of lanes on the freeways, the number of lanes in the on-ramps or off-ramps, the length of the acceleration, <b>deceleration,</b> or weaving <b>sections.</b> Varying the model parameters the function can be fitted to {{the existing}} capacity models for different types of weaving segments or ramp junctions. With this model, the traffic quality (LOS) can be obtained directly {{as a function of the}} volumes on the freeway and on the on-ramp or off-ramp respectively. The new model has the following advantages: a) a uniform function for all types of freeway weaving segments and ramp junctions, b) traffic quality assessment for all critical areas under investigation in one step, and c) easy calibration. The new model will be incorporated into the new edition of the German Highway Capacity Manual (HBS 201 X) ...|$|R
40|$|Power {{extraction}} using a dielectric-loaded (DL) waveguide {{is a way}} {{to generate}} high-power radio frequency (RF) waves for future particle accelerators, especially for two-beam-acceleration. In a two-beam-acceleration scheme, a low-energy, high-current particle beam is passed through a <b>deceleration</b> <b>section</b> of waveguide (decelerator), where the power from the beam is partially transferred to trailing electromagnetic waves (wakefields); then with a properly designed RF output coupler, the power generated in the decelerator is extracted to an output waveguide, where finally the power can be transmitted and used to accelerate another usually high-energy low-current beam. The decelerator, together with the RF output coupler, is called a power extractor. At Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA), we designed a 7. 8 GHz power extractor with a circular DL waveguide and tested it with single electron bunches and bunch trains. The output RF frequency (7. 8 GHz) is the sixth harmonic of the operational frequency (1. 3 GHz) of the electron gun and the linac at AWA. In single bunch excitation, a 1. 7 ns RF pulse with 30 MW of power was generated by a single 66 nC electron bunch passing through the decelerator. In subsequent experiments, by employing different splitting-recombining optics for the photoinjector laser, electron bunch trains were generated and thus longer RF pulses could be successfully generated and extracted. In 16 -bunch experiments, 10 ns and 22 ns RF pulses have been generated and extracted; and in 4 -bunch experiments, the maximum power generated was 44 MW with 40 MW extracted. A 26 GHz DL power extractor has also been designed to test this technique in the millimeter-wave range. A power level of 148 MW is expected to be generated by a bunch train with a bunch spacing of 769 ps and bunch charges of 20 nC each. The arrangement for the experiment is illustrated in a diagram. Higher-order-mode (HOM) power extraction has also been explored in a dual-frequency design. By using a bunch train with a bunch spacing of 769 ps and bunch charges of 50 nC each, 90. 4 MW and 8. 68 MW of extracted power levels are expected to be reached at 20. 8 GHz and 35. 1 GHz, respectively. In order to improve efficiency in HOM power extraction, a novel technique has been proposed to suppress unintended modes...|$|E
