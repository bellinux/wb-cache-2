40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>coating</b> methods using metal {{particles}} from aqueous solutions or solvent-based inks become central in the roll-to-roll fabrication processes as these methods {{can lead to}} continuous or pre-defined conductive layers on a large variety of substrates. For good electrical conductivity, the metal particles have to be brought into contact, and traditionally, additional sintering treatments are required. Such treatments can degrade the sensitive substrates as paper or polymer films. In this study, the possibility of obtaining conductive layers at room temperature is investigated for <b>direct</b> <b>coating</b> methods {{with an emphasis on}} drop-casting and inkjet printing. Thus, it is shown that electrical conductive layers can be achieved if the metal particles can compact during the drop-substrate impact interaction. It is theoretically shown that the compaction process {{is directly related to the}} particle and ink drop size, the initial fractional particle loading of the ink, solvent viscosity, and drop velocity. The theoretical predictions on compaction are experimentally validated, and the particle compaction 2 ̆ 7 s influence on changes in the electrical conductivity of the resulting layers is demonstrated.

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{field in}} the coatings industry is the coating of porous media, with broad applications in paper, apparel, textile, electronics, bioengineering, filtration and energy sector. A primary industrial scale process {{that can be used}} to coat porous media in a fast and flexible manner is slot die extrusion. A major concern when coating porous media with a wetting fluid is fluid penetration into the substrate. Although some level of penetration is desirable to obtain specific material properties, inadequate or excessive fluid penetration can negatively affect the strength, functionality or performance of the resulting material. In spite of its apparent industrial importance, limited modeling and experimental work has been conducted to study fluid penetration into porous media during fabrication. The effects of processing parameters on the penetration depth, the effects of penetration on material quality, and the method to predict and control the penetration depth are not well understood. This dissertation is composed of two parts. Part I is an applied study for coating onto porous media. This part focuses on the first objective of this dissertation which is to elucidate clearly the feasibility, advantages and disadvantages of the <b>direct</b> <b>coating</b> method as a potential fabrication route for membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEA samples are fabricated using both traditional and the <b>direct</b> <b>coating</b> methods. Then, the quality and performance of the MEA samples are examined. Experimental results in Part I demonstrate that it is feasible to fabricate MEAs using the <b>direct</b> <b>coating</b> method. However, Nafion® solution penetrates into the catalyst layer during the coating process and causes lower performance of fuel cells, which is the motivation for Part II of this thesis. The objective of Part II is to fundamentally understand the fluid penetration process and predict the penetration depth when directly coating porous media, using a comprehensive approach. A series of computational and analytical models are developed to predict the penetration depth for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with or without capillary pressure. Finally the accuracy of developed models are validated through experiments. The relative error between the predicted and experimentally measured penetration depth is generally lower than 20 %. Ph.

However, there are cases where an organic compound with promising semiconducting properties lacks adequate processability and does not form well-performing thin films through conventional solution-based deposition techniques. The photoprecursor approach, in which a soluble photoprecursor is solution-deposited on a substrate and then converted to a target material by in situ photoreaction, can be an effective means to evade such a problem. Herein, we describe a comparative evaluation of thin films deposited by three different methods; i. e., vacuum deposition, photoprecursor approach, and <b>direct</b> spin <b>coating.</b> Two highly crystalline molecular semiconductors, hexyl-substituted anthra[1, 2 -b: 4, 3 -b': 5, 6 -b'': 8, 7 -b''']tetrathiophene (C 6 -ATT) and anthra[1, 2 -b: 5, 6 -b']dithiophene (or bent anthradithiophene, C 6 -BADT), are employed in this study along with the corresponding newly synthesized α-diketone-type photoprecursors.

40|$|In {{response}} to starvation, bacilli and clostridia undergo a specialized program of development {{that results in}} the production of a highly resistant dormant cell type known as the spore. A proteinacious shell, called the coat, encases the spore and {{plays a major role in}} spore survival. The coat is composed of over 25 polypeptide species, organized into several morphologically distinct layers. The mechanisms that guide coat assembly have been largely unknown until recently. We now know that proper formation of the coat relies on the genetic program that guides the synthesis of spore components during development as well as on morphogenetic proteins dedicated to coat assembly. Over 20 structural and morphogenetic genes have been cloned. In this review, we consider the contributions of the known coat and morphogenetic proteins to coat function and assembly.
