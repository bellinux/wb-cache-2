Among higher-ranking officers, 29.2% were NSDAP members by 1941. The Wehrmacht obeyed Hitler's criminal orders for Barbarossa not because of obedience to orders, but because they, like Hitler, believed that the Soviet Union was run by Jews, and that Germany must completely destroy [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism". German historian Jürgen Förster wrote that most Wehrmacht officers genuinely believed that most Red Army commissars were Jews who in turn were what kept the Red Army going, and {{that the best way to}} bring about victory against the Soviet Union was to exterminate the commissars via enforcing the Commissar Order so as to deprive the Russian soldiers of their Jewish leaders.|$|E

40|$|While much {{supervision}} occurs within organisations {{in which}} counsellors work, {{it seems that}} the issues facing supervision in organisations where counsellors are the main professional group are different from those in organisations where counsellors are {{only a small percentage of}} the employees. One field in which counsellors are a minority profession is in education. For example, Education Queensland has approximately 55, 000 employees, 400 of whom are <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> (the term used for school counsellors in this organisation). Counsellors therefore represent less than one per cent of the total number of employees, and proportions of this order would be expected in most, if not all, school systems. Using the supervision of <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> in Education Queensland as an example, this chapter will explore issues in an organisation where counsellors constitute a minority profession. An historical background will be presented first, followed by a discussion of the issues inherent in the provision of supervision in such an organisation. Examples of supervision practices will then be provided. An historical background to school counselling and supervision Education Queensland has employed school counsellors as <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> since 1948 (Logan & Clarke, 1984).

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of a survey carried out in Western Australia to {{ascertain}} how teachers and principals view the work of psychologists (<b>guidance</b> <b>officers)</b> in schools.

Perceptions of the process and quality of service delivery and the qualifications and experience of <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> were also sampled. The results indicated that traditional child‐centred activities were still rated by most school staff as occurring more frequently than newer, system‐centred ones.

40|$|Purpose. Youth in-care face a {{range of}} {{barriers}} that hinder their career development, not {{least of which is}} the high prevalence of mental health, emotional and behavioural problems among this population and lack of access to vocational rehabilitation services. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide an overview of the factors that impede the school-to-work transition of youth in-care from their perspective and that of the key stakeholders in their lives. Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 65 youth in-care, 27 carers, 14 caseworkers and 21 <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> in Queensland, Australia. Results. There is {{a range of}} social, psychological and environmental factors that impact the career development of youth incare, some of which are unique to this population. Factors include the effect of placement stability, negative in-care experiences, negative perceptions about them, limited access to caseworkers, lack of resources, poor educational planning and lack of vocational guidance and career exploration. Conclusions. These findings have a number of implications for practice, including the need for rehabilitation counsellors to understand and address the multiple barriers facing youth in-care, to provide vocational rehabilitation services throughout the school-to-work transition period and to coordinate support from carers, caseworkers and <b>guidance</b> <b>officers.</b> Griffith Health, School of Human Services and Social WorkFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} career {{development}} in Australia is populated by practitioners and theorists representative of different professions and academic disciplines: teachers, instructors, and <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> from education; employment and recruitment officers from human resources and management; organisational, counselling, and educational psychologists from psychology; {{and others from}} rehabilitation, social work, elite performance and sport, and public policy. The diversity of professions and disciplines is, without doubt, a virtue. In one way, this diversity manifests in the array of disciplinary perspectives published in the AJCD—truly it is the core strength of the journal that its remit is so broad and inclusive. The multidisciplinary reach of the journal similarly reflects the diverse composition of the peak body {{in the field in}} this country: the Career Industry Council of Australia (CICA). Whilst the journal will always retain its intellectual independence—as a scholarly source of ideas and a platform for sharing evidence and practice—it may well prove strategic to align the journal with the CICA’s objectives and instruments of professionalisation, such as the Professional Standards for Australian Career Development Practitioners (CICA, 2006). In considering the dimensions of such a strategic alignment, here I briefly address two of the fundamental planks of the many disciplines and professions that make up the field of career development: evidence-based practice and applied research and developmen...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Current {{practice}} in Australia {{is to avoid}} discussing suicide or suicidal ideation directly with students in school suicide prevention programs. This paper examines why {{there is a strong}} argument to question this approach {{in the context of a}} continuing unacceptable rate of youth suicide in this country. Methods: A review of the literature that informs the debate was conducted. Using an action research methodology, a more direct intervention approach was taken based on the use of the ‘Toughin’ it out’ pamphlet. Results: A misrepresentation of the evidence surrounding school-based suicide intervention programs in Australia has made educators and <b>guidance</b> <b>officers</b> wary of being more direct with suicide prevention programs. The experience of several practitioners in northern Australia suggests that it is highly beneficial to engage students in discussions about suicide and how to deal with suicidal thoughts. Their impression is that this has led to a lessening of suicide attempts in high-risk situations and there has been no evidence of any adverse outcome. Conclusion: The ongoing tragedy of Indigenous adolescent suicide in Australia demands that all possible interventions should be considered. Taking a more direct approach to school suicide prevention and life-promoting programs using the brief intervention tool, the ‘Toughin’ it out’ pamphlet, appeared to be associated with a positive impact on suicide in high-risk secondary schools in northern Australia. The positive experience in northern Australia would support a similar approach being considered in school programs nationally...|$|E
