5|$|The Imperial Victoria Cross {{has been}} awarded to ninety-six Australians—91 were {{received}} for actions whilst serving with Australian forces, and another 5 were received for actions whilst serving with South African and British forces.

Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously in other cities, this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public notice. When Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause.
