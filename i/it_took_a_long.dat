5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time to set}} up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which {{made it hard to}} warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
25|$|The first ADC interceptor, the P-61 Black Widow, did {{not have}} the {{capabilities}} to engage the Soviet Tu-4 bomber.

25|$|At the Battle of Marengo on 14 June, Ott {{commanded}} the Austrian left wing. Because of congestion in the bridgehead, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time for the}} left wing to deploy. However, once his attack at mid-day got underway, it broke the French right flank and helped convince them to retreat from Marengo. Later in the battle, when French reinforcements defeated the Austrian main body, Ott withdrew in good order and brought his command off in safety. This was his last active command.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl {{whom he had}} met at Garsington Manor, {{the country}} house of Lady Ottoline Morrell, a Bloomsbury Group socialite {{with a penchant for}} artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life {{together}} included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a bipolar disorder, with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time for him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. E. B. Ford always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.|$|E
25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. I {{put down the}} rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} {{in time to the}} track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton {{to be part of the}} daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before finally a group got away from the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance. After the only categorized climb of the day, it's Giuseppe Guerini and David López who are just riding a few seconds in front of the peloton, followed by Jérôme Pineau, the holder of the polka dot jersey who successfully tried to enhance his lead in the king of the mountains classification. But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most important to remember is Benoit Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) was {{inhabited}} by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who along with other Native Americans, most likely Lenape occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis. As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands. Between 1637 and 1639, a few settlements were established. During the American Revolution, the British burned Harlem to the ground. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to rebuild, as Harlem grew more slowly {{than the rest of}} Manhattan during the late 18th century. After the American Civil War, Harlem experienced an economic boom starting in 1868. The neighborhood continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian. The New York and Harlem Railroad, as well as the Interborough Rapid Transit and elevated railway lines, helped Harlem's economic growth, as they connected Harlem to lower and midtown Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time for}} the Maharajahs Ghulab Singh and Ranbir Singh to extend their writ over Gilgit, Hunza and Nagar, and not until 1870 did they assert their {{authority}} over Gilgit town. The grip of the Jammu and Kashmir government over this area was tenuous. The Indian government undertook administrative reforms in 1885 and created Gilgit Agency in 1889 {{as a way for}} the British to secure the region as a buffer from the Russians. As a result of this Great Game, with British fear of Russian activities in Chinese Sinkiang increasing, in 1935 the Gilgit Agency was expanded by the Maharajah Hari Singh leasing the Gilgit Wazarat to the government of India for a period of sixty years and for an amount of 75,000Rs. This gave the British political agent complete control of defence, communications and foreign relations while the Kashmiri state retained civil administration and the British retained control of defence and foreign affairs.|$|E

25|$|Because of her {{participation}} in the musical, <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time for Beni to release new material. When the musical stopped touring in 2006, she began modeling as the face of Cecil McBee, {{one of the largest}} and most popular Japanese clothing lines that appeals to teenage and college girls. She was also the host of the NHK fashion program, Tokyo Kawaii TV, where Beni discusses the latest fashion trends in Japan. When she became the face of Orion Beer a new single was announced to be released on September 20. Her seventh single was named How Are U?. This single was her first single not to chart on the Oricon chart and is considered a total flop. Her eighth single named Luna was an ending theme song for the Japanese drama Warui Yatsura. This single charted at the No. 77 spot making it a small comeback from Beni. On April 25, 2007, Beni released her third studio album named Gem. The album charted at the No. 114 place on the Oricon chart.|$|E
25|$|During the Allied {{approach}} {{towards the}} Rur, {{the issue of}} the Rur dams took on a new urgency. The dams were a strategically important target, as they would allow the Germans to flood the Rur valley and everything else downstream of it as far as the Meuse and into the Netherlands. This would delay to the Allied offensive effort into Germany, possibly causing major casualties as well as trapping Allied units east of the flooding. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time until the Allied high command recognized its importance and until the first specific actions were implemented towards them. The first approach was made by the RAF which was tasked to breach them, with bombing starting in early December. In continuous attack waves, hundreds of aircraft were thrown against the dams, but damage was only negligible. On 13 December V Corps, already at the Rur, was tasked to start an offensive to seize the dams from various directions including the Ardennes sector. The offensive took the Germans by surprise, but as the Allies ran directly into the Germans being near ready for the Ardennes Offensive, resistance soon stiffened. On 16 December the Germans launched their final all-out offensive on their western front, Wacht am Rhein, which led to an immediate end of all Allied offensive efforts in this sector.|$|E

500|$|Cellador Productions of Bangalore {{worked on}} the film's sound design; Nixon George and Rajeesh K. R. {{designed}} its soundscape. Since Maheshinte Prathikaram was set in Prakash City in Idukki, it required natural sounds which blended with the dialogue and music instead of dominating them. George and Rajeesh recorded in all the locations and found it of great help during the final editing process. Creating sound effects for the climactic fight was difficult: [...] "We used {{a big piece of}} meat to produce the sound effects of punches and kicks. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and a lot of trial and error".

As a result of equipment shortages and inadequate aircrew training, the squadron was not fully ready for combat until December; this greatly frustrated Kenney's deputy, Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead, who commented that [...] "we have never gotten a mission out of that unit". Some of the training deficiencies were due to the RAAF's practice of stationing operational training units in southern Australia, {{with the result that}} aircrew were unfamiliar with flying in tropical conditions. During December, the squadron operated against Japanese positions on New Britain and New Ireland ahead of the American landings in western New Britain.|$|E
