5000|$|In an ultra-high-shear <b>inline</b> <b>mixer,</b> the high-shear mixing {{takes place}} in a single or {{multiple}} passes through a rotor-stator array. The mixer is designed to subject the product to higher shear and a larger number of shearing events than a standard inline rotor-stator mixer, producing an exceptionally narrow particle-size distribution. Sub-micrometre particle sizes are possible using the ultra-high-shear technology. [...] To achieve this, the machine is equipped with stators with precision-machined holes or slots through which the product is forced by the rotors. The rotor-stator array can also include a mechanism whereby the momentum of the flow is changed (for example by forcing it sideways through the stator), allowing for more processing in a single pass.|$|E

To improve the efficiency of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) systems, several modifications to system layouts and operating strategies are considered in this paper, rather than modifications to the fuel cell itself. Two modified DMFC systems are presented, one with an additional <b>inline</b> <b>mixer</b> and a further modification of it with a separate tank to recover condensed water. The set point for methanol concentration control in the solution is determined by fuel efficiency and varies with the current and other process variables. Feedforward concentration control enables variable concentration for dynamic loads. Simulation results were validated experimentally with fuel cell systems...|$|E

In this work we discuss an inline image analysis technique applied to the monitoring of concrete mixing, {{which is based on}} the evolution of the texture of pictures taken at the surface of the mixing bed. The method is used to study the evolution of the paste during processing in an intensive laboratory scale mixer for three different formulations: a hard-to-mix concrete, a self-compacting mortar and an easy to mix cement paste. The evolution of the texture allows obtaining important information on the evolution of the different formulations during mixing; in addition, the technique allows identifying with a good repeatability the main characteristic points of the mixture evolution, i. e. the cohesion time and the fluidity time...|$|E

40|$|Coriolis meter, {{despite being}} very {{accurate}} in single phase conditions, fails to accurately measure two-phase flows. It poses a complex fluid-structure interaction problem {{in case of}} two-phase operation; there is a scarcity of theoretical models available to predict the errors reported by Coriolis meter in aforementioned conditions, hence the need for experimental research. Experiments are conducted in both single and two-phase flow conditions. Meter accuracy is excellent in single phase conditions and no significant effect is observed on use of flow conditioners, namely inlet swirl and <b>inline</b> <b>mixer.</b> Operational two-phase envelope is determined through experiments at different flowrates. Flow conditioners are used to study the effect of phase segregation and homogenization on accuracy of the meter. Testing is done to cover two-phase flows from both extreme ends, namely aerated liquids and wet gas. Use of flow conditioners show slight improvement in meter accuracy on use of <b>inline</b> <b>mixer,</b> and reduction in accuracy in case of inlet swirl, when both former and latter are compared to results obtained from experiments with no flow conditioners. The difference in accuracies between results with flow conditioner and without flow conditioners is attributed to relative motion between the phases, which is more in case of inlet swirl, due to larger bubble sizes. Flow conditioners show an insignificant effect on meter accuracy during wet gas tests. The reason proposed is annular flow regime, which is not highly affected by flow conditioners. Single phase tests demonstrate that Coriolis meter gives accurate measurement even in presence of severe flow disturbances. There {{is no need for}} flow conditioning before the meter to obtain accurate readings from it, which would be the case in other metering technologies like orifice and turbine. In two phase flows, the meter reports negative errors, which is consistent with previous experimental works available in literature. Use of flow conditioners clearly affects the reading of the meter in aerated liquids. This phenomenon can be used to get fairly accurate estimate of flow rate in low gas volume fraction liquid flows...|$|E
40|$|Rotor-stator mixers {{are widely}} used in the {{chemical}} and pharmaceutical process industries. Up to now, however, few papers discuss the mean flow and turbulence fields generated by them and their influence on final product quality. In this work, CFD results at different scales are used {{to aid in the}} scale up of crystal wet milling processes. CFD simulations were performed to simulate different scale mixers. In addition, wet milling studies were conducted at the bench scale to complement the CFD results and predict wet milling performance in larger scale mixers. The flow properties in a batch Silverson L 4 R rotor-stator mixer at 4000 and 6000 rpm were investigated. A hybrid technique was developed. The new method is computationally efficient compared with the standard sliding mesh method. Macro scale properties are predicted. The turbulent flow field and deformation rate field are compared and analyzed. After obtaining fully converged flow fields, one way coupled particle tracking calculations were performed using an efficient fast particle tracking code. Particles trajectories were recorded, and analyzed. To validate the simulated flow field, particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments were conducted. CFD simulations of Silverson inline L 4 R (bench scale), 450 LS (pilot scale) and 600 LS (plant scale) mixers were conducted at constant tip speed to investigate the scale up effect. The macro scale properties werer predicted. The mean velocity, turbulent and deformation rate fields were investigated. The flow properties of the 450 LS and 600 LS mixers are quite similar, but they are significantly {{different from those of the}} L 4 R (bench scale) mixer. Therefore, it may be resonable to scale up from pilot scale to plant scale by the general accepted tip speed scale up criterion. However, considering tip speed alone may lead to a significant discrepancy between bench scale and larger scales. Bench scale wet milling experiment were performed at 4000, 6000 and 8000 rpm using sucrose and mannitol in the Silverson L 4 R <b>inline</b> <b>mixer.</b> The crystal size decreases with rotation rate at both free pumping conditions and constant flow rate conditions. To investigate the effect of flow rate, wet milling of granulated sucrose in the Silverson L 4 R <b>inline</b> <b>mixer</b> with constant rotor tip speed were performed at different flow rates. It is found that the crystal size increases with the flow rate...|$|E
40|$|The Sonolator liquid whistle is an {{industrial}} <b>inline</b> <b>mixer</b> {{used to create}} complex multiphase mixtures which form components of high value added liquid products. Despite its wide use, this device’s mechanism of operation is not well understood {{which has led to}} this combined experimental and computational study to elucidate key phenomena governing drop and jet break-up. The work has focused on single phase Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of a model device to validate single phase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to gain basic understanding of the flow fields which are responsible for the breakage behaviour, assuming dilute dispersions. Multiphase pilot plant experiments on a silicone oil-water-SLES emulsion have been used to characterise the droplet size reduction in a pilot scale Sonolator for both dilute and medium concentrations of the dispersed phase. An empirical model of droplet size was constructed based on pressure drop, dispersed phase viscosity and surfactant concentration. This empirical model was compared with the droplet breakage theories of Hinze, Walstra and Davies. Extra work mentioned in the appendices includes studies on cavitation in the Sonolator, with the cavitating flow conditions identified and the contribution to emulsification considered, and the usage of population balance methods to simulate droplet breakup in the environment indicated by CFD/PIV studies in order to investigate how the droplet size distributions measured in pilot plant studies came about...|$|E
40|$|Scalar fields can evolve complex {{coherent}} structures {{under the}} action of periodic laminar flows. This comes about from the competition between chaotic advection working to create structure at ever finer length scales and diffusion working to eliminate fine scale structure. Recently analysis of this competition in terms of spectra of eigenfunctions of the advection-diffusion equation (ADE) has proven fruitful because these spectra contain both fundamental information about how mixing processes create emergent Lagrangian coherent structure and also clues about how to optimize flows for heat and mass transfer processes in industry. While theoretical and computational studies of ADE spectra exist for several flows, experiments, to date, have focused either solely on the asymptotic state or on highly idealized flows. Here we show a coupled experimental and computational study of the spectrum for the scalar evolution of a model of an industrially relevant viscous flow. The main results are the methods employed in this study corroborate the eigenmode approach and the outcomes of different methods agree well with each other. Furthermore, this study employs a Lagrangian formalism for thermal analysis of convective heat transfer in the representative geometry to determine {{the impact of the}} fluid motion in the thermal homogenization process. The experimental/numerical methods and tools used in the current study are promising for further qualitative parameter studies of the mixing/heat transfer characteristics of many <b>inline</b> <b>mixers</b> and heat exchangers...|$|R
5000|$|In a batch high-shear mixer, the {{components}} to be mixed (whether immiscible liquids or powder in liquid) are fed {{from the top}} into a mixing tank containing the mixer on a rotating shaft {{at the bottom of}} the tank.

[...] When mixing sticky solutions, some of the product may be left in the tank, necessitating cleaning. However, there are designs of batch high-shear mixers that clean the tank as part of the operating run. Some high-shear mixers are designed to run dry, limiting the amount of cleaning needed in the tank.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{understanding of}} <b>inline</b> rotor-stator <b>mixer</b> (RSM) efficiency, {{described in terms}} of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy as a function of mixer design and operation, is still poor. As opposed to the correlations for shaft power draw, where a substantial amount of experimental support for the suggested correlations exists, the previously suggested correlations for the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy have not been experimentally validated based on primary hydrodynamic measurements. This study uses energy conservation to reformulate the previously suggested dissipation rate correlations in terms of pumping power which allows for empirical testing. The dimensionless pumping power of three investigated geometrically dissimilar inline RSMs were found to be qualitatively similar to that of centrifugal pumps and decrease linearly with the inline RSM flow number. The previously suggested models for turbulent dissipation in inline RSMs are inconsistent with this observation. Using this reformulation approach, the previously suggested correlation for power-draw is extended to a correlation for dissipation. A new model is suggested based on conservation of energy and angular momentum, and the empiric pumping power relationship. The new model compares well to CFD simulations of total dissiaption and show reasonable agreement to emulsification drop size scaling...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of <b>inline</b> <b>mixer</b> measurements is imposed {{in a growing}} concrete industry employing increasingly complex manufacturing processes and materials. Improper mixing, water content estimation and fresh properties control {{are one of the}} most important concerns of concrete manufacturers. These problems have increased in recent decades due to the expansion of new materials like Recycled Aggregates Concretes (RAC) employing very heterogeneous materials making the mixing and properties control very complex. An inline image analysis technique applied to the monitoring of concrete mixing has been then developed to try to address this problem. This technique is based on the evolution of the texture of pictures taken at the surface of the mixing bed. The method is used to study the evolution of the paste during processing in laboratory and industrial scale mixers. The evolution of the texture allows obtaining important information on the evolution of the different formulations during mixing. Thanks to this simple monitoring of the mixing evolution, the study of the different parameters affecting the mixing time is easily conducted. In this work, the effect of the waterto- powder ratio, the constituent’s temperature and the kind of aggregate employed (natural or recycled) on the mixing time and on the final fresh properties has been quantified. The differences in water dosage between a RAC and a standard concrete can also be estimated to design more precise formulations...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis aims to present results regarding the exploration, validation and use of a novel rotor-stator type mixing equipment employing controlled deformation dynamic mixing (CDDM) technology in creating sub-micron emulsions for use in chemical reactions. Emulsification is {{the process by which}} one immiscible liquid (e. g. oil) is finely dispersed throughout another immiscible liquid (e. g. water) and stabilised, commonly through the addition of a surface active agent or emulsifier to the system. Specific focus was given to the emulsification of plant oils (such as sunflower seed oil) as a way of improving their available reactive surface area. The addition of emulsifiers in this case was used to sufficiently reduce the interfacial tensions, allowing for greater droplet break-up, and provide adequate emulsion stability. Further testing of these emulsions was performed within biphasic saponification and transesterification reactions, such as those commonly employed in the production of soap and biodiesel. It was hypothesised that by reducing the dispersed oil phase droplet size in the presence of an emulsifier, and thus increasing the surface area to volume ratio, reaction rates could be manipulated. Testing of this hypothesis showed that despite the presence of surfactant and, {{in the case of the}} transesterification reaction, water, the use of sub-micron oil droplets caused a decrease in the overall reaction time (time spent at reaction temperature and under agitation). In support of this work, high-throughput formulation (HT) and design of experiment (DoE) software was adopted to allow a quick and efficient way of screening which emulsification parameters had the greatest impact on the size of the droplets when emulsifying oil. For this work a standard emulsion containing silicone oil and Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate (SLES) was used. Following the identification of the optimum emulsification parameter set, work focused on the scaling up from small scale (50 g) to pilot plant scale mixing devices (10 kg – 300 kg/hour) in order to formulate large quantities of emulsion. It was shown that the HT screening and DoE was sufficiently robust to predict emulsification parameters at scale. For an emulsion system of silicone oil and SLES, the formulation parameters that created an emulsion with the smallest droplet size using the high-throughput platform, also produced an emulsion with the smallest droplet size using the new pilot plant scale Ultra Mixing and Processing Facility (UMPF) fitted with CDDM technology. In order to characterise the emulsions created, laser diffraction measurements were used throughout this work (Malvern Mastersizer X & 2000) and “side by side” emulsification experiments were carried out using commercially available fluid processing units. Utilising either a rotor-stator type <b>inline</b> <b>mixer</b> (high shear Silverson 150 / 250 MS mixer) or a high pressure valve type homogeniser (M- 110 S Microfluidizer Processor, Small Volume) the emulsions produced and processed on the respective equipment were compared with those produced via the CDDM in order to assess its capabilities and performance against two of the leading mixers available...|$|E

As a control, 30 % w/w infant milk formulations were subjected to a typical process, i. e. heat treatment in a tubular heat exchanger, valve-type homogenisation, evaporation (to 55 % w/w solids content) and spray drying. Both formulations were dried using a three-stage dryer with two-fluid nozzle atomisation at inlet and outlet temperatures of 187  °C and 85  °C, respectively. Formulations subjected to the steam injection process had significantly (P[*] [*] 0. 05), 2. 04 [*]±[*] 0. 22 and 1. 82 [*]±[*] 0. 04  μm for the control and high-solids steam injection processes, respectively.

40|$|The {{degree of}} waste paper {{recycling}} {{has been increasing}} steadily in North America over the last decade. Today, it is recognized that the flotation deinking process {{is one of the}} most important processes in waste paper recycling. This is demonstrated by the numerous variety of industrial flotation cell technologies currently available. Column flotation, developed in the mineral processing industry, is proposed as an alternative to other flotation technologies due to its low capital costs and improved separation performance. The flotation column requires an air sparging device to produce bubbles. Previous experimentation has shown that columns run with internal porous spargers initially produced excellent ink recoveries and low organic losses but eventually the sparging system plugged and performance deteriorated. In this work, an air sparging technique, based on a static <b>inline</b> pipe <b>mixer</b> was compared to a porous sparger. Both air sparging systems were evaluated in-plant on a lab scale flotation column to determine their relative merits, confirm previous work and compare to a circuit of full scale deinking cells. The effects of gas rate, retention time, wash water rate, froth height were investigated. It was found that the static mixer sparger was an excellent alternative to conventional porous spargers due to its stable operation and ability to control bubble size. As with porous spargers, the bubble surface area rate produced by the sparging system was found to be an important parameter in determining ink recovery. Two flotation circuits based on columns with the two competing sparging systems were scaled up using long term test data and compared. Operational boundaries for the static mixer sparger system were also defined...|$|R
40|$|Currently, unless {{aided by}} {{subsidies}} or {{some form of}} government directive, biodiesel cannot compete against regular petro diesel because of lower pump costs. Attempting to lower production costs of biodiesel would be helpful in narrowing the price gap between these two competing fuels. The production of biodiesel involves mixing organic oil and a short chain alcohol which are not miscible {{in the early stages}} of reaction. The interfacial area between the two phases is believed to strongly affect the reaction rate leading to the development of numerous methods for the dispersion of short chain alcohol in organic oil. One such method is through the use of a static mixer which is a motionless <b>inline</b> pipe <b>mixer</b> with specially shaped baffles used to promote mixing. This study investigated the effectiveness of a Kenics static mixer as a dispersion tool in biodiesel production with methanol as the short chain alcohol and palm oil as the organic oil. This was performed by measuring the droplet sizes of methanol dispersed in palm oil for different flow parameters, namely the mixer length and flow rate. The moderately high concentration of methanol (20 % volume fraction) presented an additional level of complexity in the experimental investigation and necessitated the development of a suitable droplet measurement technique which consisted of a modified borescope attached to a digital camera and coupled with a strobe light source. Experimental results showed that the static mixer was certainly an effective mixer, outperforming the conventional agitated vessel design seen in most biodiesel production plants but was not as effective as ultrasonic emulsifiers although this method requires the highest energy input. The experimental study was complemented by a parallel numerical investigation which was performed using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS-FLUENT. To account for the droplet size evolution, the CFD simulations were coupled to a population balance model with the appropriate droplet breakage and coalescence models. There was reasonable agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations. In addition, numerical simulations predicted that the static mixer was the most efficient mixer when accounting both droplet size reduction and energy requirements. The findings of this study suggest that the Kenics static mixer is an efficient mixer. It is, therefore, worth investigating the use of the Kenics static mixer as a continuous reactor for the production of biodiesel without any rotating parts and possibly at room temperature. This would present a novel design which could be attractive in achieving quality product at low operating cost...|$|R
