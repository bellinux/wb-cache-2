40|$|Analogy as renegotiation {{of meaning}} Analogy is {{analyzed}} {{as a process}} of implicit redefinition, which is based on the abstraction of a functional genus, i. e. a common generic property that is contextually essential for the purpose of the move. Based on the twofold <b>genus-species</b> <b>relation</b> and the corresponding topoi, the attributes of one of the terms of the analogy (the Analogue) are inherited by the generic concept and then transferred to the other subject (the Primary Subject). For this reason, this type of reasoning can be considered as a strategy for introducing new implicit or explicit criteria of classification, which can result in the redefinition of an existing concept or the introduction of a new one. In the first case, new criteria of classification expand the denotation of the analogue, thereby implicitly modifying its meaning. In the second case, a new definition is provided of a new implicit functional genus, under which the two different analogical concepts fall...|$|E
40|$|The {{reasoning}} {{process of}} analogy {{is characterized by}} a strict interdependence between a process of abstraction of a common feature and the transfer of an attribute of the Analogue to the Primary Subject. The first reasoning step is regarded as an abstraction of a generic characteristic that is relevant for the attribution of the predicate. The abstracted feature can be considered from a logic-semantic perspective as a functional genus, {{in the sense that it}} is contextually essential for the attribution of the predicate, i. e. that is pragmatically fundamental (i. e. relevant) for the predica-tion, or rather the achievement of the communicative intention. While the transfer of the predicate from the Analogue to the analogical genus and from the genus to the Primary Subject is guaranteed by the maxims (or rules of inference) governing the <b>genus-species</b> <b>relation,</b> the connection between the genus and the predicate can be complex, characterized by various types of reasoning patterns. The relevance relation can hide implicit arguments, such as an implicit argument from classification, an evaluation based on values, consequences or rules, a causal relation, or an argument from practical reasoning...|$|E
