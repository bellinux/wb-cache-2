50|$|The Hessian fly or barley midge, Mayetiola destructor, is {{a species}} of fly that is a {{significant}} pest of cereal crops including wheat, barley and rye.

There are usually two generations a year but may be up to five. In the spring the dark-coloured female lays about 250 to 300 reddish eggs on plants, usually where the stems are covered by leaves; the larvae feed on the sap and weaken the plants so that they cannot bear grain.The hessian fly was described by Thomas Say in 1817. It is a very <b>harmful</b> <b>insect.</b> It mainly attacks the stem, although if it is really hungry it will eat {{any part of the}} plant it can find.In 1836 a severe infestation of Hessian flies resulted in a crop shortage aggravating the financial problems of farmers prior to the Panic of 1837.|$|E
