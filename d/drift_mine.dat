25|$|Iron mines {{operated}} {{beneath the}} northern slopes of Grike and Crag Fell from 1860 to 1896. Levels were {{driven into the}} banks of Goat Gill and Red Gill, with the principal working, Main <b>Drift</b> <b>Mine,</b> between the two. The yields were never as great as hoped and the venture was a commercial failure.|$|E
25|$|Widow Jane Mine, a <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> {{into one}} of the hillsides, is the oldest cement mine on the property. It was {{constructed}} using the room and pillar technique, where pillars of dolostone have been left to support the overlying rock. The largest of the mines, it has been likened to an underground pillared room. It is currently mostly flooded with groundwater, but that has not stopped musicians from recording in it {{to take advantage of the}} acoustics.|$|E
50|$|The Drifting-2 (æ¼‚-2, or Piao-2) <b>drifting</b> <b>mine</b> {{is a small}} <b>drifting</b> <b>mine</b> jointly {{developed}} by the 710th Research Institute and Dalian Crane Factory. This <b>drifting</b> <b>mine</b> system {{is the first in}} Chinese service {{to be able to be}} taken apart for easier transportation, and then assembled just before being planted, and it is designed to float just below the surface of the water to avoid being visually detected. This mine is mainly for riverine and coastal use and can also be used as part of the moored mine system.|$|R

25|$|The Mahogony <b>Drift</b> <b>Mine</b> is {{original}} to Beamish, having {{opened in}} 1855 and after closing, was brought back into use in 1921 to transport coal from Beamish Park Drift to Beamish Cophill Colliery. It opened {{as a museum}} display in 1979. Included in the display is the winding engine and a short section of trackway used to transport tubs of coal to the surface, and a mine office. Visitor access into the mine shaft is by guided tour.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum was}} opened to {{visitors}} on its current {{site for the}} first time in 1972, with the first translocated buildings (the railway station and colliery winding engine) being erected the following year. The first trams began operating on a short demonstration line in 1973. The Town station was formally opened in 1976, the same year the reconstruction of the colliery winding engine house was completed, and the miner's cottages were relocated. Opening of the <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> as an exhibit followed in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The Lamp Cabin {{opened in}} 2009, {{and is a}} {{recreation}} of a typical design used in collieries to house safety lamps, a necessary piece of equipment for miners (although not being required in the Mahogony <b>Drift</b> <b>Mine,</b> due to it being gas free). The building is split into two main rooms - in one half {{the interior of the}} lamp cabin is recreated, with a collection of lamps on shelves, and the system of safety tokens used to track which miners were underground. Included in the display is a 1927 Hailwood and Ackroyd lamp cleaning machine sourced from Morrison Busty Colliery in Annfield Plain. In the second room is an educational display (i.e. not a period interior).|$|E
50|$|After World War I the <b>drifting</b> contact <b>mine</b> was banned, but was {{occasionally}} {{used during}} World War II. The <b>drifting</b> <b>mines</b> were {{much harder to}} remove than tethered mines after the war, and they caused about the same damage to both sides.|$|R

50|$|Early coal {{extraction}} was small-scale, the coal lying {{either on the}} surface, or very close to it. Typical methods for extraction included <b>drift</b> <b>mining</b> and bell pits. As well as <b>drift</b> <b>mines,</b> small scale shaft mining was used. This {{took the form of}} a bell pit, the extraction working outward from a central shaft, or a technique called room and pillar in which 'rooms' of coal were extracted with pillars left to support the roofs. Both of these techniques however left considerable amount of usable coal behind.|$|R
500|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} specifically to burn coal from the Northumberland coalfields. The neighbouring Ellington Colliery originally fed coal directly to the power station using a conveyor belt from its Bewick <b>Drift</b> <b>Mine,</b> situated [...] from the station. Within a year of the power station opening, 3,000 men were employed between the Ellington and Lynemouth collieries, producing over two million tons of coal a year, the majority of it being sold to the power station. In 1994, Ellington Colliery connected underground with Lynemouth Colliery, but coal continued to be taken straight to the power station's coal sorting area using conveyor belts. This supply was supplemented by coal from local opencast mines. However, Ellington Colliery was forced to close when it flooded in January 2005. The station burned the colliery's remaining coal stock after it closed, and since then coal has been sourced from opencast mines in Northumberland and Scotland, but now {{a small amount of}} import is necessary.|$|E
500|$|Coal {{had been}} mined {{for several hundred}} years in {{numerous}} shallow shafts and adits, but took on greater importance when in 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton leased the coal rights to Thomas Guest from Leigh and John Fletcher from Bolton. In 1845 the era of deep mining arrived with the sinking of Fletcher's Lover's Lane pit at Howe Bridge. The Crombouke Day-Eye, a <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> accessing the shallow Brassy and Crombouke mines, opened in 1870 and closed in 1907. (A coal seam {{was referred to as}} a [...] "mine" [...] in this part of Lancashire.) By the early 1870s Fletcher, Burrows and Company's Howe Bridge Colliery, the biggest of the three Howe Bridge pits, was sunk to the Black & White, or Seven Foot mine. It pit closed in 1959. Gibfield Colliery, situated alongside the Bolton and Leigh Railway, was working in 1829, coal was mined from the Trencherbone mine. Forty years later a [...] shaft was sunk to Arley Mine. The pit closed in 1963. In September 1913 the first pit head baths in the country were opened at Gibfield. Chanters Colliery was in Hindsford, where [...] shafts were sunk to the Trencherbone mine in 1854. In the late 1890s shafts were deepened to [...] to reach the Arley mine. Atherton had its share of mining disasters, on 11 February 1850 five men died in a gas explosion caused by a lighted candle at Gibfield and 27 men died at Lovers Lane Colliery after a firedamp explosion caused by blown-out shot on 28 March 1872. On 6 March 1957 eight men died at Chanters Colliery after an explosion of gas.|$|E
2500|$|The Pit Pony Stables {{were built}} in 2013/14, and house the museum's pit ponies. They replace a wooden stable a few metres away in the field {{opposite}} the school (the wooden structure remaining). It represents the sort of stables that [...] were used in drift mines (ponies in deep mines living their whole lives underground), pit ponies having been in use in the north east as late as 1994, in Ellington Colliery. The structure is a recreation of an original building that stood at Rickless <b>Drift</b> <b>Mine,</b> between High Spen and Greenside; it was built using a yellow brick that was common across the Durham coalfield.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>mining</b> {{methods were}} used {{extensively}} to mine placer deposits {{during the early}} years (1899- [...] ) of the Nome mining district. During summer, surface deposits could be worked, but some placer deposits were buried too deeply for surface placering. In addition, water to wash the gold from the placers was not available in the winter. Many miners tunneled into deep placer deposits, bringing out the high-grade gravels to be washed at the spring thaw. Most of the ground in Nome is permafrost. By <b>drift</b> <b>mining,</b> miners were able to recover much of the gold buried under the permafrost.|$|R
5000|$|The {{capacity}} or {{output of}} the mines of the State varies greatly. Thick coals are capable of a greater daily output than thin seams, and {{as a general rule}} <b>drift</b> <b>mines</b> possess greater advantages for loading coal rapidly than shaft mining openings. In many of the mines of the great vein region of the Hocking valley the capacity is equal to 1,200 to 1,500 tons per day. In shaft mines 600 to 700 tons daily is regarded as a good output.The first ton of coal in a shaft mine 100 feet in depth and having a daily capacity of 600 tons frequently costs the mining adventurer upwards of $20,000 (1888), and cases are on record where owing to the extraordinary amount of water in sinking, $100,000 (1888) have been expended before coal was reached. <b>Drift</b> <b>mines,</b> as they require no machinery for pumping water and raising coal, cost less than half the amount required in shaft mining.Water is, however, an expensive item in <b>drift</b> <b>mines</b> opened on the dip slope of the coal, and underground hauling under such conditions is unusually costly.|$|R

2500|$|In 1760, Captain Thomas Hutchins visited Fort Pitt and {{reported}} {{that there was a}} mine on Coal Hill, the original name given to Mount Washington across the Monongahela River from the fort. [...] The coal was extracted from <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> entries into the Pittsburgh coal seam at outcrop along the hillside about 200 feet above the river. [...] The coal was poured into trenches dug into the hillside, rolled {{to the edge of the}} river, and transported by canoe and boats to the military garrison. Sometime around 1765, a fire broke out in this mine, which continued to burn for years, leading to collapse of part of the face of the hill. [...] Mining rights were formally purchased from the chiefs of the Six Nations in 1768, and from this point on, coal fueled the explosive growth of industry in the Pittsburgh Region.|$|E
2500|$|Coal mining in Britain, {{particularly}} in South Wales, started early. Before the steam engine, pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined {{by means of}} an adit or <b>drift</b> <b>mine</b> driven into the side of a hill. Shaft mining was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by Savery in 1698 and the Newcomen steam engine in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of John Smeaton's improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable. [...] The Cornish engine, developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the Watt steam engine.|$|E
