500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E

[...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D.

500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made me feel like I owned the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E
500|$|Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated he [...] "really enjoyed" [...] {{the episode}} {{and it was}} [...] "beautifully dark". He later {{described}} it as [...] "a chilling tale" [...] and [...] "a cracker". Now Playing magazine reviewer Arnold T Blumburg gave [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] a grade of A-, describing it as [...] "spectacular", though he noted there were [...] "a few hiccups, such as the weak and convenient plot point that forces the Gelth ... to be drawn out of their human hosts by {{the mere presence of}} gas". He also criticised Eccleston for making the Doctor appear an [...] "ineffectual goof", and noted that he played no role in the resolution. In 2013, Mark Braxton of Radio Times described the episode as [...] "a sparkling script, as crisp and inviting as a winter wonderland", praising the magical atmosphere and the treatment of Dickens. However, he felt that [...] "the spectral swirlings are all a bit Raiders of the Lost Ark". In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk felt that [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] was [...] "terribly, terribly disappointing" [...] on first viewing, as Rose and the Doctor's characterisation did not drive the plot and the story was reduced to playing it safe and being [...] "ordinary", as <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> the aliens evil instead of discussing their morality. Despite this, he wrote that the story was still enjoyable, with a [...] "delightfully ludicrous" [...] set-up, [...] "vividly realized" [...] period setting, and the characterisation of Dickens. Burk's coauthor, Robert Smith? , called the episode a [...] "complete mess". He felt that Gatiss was attempting to recreate the classic series, but that it came across as [...] "half-hearted". He felt that there was no moral dilemma and Sneed underwent an unsettling character change. While he noted that Eccleston and Piper were [...] "excellent", he felt that Rose and the Doctor's developing relationship was not subtle.|$|E

So I bought an acoustic guitar for £2 and figured that I'd get that bass sound if I just tuned the strings down an octave, but of course <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> a pointless, flapping noise." ...|$|E

BAFTA-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan said [...] "As far as I know, the only VFX on our costume was the green glove Charlize wore to hide her arm and they also took out wires from the harnesses.

2500|$|Our government, {{under our}} Constitution, was {{established}} upon {{the principles of}} Federalism -- {{that the federal government}} would have limited enumerated powers and the rest would be left to the states. It not only prevented tyranny, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> good sense. States become laboratories for democracy and experiment with different kinds of laws. One state might try one welfare reform approach, for example. Another state might try another approach. One would work and the other would not. The federal welfare reform law resulted from just this process. [...] Federalism also allows for the diversity that exists among the country's people. Citizens of our various states have different views as to how traditional state responsibilities should be handled. This way, states compete with each other to attract people and businesses -- and that is a good thing.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{title is}} a catchphrase used by Ghoulardi, the 1960s horror host alter-ego of Cleveland {{television}} presenter Ernie Anderson. Carney called the title [...] "a shout-out to Ohio", {{the state in}} which he and Auerbach grew up. The title also captured the despondent tone of the record. Auerbach said, [...] "We liked the association with Ghoulardi, this kind of weird freak from Ohio from the early 60s – that was a phrase he used to use. And then {{so much of the}} album was lyrically melancholy and introspective and personal, so it was very blue. I guess <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> sense." [...] Carney explained the original context in which Ghoulardi used the phrase: [...] "It's [...] way of telling people to fuck off." [...] The cover art, which features an image of a blue and magenta spiral, was designed by Michael Carney, the group's art director and Patrick's brother. After selecting the title, Patrick said the group began [...] "referencing early '60s sci-fi, shows like The Outer Limits and Twilight Zone" [...] for the art direction, due to Ghoulardi's association with the genre. The album's artwork was influenced by Carney's interest in mind control; the subject drew his attention after he feuded on Twitter with fans of pop star Justin Bieber. Director Harmony Korine subsequently recommended Carney watch the 1985 film The Peanut Butter Solution, in which a teacher uses mind control on students to make them build paintbrushes. The film inspired the hypnotism wheel on the cover and in the album's promotional videos.|$|E

Well perhaps this Guitar Mashing, download only, release from the highly talented Tim Scott can provide at least one solution. Here seven highly intricate instrumental tracks have been given a solid dance back beat and a remix that makes them fun to listen to, and even if you're not about to spend the night in a sleazy club in Ibiza this is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. What's more it's still technically breath-taking so none of the expertise is lost, <b>it's</b> <b>just</b> <b>made</b> accessible to a much wider audience.
