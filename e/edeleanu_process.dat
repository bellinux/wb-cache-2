50|$|His most {{significant}} invention, was the <b>Edeleanu</b> <b>process</b> (1908). It {{is a process}} in which petroleum is refined with liquid sulfur dioxide to selectively extract aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene, etc.). The procedure was first applied experimentally in Romania at the Vega Refinery and later spread to France (notably Rouen), Germany, and subsequently throughout the world.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Edeleanu</b> <b>process</b> {{is a type}} of {{extraction}} process in the petroleum refining industry, whereby liquid sulfur dioxide is used to extract aromatics from kerosene pool, Liquid SO2 selectively dissolves the aromatics leaving behind the low aromatic content kerosene as the finished product. The aromatic extract is then separated from SO2 through rectification and SO2 recirculation. Temperature is maintained at -20Â°C.By using a blend of sulfur dioxide and benzene, some improvement can be effected, more suitable solvents such as furfural, phenol and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone are used.|$|E
