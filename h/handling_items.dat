40|$|Abstract. High utility itemset (HUI) mining is {{a popular}} data mining task. It {{consists}} of discovering sets of items generating high profit in a transaction database. Several efficient algorithms have been proposed for this task. But few can <b>handle</b> <b>items</b> with negative unit profits despite that such items occurs in many real-life transaction databases. Mining HUIs in a database where items have positive and negative unit prof-its is a very computationally expensive task. To address this issue, we present an efficient algorithm named FHN (Faster High-Utility itemset miner with Negative unit profits). FHN discovers HUIs without gener-ating candidates and introduces several strategies to <b>handle</b> <b>items</b> with negative unit profits efficiently. Experimental results with six real-life datasets shows that FHN is up to 500 times faster and can use up to 250 times less memory than the state-of-the-art algorithm HUINIV-Mine...|$|R

40|$|Wholesalers and {{retailers}} {{that are not}} currently <b>handling</b> <b>items</b> produced in south Florida {{will have to be}} convinced that it is in their best competitive interests to do so, and those that are handling them must be encouraged to improve their marketing efforts. These are the biggest challenges to Florida's growers and shippers. A recent survey of produce buyers of major supermarket chains in the U. S. conducted by researchers at Cornell University revealed that supply availability, profit potential, nutritional information, vendor support, ripeness information, preparation and recipe information were important factors in deciding whether or not to carry a new produce item. Other factors which influenced their decision to carry or not carry an item included residue-free evidence, test marketing results and availability of point of sale material. Further, chain produce buyers participating in the Cornell study felt that the burden of providing marketing and promotional information for new produce items rested on suppliers (51 percent), commodity organizations (28 percent) and national trade organizations (7 percent). Only 12 percent felt retailers were primarily responsible for providing their customers with such information (McLaughlin and Perosio, 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|The testlet {{response}} {{model is}} designed for <b>handling</b> <b>items</b> that are clustered, such as those embedded within the same reading passage. Although the testlet is {{a powerful tool for}} handling item clusters in educational and psychological testing, the interpretations of its item parameters, the conditional correlation between item pairs, and the testlet information function are not always clear. For example, the a-parameter in a testlet response model, which is sometimes referred to as the discrimination parameter and interpreted in the conventional way, is often directly compared to the a-parameter in standard item response models. In this article, it is argued that despite the deceptively similar forms of the a-parameters, such interpretation and comparison can be misleading. A marginalized version of the testlet model is introduced to derive quantities that are comparable to standard item response models. This mean (marginal-ization) of the function approach is contrasted with the temptingly simple but inappropriate func-tion of the mean approach, in which the testlet effect is set to its mean of zero in respective equations for item response, correlation, and information functions. Testlet data collected from a science assessment within the National Assessment of Educational Progress are used to illustrate the subtle differences in the interpretations of the various response models...|$|E

The relevance {{of this study is}} determined by the growth of professional speech works, regulatory and guide professional activities and professional communication of the modern expert. Professional self-determination of linguistic identity is characterized {{as a result of the}} orientation of a person in the world of labour represented by professional texts. From the psycholinguistic viewpoint, the orientation of linguistic identity is based on language and speech types of relationships between a specialist and the environment. In order to develop a more comprehensive picture of psycholinguistic aspects of language socialization of the personality in the labour world the article described the psycholinguistic model of professional self-determination of linguistic identity, including linguistic, stylistic and interiorization stages that reveal patterns of perception and reproduction of professional texts by a person. The author characterizes the categories which create the mentioned model. Professional self-determination of linguistic identity is revealed through the image of professional world, generated in the process of professional texts perception. Professional texts are characterized as totality of social developed ways of <b>handling</b> <b>items</b> of work and techniques of professional communication expressed in speech.

40|$|Purpose. Functional Capacity Evaluations (FCEs) are {{batteries}} {{of tests}} {{designed to measure}} patients' ability to perform work-related activities. Although FCEs are used worldwide, it is unknown how patients' performances compare between countries or settings. This study was performed to explore similarities and differences in FCE performance of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) between three international settings that utilize the same FCE protocol. Methods. Standardized FCEs were performed on three cohorts of patients with CLBP: A sample from an outpatient rehabilitation context in The Netherlands (n = 121), a Canadian sample in a Worker's Compensation context (n 273), and a Swiss sample in an inpatient rehabilitation context (n 170). Patients were undergoing FCE {{as part of their}} usual clinical care. Means and standard deviations of maximum performance on the FCE material <b>handling</b> <b>items</b> were calculated and differences compared using ANOVA. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the relationship between country of origin and FCE performance while controlling for potential confounders including, age, sex, duration of back pain problems, and self-reported pain and disability ratings. Results. Compared to the Dutch sample, the mean performance of patients in the Canadian and Swiss samples was consistently lower on all FCE items. This association remained statistically significant after controlling for potential confounders. Conclusions. Considerable differences were observed between settings in maximum weight handled on the various FCE items. Future FCE research should examine the effects of a number of potentially influential factors, including variability in evaluator judgements across settings, the evaluator-patient interaction and patients' expectations of the influence of FCE results on disability compensation...|$|E
40|$|In the 3 {{years to}} June 30, 2008, 4, 633 {{injuries}} occurring underground at NSW (Australia) coal mines {{were reported to}} the insurer. Equipment was involved in 2149 of these injuries (46 %). The narrative field accompanying these reports was examined to determine opportunities for controlling injury risks. The most common equipment types involved were: Continuous miner (12 % of all underground injuries); Bolting machines (6 %); LHD (8 %); Longwall (7 %); Personnel Transport (4 %); and Shuttle Car (3 %). The most common combinations of equipment and mechanism were: strains while <b>handling</b> <b>items</b> associated with continuous miner or bolting machines; strains, or being struck by, or caught between, while drilling or bolting on a continuous miner or bolting machine; driving or traveling over rough roads {{in a variety of}} equipment; being struck by while operating Longwall equipment. Rare, but high potential consequence events reported during the period included: interactions between personnel and mobile equipment; interactions between personnel and Longwall shield movements; transport equipment collisions. A range of potential short-term control measures for these risks have been identified, including monorails for continuous miner services; redesign of continuous miner platforms and bolting rigs to reduce reach distances during drilling and bolting; improvements to guarding of bolting controls; standardisation and shape coding of bolting controls; two handed fast-speed drilling & bolting; improvements in underground roadway maintenance, vehicle suspension, visibility and seating; and proximity detection devices interlocked with mobile equipment controls. Longer term control measures include automated bolting, and mesh placement, in conjunction with either non-line-of-sight remote control of, or automated, continuous mining machines...|$|E

The purpose of such management is to ensure the traceability towards details that had been kept should there is needs to use it {{any time in the}} future. Mails record are usually recorded manually in a record book. The common problem faced with the manual records is it is outdated and finding of records are difficult and time consuming. Apart from that, the possibility that the record kept are loss or damage is high because physical records requires more attention in terms of ensuring the spaces provided for them is not preoccupied with other documents to prevent any mixed up of records. Besides that, it is difficult to hand over mails item to intended staff due to the needs to call each staff to acknowledge them regarding received mails. This problem consumed time and delayed the process of <b>handling</b> <b>items</b> to the receiver. The purpose of this thesis is to study and analyse mail system at IBS Technology Kuala Lumpur and to develop a computerized mail system according to user requirement. The methodology used for this study is Scrum in Agile Methodology which generally allows the system to be developed flexibly and able to respond to changes made even during development of system. The system developed is tested by using User Acceptance Test (UAT) which is carried out to ensure the system is developed based on user requirement and to track any error or improper way of a system behaviour so that correction can be made before implementation. The final result of the study is the implementation of the Mail Management System (MMS). The system is developed fully and record is kept in the system and searching of record can be made by different criteria...|$|E
