25|$|Personalized {{tourniquet}} systems utilize {{an internal}} <b>electrical</b> <b>pump</b> to compress ambient air {{to a low}} pressure; these systems do not require external high-pressure sources, such as portable canisters, portable tanks, or built-in hospital systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{personalized}} tourniquet instruments, {{the internal}} <b>electrical</b> <b>pump,</b> pressure display, and pressure regulator are combined {{in a single}} instrument in which a microprocessor continuously monitors and compensates for changing levels of pressure in the cuff bladder. Regulation does not rely on mechanical (pressure) forces to turn valves off and on. Instead, the microprocessor can detect extremely small changes in the cuff pressure and automatically regulate the flow of gas to control the pressure.|$|E

This report will explain some ways the <b>electrical</b> submersible <b>pump</b> can be installed and describe the different components in an <b>electrical</b> submersible <b>pump.</b> The report will also give an insight in how <b>electrical</b> submersible <b>pumps</b> have been used and improvements done to the <b>electrical</b> submersible <b>pump</b> on two different fields. The main part will describe a method to screen wells and find out if installing an <b>electrical</b> submersible <b>pump</b> will be profitable. The method is to estimate future oil production, based on real-time production, with and without an ESP installed, and calculate the net present value. The method takes into account costs of installing, running and removing an <b>electrical</b> submersible <b>pump.</b> The ESP screening tool is screening the wells automatically. In addition it does an ESP simulation to find applicable pumps. For the ten wells screened by the ESP screening tool, the net present values have been negative, due to weak water cut estimation. </p...|$|R

5000|$|A {{very common}} {{application}} is in sump pumps and condensate pumps where the switch detects the rising {{level of liquid}} in the sump or tank and energizes an <b>electrical</b> <b>pump</b> which then pumps liquid out until {{the level of the}} liquid has been substantially reduced, at which point the pump is switched off again.

50|$|Usually {{hardwired}} into a home's <b>electrical</b> system, sump <b>pumps</b> {{may have}} a battery backup. The home's pressurized water supply powers some pumps, {{eliminating the need for}} electricity at the expense of using potable water, potentially making them more expensive to operate than <b>electrical</b> <b>pumps</b> and creating an additional water disposal problem. Since a sump basin may overflow if not constantly pumped, a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time, as during a severe storm.|$|R

5000|$|The tower's {{construction}} date is uncertain, but {{has been}} reported as standing at this site since roughly {{the turn of the}} 20th century. It was probably built to supply water to the Rogers family farmstead, a 1770s farm property.

50|$|At {{the peak}} of the instruments' Western {{popularity}} around 1900, a wide variety of styles of harmoniums were being produced. These ranged from simple models with plain cases and only four or five stops (if any at all), up to large instruments with ornate cases, up to a dozen stops and other mechanisms such as couplers. Expensive harmoniums were often built to resemble pipe organs, with ranks of fake pipes attached {{to the top of the}} instrument. Small numbers of harmoniums were built with two manuals (keyboards). Some were even built with pedal keyboards, which required the use of an assistant to run the bellows or, for some of the later models, an <b>electrical</b> <b>pump.</b> These larger instruments were mainly intended for home use, such as allowing organists to practise on an instrument on the scale of a pipe organ, but without the physical size or volume of such an instrument. For missionaries, chaplains in the armed forces, travelling evangelists, and the like, reed organs that folded up into a container the size of a very large suitcase or small trunk were made; these had a short keyboard and few stops, but they were more than adequate for keeping hymn singers more or less on pitch.|$|E
50|$|Existing {{photographs}} of the engine bay of the final pre-production version of this system clearly show the liquid coolant from both separators was piped along the bottom {{left side of the}} engine compartment and into the right wing. The header tanks were located in the outer wing panels ahead of the main spar and immediately outboard of the main landing gear bays. The tanks extended over the same portion of the outer panel's span as the outer flaps. Coolant from the right wing header tank was pumped by a separate, <b>electrical</b> <b>pump</b> to the left wing header tank. Along the way from the right to left wing, the coolant passed through a conventional radiator mounted {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. That radiator was retractable and intended for use only during ground-running or low-speed flight. Nevertheless, coolant passed through it whenever the engine was running and regardless of whether it was extended or retracted. In the retracted position, the radiator offered little cooling, but some heat was exchanged into the aft fuselage. Finally, a return tube connected the left wing's header tank to that on the right. This allowed the coolant to equalize between the two header tanks and circulate through the retractable radiator. The engine drew coolant directly from both header tanks through two separate pipes that ran through the main landing gear bays, up the firewall at the back of the engine compartment, and into the usual coolant intakes located at the top rear of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{myths and}} legends {{are part of}} the student's culture:----La Cebolla: The logo of the {{university}} is called [...] "La Cebolla" [...] or [...] "the onion" [...] in Spanish in contrast to its technological symbolism (it was inspired by the photograph of an electric circuit). It was designed to represent a group of doors one into another, a metaphor for the hard work and effort students have {{to do in order to}} walk from the big door that leads them in, to the little one that leads them out (see http://www.usb.ve/institucion/simbolos.html).----A brief history and description:The sculpture creation started in 1975 when Gabriel Martin Landrove, a USB architect student, won an institutional contest. Construction took place until July 5, 1991 when Phd Professor Stefan Zarea conducted the final works and inaugurated it. The artistic concept was inspired by the morning dew condensed over a tree sleeve falling down into another one. The sleeves are represented with 576 metal trowels arranged as a 48 by12 matrix in a conical truncated structure that allows the water to create multiple small waterfalls. This huge structure can rotate over its own vertical axis and the movement is produced by a pelton wheel dispose at the lower level of the conical structure. The rise of the water to the top and its rotational momentum is produced by hydraulic force drive by an <b>electrical</b> <b>pump.</b> There is also a tree level shallow pool, a top circular viewer and an intricate circular walk sides that complements the design.|$|E
