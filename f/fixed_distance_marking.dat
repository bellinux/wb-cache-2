5000|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>distance</b> {{recommendations}} {{are the more}} common of the two types.

5000|$|When two atoms are {{connected}} by a chemical bond, they tend to maintain a <b>fixed</b> <b>distance.</b> The <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> depends on the atoms that forms the bond. Any variation from this <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> which is the equilibrium point adds additional potential energy to the protein. This {{is similar to the}} concept of Hooke's Law, so the bond can be envisaged as a spring connecting the atoms together. Total potential energy based on bond length is over set Sbond set of pairs of atoms that {{are connected}} by chemical bond defined as; ...|$|R

50|$|The bleeder brake is a {{simplified}} version of traditional engine brakes. When the bleeder brake is turned on, a piston extends {{to its full}} stroke and stays there, holding the exhaust valve open a small, <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> throughout the entire four-stroke engine cycle. Since the bleeder brake only holds the exhaust valve open a <b>fixed</b> <b>distance,</b> it can be designed so that is does not put any load on the camshaft {{and most of the}} overhead components.|$|R

50|$|The linear {{rigid rotor}} model {{consists}} of two point masses located at <b>fixed</b> <b>distances</b> from their center of mass. The <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> between the two masses and {{the values of the}} masses are the only characteristics of the rigid model. However, for many actual diatomics this model is too restrictive since distances are usually not completely fixed. Corrections on the rigid model can be made to compensate for small variations in the distance. Even in such a case the rigid rotor model is a useful point of departure (zeroth-order model).|$|R

40|$|A {{magnetic}} field response sensor comprises an inductor placed at a <b>fixed</b> separation <b>distance</b> from a conductive surface {{to address the}} low RF transmissivity of conductive surfaces. The minimum distance for separation {{is determined by the}} sensor response. The inductor should be separated from the conductive surface so that the response amplitude exceeds noise level by a recommended 10 dB. An embodiment for closed cavity measurements comprises a capacitor internal to said cavity and an inductor mounted external to the cavity and at a <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> from the cavity s wall.

5000|$|Stating optimum viewing {{distance}} as a range {{rather than as}} <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> is on the rise; possibly because {{of changes in the}} profile of the typical HDTV purchaser. Early adopters of HDTV were typically videophiles, the technically adventurous and the sports enthusiast looking to have the ultimate viewing experience. Today, the typical HDTV consumer’s aims may be a little more modest; total immersion takes a back seat to room integration. [...] Major retail chains like Best Buy that once stated their recommendation as a <b>fixed</b> <b>distance,</b> are starting to provide range recommendations. [...] Manufacturers have also started to provide range recommendations, updating their website with small applications that denote the optimum {{viewing distance}} as a range of distances. [...] THX in March 2009, added range recommendations to their website. [...] The minimum end of the range tends to be the proponent’s <b>fixed</b> optimum <b>distance</b> recommendation.|$|R

5000|$|Note {{that the}} power needed to push an object through a fluid {{increases}} as the cube of the velocity. A car cruising on a highway at 50 mph may require only [...] to overcome air drag, but that same car at 100 mph requires [...] With a doubling of speed the drag (force) quadruples per the formula. Exerting 4 times the force over a <b>fixed</b> <b>distance</b> produces 4 times as much work. At twice the speed the work (resulting in displacement over a <b>fixed</b> <b>distance)</b> is done twice as fast. Since power is the rate of doing work, 4 times the work done in half the time requires 8 times the power.|$|R
