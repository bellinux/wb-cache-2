He eventually signed for Rotherham United of League Two on a two-year contract on 14 June 2007. His debut for Rotherham was in a 0–0 draw against Hereford United on 10 August 2007 and he scored his first goal for the team against Notts County on 22 September with a 25-yard shot into the <b>far</b> <b>corner.</b> Holmes finished 2007–08 with 27 appearances and two goals.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's first {{opportunity}} came a minute later, after West Ham midfielder Carl Fletcher conceded a free kick for a foul on Gerrard. However, the resulting free kick was hit {{into the wall}} of players {{in front of the}} West Ham penalty area. A few minutes later, West Ham scored the first goal of the match; Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso gave the ball away to Benayoun, who played it inside to Ashton. Ashton then played a through-ball to Lionel Scaloni on the right flank, before the Argentine's low cross was put into his own goal by Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher to give West Ham a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later, West Ham extended their lead, when Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina fumbled a shot from Etherington into the path of Ashton, who squeezed the rebound under Reina into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> to make it 2–0. Liverpool looked to have reduced the defect in the 30th minute, but Peter Crouch's shot from a Gerrard free kick was disallowed as Crouch was offside.|$|E
5|$|São Paulo's {{pressure}} {{resulted in}} them {{taking the lead}} in the 27th minute. A chipped pass from Aloísio to Mineiro found the midfielder in space who put the ball beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina to give the Brazilians a 1–0 lead. It was the first goal Liverpool had conceded in over 1,041 minutes of play. Immediately afterwards, Liverpool had a corner, which almost resulted in a goal. Xabi Alonso took the corner which found García, but his shot hit the woodwork. Liverpool had another chance 30 minutes into the match, but again he failed to score with a header. Gerrard had a chance to equalise five minutes later, but he put his shot wide after Harry Kewell had passed him the ball. Liverpool continued to create chances and in the 39th minute García saw his header into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> saved by São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni. From the resulting corner Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä shot straight at Ceni. He had another chance late in the first half, but his header was saved by Ceni.|$|E

5|$|Murray's {{contract}} was cancelled {{to allow him}} to join Northern Premier League Division One North club Scarborough Athletic. York dropped into the relegation zone in 23rd place after being beaten 2–0 at home by fellow strugglers Dagenham & Redbridge, who scored in each half through Jamie Cureton. Having only made appearances as a substitute during two months with York, Morris returned to Norwich after his loan expired. York took a 2–0 lead away to Luton, Carson and Sinclair scoring within five minutes of each other early in the second half. However, Hyde was sent off for a tackle on Nathan Doyle before Mark Cullen scored twice for Luton, the match finishing a 2–2 draw. Winfield, who had made only five appearances for York, signed for AFC Wimbledon on a one-month loan. York moved out of the relegation zone and above their opponents Tranmere after a 2–0 home victory, which was the team's first win in eight matches. Fletcher scored both goals in each half, the first coming after he met Halliday's low cross at the back post and the second came after collecting Coulson's pass, cutting inside and shooting into the <b>far</b> <b>corner.</b>|$|E
5|$|York moved {{two points}} above the relegation zone with a 3–0 away win over Cambridge, Fletcher giving York {{the lead on}} 43 minutes after {{collecting}} a loose ball {{on the edge of}} the penalty area and scoring with a powerful shot. Coulson scored soon after the second half began when his deep cross dropped into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> of the goal, and Hyde finished the scoring in the 55th minute when diverting Fletcher's shot from inside the six-yard box. York went behind away to AFC Wimbledon when Deji Oshilaja scored a header in the 19th minute, before Hyde scored an equaliser after goalkeeper Joe McDonnell dropped Sinclair's cross in the 43rd minute. However, Jack Smith scored the winning goal for the home team with a volley in the 90th minute, meaning the match ended in a 2–1 win for AFC Wimbledon. Shaq Coulthirst, who scored Southend's winning goal against York in January, joined on loan from Tottenham Hotspur for the rest of the season, after Fletcher was ruled out for six weeks with a hamstring injury. York drew 0–0 at home to relegation rivals Carlisle, and the team's best chances came in the 74th minute when Coulson and Sinclair had shots cleared off the line. Having made nine appearances for York, Benning was recalled by Walsall due to an injury to Andy Taylor. Tom Soares scored early as York were beaten 1–0 at home by Bury, resulting in the team only being above the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E

Bengaluru created chances late in the game, but man of the match, Mumbai goalkeeper Nidhin Lal, saved all the attempts and both teams eventually shared a point. After the mid-season break, Bengaluru played the away game against Salgaocar. The game also marked the return of top players of Bengaluru, who were away for the national duty. Bengaluru enjoyed a lion share of possession, but could not convert any chances {{in the first half and}} the game remained goalless. Robin Singh finally broke the deadlock with a pass from Rino Anto. Salgaocar had the chance to equalize when they were awarded penalty, but man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte, correctly guessed the direction and saved the penalty to secure 3 points for Bengaluru. Bengaluru ended the March on a high note with a convincing 4–1 victory at home against Sporting Clube de Goa. Bengaluru took the lead in the first half when Josh Walker's header converted a pass from Eugeneson Lyngdoh in a goal. Rino Anto, Thoi Singh, and Beikhokhei Beingaichho scored a goal each in the second half. Sporting Goa's multiple attacks, especially from Odafe Onyeka Okolie, were thwarted by man of the match Lalthuammawia Ralte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} 2000 {{transfer}} window, South African striker Sibusiso Zuma was signed from South African side Orlando Pirates, and in May 2000, English manager Roy Hodgson became the new manager. From the 2000–01 season, the club started to improve. The club won its second Superliga championship, winning 3–1 {{in the last}} New Firm derby match of the season, at the Parken Stadium. The 2–0 goal was a bicycle kick by Zuma, who received the ball at his chest, bounced {{it in the air}} and in the same motion executed the overhead kick, volleying the ball into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> out of Brøndby goalkeeper Mogens Krogh's reach. This was later voted the Danish goal of the year, and was voted the best Superliga goal of the decade in December 2009 and was in 2013 voted as the greatest moment in the history of FCK. Roy Hodgson broke his contract with Copenhagen a few weeks after having won the championship, signing with Italian team Udinese, and he was replaced by Swede Kent Karlsson. The 2001 season is also remembered for a highly dramatic event. During training on 13 March 2001 charismatic midfielder Ståle Solbakken suffered a heart attack. He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but {{on the way to the}} hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.|$|E

500|$|Needing to beat Inter Milan {{to win the}} Emirates Cup, Arsenal {{failed to}} take the {{initiative}} and went behind after 62 minutes. William Gallas' negligence to spot the incoming David Suazo meant the Inter striker was able to head the ball past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. Arsenal regrouped quickly and scored five minutes later; a well-worked move between Eboué and Bacary Sagna set Hleb up to shoot, but his effort was saved by Toldo. The ball rebounded to the Arsenal midfielder, whose second shot went into the <b>far</b> <b>corner.</b> Near the end of normal time Robin van Persie scored a [...] "wonder goal" [...] to secure the win. Collecting a long pass from Eboué, the striker weaved past his opponent and dragged the ball back, before hitting it high into the <b>far</b> <b>corner.</b> Wenger said of Van Persie's winner: [...] "It was a great goal but I'm pleased we had a great team performance.

[...] The Democratic candidates for the 1972 presidential election sought out his endorsement. In January 1972 Gravel did endorse Maine Senator Ed Muskie, hoping his endorsement would help Muskie with the party's left wing and in the ethnic French-Canadian areas in first primary state New Hampshire (which Muskie won, but not strongly, and his campaign faltered soon thereafter). In April 1972, Gravel appeared on all three network nightly newscasts to decry the Nixon administration's reliance on Vietnamization by making reference to the secret National Security Study Memorandum 1 document, which stated it would take 8–13 years before the Army of the Republic of Vietnam could defend South Vietnam. Gravel made excerpts from the study public, but his attempt to read NSSM 1 into the Congressional Record was blocked by Senators Robert P. Griffin and William B. Saxbe.|$|E
500|$|The first close game of {{the season}} game in early November in a conference game against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in Minneapolis. In a game played in 35 minute halves at Athletic Field in Minneapolis, the Wolverines came away with the win by a score of 6–4. Michigan came within ten yards of a {{touchdown}} five minutes into the game but did not score. The first half ended in a scoreless tie. When Michigan scored its touchdown in the second half, Michigan fans in the bleachers signaled the event with cowbells. Michigan's touchdown was scored by fullback duffy and the goal after touchdown was kicked by Ferbert. Minnesota responded with a touchdown (worth 4 points under 1896 rules), but the score came at the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> of the field where a straight kick for the goal after touchdown (worth 2 points) was impossible. Accordingly, Minnesota attempted a double kick, kicking the ball first to the fullback Loomis. Loomis caught the ball so close to the goal posts that his kick for goal [...] "was easily stopped by Michigan players." [...] The blocked kick was the difference in a close game. Michigan's lineup was Hutchins (right end), Henninger (right tackle), Bennett (right guard), Wombacher (center), Carr (left guard), Villa (left tackle), Farnham (left end), Felver (quarterback), Caley (right halfback), Ferbert (left halfback), and Hogg and Duff at fullback.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result is good for the English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse race is not good for the game." [...] Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool, in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal faced West Ham United in {{the first}} weekend of October. Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Overmars were rested for the match, {{replaced}} by Oleh Luzhny, Slyvinho and Davor Šuker. In spite of general dominance from Arsenal, West Ham striker Paolo di Canio scored in each half to win his team the match. Patrick Vieira was dismissed during play for a foul on Di Canio. A confrontation soon after occurred between the player and Neil Ruddock. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. Šuker scored twice against Everton at Highbury on 16 October 1999. Arsenal then travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Goals from Tore André Flo and Dan Petrescu seemed to have given the home side victory, before Kanu scored a hat-trick {{in the space of}} 15 minutes. His first involved extending his legs and stabbing the ball past goalkeeper Ed de Goey, once it fell kindly in his direction. The equaliser came in the 83rd minute: Kanu received the ball from Overmars, which took him away from goal but hit the ball to the left of De Goey’s dive. In injury time Kanu, in the downpour, chased down the ball and dribbled past the stranded Chelsea goalkeeper on the byline, before curling the ball over Frank Leboeuf and into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> of the goal net. Kanu's teammate Šuker described the third goal as [...] "beautiful", while Bergkamp added: [...] "The skills he has got, the moves he makes, are something you like to watch and learn from. I watch him in training and it is a joy." [...] The month ended with a goalless draw at home to Newcastle United, which left Arsenal fourth, three points behind league leaders Leeds United.|$|E
500|$|Fergie's fledglings began November in {{the same}} fashion they ended the {{previous}} month – with a rout. Sheringham, Cole and Solskjær all scored twice each at home to Sheffield Wednesday, in a game that they could have scored so many more. David Pleat managed to get sympathy from Ferguson who admitted [...] "every shot United had in the first half went in" [...] but not from the board, cumulating in his sacking the following Monday. The talk of a one-horse race for the Premiership was put on hold after defeat to Arsenal at Highbury. The psychological impact of United opening up a seven-point lead had they won would have been too much ground {{to make up for the}} challengers. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger admitted before the game that defeat would make it [...] "difficult for them" [...] to catch up on United's ground but not [...] "impossible". The Gunners put themselves in front with Nicolas Anelka's first goal for the club and Patrick Vieira's swooping shot which left Schmeichel rattled. Sheringham's admirable brace just before half time left the match finely poised but former United trainee David Platt headed into the <b>far</b> <b>corner</b> with seven minutes left. Thumping Wimbledon courtesy of a Beckham brace and goals from Cole, Scholes and Butt was the perfect response after their second defeat of the season and United bettered it at home to Blackburn Rovers, the only team with an unbeaten away record. A 4–0 win ensured distance between themselves and the challengers, popping the question as to which team was capable of stopping them. The Red Devils managed to score 30 goals in the last nine fixtures prior to this game and qualification to the quarter finals of the Champions League meant that they could prolong their rich domestic goal-scoring form. Ferguson understandably quashed any sort of hype, but admitted that they were in an [...] "ideal position", in comparison to the same point in the last season.|$|E
