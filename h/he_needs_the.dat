She reports that forensics teams are attending each crime scene {{and they are}} recovering 9mm bullet casings, vacuuming for hair and fiber and laser printing for footprints. Daniels returns and is asked {{to confirm that the}} bodies are linked to one organization. He tells Burrell that Marlo Stanfield's drug organization is their prime focus and is then asked what they have on Stanfield. He explains that Major Crimes was building a case against Stanfield until three months ago when their wiretaps were pulled by Lieutenant Marimow. Burrell offers Daniels whatever support he needs. Daniels tells Burrell that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E
25|$|In May 2016, Peggy {{returns to}} the Square having been {{diagnosed}} with terminal breast cancer. She decides to stop her treatment, but Phil tries to change her mind, enlisting the help of Sharon. Sharon then calls Grant in Portugal, leaving a voicemail saying that his family needs him. Grant {{returns to the}} square soon after and walks in on Phil and Peggy. He plans to take Peggy with him back to Portugal, only {{for her to say}} that her cancer has returned. Grant is angry when she reveals that she had planned to tell him and Sam through letters to them after she died, and that she plans to commit suicide. Phil and Grant seemingly convince Peggy not to do this. Grant tells Phil <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> money that he lent him immediately but knows he cannot get it so threatens him unless he returns the money. Grant then returns to Portugal, only for Sharon to call him again to inform him that Peggy has killed herself. When Sam returns to Walford for Peggy's funeral, she reveals that Grant is unable to come to the funeral.|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Not on Board" [...] makes several media references. The plot {{itself is}} {{inspired}} by the film Home Alone. At the Quahog Day Spa, Peter mentions that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> sauna's treatment after a stressful morning; the scene cuts to a non-sequitur that parodies the opening scene of Back to the Future. Another scene in the spa references the film Ghost; representations of the film's stars, Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore, are on top of Peter's back giving him a massage. After Lois chastises Peter, he recites the speech John Candy made in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles nearly verbatim. Chris asks his friend why in the Lord of the Rings films Frodo and Gandalf walk to get to Mordor instead of taking the Eagle that was used {{at the end of}} the story.

2500|$|The State of the Union {{address is}} an annual speech {{presented}} by the President of the United States to {{a joint session of}} the United States Congress, except {{in the first year of}} a new president's term. The address not only reports on the condition of the nation but also allows the President to outline his legislative agenda (for which <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> cooperation of Congress) and national priorities. The address fulfills rules in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, requiring the President to periodically give Congress information on the [...] "state of the union" [...] and recommend any measures that he believes are necessary and expedient. During most of the country's first century, the President primarily only submitted a written report to Congress. With the advent of radio and television, the address is now broadcast live across the country on most networks.|$|E
2500|$|Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who had {{previously}} collaborated with Guadagnino in Ferdinando Cito Filomarino's Antonia (2015), served {{as the director of}} photography. Guadagnino and Filomarino developed an [...] "exquisite and extraordinary" [...] relationship with Mukdeeprom during the production of Antonia, the cinematographer's first non-Thai film. Lighting {{is an important factor in}} Mukdeeprom's work, as <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> light to be engaged with the characters. In order to capture the Northern Italian summer atmosphere for Call Me by Your Name, he had to create completely artificial light, due to the heavy rains that lasted the entirety of the shoot. He also connected to the actors during the scene; when they finished shooting the first take of the confrontation between Oliver and Elio, he was crying in a corner of the room. The film was shot using a 35 mm lens, a decision influenced by the work of David Cronenberg in order to [...] "solidif the point of view." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couplet {{brings the}} sonnet {{together}} in a happy light. Throughout the sonnet we're learning about the poet's dark confessions to finding his ideal love and realizing the only love that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> most is of the young mans. Jane Roessner notices how the line [...] "then give me welcome, next my heaven the best" [...] is [...] "the poet's need of pity from the young man and how his long confession important for {{its effect on the}} young man, calculated to move him to a certain response." [...] Line 13 is the poet begging the young man to forgive him and to embrace him. The phrase in line 13 [...] "next my heaven the best" [...] is the poet confessing to the young man that his love is like his heaven. He is the closest thing to the divine. Radley and Redding state that the poet is saying, [...] "your love is next of the divine (ideal), grant me a welcome sanctuary in your person." [...] The couplet is the most powerful part of the sonnet because now he is saying that the love the young man provides is great next to this divine being.|$|E

We shall, after we have put out to sea, disguise the brig and rig her as a merchantman in order to tempt them out. We shall not do it until we are well away, for the pirates may have friends here who might send them information. We shall head for the south, and shall give out that we are to rejoin our commander off Alexandria, as we have only come round here to give you news of the retreat of the French. We shall be glad if you will furnish us with two men having a thorough knowledge of the islands, and of the spots where the piratical craft are most likely to harbour. They must be trusty men who will not open their lips here as to our designs." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{frequently}} saw old ruined {{houses of}} which there only remained two walls of stone, to which the nomads had added two walls of canvas making an exact cube in form with the most startling incongruity in colour. <b>He</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> form {{and he does not}} mind the incongruity, nor does he mind the fact that somebody else has done the solid part and he has only done the ramshackle part. You can say that he is nobly superior to jealousy, or that he is without artistic ambition, or that he is too much of a nomad to mind living half in somebody else's house and half in his own. The real quality is probably too subtle for any simple praise or blame; we can only say that there is in the wandering Moslem a curious kind of limited common sense; which might even be called a short-sighted common sense. But however we define it, that is what can really be traced through Arab conquests and Arab culture in all its ingenuity and insufficiency. That is the note of these nomads in all the things in which they have succeeded and failed. In that sense they are constructive and in that sense unconstructive; in that sense artistic and in that sense inartistic; in that sense practical and in that sense unpractical; in that sense cunning and in that sense innocent. The curtains they would hang round Stonehenge might be of beautifully selected colours. The banners they waved from Stonehenge might be defended with glorious courage and enthusiasm. The prayers they recited in Stonehenge might be essentially worthy of human dignity, and certainly a great improvement on its older associations of human sacrifice. All this is true of Islam and the idolatries and negations are often replaced. But they would not have built Stonehenge; they would scarcely, so to speak, have troubled to lift a stone of Stonehenge. They would not have built Stonehenge; how much less Salisbury or Glastonbury or Lincoln.|$|E
60|$|I {{go to the}} Bank {{and read}} Galignani and the American newspapers; thence I stroll to the Pincian or to the Medici Gardens; I see {{a good deal of}} General Pierce, and we talk over his Presidential life, which, I now really think, he has no latent desire nor purpose to renew. Yet he seems to have enjoyed it while it lasted, and {{certainly}} he was in his element as an administrative man; not far-seeing, not possessed of vast stores of political wisdom in advance of his occasions, but endowed with a miraculous intuition of what ought to be done just at the time for action. His judgment of things about him is wonderful, and his Cabinet recognized it as such; for though they were men of great ability, he was evidently the master-mind among them. None of them were particularly his personal friends when he selected them; they all loved him when they parted; and he showed me a letter, signed by all, in which they expressed their feelings of respect and attachment at the close of his administration. There was a noble frankness on his part, that kept the atmosphere always clear among them, and in reference to this characteristic Governor Marcy told him that the years during which he had been connected with his Cabinet had been the happiest of his life. Speaking of Caleb Cushing, he told me that the unreliability, the fickleness, which is usually attributed to him, is an actual characteristic, but that it is intellectual, not moral. He has such comprehensiveness, such mental variety and activity, that, if left to himself, he cannot keep fast hold of one view of things, and so cannot, without external help, be a consistent man. <b>He</b> <b>needs</b> <b>the</b> influence of a more single and stable judgment to keep him from divergency, and, on this condition, he is a most inestimable coadjutor. As regards learning and ability, he has no superior.|$|E
