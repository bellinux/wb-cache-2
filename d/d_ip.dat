50|$|Mbone is {{a virtual}} network built {{on top of the}} Internet. The purpose of Mbone is to {{minimize}} the amount of data required for multipoint audio/video-conferencing. Mbone is free and it uses a network of routers that support IP multicast, and it enables access to real-time interactive multimedia on the Internet. Many older routers do not support IP multicast. To cope with this, tunnels must be set up on both ends: multicast packets are encapsulated in unicast packets and sent through a tunnel. Mbone uses a small subset of the class <b>D</b> <b>IP</b> address space (224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255) assigned for multicast traffic. Mbone uses 224.2.0.0 for multimedia conferencing.|$|E
50|$|Multicast is what {{enables a}} node {{on a network}} to address one unit of data to a {{specific}} group of receivers.In interactive multicast at the data link or network layer, such as IP multicast, Ethernet multicast or MBMS service over cellular network, receivers may join and leave the group using an interaction channel. Only one copy of the data is sent from the source, and multiple copies are created and then sent to the desired recipient by the network infrastructure nodes. In for example IP multicast, a multicast group is identified by a class <b>D</b> <b>IP</b> address. A host enters or exits a group using IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol). A message sent via multicast is sent to all nodes on the network, but only the intended nodes accept the multicast frames. Multicasting is useful in situations such as video conferencing and online gaming. Multicast was used originally in LANs, with Ethernet being the best example. A problem with multicast communication {{is that it is}} difficult to guarantee that only designated receivers receive the data being sent. This is largely because multicast groups are always changing; users come and go at any time. A solution to the problem of ensuring that only the chosen recipient obtains the data is known as multicast encryption.|$|E

Extreme dwarfs were characterized by a tufted growth habit which could be distinguished {{from the time of}} germination, while the other dwarf lines could be distinguished only after anthesis. The F 1 hybrids between the tall and dwarf genotypes were tall, indicating that dwarfness is a recessive trait. In 10 out of the 13 crosses, the F 2 segregation ratio was three tall to one dwarf (3 ratio 1) suggesting that the dwarfness is controlled by a single recessive gene, while the height differences in 3 of the dwarfs (IP 8056, IP 8210 and IP 8214) were controlled by more than one gene as they showed continuous variation for plant height in F 2.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes the ASIMcast (Any-Source Implicit Multicast) {{protocol}} which {{builds a}} bidirectional tree for routing of multicast traffic. ASIMcast includes features addressing issues {{which have been}} slowing down the deployment of multicast until now. ASIMcast does not use class <b>D</b> <b>IP</b> addresses to forward multicast data but normal unicast addresses instead. This prevents the collision of different multicast sessions, but mainly, it eases the deployment of multicast by having non-multicast routers (or domains) process multicast traffic {{as if it were}} unicast. For the same reason, multicast interdomain routing stops being an issue. ASIMcast also reduces routers memory usage by having routing states stored only at branching routers; non-branching routers are only involved when the tree is being optimized. Finally, ASIMcast is an efficient approach to provide several channels per multicast session with the possibility for the end-user to specify which channel it wants to receive. Simulation and implementation have proved the feasibility and the scalability of ASIMcast. I...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{multicast}} protocol called REUNITE. The key idea of REUNITE {{is to use}} recursive unicast trees to implement multicast service. REUNITE does not use class <b>D</b> <b>IP</b> addresses. Instead, both group identification and data forwarding are based on unicast IP addresses. Compared with existing IP multicast protocols, REUNITE has several unique properties. First, only routers that are acting as multicast tree branching points for a group need to keep multicast forwarding state of the group. All other non-branching-point routers simply forward data packets by unicast routing. In addition, REUNITE can be incrementally deployed {{in the sense that}} it works even if only a subset of the routers implement the protocol. Furthermore, REUNITE supports load balancing and graceful degradation such that when a router does not have resources (forwarding table entry, buffer space, processing power) to support additional multicast groups, the branching can be automatically migrated to other less load [...] ...|$|E

In this context, recent re- searches have addressed Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) net- works, which benefit of very high broadcast capacities, but are unidirectionnal. Coupling a DVB network with a bidi- rectional network brings bidirectionality and service inter- activity. In this context, we focus on a DVB-SH (satellite services for hand-held devices) network, which is a hybrid (satel- lite/terrestrial) standard. We couple DVB-SH with a 3 G cellular network, thus providing bidirectionality. DVB-SH benefits from a very high bandwidth capacity that allows unidirectional IP-TV channels broadcast. A residual bandwidth in the DVB-SH path may still be avail- able because of the variable bit rates of served flows. In a previous study [1], we focused on this small residual bandwidth and its potential utilization.

40|$|Background—Rapamycin is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration. Rapamycin-mediated inhibition of SMC proliferation is associated with upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 27 Kip 1. Previously, we showed that mixed embryonic fibroblasts obtained from p 27 Kip 1 (2 / 2) mice were relatively rapamycin-resistant, suggesting that p 27 Kip 1 plays an integral role in modulating the antiproliferative effects of rapamycin. We hypothesized that the antimigratory effect of rapamycin may also be mediated by p 27 Kip 1. Methods and Results—Rapamycin (1 to 10 nmol/L) inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor–induced migration of wild-type (WT) but not p 27 Kip 1 (2 / 2) SMCs in a dose-dependent manner (P, 0. 05) in a modified Boyden chamber.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{observation}} and cross section measurement of exclusive photon pair production in proton-antiproton collisions at √ s = 1. 96 TeV {{taken by the}} Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab. We select events with two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energy ET> 2. 5 GeV and pseudorapidity |η | < 1. 0, with no other particles detected in − 7. 4 <η < + 7. 4. The two showers have similar ET and have ∆φ ∼ π. A subset of those events having charged tracks {{are consistent with the}} QED process p ¯p → p+e + e − + ¯p by two-photon exchange, giving confidence in the selection methods for the exclusive diphoton events. A subset without any charged tracks are candidates for the exclusive process p+ ¯p → p+γγ + ¯p. Data from wire chambers near electromagnetic shower maximum shows that a possible background from exclusive π 0 π 0 production is consistent with zero, as expected, and other backgrounds are negligible. The events are explained as the double pomeron exchange process (<b>D</b> <b>IP</b> E) : IP + IP → γ+ γ, observed here for the first time. The measured cross section is in agreement with a perturbative QCD calculation. This process is closely related to exclusive Higgs boson production p+ p → p+H+ p, that could be observed at the LHC.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{activation}} of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) - 3 β {{may be involved in}} burn injury-induced metabolic derangements and protein breakdown in skeletal muscle. However, the mechanism for GSK- 3 β activation after burn injury is unknown. To investigate the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in this scenario, a major mediator of inflammation, we examined the effects of a specific inhibitor for iNOS, L-NIL, on GSK- 3 β activity in skeletal muscle of burned rats. MATERIALS/METHODS: Full-thickness third degree burn injury comprising 40 % of total body surface area was produced under anesthesia in male Sprague-Dawley rats (160 - 190 g) by immersing the back of the trunk for 15 s and the abdomen for 8 s in 80 °C water. Burned and sham-burned rats were treated with L-NIL (60 mg/kg BW, b. i. <b>d.</b> <b>IP)</b> or phosphate-buffered saline for three days. GSK- 3 β activity in skeletal muscle was evaluated by immune complex kinase assay, and by phosphorylation status of GSK- 3 β and its endogenous substrate, glycogen synthase. RESULTS: GSK- 3 β activity was increased in a time-dependent manner in skeletal muscle after burn injury, concomitant with the induction of iNOS expression. iNOS inhibitor, L-NIL, reverted the elevated GSK- 3 β activity in skeletal muscle of burned rats, although L-NIL did not alter GSK- 3 β activity in sham-burned rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly indicate that iNOS {{plays an important role in}} burn injury-induced GSK- 3 β activation in skeletal muscle. These findings suggest that iNOS may contribute to burn injury-induced metabolic derangements, in part, by activating GSK- 3 β. JOURNAL ARTICLEinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|For {{interpolation}} of scattered multivariate data by radial basis functions, an "uncertainty relation" {{between the}} attainable error and {{the condition of}} the interpolation matrices is proven.

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} cellular repressor of E 1 A stimulated genes (CREG 1) on cardiac function in mouse with myocardial fibrosis. Methods　CREG 1 knockout mice (CREG 1 +/–) and CREG 1 wild-type mice (CREG 1 +/+) were used to reproduce the model of myocardial fibrosis by subcutaneous pump burying of angiotensin Ⅱ (AngⅡ). After being stimulated with AngⅡ for 14 days, myocardial fibrosis was verified by HE staining and Masson trichrome staining. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of CREG 1 in myocardium before stimulation and 3, 7, 14 days after the AngⅡ stimulation. The cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography after AngⅡ stimulation for 14 days. The CREG+/+ mice were given AngⅡ for 14 days, {{and at the same}} time recombinant CREG 1 protein [respectively 15, 30, 60 and 300 μg/(kg. <b>d),</b> intraperitoneal (<b>IP)</b> injections] (treatment group) and NaCl (control group) were administered for treatment, and then cardiac function and myocardiac apoptosis were examined. Results　Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of CREG 1 in heart tissue was significantly lower in CREG+/– mice than in CREG+/+ mice (P< 0. 05). After AngⅡ stimulation for 3, 7 and 14 days, the expression of CREG 1 in heart tissue declined significantly in both CREG+/- and CREG+/+ mice (P< 0. 05), especially in CREG+/- mice (P< 0. 01). With HE and Masson staining, it was also found that CREG 1 deficiency aggravated myocardial fibrosis and cardiac function deterioration in response to AngⅡ stimulation (P< 0. 05). Conversely, exogenous infusion of recombinant CREG 1 protein significantly inhibited the occurrence of myocardial apoptosis (P< 0. 05), thus ameliorated cardiac function (P< 0. 05). Conclusions　CREG 1 deficiency may aggravate the deterioration of cardiac function in mouse with myocardial fibrosis induced by AngⅡ stimulation. The deterioration of cardiac function can be improved by administration of exogenous recombinant CREG 1 protein. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2015. 01. 0...|$|R
