5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of the}} Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a <b>genuine</b> <b>attempt</b> to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the amount}} of pad-play increased, owing to more {{difficult}} and unpredictable pitches that made batting much harder. Critics continued to regard this tactic as [...] "negative and unfair". In an effort to discourage pad-play and encourage leg spin bowling, a new variant of the lbw law was introduced, initially in Australia and the West Indies in the 1969–70 season, then in England for 1970. Under the re-worded law, a batsman would be lbw if a ball destined to hit the stumps pitched {{in line with the}} wickets or [...] "outside a batsman's off stump and in the opinion of the umpire he made no <b>genuine</b> <b>attempt</b> to play the ball with his bat". This revision omitted the requirement that the impact should be in line with the wickets, but meant that any batsman playing a shot could not be out if the ball pitched outside off stump, in contrast to the 1935 law. The editor of Wisden believed the change encouraged batsmen to take more risks, and had produced more attractive cricket. However, the proportion of wickets falling lbw sharply declined, and concerns were expressed in Australia. The Australian authorities proposed a reversion to the previous law. A batsman could once more be out to a ball that pitched outside off stump, but a provision was added that [...] "if no stroke is offered to a ball pitching outside the off-stump which in the opinion of the umpire would hit the stumps, but hits the batsman on any part of his person other than the hand, then the batsman is out, even if that part of the person hit is not in line between wicket and wicket". The difference to the 1935 rule was that the batsman could now be out even if the ball struck outside the line of off-stump. This wording was adopted throughout the world, although it was not yet part of the official Laws, from 1972 and the percentage of lbws sharply increased to beyond the levels preceding the 1970 change. The MCC added the revised wording to the Laws of Cricket in 1980; this version of the lbw law is still used as of 2013.|$|E

[...] According to Paddick, it was [...] "a fairly conventional marriage" [...] and his former wife said it was [...] "a wonderful marriage". She did not know he was gay. He struggled with his sexuality until towards the end of his marriage in 1988: [...] "I learned the lesson about being yourself before that, and being open about my sexuality was the last piece in the jigsaw. I wasn't open about my sexuality until I was a commander." [...] A November 2003 profile in The Guardian noted: [...] "Mr Paddick is relaxed enough to laugh at himself and told a gay magazine: 'My last staff officer got promoted and went to royalty protection. In his leaving card I wrote, [...] "Same job, different Queen".'" [...] Paddick currently lives in Vauxhall, London, with Petter Belsvik, a civil engineer from Oslo, Norway; they met in a bar while on holiday in Ibiza.

2500|$|Coca-Cola's {{market share}} had been losing ground to diet {{soft drinks and}} {{non-cola}} beverages for many years. Consumers who were purchasing regular colas seemed to prefer the sweeter taste of rival Pepsi-Cola, as Coca-Cola learned in conducting blind taste tests.

2500|$|A {{professional}} {{book review}} by Maximiliano Korstanje, an economist from Argentina, posits {{a more radical}} criticism on Why Nations Fail. Far from being objective, he claims, the argument of this book is based on Ethnocentrism, or Anglocentrism—that other non-Western civilizations will converge to the universal Western ideal of development, democracy and human rights. Acemoglu and Robinson, he argues, fail {{to recognize that there}} are many other nations that are free to choose to live in another way; there is no imperative stating that all nations should be democratic to enjoy the “benefits” of modern life and a capitalist economy. Indeed, paradoxically, envisaging democracy as a [...] "universal value" [...] is a betrayal to the self-determination of others, which Korstanje sees as the very cornerstone of democratic ideology. In his view, defining a nation's success as a function of its degree of wealth or per capita income corresponds directly to an [...] "ethnocentric" [...] mechanism within the discipline, aimed at creating a need in non-western societies, namely, the [...] "need" [...] to be [...] "economically developed," [...] "modern" [...] and [...] "democratic." [...] There is no <b>genuine</b> <b>attempt</b> for a critical discussion of the role of international financial corporations like the World Bank in issuing an unlimited number of loans to the world. Lastly, Acemoglu and Robinson are not treating the problem of inequality with accuracy and detail. The Gini coefficient list shows how some Latin American countries such as Uruguay are more egalitarian than the United States. Moreover, inside the United States, despite the high level of economic development and the democratic system, black people are often excluded from such benefits, reaffirming the ethnocentric nature of democracy and development.|$|E

Field experience of knowledge projects with Indigenous Australians underpins our analysis, but we primarily discuss a priori and general issues: the political and ethical context of such projects; knowledge making as terminology; key characteristics of (scientific) models; local capacity, participation, and representation; and examples of computer-based tools for knowledge representation.
