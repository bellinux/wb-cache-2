40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the results of ACL (anterior {{cruciate}} ligament) reconstruction using quadruple flexor tendons as grafts, with ligament fixation in the femur using a rigid guide transverse screw and in the tibia, using a cancellous screw with a <b>fixing</b> <b>washer.</b> Methods: 173 knees (166 from males and seven from females) that had undergone surgery with ACL reconstruction using this technique between December 2002 and February 2007 were evaluated. The mean age was 30 years (from 13 to 56 years), and the mean follow-up time was 30 months (6 - 55 months). We divided the knees into three groups, which were assessed using the Lysholm scale: Group A with six months of follow-up; Group B with 12 months of follow-up; and Group C with 24 months of follow-up. Results: We evaluated the results, and groups A, B and C received 94, 95 and 95 points respectively on the Lysholm scale. Conclusions: The surgical technique proved to be safe and easy to perform, with good results and a low complication rate. Also, its results were maintained throughout the study period of 24 months...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste trabalho é analisar os resultados da reconstrução do LCA (ligamento cruzado anterior) com o uso dos tendões flexores quádruplos como enxerto e fixação ligamentar no fêmur com parafuso transverso de guia rígido e, na tíbia, parafuso esponjoso fixando uma arruela de fixação ligamentar. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados, no período de dezembro de 2002 a fevereiro de 2007, 173 joelhos, que foram operados e submetidos à reconstrução do LCA com a técnica proposta, sendo 166 masculinos e sete femininos. A idade média foi 30 anos (13 a 56 anos), e com tempo de seguimento médio de 30 meses (6 - 55 meses). Elaboramos três grupos que foram submetidos à escala de Lysholm: o grupo A, com seis meses de seguimento; o grupo B, com 12 meses de seguimento; e o grupo C, com 24 meses de seguimento. RESULTADOS: Avaliamos os resultados, e os grupos A, B e C obtiveram 94, 95 e 95 pontos, respectivamente, na escala de Lysholm. CONSLUSÕES: A técnica cirúrgica se mostrou segura, de fácil execução, com bons resultados, baixa taxa de complicações e mantém seu resultado com o tempo estudado de 24 meses.

60|$|It {{can hardly}} be due to {{anything}} in the curriculum or programme of studies. Indeed, to any one accustomed to the best models of a university curriculum as it flourishes in the United States and Canada, the programme of studies is frankly quite laughable. There is less Applied Science in the place than would be found with us in a theological college. Hardly a single professor at Oxford would recognise a dynamo if he met it in broad daylight. The Oxford student learns nothing of chemistry, physics, heat, plumbing, electric wiring, gas-fitting {{or the use of}} a blow-torch. Any American college student can run a motor car, take a gasoline engine to pieces, <b>fix</b> a <b>washer</b> on a kitchen tap, mend a broken electric bell, and give an expert opinion on what has gone wrong with the furnace. It is these things indeed which stamp him as a college man, and occasion a very pardonable pride in the minds of his parents.|$|R
40|$|Kinematical, {{electromechanical}} energy accumulator is {{a facility}} that converts supplied electrical energy to the kinetic one, stored in the rotating inertial system. Electric driving motors can operate both as a propulsion units, providing torque to the rotor shaft, and as generators {{in the course of}} braking. The prototype is designed to operate in a vacuum; the energy accumulator is located in a sealed pressurized vessel connected to the apparatus, which can generate vacuum pressure down to 1 Pa. The accumulator is destined for storage energy of 7. 2 MJ at a speed of up to 20, 000 1 / min. The energy accumulator is equipped with inert weight in the form of metal disc, connected to a composite band. In the course of operation, the rotor assembly is suspended in non-contact manner in housing assembly while the main body is fastened to the inner ring of the pressure vessel. The rotor consists of a shaft on which are mounted: a metal disc together with a band made of carbon fibre, inset into inert weight using epoxy resin; four disc rotors of two electric motors; two disks which are magnetic armature for electromagnetic bearings operating along the shaft axis; bushings of both sleeve bearings; <b>fixing</b> sleeves, <b>washers</b> and lock nuts to fix particular elements on the shaft. During normal operation the rotor is positioned in the radial direction through two electromagnetic bearings, top and bottom, located at both ends of shaft and operating in the differential arrangement, and in the axial direction- by a system of two eight-pol...|$|R
5000|$|... [...] With {{the use of}} Split-shot HEUI fuel injectors, high {{pressure}} oil is required to pressurize the fuel injectors. The main {{high pressure}} oil (HPO) system components are; High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP), HPO manifolds, Stand pipes and branch tube. The HPOP {{is located in the}} engine valley {{at the rear of the}} engine block. Early build years (2003.5-04.5) are well known for pre-mature HPOP failure. This is due to the poor quality materials used in manufacturing. The HPOP is pressurized by a rotating gear, meshed with a rear camshaft gear. The early model HPOP gears were known to be weak, and develop stress cracks in the teeth resulting in gear failure, thus causing a no start issue for the engine. Early models also had the ICP sensor located on the HPOP cover. The high amount of heat in this location, combined with the exposure to debris in the oil was known to cause ICP sensor failure also resulting in a no start condition. This issue was addressed by Ford with the late 2004 engine update, bringing a new HPOP design, along with relocation of the ICP sensor to the Passenger side valve cover. The newly designed pump is not known for frequent failure, however a new issue arose with the update. In the late model engines, Ford also redesigned the HPO stand pipes and dummy plugs in the HPO manifold, using poor quality o-rings. These o-rings were prone to failure causing a HPO leak, and eventually a no start condition. Ford addressed this concern with updated Viton o-ring <b>washers</b> <b>fixing</b> the issue. With the new HPO system design also came a Snap To Connet (STC) fitting. Some models had issue with the prongs of the STC fitting breaking causing the fitting to lose it's sealing property and again, a no start condition for the engine. Another frequent (but not always catastrophic) issue with the HPO system is the Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR) screen. The IPR screen is located in the engine valley with the oil cooler. The material used was susceptible to failure and neglecting to replace the screen during an oil cooler replacement could lead to the debris being sent through the HPOP causing complete failure.|$|R
