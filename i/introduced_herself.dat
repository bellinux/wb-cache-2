5|$|In May 2005, Stratus was sidelined {{with the}} Women's Championship after {{suffering}} a herniated disc, with the storyline explanation that Viscera had injured her at Backlash after she insulted him for losing to Kane. This left the company without a Women's Champion for four months, as Stratus remained the champion {{during the time of}} her injury, thus ignoring the 30 day clause stating that a champion must defend their respective title at least once every 30 days. She returned to Raw on September 12, 2005 as a face by siding with Ashley Massaro against Vince's Devils (Candice Michelle, Victoria and Torrie Wilson). The feud also involved the debuting Mickie James, who <b>introduced</b> <b>herself</b> as Stratus' biggest fan. In November, during the Eddie Guerrero Tribute Show, Stratus took part in an inter-promotional Divas battle royal that was won by SmackDown! Diva Melina. The next week, MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) kidnapped Stratus for Melina, who challenged a tied up and gagged Stratus to a match for the Women's Championship. The two fought at Survivor Series, with Stratus defeating Melina. Stratus and Mickie James continued teaming together in late 2005, while James became increasingly obsessed with Stratus. On the December 26 episode of Raw, the storyline between Stratus and James developed into a lesbian one, when James initiated an intimate kiss with Stratus under a sprig of mistletoe, causing a surprised Stratus to flee the locker room.|$|E

25|$|After {{accompanying}} {{her father}} to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to Dapitan to live with Rizal, Josephine <b>introduced</b> <b>herself</b> to members of Rizal's family in Manila. His mother suggested a civil marriage, which she {{believed to be a}} lesser sacrament but less sinful to Rizal's conscience than making any sort of political retraction in order to gain permission from the Bishop. Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and wife in a common-law marriage in Talisay in Dapitan. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours after Josephine suffered a miscarriage; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.|$|E
25|$|While {{working with}} the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station. Both women {{had been arrested for}} demonstrating, and Alice Paul <b>introduced</b> <b>herself</b> when she noticed that Lucy Burns was wearing an American flag pin on her lapel. The women {{discussed}} their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement. Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by Anna Howard Shaw. Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends. Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} her two first major releases, The Love Club EP and Pure Heroine, criticises {{mainstream}} popular culture. Lindsay Zoladz from Pitchfork noted that Lorde expressed her indifference towards modern-day's culture, further explaining that [...] "Lorde has <b>introduced</b> <b>herself</b> {{to the world as}} someone who gives very few fucks." [...] On behalf of Rolling Stone, critic Jonah Weiner also noted the typical themes of teen pop music, including [...] "social anxiety, romantic yearning, debilitating ennui [...] booze-soaked ragers". Jim Pickney from the New Zealand Listener writes that Lorde's lyrics are structured in a short story manner and praised that her songwriting ability [...] "combines unmistakably teenage confusion, curiosity and confidence with word skills beyond her years." ...|$|E
500|$|In November, Perry also {{performed}} [...] "Peacock" [...] at New York's Roseland Ballroom, where she <b>introduced</b> <b>herself</b> by popping {{out of a}} giant cake, dressed in a purple skin-tight cupcake print dress.

She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that [...] "everything I write will be his. He's done this to me... He's screwed me!" [...] Solanas intended {{to write a novel}} based on the SCUM Manifesto, and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the Up Your Ass script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.|$|E

500|$|On 4 March, Webster {{travelled}} to Hammersmith {{to see her}} old neighbours the Porters, {{whom she}} had not seen for six years, wearing Thomas' silk dress and carrying a Gladstone bag which she had filled with some of Thomas' remains.

She invited Porter and his son Robert to the Oxford and Cambridge Arms pub in Barnes. Along the way, she disposed of the bag that she was carrying, probably by dropping it into the River Thames, while the Porters were inside the pub drinking. It was never recovered.
