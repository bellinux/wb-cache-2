40|$|Predicting and under-standing the {{dynamics}} of a population requires knowledge of vital rates such as survival, growth, and reproduction. However, these variables are influenced by individual behavior, and when managing exploited populations, it is now generally realized that knowledge of a species’ behavior and life history strategies is required. However, predicting and understanding a response to novel conditions—such as increased fishing-induced mortality, changes in environmental conditions, or specific management strategies—also require knowing the endogenous or exogenous cues that induce phenotypic changes and knowing whether these behaviors and life history patterns are plastic. Although {{a wide variety of}} patterns of sex change have been observed in the wild, it is not known how the specific sex-change rule and cues that induce sex change affect stock dynamics. Using an individual based model, we examined the effect of the sex-change rule on the predicted stock dynamics, the effect of mating group size, and the performance of traditional spawning-per-recruit (SPR) measures in a protogynous stock. We considered four different patterns of sex change in which the probability of sex change is determined by 1) the absolute size of the individual, 2) the relative length of individuals at the mating site, 3) the frequency of smaller individuals at the mating site, and 4) expected reproductive success. All four pat-terns of sex change have distinct stock dynamics. Although each sex-change rule leads to the prediction that the stock will be sensitive to the size-selective <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern</b> and may crash if too many reproductive size classes are fished, the performance of traditional spawning-per-recruit measures, the <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern</b> that leads to the greatest yield, and the effect of mating group size all differ distinctly for the four sex-change rules.

40|$|The <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern</b> of {{individual}} beam trawl vessels comprises alternating searching and exploitation phases during a fishing trip. The searching phase {{is characterized by}} a below-average catch rate and a long distance between the midpoints of hauls. The exploitation phase {{is characterized by a}}n above average-catch rate and a small inter-haul distance. During the exploitation of a local concentration of flatfish, the catch rate decreases on average by 10 % over a period of 48 h. The rate of decline {{is a function of the}} engine power. Powerful vessels experience a small or no decline in catch rate, whereas less powerful vessels experience a decline of up to 16 %. It is inferred that the decline in catch rate may be due to interference competition among vessels through a change in the behaviour of flatfish in response to fishing disturbance, although a reduction in local abundance may also have contributed to the decline. Areas with above-average catch rates may change on a weekly basis...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{fisheries}} management encourages highly selective fishing patterns for various purposes, such as increase relative yield, reduce unwanted bycatch, protect various species or sizes and rebuild ecosystems. Recent empirical and theoretical studies, however, show increasing evidence that selective removals of targeted components have unintended {{adverse effects on}} stocks, fish communities and the ecosystem. Based on case studies from artisanal African freshwater fisheries, and results from dynamic size-based models, this chapter supports the renewed suggestion that an application of a more balanced <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern</b> will mitigate adverse effects and enhance food security better than increased selectivity. Contrary to common belief, small-scale unregulated artisanal fisheries, with a high diversity of seasonally adapted fishing methods, are probably the closest empirical examples we have of an optimal exploitation pattern with the least disruptive effects {{on the structure of}} the ecosystem.

The data (catch landing of commercial fishing, number of fishing gear landing, and price of fish) were collected from Pelabuhanratu Fishing Port. The analysis shows that the fishing gear was fluctuated seasonally. The seasonal pattern dynamic of fishing gear was caused by fish abundance both in volume and value. Because of limited fish abundance and season, fishing gears compete each other and have caused the fishing gear interaction. Three groups of the fishing gear interaction in Pelabuhanratu Bay could be found; i. e., outboard gillnet -handline, inboard gillnet-longline, and liftnet-seine net interaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only. The {{individual}} size of fish as a {{proxy for}} life-history traits and market value displays an important, yet in bioeconomic modelling often ignored biological and economic parameter. This raises the question if and to what extent the consideration of a pricing related to the individual size influences optimal harvest strategies. We demonstrate here that the magnitude of size-dependency in the pricing clearly causes a quantitative impact on the outcome of optimizing the harvest strategy. Resulting is not only a shift regarding the potentially achieved revenues, but mainly a correlation regarding the optimal <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern</b> and the catch weights. The observed qualitative tendency towards a reduction in the fishing mortality simultaneously yielding higher catch weights with increasing size-dependent price effects can be generalized and is insensitive of additional economic factors like the discount rate or demand functions. These findings suggest that size-dependent pricing has a certain impact on the harvest strategy if one is aiming for maximum economic yield (MEY) and hence it should be more often accounted for in bioeconomic modelling...|$|E

40|$|Under the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries {{an optimal}} <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is one that}} gives the highest {{possible}} yield while causing the least structural impact on the community. Unregulated, open access African inland fisheries have been observed to sustain high catches by harvesting {{a broad spectrum of}} species and sizes, often in conflict with current management regulations in terms of mesh and gear regulations. Using a size and trait-based model we explore whether such exploitation patterns are commensurable with the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries, by comparing the impacts on size spectrum slope and yield with the different size limit regimes employed in the Zambian and Zimbabwean side of man-made Lake Kariba. Long-term multispecies data under fished and unfished conditions are used to compare and validate the model results. Both model and observations show that the highest yields and low structural impact on the ecosystem are obtained by targeting small individuals in the community. These results call for a re-evaluation of the size based management regulations that are ubiquitous in most fisheries...|$|E
40|$|Pomadasys incisus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} coastal demersal species around the Canary Islands. It is a gonochoric species with similar biological characteristic in males and females. The adult sex ratio is not significantly different from 1 : 1, and the mean size of males and females is similar. It reaches first maturity at the end of the second year of life (183 mm). Spawning takes place throughout the year. Growth analysis reveals that the species is fast-growing and relatively short-lived (7 years). Length at age is well described by the von Bertalanffy growth model. Individuals grow quickly in their immature first year, attaining approximately 45 % of their maximum length. After one year, the annual growth rate drops rapidly. The direct effects of fishing result in changes in abundance, with an 80 % reduction from the unexploited equilibrium level. Recruitment into the commercial fisheries occurs before size at sexual maturity, resulting in all spawners being accessible using the current <b>fishing</b> <b>pattern.</b> The length at first capture (168 mm) is less than the length at maturity; 45 % of the total catch are smaller than this, indicating a danger of recruitment-overfishing...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the coral}} reef of Okinawa, various methods of fishing have been {{developed}} since ancient times. These methods correspond to the habits and habitats of marine fauna on the coral reef. As a result of reversion to Japan in 1972, the people in Okinawa were under the same legal restrictions as those on the mainland. Some have continued fishing by conventional methods; others were forced to switch to different methods, or were even forced to change fishing grounds. Besides, conventional monthly <b>fishing</b> <b>patterns</b> have been altered recently because of the adoption of newly-introduced fishing methods. One is trolling around payaw, floating fish aggregation devices installed off the coast which attract tuna and bonito etc., and started in 1984. Another is handline fishing for diamondback squid (sode-ika) which began to be widely adopted in 1990. In particular, alteration in the former has greatly increased annual income while bringing about a change to the traditonal <b>fishing</b> <b>patterns.</b> Even though these newer methods may attract the younger generation to become fishermen because a simpler fishing skill is required, {{it is evident that}} it will accelerate to rapidly estrange fishermen from their traditional knowledge and skill necessary for fishing at sea.
