5|$|Despite not {{charting}} in Billboard magazine, {{the video}} reached the Top 10 for four consecutive weeks on Terra Networks' Top Music Video countdown. In the music video for the song, Queen is video taped showing sensual scenes by several cameras from different angles. Scenes alternate between a dance in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> and Queen {{is a record}} studio and the cameras. She is surrounded by multiple computers and flat screen television sets which display the feeds from the cameras.|$|E
5|$|Davis's renewed {{service in}} the Senate was {{interrupted}} in early 1858 by an illness that began as a severe cold and which threatened him {{with the loss of}} his left eye. He was forced to remain in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> for four weeks. He spent the summer of 1858 in Portland, Maine. On the Fourth of July, Davis delivered an anti-secessionist speech on board a ship near Boston. He again urged the preservation of the Union on October 11 in Faneuil Hall, Boston, and returned to the Senate soon after.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E

25|$|In his 1637 book Dioptrique French philosopher, {{mathematician}} and scientist René Descartes suggested placing an eye of {{a recently}} dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the {{eye of a}}n ox) into an opening in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1869, her sister Florence {{died at the}} age of 19. At this time a group of young sisters was growing up around her —the {{children}} of her father's second marriage. Davis took the greatest interest in their education. She became their home instructor, and sought to form their taste in reading. When her suffering confined her to a <b>darkened</b> <b>room,</b> they became her readers and amanuenses.|$|E
25|$|The video depicts Yamaguchi in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room,</b> {{behind a}} row of naked women who are lying {{down on the ground}} in a line. He traces the {{contours}} that their bodies made, as he walks past the bodies. These scenes are interspersed with footage of Tokyo. In the final scene, a wider top-down angle shows that the naked women are spelling out the word eureka in capital letters.|$|E

25|$|The 8 × 10 cameras he {{preferred}} were large and heavy, {{and due to}} the weight {{and the cost of}} the film he never carried more than twelve sheet film holders with him. At the end of each day, he had to go into a darkroom, unload the film holders and load them with new film. This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.|$|E
25|$|According to news {{accounts}} from around that time, the assassination {{was carried out}} in a backroom of the Yanceyville courthouse. Stephens was in attendance at a Democratic gathering, in an attempt to convince a prominent Democrat to run for Sheriff as a Republican. The man he was attempting to sway signaled to him from the floor of the hall, and Stephens followed him downstairs. Knowing Stephens' reputation for being quite well armed, his Klan assassins had assembled between eight and twelve men who lay in wait in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> on the Caswell County Courthouse's first floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{overarching}} {{theme of the}} book is to debunk the notion that Lennon retired from rock for five years, from 1975 until his 1980 comeback album, Double Fantasy, to live as a househusband and raise the couple's son, Sean. Goldman asserts that in reality Lennon had retreated into a secluded, <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> watching television all day, every day, leaving domestic servants to tend his son, while Ono was feeding a chronic heroin habit. This theme is also supported in the book , which is based on Lennon's own diaries from the months and weeks leading up to his murder.|$|E

50|$|Blanche Craig {{was born}} on January 6, 1866, in Cutler, Maine. She {{appeared}} in films such as The City of Illusion (1916), The Accidental Honeymoon (1918), The Magic Cup (1921), and <b>Darkened</b> <b>Rooms</b> (1929). She died on September 23, 1940, in Hollywood, California.|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} problem {{occurs when}} light must {{pass through a}} very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene (consider a <b>darkened</b> <b>room,</b> with a door slightly ajar leading to a brightly lit room), or {{a scene in which}} most points do not have direct line-of-sight to any light source (such as with ceiling-directed light fixtures or torchieres). In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy; Metropolis light transport is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{feedback}} {{has also}} been studied in relation to visual extinction. Patients were asked to touch a known target in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room.</b> A light attached to the patient’s hand was sometimes briefly illuminated, {{to provide information about}} where the hand was in relation to the target. In some of these trials, a distracting light was also lit, which induced an extinction event in the patient. Although the patient reported in such cases that he had not seen the indicator light on his hand, their performance was correspondingly better, similar to the results when visual feedback had been available. Although the patient was not cognizant of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, {{in a manner similar to}} blindsight.|$|E
25|$|Upton {{was born}} on a farm near Batavia, New York, the tenth child and sixth son of Daniel and Electra Randall Upton. He would become the {{brother-in-law}} of Andrew J. Alexander and of Frank P. Blair, Jr. He studied under famous evangelist Charles G. Finney at Oberlin College {{for two years before}} being admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1856. While at West Point Upton fought a duel with fellow Cadet Wade Hampton Gibbes of South Carolina over some offensive remarks about Upton's alleged relationships with African-American girls at Oberlin College. The two men fought with swords in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> of the cadet barracks. Upton suffered a cut on his face. He graduated eighth in his class of 45 cadets on May 6, 1861, {{just in time for the}} outbreak of the Civil War.|$|E

60|$|In {{the rapidly}} <b>darkening</b> <b>room</b> and rapidly rising wind, Brown went along {{the table to}} where a bundle of wax candles lay among the other scrappy exhibits. As he did so he bent accidentally over the heap of red-brown dust; and a sharp sneeze cracked the silence.|$|R
50|$|Klein's {{technique}} was unusual {{in that he}} avoided {{the use of a}} flash by heating the developer. This allowed for <b>darkened</b> <b>rooms</b> such as theaters to be photographed inconspicuously.

500|$|Rob Newman is the {{producer}} of the video, while Craven, Nicholas and Thananath Songchaikul executively produced the visual. Sing Howe Yam performed {{the direction of the}} photography while Clark Eddy is the editor. The video opens to Rihanna appearing on a static television screen in a simple nude gown and crucifix necklace. She then begins to sing whilst being in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> with a black gown on and later appearing in a brightened room with a white gown on. Throughout the video, Rihanna seems to have an [...] "emotional breakdown" [...] and does exorcism-type dance moves. The video switches between the creepy and the pretty Rihanna as she mopes in a sparse warehouse space, possessed by her loneliness.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{an event}} in The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss' childhood, young Bart {{does not want to}} give up {{sleeping}} in the crib to make way for his newborn sister. Noticing Bart's affection for Krusty the Clown but unable to afford a professionally built Krusty-themed bed, Homer decides to build a bed with Krusty's likeness to please his son. However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on an ominous appearance and frightens Bart, especially in the <b>darkened</b> <b>room.</b> In his first night in the new bed, far from [...] "laughing himself to sleep", Bart imagines that the face on the headboard of the bed comes to life, intoning with evil glee, [...] "if you should die before you wake...", before collapsing into evil cackling.|$|E
500|$|He was {{accepted}} by the University of Edinburgh to study history at the same early age of sixteen. During an end-of-term rugby union match at his old school, he received a kick to the head and suffered a retinal detachment. This left him blind in his left eye, despite treatment including several operations and weeks spent lying in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room.</b> Later at Edinburgh, while playing tennis, he noticed the same symptoms in his right eye. Brown underwent experimental surgery at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and his right eye was saved by a young eye surgeon, Hector Chawla. [...] Brown graduated from Edinburgh with First-Class Honours MA degree in history in 1972, and stayed on to obtain his PhD degree in history (which he gained ten years later in 1982), titled The Labour Party and Political Change in Scotland 1918–29.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have had}} a dreadful dream,' said the child, with an energy that nothing but such terrors could have inspired. 'A dreadful, horrible dream. I have had it once before.

5000|$|In {{controlled}} environments, such as [...] <b>darkened</b> <b>rooms,</b> or {{rooms where}} all light sources are diffused, glossy displays create more saturated colors, deeper blacks, brighter whites, and are sharper than matte displays. This is why supporters of glossy screens consider {{these types of}} displays more appropriate for viewing photographs and watching films.|$|R
60|$|A little {{knowledge}} {{of the laws of}} light, for instance, would teach many women that by shutting themselves up day after day, week after week, in <b>darkened</b> <b>rooms,</b> they are as certainly committing a waste of health, destroying their vital energy, and diseasing their brains, as if they were taking so much poison the whole time.|$|R
500|$|Despite the Sontarans' clone culture being {{asserted}} in {{the classic}} series, [...] "The Sontaran Strategem" [...] is the first episode to depict the cloning process. Originally, all of the factory workers were to be clones, but Raynor reduced this to only Martha to solve continuity problems with the second part. The template clone was portrayed by Ruari Mears, who wore a prosthetic mask that took longer to apply than any he had previously worn. The scenes involving the cloning tank were filmed in a Welsh shampoo factory and reused a prop from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] as the tank which contained the clone. Davies and Agyeman enjoyed the scenes set in the cloning room; Agyeman liked playing an [...] "evil companion", who she and Davies felt made the real Martha [...] "warmer", and Davies thought Privates Gray and Harris discovering the tank in a <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> was [...] "classic Doctor Who".|$|E
500|$|Unlike other Cretan {{artists who}} had moved to Venice, El Greco {{substantially}} altered his style and sought to distinguish himself by inventing new and unusual interpretations of traditional religious subject matter. His works painted in Italy were influenced by the Venetian Renaissance style of the period, with agile, elongated figures reminiscent of Tintoretto and a chromatic framework that connects him to Titian. The Venetian painters also taught him to organize his multi-figured compositions in landscapes vibrant with atmospheric light. Clovio reports visiting El Greco on a summer's day while the artist was still in Rome. El Greco {{was sitting in a}} <b>darkened</b> <b>room,</b> because he found the darkness more conducive to thought than the light of the day, which disturbed his [...] "inner light". As a result of his stay in Rome, his works were enriched with elements such as violent perspective vanishing points or strange attitudes struck by the figures with their repeated twisting and turning and tempestuous gestures; all elements of Mannerism.|$|E
500|$|The {{cockatoo}} {{would have}} been a rare bird at the time, [...] "and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this". It did not become well-known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of Captain Cook in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatoos had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (Mr & Mrs William Chase) and a separate study, The Parrot. In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the [...] "lungs-glass", but was perhaps making a statement about the values of society in the Age of Enlightenment. The white plumage of the cockatoo also shows much more effectively in the <b>darkened</b> <b>room</b> than the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early oil sketch. A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the Trinity found in Early Netherlandish painting, where the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove, to which God the Father (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.|$|E
60|$|Back to {{his chair}} and solitude. Jacob made his way {{presently}} through the <b>darkened</b> <b>rooms</b> and passages to his own apartments, where a servant was waiting for him, the evening papers were laid out, whisky and soda and sandwiches were on the sideboard. His valet relieved him of his dresscoat and smoothed the smoking jacket around him.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a shrill}} answer {{from the court}} below, and a negro girl in a yellow turban came running up, while Madame Bouvet bustled along the gallery and opened the doors of two <b>darkened</b> <b>rooms.</b> Within I could dimly see a walnut dresser, a chair, and a walnut bed on which was spread a {{mosquito}} bar.|$|R
60|$|When I at last {{concluded}} with a loud note of joy, a long, involuntary suspiration in the <b>darkening</b> <b>room</b> told me that I had been listened to with profound interest; and, although no word was spoken, though I was still a stranger and under a cloud, it was plain that the experiment had succeeded, and that for the present the danger was averted.|$|R
