25|$|The {{code that}} would become WebKit began in 1998 as the KDE HTML (KHTML) layout engine and KDE JavaScript (KJS) engine. The WebKit project was begun within Apple by Don Melton on June 25, 2001 as a fork of KHTML and KJS. Melton {{explained}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> KDE developers that KHTML and KJS allowed easier development than other available technologies {{by virtue of being}} small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed and standards-compliant. KHTML and KJS were ported to OS X {{with the help of an}} adapter library and renamed WebCore and JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore was announced <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>e-mail</b> <b>to</b> a KDE mailing list in June 2002, alongside the first release of Apple's changes. WebCore was announced at the Macworld Expo in January 2003 by Apple CEO Steve Jobs with the release of the Safari web browser. JavaScriptCore was first included with Mac OS X v10.2 as a private framework which Apple used in their Sherlock application, while WebCore debuted with the first beta of Safari. Mac OS X v10.3 was the first major release of Apple's operating system to bundle WebKit, although it had already been bundled with a minor release of 10.2.|$|E
