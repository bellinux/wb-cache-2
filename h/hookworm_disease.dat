50|$|N. americanus {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in the development of New and Old Worlds. N. americanus cause <b>hookworm</b> <b>diseases,</b> which are associated with nutrition and blood loss. Patients who are infected with approximately 25 to 100 worms will experience symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and slight headaches. As the infestations number reach 100 to 500 worms, the patient will experience extreme fatigue, iron deficiency, and abdominal pain. The symptoms worsen and result in possible death when the infestation reaches over 500 hookworms. Children and pregnant women affected by N. americanus are at greater risk due to anemia and the greater need for nutrition. There is a high demand for an improvement of sanitation to reduce fecal contamination in regions with high prevalence of N. americanus infections. The current control strategies include a combination of mass drug administration (MDA) for children at age 4-6 years to prevent or eliminate N. americanus infections.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND In Indonesia, {{there is}} still a high {{prevalence}} of hookworm infection, especially in poor areas with poor sanitation. The number of helminthic diseases in Keerom Regency was about 599 cases in 2010. This number is bound to increase due to the low sanitation, hygiene and socio-economic status {{of the people in the}} regency. The children are a group at risk for contracting infections, especially intestinal worms, which affect the child’s physical growth and intelligence. The objective of this study was to determine the risk factors of <b>hookworm</b> <b>diseases</b> in elementary school students. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on 224 elementary school students. Demographic data were obtained by questionnaire, comprising gender, parental socio-economic status, household sanitation, and personal hygiene. Body mass index was calculated by measurement of body weight and height. And hemoglobin concentration was measured using a Quick Check Hb-meter. Stool samples were microscopically examined using the Kato-Katz method. We used chi-square and logistic regression to find predictors of hookworm infections, with level of significance at p< 0. 05. RESULTS The number of hookworm infection was 6. 7 % and the risk factor of hookworm infection among elementary school students was the habit of using footwear outdoors [OR 5. 3; 95 % CI 1. 7 - 17. 7; p= 0. 004]. CONCLUSION The use of footwear outdoors was a predictor of hookworm infections in elementary school children. An effective and efficient intervention program is needed to prevent and eradicate hookworm infection among primary school children...|$|R
40|$|Recently, only a {{few people}} {{infected}} with intestinal helminths are found in South Korea (S. Korea). However, soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) used to be widely prevalent throughout the Korean penin-sula in the past (Kobayashi, 1928; Korea Association of Health Promotion- KAHP, 2004). Ascariasis, trichuriasis and <b>hookworm</b> <b>diseases</b> are main STHs and were the target of serious concern in S. Korea when agriculture was the main field of employment (Seo et al., 1969). During this comparatively past in S. Korea, human feces were used as a fertilizer for culti-vation purposes, which perpetuated STHs and rein-forced their abilities to reinfect the human population. Helminth egg positive rates were similar in South and North Korea (N. Korea) before the Korean War in 1950 according to previous reports (Kobayashi, 1928; Brooke et al., 1956). However, many records are avail-able on the prevalence of helminthiasis in S. Korea after the Korean War, including national surveillance records, {{but it is hard to}} find any report on prevalence of helminthiasis in N. Korea. Only the infection of malaria is well understood in N. Korea due to the involvement of WHO (WHO, 2000), when the serious-ness of the situation became evident in late 1990 s. Recently collaborations between S. and N. Korea have increased in non-political areas, e. g., economy, sports, science, and tourism.

50|$|The {{effect of}} NTDs {{is tied to}} gender in some situations. NTDs disproportionately affect females.

A study in Uganda found that women were more easily able to obtain treatment because they had fewer occupational responsibilities than men and were more trusting of treatment, but ignorance of the effects of medicines on pregnant women prevented adequate care. The paper concludes that gender should be considered when designing treatment programs in Uganda. Additionally, women often bear a heavier social stigma in relation to the pressure to marry.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Worldwide, {{dogs and}} cats {{are the two most}} common {{household}} companion animals. Because of this, they can be direct or indirect source of many human infections. Fortunately, most of these zoonotic infections can be clinically prevented by appropriate prophylactic interventions. Materials and Methods: Present kind of cross-sectional study, for the first time, was conducted in city of Ithaca, New York. People visiting local animal hospitals, dog parks, library and shoppers at Walmart supermarket were personally interviewed and a pre-tested questionnaire was got filled from every individual. The collected data were analyzed for percentage proportions using Microsoft Excel ® and the results had been presented in graphical as well as tabulated forms. Results: Out of 100 participants responding to the request for participation, gender-wise, 45 % of the participants were male while 55 % of the participants were females. Demographically, 50 % participants lived in rural, 35 % in urban while 15 % participants lived in suburban areas.

40|$|Background: Globally, hookworms infect 440 {{million people}} in {{developing}} countries. Especially children and {{women of childbearing age}} are at risk of developing anaemia as a result of infection. To control <b>hookworm</b> infection and <b>disease</b> (i. e. reduce the prevalence of medium and heavy infection to < 1 %), the World Health Organization has set the target to provide annual or semi-annual preventive chemotherapy (PC) with albendazole (ALB) or mebendazole (MEB) to at least 75 % of all children and women of childbearing age in endemic areas by 2020. Here, we predict the feasibility of achieving < 1 % prevalence of medium and heavy infection, based on simulations with an individual-based model. Methods: We developed WORMSIM, a new generalized individual-based modelling framework for transmission and control of helminths, and quantified it for hookworm transmission based on published data. We simulated the impact of standard and more intense PC strategies on trends in hookworm infection, and explored the potential additional impact of interventions that improve access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). The individual-based framework allowed us to take account of inter-individual heterogeneities in exposure and contribution to transmission of infection, as well as in participation in successive PC rounds. Results: We predict that in low and medium endemic areas, current PC strategies (including targeting of WCBA) will achieve control of hookworm infection (i. e. the parasitological target) within 2 years. In highly endemic areas, control can be achieved with semi-annual PC with ALB at 90 % coverage, combined with interventions that reduce host contributions to the environmental reservoir of infection by 50 %. More intense PC strategies (high frequency and coverage) can help speed up control of hookworm infection, and may be necessary in some extremely highly endemic settings, but are not a panacea against systematic non-participation to PC. Conclusions: Control of hookworm infection by 2020 is feasible with current PC strategies (including targeting of WCBA). In highly endemic areas, PC should be combined with health education and/or WASH interventions...|$|R
