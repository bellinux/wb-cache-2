5000|$|Faking in the <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> can {{be broken}} down into four elements. [...] The first {{involves}} the interviewee portraying him or herself as an ideal job candidate by exaggerating true skills, tailoring answers to better fit the job, and/or creating the impression that personal beliefs, values, and attitudes {{are similar to those of}} the organization.|$|E
50|$|Different {{interview}} characteristics {{also seem}} to impact the likelihood of faking. Faking behavior is less prevalent, for instance, in past behavioral interviews than in situational interviews, although follow-up questions increased faking behaviors in both types of interviews. Therefore, if practitioners are interested in decreasing faking behaviors among job candidates in <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> settings, they should utilize structured, past behavioral interviews and avoid the use of probes or follow-up questions.|$|E

40|$|This {{study found}} mixed {{support for the}} {{hypothesis}} that the difference in criterion-related validity between unstructured and structured <b>employment</b> <b>interviews</b> is due solely to the greater reliability of structured interviews. Using data from prior meta-analyses, this hypothesis was tested in 4 data sets by using standard psychometric procedures to remove the effects of measurement error in interview scores from correlations with rated job performance and training performance. In the 1 st data set, support was found for this hypothesis. However, in a 2 nd data set structured interviews had higher true score correlations with performance ratings, and in 2 other data sets unstructured interviews had higher true score correlations. We also found that averaging across 3 to 4 independent unstructured interviews provides the same level of validity for predicting job performance as a structured interview administered by a single interviewer. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. <b>Employment</b> <b>interviews</b> are part of the hiring process for virtu-ally all jobs. Only reviews of resumes and application blanks are used more frequently in selection (Ash, 1982; Dipboye, 1994, 1997; Dipboye & Jackson, 1999). As a result, industrial/organiza-tional psychologists have devoted much research to the validity of <b>employment</b> <b>interviews.</b> It is now well established that structured <b>employment</b> <b>interviews</b> have higher criterion-related validity for predicting job perfor-mance than do unstructured interviews.

5000|$|Interviewers {{should be}} aware that {{applicants}} can fake their responses during the job interview. Such applicant faking can influence interview outcomes when present. One concept related to faking is impression management (IM; when you intend or do not intend to influence how favorably you are seen during interactions). Impression management can be either honest or deceptive. Honest IM tactics are used to frankly describe favorable experiences, achievements and job-related abilities. Deceptive IM tactics are used to embellish or create an ideal image for the job in question. Honest IM tactics such as self-promotion (positively highlighting past achievements and experiences) may be considered necessary by interviewers in the interview context. Consequently, candidates who do not use these tactics may be viewed as disinterested in the job. This can lead to less favorable ratings. Faking can then be defined as [...] "deceptive impression management or the intentional distortion of answers in the interview in order to get better interview ratings and/or otherwise create favorable perceptions". Thus, faking in the <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> is intentional, deceptive, and aimed at improving perceptions of performance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{reviews the}} {{research}} literature on age discrimination in the <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> and related contexts. Twenty one studies were identified which explored whether age discrimination occurs {{within the context of}} the <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> since the Age Discrimination in Employment Act was put into law. Sixteen studies were conducted in laboratory settings. It was concluded that evidence of age discrimination in the <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> is commonly observed in laboratory studies which do not assess the influence of other job-relevant characteristics. Laboratory studies may create too much artificiality, where the impact of qualifications is artificially minimized and the impact of irrelevant factors like age are maximized.

Participants: 60 subjects that participated in an <b>employment</b> <b>interview.</b> The performance was evaluated by 2 interviewers. The results show a positive correlation between the candidate's self-esteem and their performance at the interview. Extraversion, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness were positively associated with performance at the interview.

Specifically, we address aspects of communication effectiveness and appropriateness in <b>employment</b> <b>interviews,</b> including how they vary according to the degree of their standardization. For instance, both parties (interviewer and interviewee) have the goal of reducing uncertainty, although the nature of those goals differ (e. g., organizational perspectives regarding potential interviewee performance verses interviewee perceptions of job fit and the likelihood of being offered the job). Directions for future research are presented, including a pressing need for research examining how the two parties adjust communication during the interaction based on perceptions of the other’s communication behaviors...|$|R

The purpose with this study has been to examine if there are any differences between inhouse-recruiters and recruiting consultants concerning the <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> and its assessment methods. Five inhouse-recruiters and five recruiting consultants have been interviewed on the basis of a manual. There are differences between the groups in 6 of the 17 themes that have been examined: purpose with the <b>employment</b> <b>interview,</b> private-, double- or panelinterview, length of the interview, personal chemistry, appearance and objectivity in the assessment. Many of the differences are caused by the fact that inhouse-recruiters recruit for their own organisation and recruiting consultants recruit for a client.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{surprisingly}} little research on faking in the <b>employment</b> <b>interview,</b> {{despite the fact}} that professional judgment would suggest that faking might occur in the interview.

We argue that faking is a function of capacity, willingness, and opportunity to fake.

Finally, job candidates distort their responses in job desirable ways. I n recent years we have seen the growing number ofstudies of impression management in interview setting...|$|E

40|$|In organizations, {{the past}} decade has seen an {{increase}} in the popularity of Skype as a first-round <b>employment</b> <b>interview</b> tool. Due to Skype’s speed, quality, and transmittal of sound and video, it is sometimes thought of as a substitute for face-to-face. However, is this a fair substitution? In a survey-based study, we investigated the difference between Skype and face-to-face interviews by examining two critical assessment traits: truthfulness and communication anxiety. Our results showed that interviewers in an academic setting perceived candidates to be less honest via Skype than they do face-to-face, even when candidates seemed equally competent. Our results also showed that interviewers perceived equal communication anxiety through both mediums, though prior research suggests interviewee communication anxiety would be higher over Skype.
