The heavy polyethylene bags with 80-µm thickness come in 50 - kg or 100 - kg. The first polyethylene bag is filled completely and then tied securely. The first bag is then placed into a second polyethylene bag with same thickness and that bag is tied securely as well. Finally, these two bags are placed in a third woven nylon or polypropylene bag used for its strength. In this third bag farmers and markets can handle the bags without bursting the inner two, and are readily accepted by grain handlers.|$|R

40|$|Mass {{maturity}} (end of the seed-filling phase) {{occurred at}} about 72 days after flowering (DAF) in developing seeds of Mimusops elengi, {{at which time}} seed moisture content had declined to about 55 %. The onset of ability to germinate was detected at 56 DAF and seeds showed 98 % germination by 84 DAF. Tolerance of desiccation to 10 % moisture content was first detected at 70 DAF and was maximal by 84 DAF. Delaying collection by a further 14 days to 98 DAF, when fruits began to be shed, reduced seed viability, particularly for seeds first dried to 10 % moisture content. Hence {{the best time for}} seed collection appears to be about 14 days before fruits shed. In a separate investigation with six different seed lots, desiccation below about 8 - 12 % moisture content reduced viability (considerably in some lots). The viability of dry seeds (below about 10 % moisture content) stored hermetically was reduced at cool temperatures (5 degrees C and below), and none survived storage at sub-zero temperatures. The results suggest that Mimusops elengi shows intermediate seed storage behaviour and that the optimal <b>hermetic</b> seed <b>storage</b> environment is about 10 % moisture content at 10 degrees C, while short-term, moist, aerated storage at high (40 %) moisture content is also feasible...|$|R
40|$|As a {{tropical}} country with relatively high humidity and temperature, Indonesia {{is struggling with}} aflatoxin which frequently contaminates peanut. Aflatoxin is a carcinogenic toxic substance that could cause liver cancer. Due to the increasing concern on food safety, the Indonesian Drugs and Foods Agency specifies the maximum aflatoxin allowed in peanut as much as 20 ppb. However, researches showed that aflatoxin contamination in peanut in Indonesia {{is much higher than}} the threshold. The study was carried out to observe the effect of using postharvest machineries and packaging treatments on aflatoxin contamination in peanut. Reduction of postharvest processes was conducted by using series of machineries, e. g. thresher, dryer, and sheller. Packaging treatments, e. g. vacuum plastic pack, hermetic glass chamber, and polyethylene (PE) plastic wrap were carried out during storage at ambient temperature (25 - 27 °C). The results showed that using machineries in postharvest handling produced peanut free from aflatoxin contamination. However, without effective packaging, the aflatoxin level would increase during <b>storage.</b> <b>Hermetic</b> packaging could protect peanut from the mold as indicated by low level of aflatoxin contamination...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> is {{the process}} of storing grain or seeds inside sealed {{compartments}} to avoid gas changes with the environment in order to deplete the oxygen and accumulation of dioxide carbon gas. This combination is lethal to insects and molds, creating an alternative control instead of using any other substance nocive to these pests and maintaining the product quality.This storage method is an important aspect for enhancing and elongating grain life at the same time maintaining the grain integrity. <b>Hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> {{has been around for a}} long times and it has been received well and largely in developing countries since the inception of the method. The method can exercised using different materials such as sealed clay pots, sealed plastic bags, sealed metals etc. These materials are effective in their own right and cost are variable therefore caution need to be practiced to preclude insects infestation during storage time. The process is of utmost importance. Ideally a successful <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> would mean grains are able to retain all their nutrient quality and crushable commodities are well kept for the entire process of storage. Hypothetically, if ninety five percent (95%) of the grain retains their natural characteristic and quality, therefore, statistically hermetic grain storage would mean its efficient and effective method. Nonetheless, the method is used worldwide in Africa, Asia and majority parts of America. The scale of acceptance of this method assure its quality in preserving small and large scale farmer’s crops. Developing countries are relentless and do not want to be left behind, there are enthusiastically adopting the method in large scales as they have seen the benefits of using this storage process.Benefits of using the <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> method include (i) enhances grain life in a much safer and it is rodent-free, weevils-free, pesticides-free and prevents infestation of insects, (ii) the storage process is defiant and resistant to harsh conditions (with the exception of extremely harsh conditions i.e. temperature 0 to -20 degrees Celsius, being unfavorable for oil palm seeds storage [...] such as hot and humid climates, (iii) the mortality of living organisms is kept at 100 percent rate, (iv) precludes mold from developing and (v) mycotoxins which have a high likelihood to cause cancer are totally annihilated. Prior to <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage,</b> grain need to be properly dried to moisture content range of approximately 12 - 14 percent to avoid germination and viability losses. Germination and viability are crucial for crop productions and if losses are encountered then it would mean a loss in profits.|$|E

To identify the most cost effective storage method for S. vermiculata, experiments were carried out to test the effects of fruit bracts (wings), temperature regimes, seed moisture and packaging methods on storage life. Seed samples were removed from storage at monthly intervals for testing and {{towards the end of}} the experiments samples were transferred from <b>hermetic</b> to ambient <b>storage</b> conditions and tested for germination. Experiment 1 continued for 1, 140 days, Experiment 2 for 720 days. For de-winged seed, high moisture content increased seed longevity, suggesting that desiccation susceptibility is one of the causes of limited longevity in this species. Most longevity regression lines of winged seeds had negative intercepts suggesting increase in germination resulting from gradual dormancy-breaking. Drying and packaging alone increased longevity by 7. 6 and 3. 8 times in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Samples kept at lower temperature and lower moisture treatments survived longer under ambient conditions. Increased longevity by drying and vacuum packaging alone can provide simple, cost effective and environmentally friendly options for rangeland rehabilitation programs...|$|R

50|$|Seeds stored {{hermetically}} {{have shown}} to exhibit prolonged quality. Researches in Ghana investigated {{the effectiveness of}} storing seeds using three different types of grain storage. The three methods used in the research included the jute, polypropylene and triple layer <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage.</b> Two destructive insects pests, Adult Prostephanus truncatus and Sitophilus were infested in each bag. These two insects pests are common in Africa and are very destructive to maize. Unprotected maize in storage can be totally annihilated by these organisms. Of these three methods, the triple layer <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> offered outstanding results of seed quality with prolonged germination rate and viability despite insect infestation. Additionally, to ensure that grain maintains its natural quality in storage, {{it has to be}} stored at optimal moisture contents of approximately 12 -14% and preferably low moisture content. The bags have to be sealed for the entire period of storage and regular check ups need to be down to ascertain that the seal remains intact i.e. very air tight bags. Another study investigated the efficacy of controlling bean pests i.e. Acanthoscelides obtectus on the quality of beans by employing the <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> system (silo bags and plastic bottles) and non-hermetic glass containers. Beans were stored at high moisture contents of 15%, temperature 25 C and relative humidity 70± 5%. In the study the hermetic method showed no alteration in quality.Deterioration in grain quality arises from several factors (1) high moisture content at the time of storage. High grain moisture content promotes development of molds which renders the grains unusable or unsafe for consumption. (2) failure to keep storage bags air tight from oxygen which would otherwise accelerate insect infestation leading to total destruction of grain. In this phenomenon, hermetic conditions are not met to secure the grain from insects. (3) Failure to keep the bags water tight to prevent moisture infiltration, (4) high temperatures leading to grain discoloration and largely insect infestation.|$|E
50|$|The {{method is}} heavily used in central, {{southern}} parts of Africa (i.e. Botswana) and South America. Small scale farmers {{have found the}} process to be more beneficial in their regions. Botswana is an arid area, it can go {{for longer periods of}} time without rain and therefore <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> has helped in times without rain i.e. draught. Seeds are well stored for the next season of plowing even though at times seeds are purchase. Usually seeds purchase is done in supplementary measures. In Botswana, traditional people usually use the <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> placed inside a jute bag to increase efficiency and effectiveness in eradicating living organisms within few days. Also, hermetic is crucial in Africa as most of the seeds are produced and stored in the farm. Experimental results proved that <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> of seeds for twelve months can retain germination and viability characteristics, whilst extremely harsh conditions can render an opposite effect.Brazilian grain producers are starting to use hermetic bags on site to store grains as an alternative to bins. They claim that the cost is accessible and the quality of the grain remains the same for a period of 18 months. The bags are made of polyethylene that are capable of reflect sunlight and avoid the heating of the product as well as degradation by light.Argentina has to, frequently, deal with a storage shortage of 20 to 35 million tonnes of grain. This led to quality and quantity loss since the grain has to be transported directly from the farms to elevators, and from elevators to terminal ports. Hermetically sealed plastic bags (silo bags) has gained popularity among producers to overcome this issue. In 2008 harvest season, more than 33 million tonnes of grain were stored using the silo bags in the country for several grains and oilseeds, and, now, this technology is being adopted by other South American countries.Sealed bag has been used to store mostly silage in North America, however, the use of this storage system started to grown since the early 2000s. Still, instead using hermetic choices, the most common option when dealing with storage shortage is piling the grain on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Underground {{grain storage}} {{was one of}} the main methods to {{preserve}} cereal early in the nineteenth century through some southeast European and Asiatic societies using “airtight” underground silos as an alternative for big bottle and jars that was used in the Mediterranean. Writing evidence appeared only in the 16th century. By the 1800s, detailed descriptions of the underground silos were made by knowledgeable agricultural writers of Western Europe. They highlighted the airtightness as a major factor to maintain grain quality although some reports observed that some seeds lost germination power.Early researches with airtight storage were made from 1819 to 1830, where a French industrialist named Ternaux at Saint-Ouen stored grain in 9 series of experiment in large scale in general. Ternaux`s stored the product under not so favorable circumstances. The silos were dug into a wet alluvium and the material was stored without caring about the humidity. After several years, only spots of mold was encountered inside the silos, especially in critical areas as the walls, roof, and bottom of the structure. Bread was made with the remaining unspoiled grain but the taste of it was not satisfying, thus, the experiment was considered a failure. However, this can be considered as one of the first made scientific research involving <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E
50|$|More {{positive}} achievements {{have been}} recorded in the Central African Republic, using a simple 1-tonne capacity structure that was found by farmers {{to be easy to}} construct and proved popular even without donor subsidies. Considerable success has been reportedly achieved with metal bins over the last 20 years in Central America and metal bins have been widely used for grain storage in Swaziland for half a century, drawing on the availability of local entrepreneurs who had been supplying metal water tanks. Replication of this success in other parts of Africa is very much in the pilot stage. Difficulties include the lack of local craftsmen to fabricate the bins; the need for grain stored in such bins to be dried to 14 °C, and problems with carrying out the necessary fumigation. Small-scale bins for use inside the home appear to be having more success than larger bins for outside use. A relatively new development is hermetically sealed bags, which appear to offer good possibilities to store a variety of quantities, although further socio-economic evaluation is still required. The Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) bags are hermetically sealed bags that allow small-scale farmers/users to store cowpea without any use of chemicals. Similarly, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and US-based GrainPro Inc. have collaborated to develop <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> bags referred as IRRI bags but widely known today as GrainPro SuperGrainbag that offers the lowest water vapor transmission rate and oxygen transmission rate of any hermetic bags available in the market.|$|E
30|$|The study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} hermetic and non-hermetic storage systems of storing cowpeas on grain moisture content, infestation by cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus), weight of cowpeas, and finally usable (or wholesome) proportion of grains after storing grains for 12  weeks. Observations made from the investigations proved that the <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> technology was able to stabilize the moisture content of cowpea stored compared to the non-hermetic system of storage. In addition, the <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> system drastically {{reduced the number of}} live insects to a mortality rate of 100 % over the storage period. Although {{there was no significant difference}} in weight loss, the <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> system slightly minimized weight loss compared to the non-hermetic system and maintained a high proportion of wholesome grains (usable proportion) compared to the non-hermetic system. The measured parameters in the hermetic and non-hermetic storage techniques clearly depicted that <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> is a preferred option for storing cowpea and could be used replace the use of fumigants and other expensive storage systems. This study recommends that cowpea farmers, middle men, and other retailers will adopt <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> system in order to minimize post-harvest losses observed in handling cowpeas. In terms of further studies, it is recommended that efforts should be made to quantify mold infestation and the germination potential of grains stored hermetically.|$|E
40|$|In seed storage research, {{moisture}} content {{can be maintained}} by providing a stable relative humidity (e. g. over saturated salt solutions) or by <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage,</b> but the two approaches provide different gaseous environments which might affect longevity.

40|$|Background and Aims The {{negative}} logarithmic {{relationship between}} orthodox seed longevity and moisture content in <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> {{is subject to}} a low-moisture-content limit (m(c)), but is m(c) affected by temperature? Methods Red clover (Trifolium pratense) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) seeds were stored hermetically at 12 moisture contents (2 - 15 %) and five temperatures (- 20, 30, 40, 50 and 65 degrees C) for up to 14. 5 years, and loss in viability was estimated. Key Results Viability did not change during 14. 5 years <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> at - 20 degrees C with moisture contents from 2. 2 to 14. 9 % for red clover, or 2. 0 to 12. 0 % for alfalfa. Negative logarithmic relationships between longevity and moisture contents > m(c) were detected at 30 - 65 degrees C, with discontinuities at low moisture contents; m(c) varied between 4. 0 and 5. 4 % (red clover) or 4. 2 and 5. 5 % (alfalfa), depending upon storage temperature. Within the ranges investigated, a reduction in moisture content below m(c) at any one temperature {{had no effect on}} longevity. Estimates of m(c) were greater the cooler the temperature, the relationship (P 0. 10) between species, whereas those of K-E and C-W did (P < 0. 001). Conclusions The low-moisture-content limit to negative logarithmic relationships between seed longevity and moisture content in <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> increased the cooler the storage temperature, by approx. 1. 5 % over 35 degrees C (4. 0 - 4. 2 % at 65 degrees C to 5. 4 - 5. 5 % at 30 - 40 degrees C) in these species. Further reduction in moisture content was not damaging. The variation in m(c) implies greater sensitivity of longevity to temperature above, compared with below, m(c). This was confirmed (P < 0. 005) ...|$|E
40|$|Maize {{grown by}} {{subsistence}} farmers is a staple food {{for millions of}} people around the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. Following harvest and shelling, maize is subject to storage losses caused by birds, rodents, fungi, and insects. The losses amount to millions of Mg per year of maize, which could be available with no additional inputs of land, seed, fertilizer and water. On-farm <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> has the potential to substantially reduce these losses without the use of pesticides. This paper explains the basis of <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> and presents the Iowa State University procedure for predicting the time required for 100 % mortality of adult maize weevils in hermetically-stored maize, shows field data verifying the prediction accuracy, and describes four systems being successfully used for hermetic maize storage on subsistence farms: Postcosecha galvanized steel silos, Purdue triple-bagging system, Grain Pro ultra hermetic bags, Recycled plastic food containers. Based on purchase price, the steel silo is the least cost system. The two bagging systems cost three to four times as much. The recycled oil container is the most costly, in spite of its low purchase price...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{grain and}} seed losses occur during maize storage in East Africa. This {{is due to}} high ambient {{relative}} humidity, {{and the fact that}} storage ecosystems and the stored maize equilibrate with ambient moisture and temperature. The result is rapid pest multiplication and mold formation in the stored maize, leading to a high spoilage rate. This is particularly important considering {{that a large number of}} farmers store their maize in open-air storage that utilizes little or no chemical preservatives. Of these pests, the most economically important are the maize weevils, and to reduce losses, a non-chemical system that naturally eliminates them was developed. Three studies aimed at 2 ̆ 2 Testing time to complete adult weevil mortality in <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> 2 ̆ 2, testing the 2 ̆ 2 effect of <b>hermetic</b> <b>storage</b> on maize seed germination 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 using recycled edible oil containers for hermetic maize storage 2 ̆ 2 were conducted to solve these problems. The first study found significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001) treatment effects. A laboratory-scale study found mean adult weevil mortality and standard error of 94. 2 ± 10. 77...|$|E
