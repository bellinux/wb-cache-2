50|$|<b>Disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> were {{originally}} {{developed for the}} dyeing of cellulose acetate, and are water-insoluble. The dyes are finely ground {{in the presence of}} a dispersing agent and sold as a paste, or spray-dried and sold as a powder. Their main use is to dye polyester but they can also be used to dye nylon, cellulose triacetate, and acrylic fibers. In some cases, a dyeing temperature of 130 °C is required, and a pressurised dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fiber. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of dispersing agent used during the grinding.|$|E
