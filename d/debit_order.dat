5000|$|The UCKG {{considers}} {{that the first}} ten percent of all income, before doing anything with the money, [...] "belongs to God" [...] as a tithe, quoting the Bible as authority. The first tithe should include 10% of everything owned at the time. They give very detailed instructions on {{what is to be}} paid, when, and to whom, distinguishing between rules for salaried workers, business owners, the self-employed, pensioners, and the unemployed, including beggars. Guidance is given for money received as a loan, gifts, benefits, and the sale of property. The tithe is to be paid to the Church as soon as possible; it is not acceptable to defer payment in time of need—this is compared with being unfaithful to your wife and being faithful later. If payment is deferred for any reason, then it must be increased by a fifth, on Biblical authority. The UCKG says [...] "the Biblical way of tithing is to bring the tithe onto the altar of the church (see Deuteronomy 14:25)", but accept payment by <b>debit</b> <b>order,</b> [...] "if you must".|$|E

The normal expense account balance is a <b>debit.</b> In <b>order</b> to understand why expenses are debited, it is relevant to note the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity. [...] Expenses show up under the equity portion of the equation because equity is common stock plus retained earnings and retained earnings are revenues minus expenses minus dividends.

40|$|One of {{the major}} sources of income to South African Municipalities is {{property}} rates. Income generated from property rates is meant to develop and deliver services to residents living in the said Municipal area. The main {{aim of the research}} was to identify the causes and effects of the non-payment of residential property rates, and also to develop workable strategies to maximise the collection of residential property rates in order to ensure developmental growth sustenance, specifically in Mahikeng Municipal area. Related literature was reviewed on the non-financial viability of Municipalities, maintenance of public infrastructure, service delivery and Municipal development plans in establishing the relationship with non-payment of residential property rates. Four hypotheses were set to guide the research with two testing positive with high level of confidence using the chi square method of testing. The research methodology employed in the research was mainly quantitative where the results and findings obtained from the questionnaire were statistically analysed. The research revealed that: The Mahikeng Local Municipality has failed to find the right medium to send rates bills to clients on time, is not taking active responsibility to recover rates debts, does not provide quality service delivery and the reluctance by locals to pay their property rates. The effects thereof, are the inability of the Municipality to deliver effective and efficient services, lack of maintenance of public infrastructure and development in the area. By implementing various options such as email, sms and the post to send rates bills to property owners, by employing different payment options, for example <b>debit</b> <b>orders,</b> transfers, bank deposits and discounts for property owners and embarking on periodic public awareness campaigns in educating the community regarding the importance of payment of property rates could serve as effective mechanisms to address the non-payment of residential property rates faced by the Mahikeng Local Municipality...|$|R

Furthermore, if given a formal bank account this correlates with the poor being more likely to save (Porteous and Hazelhurst, 2004 : 63).

The account is a first order transactional product and a saving service which targets poor clients from LSM 1 - 5. Mzansi account holders are found to be significantly more likely to be informally employed or unemployed (Porteous, 2007 : 10). Yet there is a research gap about the financial behaviour of those working informally. This study draws on the experiences of women working in the informal economy who utilise the Mzansi account. It aims to determine the limitations and benefits of the account. It also seeks to learn what role the Mzansi account plays in the savings habits of the women and how it influences their livelihood strategies. This is with a view to recommending how the services of the Mzansi account can be improved so as to maximise its support of informal workers. The research suggests that the intrinsic benefits of the Mzansi account are that the account's bank charges are lower compared to other bank accounts, a small initial deposit is needed to open the Mzansi account and a proper address is not required to open the account. The interviewees highlight five day-to-day limitations on the Mzansi account.

Similarly, credit card issuers typically (until June 2006) charged customers a fee of around £25 for payment that is late, insufficient, or not made, and the same for exceeding their authorised credit limit.

40|$|In South Africa, {{the robust}} banking sector may be {{overwhelming}} to its clients {{and may even}} leave them vulnerable to their business practice. Banks support card purchases but some are reticent about their role in chargebacks. The Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 provides for some very noble refund remedies but if these remedies are not enforced by banks, they prove ineffective. The banks own the credit transfer process but neither the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 nor the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 compels them to chargeback credit card transactions and the consumer is therefore left without protection. This means that if a customer buys a service using his credit card and seeks a chargeback from his bank for a valid reason, there is no recourse for the customer {{in terms of the}} contract with the bank and the customer is left {{at the mercy of the}} bank and the rules and regulations of the credit card operator with whom the customer does not have a contract. Similarly debit card purchases and electronic fund transfers (EFT) also fall short of protection as the banks? reticence follows through to these as well. The bank is under no obligation to assist the client with disputed transactions and this can be appreciated from the wording in card agreements, some more notably than others. That been said, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 does contemplate payment for goods and services using a credit or a debit card but fails to call on the banks to assist the consumer. The code of banking practice does not come to the aid of the consumer either as the voluntary commitments are limited to some aspects of cheques, <b>debit</b> <b>orders,</b> foreign exchange, internet telephone and cell phone banking. The aforementioned payment services have chargeback references or provisions which protect the customer; however the code makes no mention of payment services linked to debit and credit card payments. In practice, a third party card operator attends to dispute resolution and chargebacks but accrues no contractual responsibility towards the client, nor are the card operators subject to South African law and jurisdiction. In this paper, the client bank relationship is also examined as the bank is in the precarious position of having to make or break a client. The mechanics behind the real time gross settlement system of South Africa in order to understand what can and cannot be done is also discussed. Coming back to the refund provisions in the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 only two of them stipulate a timeline within which to effect the refund but the international card operator is not bound by these timelines. Also, there is no visibility as to the debit and credit mechanisms between the client?s bank and the merchant?s bank and if a dispute is resolved within 3 or 4 days there is nothing preventing the merchant?s bank or the client?s bank from taking 120 days to credit the client. The banks would then have the opportunity to create a healthy cash flow at the expense of the aggrieved customer. This dissertation also calls on the Competition Commission to test the code of banking practice against prohibited practices and it calls on the legislator to address consumer chargeback rights in appropriate legislation. Lastly a recommendation with regard to wording that must be introduced into the code of banking practice to enforce chargeback rights is made as well as a suggestion to the utilization of existing Ombudsman and registered paralegals.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The Mzansi bank account, {{launched}} {{in the latter part}} of October 2004, arose out of the financial services charter and is aimed at low income, previously unbanked individuals and households. Since its inception, it has been supported by the following financial institutions: Amalgamated banks of South Africa (ABSA), Standard Bank of South Africa (SBSA), First National Bank (FNB), Nedbank (essentially the four major retail banks in South Africa) and the Postbank (a subsidiary of the Post Office). This study investigates the performance of the Mzansi account from both the customer and supporting financial institutions' perspective The investigation's primary objectives focused on determining how accessibility to financial services (and to the account itself) may be improved for customers, determining what Mzansi customers needs are, and how the account may be expanded or enhanced to meet these needs. The secondary objectives concentrated on problems the supporting financial institutions faced: improving accessibility for customers (without too costly an investment in supporting infrastructure), differentiating the product and service significantly from other competing institutions, limiting product cannibalisation (where the Mzansi account is chosen over higher order retail bank products) and limiting overall costs of the account to ensure profitability. The research methodology consisted of a literature study and empirical research that in turn encompassed administering survey questionnaires to current Mzansi customers. The literature study focused on both national and international attempts at banking the unbanked, distilled common learnings from these attempts and ultimately described best practices with particular reference to improving accessibility to financial services and tailoring financial services options to meet the most critical needs of the unbanked market. The literature study also found that a definite business case exists for financial institutions - vii - willing to pursue this market, provided that the core value proposition was adequately adapted. Previous findings on how to avoid product cannibalisation, as well as how to differentiate products and services to entrench greater customer appeal completed the literature study. The empirical research encompassed the development of a survey questionnaire aimed at understanding five core research areas: the Mzansi customer profile (for a sample of one hundred and forty seven existing customers and transacting at Gauteng branches and outlets and evenly distributed across each of the supporting financial institutions), gauging how well customers understood their accounts, determining the service customers had received, understanding customer transaction and the value they attach to these transactions, and finally affording customers the opportunity to suggest ways in which the account may be improved. The questionnaire comprised both open and closed ended question (the latter questions used a five point Likert-type scale to determine scoring). The results, apart from compiling an overall demographic profile of the customer, showed that significant work still needs to be accomplished by the financial institutions to ensure customers understand their accounts and the various transactions and channels available to customers. AIM transaction for instance caused customers problems; to the extent that customers were willing to pay almost twice as much for branch transactions instead. The service received by customers also proved to be average, with more customer orientated demonstrations and a greater amount of time spent during the account opening procedure being seen as valuable ways to improve the overall service received. Customers valued cash withdrawal transactions the most, favouring the use of the branch channel. Customer needs were identified to be primarily credit based; with different credit facilities being required. Customer motivated improvements also extended to a greater range of free transactions on the account, improved - viii - interest rates on credit balances and some form of loyalty based discount on certain transactions. Practical ways suggested to improve access to the account included account proliferation techniques (where third parties may initiate the opening of an Mzansi account on behalf of a customer) and the use of mobile banking facilities. The product functionality was also recommended to be expanded to include limited numbers of <b>debit</b> and stop <b>orders</b> for the retail banks' offering, while a strong emphasis was placed on approaches to improving customer financial literacy by way of education programs that are community based. The later aspects were also seen as strong departure points that the supporting financial institutions could leverage to significantly differentiate their service and product offering. The objectives of the study were deemed to have been met, despite the fact that the study's geographical bias, customers possibly misrepresenting their income and possible translation bias.
