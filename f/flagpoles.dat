5|$|In early 2013, protestors went to {{the streets}} flying the old colonial flag {{demanding}} more democracy and resignation of Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying. The use of the flag has created concerns from Chinese authorities and request from Leung to stop flying the flag. Despite the calls from Leung the old flags {{are not subject to}} use restrictions beyond not being allowed to be placed on <b>flagpoles</b> and are freely sold and manufactured in the territory.|$|E
5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. The lumber was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and <b>flagpoles,</b> and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E

5|$|The Law on the National Flag {{mentions}} five possible sizes {{that could}} be made for the national flag: According to Article 4 of the Law On the National Flag, people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government are directed to authorize companies to make any copy of the national flag. Besides five official sizes for flying on <b>flagpoles,</b> there are another four smaller sizes for other purpose, such as decoration on cars or display in the meeting room.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{includes}} {{a number of}} major buildings. While the Secretariat building is most predominantly featured in depictions of the headquarters, it also includes the domed General Assembly building, the Dag Hammarskjöld Library, as well as the Conference and Visitors Center, which is situated between the General Assembly and Secretariat buildings, and can be seen only from FDR Drive or the East River. Just inside the perimeter fence of the complex stands a line of <b>flagpoles</b> where the flags of all 193 UN member states, plus the UN flag, are flown in English alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I {{organized}} great {{building projects}} during his reign, including many temples and tombs, but his greatest projects {{were at the}} Temple of Karnak {{under the supervision of}} the architect Ineni. Previous to Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road. Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple's main road, along with a wall to run around the inner sanctuary and two <b>flagpoles</b> to flank the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall. Between pylons four and five, he had a hypostyle hall constructed, with columns made of cedar wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more <b>flagpoles</b> and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.|$|E
50|$|Since 23 September 2014, {{the tallest}} {{free-standing}} <b>flagpole</b> {{in the world}} is the Jeddah <b>Flagpole</b> in Saudi Arabia at a height of 171 m, exceeding the former record holder the Dushanbe <b>Flagpole</b> in Tajikistan (height: 165 m), National <b>Flagpole</b> in Azerbaijan (height: 162 m) and the North Korean <b>flagpole</b> at Kijŏng-dong (height: 160 m).|$|R
50|$|The King Abdullah Square on the {{intersection}} of Andalus Road with King Abdullah Road has the world's tallest <b>flagpole.</b> It is 171 m high and the Saudi flag atop it weighs 570 kg.

5|$|As part {{of civic}} {{redevelopment}} {{of the market}} area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on Market Place, between the new City Hall and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by King George VI on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now stands on a terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along {{either side of the}} memorial itself, one of which is a later replacement. Two <b>flagpoles</b> stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{two other}} {{national}} flags are hoisted on <b>flagpoles</b> {{one at a}} time while the corresponding national anthems are played: the flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games. In Moscow during the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott, the flag raised to represent the next games host was that of the City of Los Angeles instead of the flag of the boycotting-United States. In Sydney and Athens, two Greek flags were raised because Greece was the next games host (in 2000) and in 2004, because Greece was hosting the games. Then, while the Olympic Hymn is played, the Olympic Flag that was hoisted during the opening ceremonies is lowered from the flagpole and carried from the stadium.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more <b>flagpoles</b> present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E

5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall <b>flagpoles.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{octagonal}} three-tiered <b>flagpole</b> {{base was}} present at the eastern end of the existing garden bed. The <b>flagpole</b> base was concrete, and each tier was of decreasing diameter and height. The edge was bevelled. The base measured 1.2 metres across and 0.3 metres high, and the <b>flagpole</b> was once affixed by four bolts. This base was removed during maintenance activities in March 1999. Another <b>flagpole</b> base was constructed in July 1953.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flagpole's</b> {{structural}} integrity was reinforced and a mechanized pulley {{in lieu of}} the manual pulley was installed along with a marble base. The renovation project was implemented by the DPWH's Manila South Engineering District while the project contractor was AKH Construction. The material used for the new <b>flagpole</b> is Q345 steel. The steel and two cranes of the flag pole were both imported from Hong Kong. The <b>flagpole's</b> construction took less than a month and was finished in September 2013. The newer <b>flagpole</b> was divided into three segments. The old <b>flagpole</b> was moved to the Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite.|$|R

The other two <b>flagpoles</b> are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by House pages. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the Senate Sergeant at Arms's office. Several {{auxiliary}} <b>flagpoles,</b> to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground, are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol.
