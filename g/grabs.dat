5000|$|When {{requesting}} a <b>grab,</b> a client specifies a <b>grab</b> window: all events {{are sent to}} the <b>grabbing</b> client {{as if they were}} relative to the <b>grab</b> window. However, the other clients do not receive events even if they have selected them in the <b>grab</b> window. There are two kinds of grabs: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{requests}} for <b>grabbing</b> include a field for specifying {{what happens to}} events that {{would be sent to}} the <b>grabbing</b> client even if it had not established the <b>grab.</b> In particular, the client can request them to be sent as usual or according to the <b>grab.</b> These two conditions {{are not the same as}} they may appear. For example, a client that would normally receive the keyboard events on a first window may request the keyboard to be <b>grabbed</b> by a second window. Events that would normally be sent to the first window may or may not be redirected to the <b>grab</b> window depending on the parameter in the <b>grab</b> request.|$|R

40|$|WO 2005019072 A UPAB: 20050324 NOVELTY - Device for <b>grabbing,</b> {{transporting}} and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects comprises a <b>grabbing</b> device (1) {{having at}} least two <b>grabbing</b> jaws (2, 3). The first <b>grabbing</b> jaw (2) is placed on a freely accessible first surface {{in the form of}} a surface of the object or a freely accessible side surface of the object. The second <b>grabbing</b> jaw (3) is placed on a second surface {{in the form of a}}n additional freely accessible surface of the object. The first <b>grabbing</b> jaw is pressed with a pressure until an object-specific friction is reached between the first <b>grabbing</b> jaw and the first surface or side surface of the object. The <b>grabbing</b> jaws are arranged at an angle to each other. Before the start of object transport, the <b>grabbing</b> jaws serve as a tilting device about an axis of rotation. Rotation about the base surface edge of the object occurs which restricts the freely accessible side surface of the object with the second <b>grabbing</b> jaw against a support and after rotation th e second <b>grabbing</b> jaw lies underneath the new standing surface of the object. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for: (1) Alternative devices; and (2) Processes for <b>grabbing,</b> transporting and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects. USE - For <b>grabbing,</b> transporting and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects. ADVANTAGE - Stacked objects can be handled with little constructive and financial expenditure. The device can be used to reposition the objects in a quick manner...|$|R
50|$|While the ADA {{guidelines}} provide {{specifics on}} {{the placement of}} <b>grab</b> bars in public locations, they do not require a specific style. The British Doc M regulations specify a minimum contrast between bars and background. Many public facilities opt for the cheapest <b>grab</b> bars, which usually have an institutional look. However, <b>grab</b> bars are actually available in many styles, finishes and colors. Manufacturers have begun to understand the need {{to blend in with}} home decor, offering <b>grab</b> bars that have style and pizazz. For the home, <b>grab</b> bars {{do not need to be}} ADA compliant, but those guidelines should be considered. In addition to straight <b>grab</b> bars, there are fold-out bars, those that clamp onto the side of the bathtub, L-shaped, U-shaped and corner <b>grab</b> bars. <b>Grab</b> bars are also made with built in LED lighting and can come in many different colours.|$|R

5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female <b>grabs</b> food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which he holds his opponent upside-down and around his back.

Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|E
50|$|One major {{difference}} between the <b>Grabber</b> and the Gravity Gun is that the <b>Grabber</b> has a limited charge, and thus can only hold onto an object for several seconds. Additionally, the <b>Grabber</b> creates a distortion effect that can obscure the player's vision when in use however the <b>Grabber</b> can catch projectiles and small creatures, whereas the Gravity gun cannot.|$|R

40|$|The <b>grabbing</b> {{forces of}} log grapples were modeled and {{analyzed}} mathematically under operating conditions when <b>grabbing</b> logs from compact log piles and from bunch-like log piles. The <b>grabbing</b> forces {{are closely related}} to the structural parameters of the grapple, the weight of the grapple, and the weight of the log <b>grabbed.</b> An opera-tional model grapple was designed and tested to validate <b>grabbing</b> forces of the mathematical models while grab-bing logs from five alternative diameter classes under two different working conditions. The working conditions and log sizes affected the <b>grabbing</b> forces significantly. Vali-dation results suggest that the mathematical models de-veloped can be used to estimate the <b>grabbing</b> forces re-quired in the design process of log grapples. The results can be used by equipment manufacturers and researchers involved in the engineering design of grapples used in harvesting operations...|$|R

5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that track surfaces, horseshoes with toe <b>grabs,</b> use of certain legal medications, and high-intensity racing {{schedules}} may also contribute to a high injury rate. One promising trend {{is the development of}} synthetic surfaces for racetracks, {{and one of the first}} tracks to install such a surface, Turfway Park in Florence, Kentucky, saw its rate of fatal breakdowns drop from 24 in 2004–05 to three in the year following Polytrack installation.
