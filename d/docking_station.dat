5|$|The city's {{southern}} waterfront, {{away from}} the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.|$|E
5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> in June 2014. A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

5|$|Forge and the Spartans {{return to}} the Spirit of Fire and the crew follows Anders' signal to an uncharted planet in another star system. The planet's surface is infested by the {{parasitic}} Flood, who attack and assimilate any sentient life they encounter. The Spirit of Fire inadvertently activates a Forerunner <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> and enters the planet's interior. Flood board the ship, and very soon Forerunner Sentinels appear to cleanse the Flood threat and also to destroy all UNSC forces in the process. The crew discovers the planet is actually hollow, with a habitable interior and a miniature sun. The Covenant's plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced Forerunner starships inside the planet, {{and use them to}} obliterate humanity.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI compatible peripherals {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> cabinet. A proprietary riser card interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by docking stations. A <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or floppy disk drive controllers, video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The logic board passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the <b>docking</b> <b>station.</b> Docking stations within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> at one time. For example, a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for a floppy disk drive would need to be removed in order to attach a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic <b>docking</b> <b>station,</b> containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} {{generation}} iPod Shuffle, USB connectivity is provided via an included piece of hardware which acts as a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> for the transfer of data and the recharging of the iPod's internal battery through its headphone jack. The second generation iPod Shuffle was also able {{to act as a}} flash drive, just like the first generation iPod Shuffle. However, unlike the first generation iPod Shuffle, {{the second generation}} did not have a built-in USB connector. This means that the <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> was required for connection to a computer.|$|E

25|$|Apple {{intended}} {{to grow the}} Pippin platform alongside {{the rest of the}} Macintosh line. In an Apple developer publication, Apple's CEO Gil Amelio announced the Pippin 1997 Reference Platform, and suggested that the platform would include the latest Macintosh technologies, including IEEE 1394 or FireWire, as well as a 25-pin external SCSI port as standard interfaces. In May 1997, Bandai announced a <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> that would include Ethernet support at US$139.00, although such a peripheral was never made available.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} card form factors: Type I, Type II, and Type III cards. The card {{connector}} used {{for each type}} include: Type I and II use a 100-pin stacking connector, while Type III uses a 124-pin edge connector, i.e. the connector for Types I and II differs from that for Type III, where the connector is {{on the edge of}} a card, like with a SO-DIMM. The additional 24 pins provide the extra signals required to route I/O back through the system connector (audio, AC-Link, LAN, phone-line interface). Type II cards have RJ11 and RJ45 mounted connectors. These cards must be located at the edge of the computer or <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> so that the RJ11 and RJ45 ports can be mounted for external access.|$|E
25|$|Interior design {{improvements}} {{were another}} {{main focus of}} the LRX concept though {{the interior of the}} production Evoque changed significantly from the concept LRX. Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium centre console with an iPhone <b>docking</b> <b>station</b> stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E
