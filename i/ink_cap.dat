5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E

A 1982 report of three cases from Switzerland further incriminated the species, yet a 1994 study casts doubt on this; researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for antabuse-like compound coprine content in S.luridus and similar species, and found none in the historical suspect but did find indications {{for it in the}} rare B.torosus. They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical incidents was a misidentification of B.torosus with S.luridus, though they could not rule out S.luridus containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions.|$|E
500|$|Coprinopsis variegata, {{commonly}} known as the scaly <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> or the feltscale inky cap, is a species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. Distributed in eastern North America, it has a medium-sized, bell-shaped to flattened cap up to [...] in diameter, with felt-like, patchy scales. The gills, initially white, turn black in maturity and eventually dissolve into a black [...] "ink". Fruit bodies grow in clusters or groups on leaf litter or rotted hardwood, although the wood may be buried, giving the appearance of growing in the soil. The fungus is found in the United States, in areas east of the Great Plains. Coprinus ebulbosus and Coprinus quadrifidus are names assigned by Charles Horton Peck to what he believed were species distinct from C.variegata; they were later shown to represent the same species, and are now [...] synonyms. The mushroom is not recommended for consumption, and has been shown to cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.|$|E
5000|$|Coprinus comatus {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with the common <b>Ink</b> <b>Cap,</b> which contains coprine and can induce coprine poisoning. Symptoms of coprine poisoning include vomiting, diarrhoea, palpitations and a metallic taste in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Like many <b>ink</b> <b>caps,</b> {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried dead wood.|$|R
40|$|On 6 April 2003 {{a tragic}} {{accident}} {{led to the}} untimely death of Kees Uljé, mycologist and {{active member of the}} Netherlands’ Mycological Society. Kees’ first contact with mycology dated back some twenty years ago when, not being able to continue his profession as a roadworker, he became more and more interested in the study of agarics and taxonomy. In the first few years he acquired a general knowledge of mushrooms and toadstools, collecting and painting them in his own meticulous style, but gradually he became more and more involved in the study of <b>ink</b> <b>caps</b> (Coprinus),, eventually becoming one of the world’s leading specialists in this taxonomically and ecologically interesting and difficult group of fungi. This resulted not only in a series of popular and scientific papers, but also in a network of personal contacts with mycologists all over the world. Kees was typically a self-made man: with only a limited higher education, he nonetheless developed all the knowledge and skills necessary for his mycological studies. He had a gift for drawing and made beautiful illustrations for his publications. His affinity with computers and programming was put to good use to produce a unique website on Coprinus, and to develop an identification program, which could be down-loaded from his site, and not only served for the identification of <b>ink</b> <b>caps,</b> but also a wide range of other genera...|$|R

50|$|Proper hygiene {{requires}} a body modification artist {{to wash his}} or her hands before starting to prepare a client for the stencil, between clients, after a tattoo has been completed, and {{at any other time}} where cross contamination can occur. The use of single use disposable gloves is also mandatory. In some countries and U.S. states it is illegal to tattoo a minor even with parental consent, and it is usually not allowed to tattoo impaired persons (e.g. someone intoxicated or under the influence of drugs), people with contraindicated skin conditions, those who are pregnant or nursing, or those incapable of consent due to mental incapacity.

40|$|Printed inks or pastes {{based on}} silver {{nanoparticles}} are promising alternatives for the metallization of temperature-sensitive silicon solar cells. We {{show that the}} sintering of silver nanoparticles strongly depends {{on the nature of}} the capping agent used to stabilize the particles during synthesis and in <b>ink</b> formulation. Particles <b>capped</b> by agents containing nitrogen as coordinative anchor group (between agent and silver surface) show poorer sintering under same conditions compared with particles capped by oxygen containing stabilizers. Polymers also hinder sintering more than shorter oligomers. In order to avoid unwanted spreading of the metal ink or paste during printing, the formulation has to be adjusted to the requirements given by the surface. If samples covered by a layer of indium tin oxide are stored in air, the surface energy rapidly decreases, dropping by around 30 - 50 % within one day. Thus, wettability and the work of adhesion also become poorer. This has to be taken into account by formulating inks for metallization on ITO layers...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Printed {{electronics}} is {{an emerging}} {{area of study}} {{at the forefront of}} additive manufacturing technology. Additively manufactured electronic devices have many novel application areas, including three-dimensional microbatteries, electrically small antennas, spanning electrodes and printed circuit boards. Conductive features, the backbone of all electronic devices, are typically printed with colloidal solutions of silver nanoparticles. Of the well-studied metallic nanoparticle systems, silver exhibits the highest conductivity and is commonly used in commercially available conductive inks. These <b>inks</b> are typically <b>capped</b> with polymeric ligands that interfere with ink rheology and require high processing temperatures to achieve the desired electrical conductivity. For this reason, there is an impetus to develop conductive inks that can be processed at low temperatures in order to minimize processing costs and improve substrate compatibility. This work explores four methods of synthesizing silver nanoparticle based conductive inks, including polymeric ligand, ligand free, small molecule, and conductive ligand synthesis techniques...|$|R

50|$|Coprinus comatus, the shaggy <b>ink</b> <b>cap,</b> lawyer's wig, or shaggy mane, is {{a common}} fungus often seen growing on lawns, along gravel roads and waste areas.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, some {{treatments}} were missed {{due to the}} pollution in substrate such as <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> growth. Although applying a pasteurization step assumes that the material used was not already heavily contaminated with microorganisms before it was pasteurized, the pasteurization condition can be revised in further studies. <b>Ink</b> <b>cap</b> (Coprinus spp.) fungi appeared on the substrate before mushroom fruiting. Coprinus indicates the presence of free ammonia or conversely a high content of nitrogen in the compost. On the other hand, the appearance of <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> fungi in the growing room indicates the low quality of substrate due to the disturbance of the fermentation and the substrate’s pasteurization process (Sharma et al. 2007). Sterilized substrate production and containers and use of plant products could considerably minimize the nematode damage to mushrooms and maximize the yields.

40|$|The <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> Coprinopsis cinerea {{is a model}} {{organism}} {{for studying}} fruiting body (mushroom) formation in homobasidiomycetes. Mutant screens and expression studies have implicated a number of genes in this developmental process. Functional analysis of these genes, however, is hampered {{by the lack of}} reliable reverse genetics tools for C. cinerea. Here, we report the applicability of gene targeting by RNA silencing for this organism. Efficient silencing of both an introduced GFP expression cassette and the endogenous cgl 1 and cgl 2 isogenes was achieved by expression of homologous hairpin RNAs. In latter case, silencing {{was the result of a}} hairpin construct containing solely cgl 2 sequences, demonstrating the possibility of simultaneous silencing of whole gene families by a single construct. Expression of the hairpin RNAs reduced the mRNA levels of the target genes by at least 90 %, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The reduced mRNA levels were accompanied by cytosine methylation of transcribed and nontranscribed DNA at both silencing and target loci in the case of constitutive high-level expression of the hairpin RNA but not in the case of transient expression. These results suggest the presence of both posttranscriptional and transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms in C. cinerea and demonstrate the applicability of targeted gene silencing as a powerful reverse genetics approach in this organism...|$|E

We cloned and sequenced three laccase genes (lcc 1, lcc 2, and lcc 3) from the <b>ink</b> <b>cap</b> basidiomycete C. cinereus. The lcc 1 gene contained 7 introns, while both lcc 2 and lcc 3 contained 13 introns. The predicted mature proteins (Lcc 1 to Lcc 3) are 58 to 80 % identical at the amino acid level. The predicted Lcc 1 contains a 23 -amino-acid C-terminal extension rich in arginine and lysine, suggesting that C-terminal processing may occur during its biosynthesis. We expressed the Lcc 1 protein in Aspergillus oryzae and purified it. The Lcc 1 protein {{as expressed in}} A. oryzae has an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and absorption maxima at 278 and 614 nm.
