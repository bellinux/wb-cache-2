500|$|In {{the early}} morning hours—between 2:00 am and 3:30 am—on August 28, 1955, Bryant, Milam, and Bryant's wife drove to Mose Wright's house. Milam was armed with a pistol and a flashlight. He asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin; there were eight people in the small two-bedroom cabin. Milam asked Wright {{to take them to}} [...] "the nigger who did the talking." [...] Till's {{great-aunt}} offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmet to put on his clothes. Moses Wright informed the men that Till was from up north and didn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>better.</b> Milam reportedly then asked, [...] "How old are you preacher?" [...] to which Wright responded [...] "64." [...] Milam threatened that if Wright told anybody he wouldn't live to see 65. The men marched Till out to the truck and asked Carolyn Bryant whether this was the young man who had accosted her. She said that he was.|$|E

Newsday {{reviewer}} Glenn Gamboa wrote: [...] "With the help of producer Rodney Jerkins, Brandy radiates warmth and hopefulness throughout Human – not in the naive way of someone who doesn't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>better,</b> but in the determined way of someone who does. Her delivery on the up-tempo [...] "Right Here (Departed)" [...] reflects those choices. There's no showing off with vocal acrobatics or flashy production, just a premium on the melody and the mood." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{addressing}} {{issues of}} child abuse, Katz continued in {{her efforts to}} address child disabilities. In March 1994, Katz explained the motivation behind her efforts:"With my books, I'm trying to prevent kids from making fun of children with disabilities, being cruel because they don't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>better.</b> That's why I'm writing. Not only to teach children about the disabilities or the diseases, but to help them {{grow up to be}} better, more caring people. Lord knows, we could use all we can get. Is it naive on my part? Probably. Am I going to try anyway? Of course." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, as Jaffe himself {{notes in}} his paper, [...] "no one has shown that source theory or another S-matrix based {{approach}} can provide a complete description of QED to all orders." [...] Furthermore, Milonni has shown the necessity of the vacuum field for the formal consistency of QED. In QCD, color confinement has led physicists to abandon the source theory or S-matrix based approach for the strong interactions. The Higgs mechanism, Hawking Radiation and the Unruh effect are also theorized {{to be dependent on}} zero-point vacuum fluctuations, the field contribution being an inseparable parts of these theories. Jaffe continues [...] "Even if one could argue away zero-point contributions to the quantum vacuum energy, the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking remains: condensates [...] that carry energy appear at many energy scales in the Standard Model. So {{there is good reason to}} be skeptical of attempts to avoid the standard formulation of quantum field theory and the zero-point energies it brings with it." [...] It is difficult to judge the physical reality of infinite zero-point energies that are inherent in field theories, but modern physics does not <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>better</b> way to construct gauge-invariant, renormalizable theories than with zero-point energy and they would seem to be a necessity for any attempt at a unified theory.|$|E
2500|$|The Patriots and Giants {{had played}} {{against each other}} in the last week of the regular season. [...] Technically, the game had little significance, since both teams had already {{clinched}} their respective spots in the playoffs. [...] But due to the Patriots' quest for an undefeated season, this game {{was one of the most}} heavily watched games in league history. NFL Network was originally scheduled to air the game as part of their Saturday Night Football coverage, with WCVB and WWOR carrying the game locally in Boston and New York. Shortly before the game was scheduled to air CBS and NBC bought broadcast rights to the game and NFL Network's broadcast was carried by both networks, marking the first time in NFL history that an NFL game was carried on three broadcast networks at the same time. [...] The game was also the first NFL game to be simulcast on a national level since Super Bowl I. [...] As they were favored to do, the Patriots won the game to finish the regular season undefeated. Still, the game was close and competitive, with both teams playing their starters for all 60 minutes. New England won, 38–35, by overcoming a 12-point deficit in the third quarter, the largest deficit the Patriots had faced all season. [...] "There is nothing but positives", Giants coach Tom Coughlin said after the game. [...] "I told the players in playing this game everything would be positives, there would be no negatives and that is how I feel. I don't <b>know</b> <b>any</b> <b>better</b> way to be prepared for the playoffs than to go against a team that was 15–0." ...|$|E

[...] "Poor little fellow. It was too bad he got into {{mischief}} and had to be killed. I don't suppose he <b>knew</b> <b>any</b> <b>better.</b> Somehow it always seems wrong to me to kill these little creatures just because they get into mischief when all the time they don't know that they are in mischief."

Well, I didn't use you very well, Clementina, and I never pretended I did. I've eaten a lot of humble pie for that, my dear. Did Miss Milray tell you that I wrote to her about it?
