40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} an inverse method {{for determining the}} conductivity distribution of a flat, layered conductor using a multi-frequency electromagnetic sensor based on phase signature alone. Eddy current sensors are used {{in a wide range}} of non-destructive testing (NDT) applications. Single frequency sensors are very common, however, the potential of an eddy current sensor with spectroscopic techniques offer the ability to extract depth profiles and examine more fully the internal structure of the test piece. In this paper, we found a simplified model that can estimate the phase signature of a cylindrical coil above a conductor with an arbitrary conductivity profile. This simplified model improves the computational efficiency by many fold compared to the complete analytic solution. For inverse solution, a simplex search method was used to fit a set of multi-frequency phase values in a least-squared sense. Experimental <b>eddy-current</b> <b>tests</b> are performed by taking the difference in inductance of the coil when placed in free space and next to a layered conductor over the range 100 Hz- 1 MHz.

50|$|Non-destructive {{examination}} (NDE) or {{nondestructive testing}} (NDT) {{is a family}} of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic-particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, <b>eddy-current</b> <b>testing,</b> acoustic emission testing, and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher. Stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects.|$|E
50|$|These loops {{also have}} an {{important}} safety role because they constitute {{one of the primary}} barriers between the radioactive and non-radioactive sides of the plant as the primary coolant becomes radioactive from its exposure to the core. For this reason, the integrity of the tubing is essential in minimizing the leakage of water between the primary and secondary sides of the plant. Steam generator tubes often degrade over time. There is the potential that, if a tube bursts while a plant is operating, contaminated steam could escape directly to the secondary cooling loop. Thus during scheduled maintenance outages or shutdowns, {{some or all of the}} steam generator tubes are inspected by <b>eddy-current</b> <b>testing,</b> and individual tubes can be plugged to remove them from operation.|$|E

50|$|By Lenz's law, an {{eddy current}} creates a {{magnetic}} field that opposes {{a change in the}} magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field. For example, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is employed in eddy current brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus eddy currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current (AC) inductors, transformers, electric motors and generators, and other AC machinery, requiring special construction such as laminated magnetic cores or ferrite cores to minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction heating furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using <b>eddy-current</b> <b>testing</b> instruments.|$|E

This innovation offers new dimensions for the concept and design of such systems, including features providing effortless maintenance of the inspection systems.

The new front-end technology is applied for the testing stations of the latest generation. One example is a system installed at the DB plant Krefeld, specifically designed for the ultrasonic testing of ICE train drive wheels. The transducer assembly for wheel rim and disk inspection includes hot-swap modules with integrated UT front-end modules adapted to inspect specific wheel disk configurations. A second example represents testing equipment operating at the Süddeutsche Rail Service GmbH, Kaiserslautern.
