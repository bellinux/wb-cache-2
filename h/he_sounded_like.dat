5|$|The When Harry Met Sally... soundtrack album {{features}} American {{singer and}} pianist Harry Connick Jr. Bobby Colomby, the drummer for Blood, Sweat & Tears, {{was a friend}} of Reiner's and recommended Harry Connick Jr., giving the director a tape of the musician's music. Reiner was struck by Connick's voice and how <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a young Frank Sinatra. The movie's soundtrack album was released by Columbia Records in July 1989. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr. with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.|$|E
500|$|In August 1953, Presley {{walked into}} the offices of Sun Records. He aimed {{to pay for a}} few minutes of studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: [...] "My Happiness" [...] and [...] "That's When Your Heartaches Begin". He would later claim that he {{intended}} the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he [...] "sounded like", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, [...] "I sing all kinds." [...] When she pressed him on who <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like,</b> he repeatedly answered, [...] "I don't sound like nobody." [...] After he recorded, Sun boss Sam Phillips asked Keisker to note down the young man's name, which she did along with her own commentary: [...] "Good ballad singer. Hold." ...|$|E
500|$|The actors used several {{techniques}} {{to develop their}} characters. Arshad Warsi ("Circuit") encountered some initial problems reviving his character from the first film. On {{the first day of}} the shoot when Arshad, [...] "said his first line, he didn't sound like Circuit at all. <b>He</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Arshad Warsi speaking with an accent." [...] Warsi admits that he had [...] "forgotten" [...] the character of Circuit and had to watch the DVD of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. three times before being able to film the scene correctly. Sanjay Dutt ("Munna Bhai") also confessed that he had to watch the first film eight to nine times to recapture the [...] "persona" [...] of Munna Bhai. In addition, Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi's autobiography My Experiments with Truth as a preparation for Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Rather, he comments, his father, Sunil Dutt (who portrays Munna Bhai's father in the first film, Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.) and his mother (the late actress Nargis) were his role models as they [...] "were basically Gandhians. We were brought up with those values." ...|$|E
50|$|When Soundwave speaks, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> his G1 counterpart, {{only with}} his voice {{distortion}} slightly less enhanced, thus sounding more human than robotic.|$|R
5000|$|... “Whether he’s soaring over grubby bass on “LIFE” or {{fading in}} and out of the sound scape on “The Yearning,” <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> nobody else.” ...|$|R
5000|$|HARE: The sheik is {{from the}} ghetto. I thought he came from Spain.JONES: His voice is high falsetto! And <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> in pain! ...|$|R
500|$|In 1991, Irwin met Terri Raines, an American naturalist from Eugene, Oregon, who {{was visiting}} {{wildlife}} rehabilitation facilities in Australia and {{had decided to}} visit the zoo. According to the couple, {{it was love at}} first sight. Terri said at the time, [...] "I thought there was no one like this anywhere in the world. <b>He</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> an environmental Tarzan, a larger-than-life superhero guy." [...] They were engaged four months later and were married in Eugene on 4 June 1992. Together they had two children: a daughter, Bindi Sue Irwin (born 24 July 1998), and a son, Robert Clarence [...] "Bob" [...] (named after Irwin's father) Irwin (born 1 December 2003). Bindi Sue is jointly named after two of Steve Irwin's favourite animals: Bindi, a saltwater crocodile, and Sui, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who died on 23 June 2004. Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as [...] "the reason [...] was put on the Earth." [...] His wife once said, [...] "The only thing that could ever keep him away from the animals he loves are the people he loves even more." [...] Although the Irwins were happily married, they did not wear wedding rings; they believed that in their line of work, wearing jewellery could pose a hazard to them and/or the animals.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in mid-September 2009 in Vancouver. Due to the Russian {{lettering}} {{on many of}} the episode props, director Cassar joked during shooting, [...] "Can we get a translator and find out what this writing means, specifically? Maybe it says 'Do not open until Christmas' or 'Watch The Simpsons on Sunday night,' knowing Fox." [...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people. The only way to recall the smoke monster to the host body, or to keep him there in the first place, is by severe electrical shock." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{standoff}} with police lasted for approximately four hours. Poplawski's friend Edward Perkovic {{said he got}} a call at work from Poplawski during which he said, [...] "Eddie, I am going to die today. ... Tell your family I love them and I love you." [...] Perkovic said [...] "I heard gunshots and he hung up. ... <b>He</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> he was in pain, like he got shot." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick states [...] "Aida is a remarkably {{beautiful}} entry {{to one of}} the world's masterful musicians. Indeed, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> no one else".|$|R
5000|$|Wilson - The sidekick of Commander Ozone. In Season One, {{he had a}} squeaky {{voice like}} Zip. In Season Two, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Scotty of Star Trek fame.|$|R
5000|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Though <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a mere number from the Dickensian workhouse, there's nothing anonymous about this debut single." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, his parents {{sent him to the}} University of Oklahoma for a seven-week {{computer}} camp. Shortly after he arrived, some of the other boys attending the camp introduced themselves. When Garriott replied to their greeting of [...] "Hi" [...] with [...] "Hello" [...] they decided <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> he was from Britain, and gave him the nickname [...] "British". Garriott uses the name to this day for his various gaming characters, including Ultima character Lord British and Tabula Rasa character General British; however, despite his nickname and birthplace, his parents moved to Texas when he was a baby and his accent is American rather than British.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Tan contested {{both the}} Parliamentary seat of Batu in Kuala Lumpur and the Selangor State Assembly seat of Kepong. Although the Alliance crushed the opposition, Tan won both seats – with {{a margin of}} victory of two votes for his Parliamentary seat, officially the {{smallest}} ever margin of victory in a Malaysian election as of 2004 – {{and was one of}} only two Labour members of parliament (MPs). Tan would not relinquish either seat until his retirement. During his tenure as an MP, Tan became known for thoroughly probing government policies and making his views known. As a result, he was popularly known as [...] "Mr. Opposition". Tan was known for his opposition to wanton amendments of the Constitution in Parliament, and also for his outspoken opposition to the establishment of Malaya (and later Malaysia) as an Islamic state, which he felt contravened the Constitution. He was also known for his devotion to his constituents, making himself available to them at least two days a week in his office. Tan made no secret of his religion, and freely peppered his Parliamentary speeches with quotations from the Bible, leading the first Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to remark how much <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a preacher.|$|E
60|$|It was rotten. The poor nut had got {{stage fright}} {{so badly that}} it {{practically}} eliminated his voice. <b>He</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> some far-off echo of the past 'yodelling' through a woollen blanket.|$|E
2500|$|Willows {{is now a}} Sports Science Teacher and a {{first team}} cricket coach at SACS. He is known [...] for his grey hair and his British accent. Some [...] say <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a {{squirrel}} on helium.|$|R
5000|$|Mind Equals Blown {{were more}} negative, criticizing Ritter's vocals as [...] "in a tone where <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a whiny high school kid who hasn't reached puberty yet," [...] but overall said {{the song was}} a [...] "decent effort".|$|R
5000|$|When Chuck {{reveals that}} [...] "Lichtenstein" [...] can speak English and is insulted by the interpreter's [...] "poor" [...] German, Casey remarks that <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Col. Klink. Col. Klink was the {{commander}} of the POW camp in the series Hogan's Heroes.|$|R
6000|$|Buzard rose out {{of waves}} of subsiding emotion. Buzard was a slender, long-necked, stalk-shaped man with gilt glasses, uneasy {{movements}} and a hypersensitive manner. He didn't so much speak as thrill with thought vibrations; he spoke like an entranced but still quite gentlemanly sibyl. After Agatha's deep trumpet calls, <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a solo on the piccolo. He picked out all his more important words with a little stress as though he gave them capitals. He said their hostess's remarks had set him thinking. He thought {{it was possible to}} stew the Scientific Argument in its own Juice. There was something he might call the Factuarial Estimate of Values. Well, it was a High Factuarial Value on their side, in his opinion at any rate, when Anthropologists came and told him that the Primitive Human Society was a Matriarchate. ("But it wasn't!" [...] said Trafford to himself.) It had a High Factuarial Value when they assured him that Every One of the Great Primitive Inventions was made by a Woman, and that it was to Women they owed Fire and the early Epics and Sagas. ("Good Lord!" [...] said Trafford.) It had a High Factuarial Value when they not only asserted but proved that for Thousands of Years, and perhaps for Hundreds of Thousands of Years, Women had been in possession of Articulate Speech before men rose to that Level of Intelligence....|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Cory Monteith's vocal {{performance}} in the episode was criticized by Joal Ryan of E! Online, who felt that [...] "Monteith was so Auto-Tuned <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Cher." ...|$|E
5000|$|Baron Barracuda wore a monocle in one eye, {{and spoke}} in a vaguely European accent; <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a Bela Lugosi [...] "Dracula" [...] imitation. Trigger always had an {{apparently}} unlit cigarette jutting {{from the side of}} his mouth and sounded a bit like Ed Norton from The Honeymooners.|$|E
5000|$|Owen is {{a natural}} actor. <b>He</b> doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> acting, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a human being {{speaking}} in a situation, and that's very appealing to me. He's got a wonderful funny bone, a wonderful comic instinct that's quite unlike my own, but wonderful of its kind. He's a blond Texan kind of Everyman's hero, the kind of hero of the regiment in the old war pictures, with a great flair for being amusing. It's a rare combination and I thought he'd be great." [...] — Woody Allen, in production notes about the film ...|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Lloyd - Professor Harold March is {{a regular}} {{customer}} to whom Katrina always reveals her nefarious plans. Skyler loves to play with his hair. He is always reading the newspaper. His presence commands gravitas, however whenever <b>he</b> speaks, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a crazy man.|$|R
5000|$|Fuddy is Merlin's apprentice. When a {{full moon}} is out, Jake is able to chant and call him for help by casting a magic spell, which rarely works {{the way it is}} {{supposed}} to. Similar to Orko from He-Man, though <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Kowl from She-Ra. Voiced by Lou Scheimer.|$|R
5000|$|The Wendigo first {{appeared}} in The Incredible Hulk #162 (April 1973), and was created by Steve Englehart and Herb Trimpe. Englehart recalled, [...] "I knew about {{the legend of the}} Wendigo, and thought, between his strength and his sad story, that <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a good Hulk opponent." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} 13, Vallee {{learned to}} play guitar. Even at that age, he was quite sizable. One day when he was singing in a choir, his pastor heard him and commented that <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Elvis. He later was in Washington {{as part of a}} group called Ricky and the Starfires.|$|E
50|$|Gene Dunlap {{was born}} and raised in Detroit, Michigan, and he began playing drums as a high school student. He joined the guitarist Earl Klugh as a drummer. In later years, he also {{performed}} with Roy Ayers, who played the vibraphone, and guitarist Grant Green. As a vocalist, <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Diana Ross.|$|E
2500|$|Lacan {{comes close}} here {{to one of}} the points where [...] "very {{occasionally}} <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> Thomas Kuhn (whom he never mentions)", with Lacan's [...] "discourse" [...] resembling Kuhn's [...] "paradigm" [...] seen as [...] "the entire constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by the members of a given community".|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> {{knows the}} game {{well enough to}} do the whole thing with his eyes shut; the {{difference}} here is he's learnt it's best to {{do this sort of}} thing with them open. This record is tuneful, jittery, exhausting and, I suspect, made by a man having difficulty in keeping a straight face.|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, Richard M. Juzwiak of Pitchfork {{gave the}} album a {{negative}} review, stating: [...] "The fact that Gira attempts the monumental, snug fit is admirable. Sure, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> means what he's saying, but his esoteric words seem born {{more out of}} self-satisfaction than pleasing listeners. Ultimately, conviction does not compensate for inaccessibility; Gira's calluses, you see, <b>sound</b> much more <b>like</b> warts." ...|$|R
5000|$|Before execution, Cui was {{put into}} a caged cart and placed outside Pingcheng so that people could see him. Scores of {{soldiers}} guarded him, and they took turns urinating on Cui's face and body. Cui yelled out in grief, and <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Ao Ao." [...] After Cui's death, Emperor Taiwu began to regret putting him to death, and mourned bitterly.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} {{for the release of}} Back to the Future: The Game, Locascio said that {{when he was a kid}} that people used to say that <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Marty McFly from Back to the Future. Since Michael J. Fox was unavailable to voice Marty (although he voiced Willie McFly and Marty Future in Episode 5), Locascio auditioned for the part and got it.|$|E
5000|$|Mills' {{audition}} {{song for}} The X Factor was [...] "Bring It On Home To Me" [...] by Sam Cooke, which impressed {{the panel of}} judges; Simon Cowell thought <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> a young Joe Cocker, whom, incidentally, Ben names {{as one of his}} musical influences along with Tom Waits, Rod Stewart and David Bowie. During his time on The X Factor he was mentored by Sharon Osbourne.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} by Matthew Reilly that the Black Knight {{was meant to}} be a dark double to Scarecrow; he also has an eye problem and has had his disagreements with the US government. This is even mentioned in the book, when Mother (upon hearing his biography) remarks that <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a Shane Schofield gone wrong.|$|R
5000|$|... "Rolling Stone" [...] {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album 3½ stars out of five, saying that [...] "American Slang arrives with serious advance buzz: The choruses are more sculpted, but the band's tough-as-leather rush is {{as hard as}} ever, and Fallon howls so hard, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> aiming to get {{a section of the}} Jersey Turnpike named after him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the cast}} members, only Travolta and Newton-John {{provided}} vocals {{for the previous}} single from the soundtrack, [...] "You're The One That I Want", but {{other members of the}} cast contributed backing and cameo lead vocals to [...] "Summer Nights". Stockard Channing's solo line [...] "'Cause <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a drag" [...] was spoken rather than sung.|$|R
