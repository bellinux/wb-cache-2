5|$|Curtis Gates Lloyd {{described}} the variety rochesterensis in 1909, originally {{as a new}} species, Phallus rochesterensis. It was found in Kew, Australia. A form with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by Vincenzo de Cesati in 1879 as Hymenophallus roseus, and later called Dictyophora indusiata f.rosea by Yosio Kobayasi in 1965; it is synonymous with Phallus cinnabarinus. A taxon described in 1936 as Dictyophora lutea and variously <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> as Dictyophora indusiata f.lutea, D.indusiata f.aurantiaca, or Phallus indusiatus f.citrinus, was formally transferred to Phallus in 2008 as a distinct species, Phallus luteus.|$|E

Amanda Root had also worked with Thompson on the screenplay, but had already committed to star in the 1995 film Persuasion.

500|$|The {{original}} oak fell on {{the evening}} of October 9, 1942, following a long period of decline. Its poor condition had been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> and within days of its collapse, a move was under way to replace the fallen tree with a [...] "son" [...] grown from one of its acorns. One account suggests that the tree had actually died several years before its collapse, the victim of root rot. The tree was over [...] tall, and was estimated to be between 150 and 400 years old when it fell. It has been reported elsewhere that the tree fell on December 1, 1942, succumbing not to old age and disease but rather to a violent windstorm that ravaged much of north Georgia that evening, causing widespread damage and killing several people. While it is possible that some portion of the tree had remained standing for several weeks, meeting a dramatic end {{at the hands of a}} killer storm, only the earlier date is supported by newspaper accounts. It is not known why the tree was not dated by counting its rings.|$|E
500|$|Adeline Hulot, on {{the other}} hand, is mercy personified. Like her cousin Bette, she comes from a peasant background, but has internalized the ideals of 19th-century womanhood, {{including}} devotion, grace, and deference. She reveals in the first scene that she has <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> about her husband's infidelities, but refuses to condemn him. Adeline's forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw. Some suggest that she is partly to blame for Hulot's wandering affection. C.A. Prendergast, for example, calls her forgiveness [...] "an inadequate and even positively disastrous response" [...] to her situation. He further suggests that Adeline, by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife, has excised from herself the erotic power to which the Baron is drawn. [...] "ne could {{at the very least}} offer the tentative speculation that Hulot's obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in Adeline, that the terrible logic of Hulot's excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife." [...] Others are less accusatory; Adeline's nearly infinite mercy, they say, is evidence of foolishness. Critic Herbert J. Hunt declares that she shows [...] "more imbecility than Christian patience", and David Bellos points out that, like her husband, she is driven by passion– albeit of a different kind: [...] "Adeline's desire (for good, for the family, for Hector, for God) is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire..." ...|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's questions was a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E
