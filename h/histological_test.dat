40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the intra-/interobserver {{agreement of the}} visual interpretation of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of pancreatic head lesions and its concordance with the <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> results. Material and Methods: Two observers (A + B) evaluated by simple visual interpretation 40 consecutive CEUS examinations of pancreatic head lesions {{and one of the}} observers evaluated the examinations twice (A 1 + A 2). The examinations were evaluated according to the criteria outlined in EFSUMB guidelines. The two experienced observers were blinded to histological evidence and clinical information of tumor type and to each other’s results. Results: The kappa value for the intraobserver evaluation between observer A 1 and A 2 was 0. 89, equating to almost perfect agreement. The kappa value for the interobserver evaluation between observer A 1 and B was 0. 76 and between observer A 2 and B it was 0. 75, both equating to substantial agreement. Evaluation of the visual interpretation compared to the <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> result showed a positive predictive value for A 1, A 2 and B versus biopsy of 97 %, 94 % and 90 % respectively and an accuracy of 83 %, 88 % and 73 % respectively.

40|$|Introduction. Helicobacter pylori is a {{bacterium}} {{that has been}} in the limelight of gastroenterologists and oncologists worldwide since its immediate effect on the development of gastritis, ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and gastric cancer was proved. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the correlation between the positive immunological test, rapid urease test and pathohistological finding in detecting Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric mucosa. Material and Methods. This retrospective study included 250 endoscopic findings of subjects having undergone endoscopy in the first half of 2010 at the Ward of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Diseases, Hospital in Senta. The endoscopy procedure was performed by Fujinon endoscopes and the fast urease test was done by the Cambridge Life Science set from England. The immunological test was carried out by the Vidas apparatus applying the Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) technique and the staining for the pathohistological analysis was done by the modified Giemsa method. Results. The paper presents the results obtained by endoscopic examination of a group of 250 patients performed at the Ward of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Diseases, Hospital in Senta. The endoscopic findings were the first to be analyzed then the rapid urease test findings, which showed that 95 (38 %) patients were positive and 155 (62 %) patients were negative; whereas the immunologic test for Helicobacter pylori was positive in all 250 patients (100 %). The <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> for Helicobacter-Like Organism was positive in 105 subjects (42 %), whereas it was negative in 145 patients, that being 58 % of all the cases. Sensitivity, specificity and predictability of the serological test and the rapid urease test were calculated according to the pathohistological finding as the ”gold standard” and they were found to be: sensitivity 100 % and specificity 0 % for the serological test and sensitivity 90 % and specificity 100 % for the rapid urease test. The immunologic test was not correlated with other findings, and there was a high level of correlation between the rapid urease test and <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> (r= 0. 927589261).

40|$|We {{previously}} {{isolated and}} sequenced two genomic segments of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, namely, f 57, a species-specific sequence, and the p 34 gene, coding for a 34 -kDa antigenic protein. Comparison of sequences upstream of the p 34 {{open reading frame}} (us-p 34) from M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and M. tuberculosis showed a 79 -base deletion in M. tuberculosis. Sequence analysis of the p 34 genes in another two species, M. bovis (strain BCG) and M. avium (strain D 4), confirmed the differences observed between tuberculous and nontuberculous species. A duplex diagnostic PCR strategy based on coamplification of nonhomologous us-p 34 and species-specific f 57 sequences was therefore developed. Duplex PCR yielded three different patterns, specific either for tuberculous bacilli (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. africanum), for both nontuberculous mycobacteria M. avium and M. intracellulare, or for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis.

Chronic HBV infection {{has a very}} high risk of evolving into hepatocellular carcinoma. Although considerable progress was made during the recent past, the pathogenesis of HBV infection is still elusive and a definite diagnosis of HBV infected liver information still relies on biopsy <b>histological</b> <b>test.</b> In this report, we used proteomics technology to globally examine HBV infected serum samples aiming at searching for disease-associated proteins {{that can be used}} as serological biomarkers for diagnosis and/or target proteins for pathogenetic study. By comparing with normal and HBV negative serum samples, we found that at least seven proteins were significantly changed in HBV infected sera. These greatly altered proteins were identified to be haptoglobin β and α 2 chain, apolipoprotein A-I and A-IV, α 1 -antitrypsin, transthyretin and DNA topoisomerase IIβ. The alteration of these proteins is displayed not only in quantity but also in patterns (or specificity), which can be correlated with necroinflammatory scores. In particular, apolipoprotein A-I presents heterogeneous change in expression level with different isoforms and $ 1 -antitrypsin produces evidently different fragments implying diverse cleavage pathways.

The relationship between the immunohistochemical data and the parameters obtained from SPECT-MIBI was evaluated. This cross-sectional study evaluated 48 patients with brain tumors including low-grade astrocytomas (LGAs), anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) and glioblastoma multiformes (GBMs). Patients had been admitted to the Hospital de Cancer de Barretos - Fundação Pio XII, and underwent brain SPECT-MIBI prior to any treatment.

Although RPE cell sheet transplantation is more complicated and limited by the scaffold and surgical tool, the delivery of RPE patch allows the anatomic integration and reliable cell survival. However, only few reports have compared the two transplantation strategies and shown that hESC-RPE cultured on a synthetic parylene substrate survived longer compared to suspension transplantation according to the <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> results (Diniz et al., 2013). Our study compared the two transplantation strategies in terms of visual function which demonstrated is no significant difference {{of the two groups}} according to the ERG results. However, the quantity of hESC-RPE cells for suspension transplantation (1 × 105 cells) was about 25 times as compared to cell sheet transplantation (~ 4000 cells). Due to the small size of RCS rats’ eyes, the cell patch was limited to 1 mm × 0.5 mm with ~ 4000 cells. For clinical practice, a cell patch of ~ 3 mm × 6 mm with ~ 1 × 105 cells is used (da Cruz et al., 2018). As a result, it is plausible to speculate that cell sheet transplantation will be more effective than cell suspension transplantation under the same condition. In the future, more comparisons between the two transplantation strategies in terms of anatomic integration and survival rate of grafted cells are required.|$|E

The mRNA levels of tyrosinase related protein (TRP) - 1, TRP- 2, tyrosinase, MITF, ERK, and PKA protein were analyzed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. We also assessed the inhibitory effects of TAM with PW on melanin synthesis in HRM- 2 melanin-possessing hairless mice. After UVB irradiation, differences in melanin were analyzed with an image analysis software between the left dorsal skin (untreated part) and the right dorsal skin (treated part). The mRNA levels of TRP- 1, TRP- 2, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 were analyzed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The dorsal skins were analyzed with <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Results: TAM inhibited the TRP- 1, TRP- 2, tyrosinase, MITF mRNA gene expression, and PKA protein expression on the concentration-dependent B 16 F 10 cell. Moreover, TAM increased the ERK mRNA gene expression in the B 16 F 10 cell. After UVB irradiation, TAM with PW increased the differences in melanin between the left dorsal skin (untreated part) and the right dorsal skin (treated part) in HRM- 2 mice. TAM with PW inhibited the TRP- 1, TRP- 2, and MMP- 9 mRNA gene expression in HRM- 2 mice. TAM with PW decreased the epidermal thickness, around the cell deformation, keratinization, and infiltration in HRM- 2 mice.

40|$|Pilomatricoma é um tumor benigno oriundo do folículo pilossebáceo, que surge como nódulo intradérmico durante a infância na maioria dos casos. Geralmente é recoberto por pele normal, alcança em média diâmetro de 1, 5 cm e frequentemente não recidiva após exérese cirúrgica. Os autores descrevem um caso no qual uma lesão tumoral iniciou seu crescimento na região superciliar esquerda de um paciente de 26 anos, sendo realizada exérese total da mesma e diagnóstico através do exame anatomopatológico de pilomatricoma. Esta lesão teve um crescimento lento, de aproximadamente dois anos, segundo o paciente. Decorridos oito meses da intervenção cirúrgica houve novo crescimento tumoral no local, desta vez de maneira rápida e exacerbada e com ulceração de pequena área da pele que recobria a lesão, induzindo, portanto, suspeita de malignidade. Realizada nova exérese com margem de segurança, o exame anatomopatológico confirmou ser a lesão um pilomatricoma, não possuindo a peça cirúrgica sinais de malignização. O paciente encontra-se em seguimento há um ano, sem sinais de recidiva até o momento. Pilomatricoma is {{a benign}} {{neoplasm}} {{originated in the}} pilosebaceous follicle wich appears as an intradermal nodule during childhood, in most cases. It is generally covered with normal skin, reaching a diameter of 1. 5 cm on average, and it often shows no recurrence after surgical excision. The authors describe a case in wich a 26 -year-old patient presented a tumoral lesion on the upper left superciliary area was submitted to total excision, and diagnosed as pilomatricoma by the histological study. According to the patient, this lesion had a progressive and slow growth of about two years. Eight months after the first surgical intervention, {{there was a new}} tumor growth in the region, this time quicker and worsen, with ulceration on the small skin area that covered the lesion, thus leading to malignity suspicion. After the conduction of a new excision within a security margin, the <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> confirmed that it was a pilomatricoma lesion and the piece displayed no sign of malignity. The patient has been followed up for one year, showing no signs of recurrence so far...|$|E
40|$|Background: Guidelines on pain {{management}} recommend that patients {{at risk of}} ulcers receive either a cyclo-oxygenase (COX 2) inhibitor or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). These two treatments have similar effectiveness, but they are insufficient for protection of patients at very high risk for ulcer bleeding. We aimed {{to test the hypothesis}} that in patients with previous ulcer bleeding induced by non-selective NSAIDs, combined treatment with the COX 2 inhibitor celecoxib and the PPI esomeprazole would be better than celecoxib alone for prevention of recurrent ulcer bleeding. Methods: 441 consecutively presenting patients who were taking non-selective NSAIDs for arthritis were recruited to our single-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind trial after admission to hospital with upper-gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients were enrolled after their ulcers had healed and a <b>histological</b> <b>test</b> for Helicobacter pylori was negative. All patients were given 200 mg celecoxib twice daily. 137 patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg esomeprazole twice daily (combined-treatment group), and 136 to receive a placebo (control group) for 12 months. The primary endpoint was recurrent ulcer bleeding during treatment or within 1 month of the end of treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00365313. Findings: Combination treatment was more effective than celecoxib alone for prevention of ulcer bleeding in patients at high risk. The 13 -month cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint was 0 % in the combined-treatment group and 12 (8 · 9 %) in the controls (95 % CI difference, 4 · 1 to 13 · 7; p= 0 · 0004). The median follow-up was 13 months (range 0 · 4 - 13 · 0). Discontinuation of treatment and the incidence of adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups. Interpretation: Patients at very high risk for recurrent ulcer bleeding who need anti-inflammatory analgesics should receive combination treatment with a COX 2 inhibitor and a PPI. Our findings should encourage guideline committees to review their recommendations for patients at very high risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractObjective {{methods of}} {{assessment}} are often required in scientific studies. <b>Histological</b> <b>tests</b> with immunohistochemical staining {{can be assessed}} by photometry. ObjectiveTo compare this objective method with the subjective evaluation performed by three independent examiners, using slides of acquired middle ear cholesteatomas. MethodWe selected a total of 54 cholesteatoma images, immunohistochemically stained by anti-TNF-R 2 (32 slides) and anti-TGF-α, (22 slides). The secondary antibody used {{in the two groups}} was the Max Polymer Detection System (Novo Link Kit, Novocastra®, UK). The samples were processed by a digital slide scanner (ScanScope - Aperio). The selected sites were analyzed by photometry. ResultsThe objective assessment by photometry was compared with the subjective evaluation by three examiners and subjected to statistical analysis. The Statistical analysis revealed moderate reproducibility (K values between 0. 41 and 0. 60) for both groups. ConclusionOur study showed that the irregular characteristics of middle ear cholesteatoma slides stained by immunohistochemistry prevents its proper objective evaluation, while the subjective assessment by experienced examiners was more reliable...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{case report}} on a young patient with severe {{osteoporosis}} that was initially revealed when she presented with polyarthralgia during her second pregnancy. Postpartum, the pain increased and her X-ray did not show any abnormalities. A bone scintigraphy was performed. It indicated an inflammatory rheumatic disorder. Six months after partum, an investigation of right coxalgia revealed a spontaneous basicervical fracture. Given the persistent polyarthralgia, the patient underwent a new scintigraphy, which revealed areas of {{what looked to be}} old rib and L 1 fractures. A subsequent full body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed signal abnormalities that could indicate multiple lower limb bone fractures. Despite exhaustive biological, radiological, and <b>histological</b> <b>testing,</b> no secondary cause for the osteoporosis was found. The patient was started on teriparatide. We finally concluded that, despite the atypical presentation, the patient was suffering from postpregnancy osteoporosis. It is possible that the frequency of occurrence of this still poorly understood disease is underestimated...|$|R
40|$|The Authors {{describe}} {{a case of}} a 14 -year-old, who died of a spontaneous rupture of the spleen immediately after arriving at a First Aid Department. The diagnostic examination revealed a hemoperitoneum and laceration of the spleen that, in view of the young age of the victim, led the medical staff to request a postmortem. The autopsy and subsequent serologic and <b>histological</b> <b>tests</b> allowed for the formulation of an exact diagnosis of death. In fact, apart from the considerable splenomegaly with capsular laceration and perisplenic hematoma, the autopsy showed widespread, relevant lymphadenopathy, associated with a pulmonary and tonsillar inflammation. The serologic tests were positive for the recent, but no longer active, Epstein Barr virus infection. Lastly, examination of the histological preparations confirmed the important, almost systemic inflammatory scenario. The objective of this work was to analyse the event that led to the death of the young girl, in light of the main forensic concepts of causal nexus...|$|R
