500|$|By early 1868, the U.S. {{government}} desired {{a peaceful}} settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's {{demands that the}} US abandon forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, and Yankton Dakota) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out {{on behalf of the}} government: [...] “I wish all to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not propose to sell any part of part of my country.” He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.|$|E
2500|$|Although I and you, {{my older}} brother, are of {{different}} branches, {{but we are}} both Lis. I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not have sufficient strength, but by {{the love of the}} men on this earth, I have been made the leader. I hope that you will support and help me. Let us capture Ziying at Xianyang, and let us kill Xin of Shang at Muye; would it not be a great accomplishment? ...|$|E
2500|$|Luther {{recalled}} his first speech on sobriety. “My relations, {{you all know}} that I am {{to take care of}} you while going across the big water to another country, and all the time we are to stay there. [...] I have heard that when anyone joins this show, about the first thing he thinks of is getting drunk. [...] I understand that regulations of the Buffalo Bill show require that no Indian shall be given any liquor. [...] You all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not drink, and I am going to keep you all from it. [...] Don’t think because you may be closely related to me I will shield you, for I will not. [...] I will report to Colonel Cody immediately anyone I find drinking.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In old age, Laplace {{remained}} {{curious about}} the question of God and frequently discussed Christianity with the Swiss astronomer Jean-Frédéric-Théodore Maurice. He told Maurice that [...] "Christianity is quite a beautiful thing" [...] and praised its civilising influence. Maurice thought that the basis of Laplace's beliefs was, little by little, being modified, but that he held fast to his conviction that the invariability of the laws of nature did not permit of supernatural events. After Laplace's death, Poisson told Maurice, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not share your [...] opinions, but my conscience forces me to recount something that will surely please you." [...] When Poisson had complimented Laplace about his [...] "brilliant discoveries", the dying man had fixed him with a pensive look and replied, [...] "Ah! we chase after phantoms [...]" [...] These were his last words, interpreted by Maurice as a realisation of the ultimate [...] "vanity" [...] of earthly pursuits. Laplace received the last rites from the curé of the Missions Étrangères (in whose parish he was to be buried) and the curé of Arcueil.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have had}} a time together, Joe, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can never forget. There were days once, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> for a while forget; but I never shall forget these." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "for if {{my father}} and my mother <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> such a thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me to my bed alone in the dark." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe}} Arbuthnot's story?" [...] Bickley {{asked in a}} rather cross voice and {{avoiding}} the direct issue. [...] "Do you also send thoughts to work your errands clothed in your own shape, Lady Yva?" ...|$|R
