40|$|Abstract. The {{feedback}} {{stabilization of}} resistive wall modes (RWMs) for realistic wall structures {{has been studied}} splitting the problem in two parts. In the open-loop part, the complete set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the plasma-resistive wall system without <b>feedback</b> <b>currents</b> has been determined. Then, in the closed-loop part an initial value problem has been formulated for the time evolution of the RWMs and the <b>currents</b> of the <b>feedback</b> coils. The feedback logics controlled {{by a set of}} free parameters prescribes the interaction between the <b>feedback</b> <b>currents</b> and the RWMs. After choosing their values, the effectiveness of the feedback can be studied by solving the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system. The procedure has been implemented numerically (STARWALL code) and applied to a resistive wall conguration for ASDEX Upgrade.

40|$|In this paper, {{the initial}} pole-position {{estimation}} of a surface (non-salient) permanent magnet synchronous motor is mathematically analyzed and surveyed {{on the basis}} of simulation analysis, and developed for accurate servo motor drive. This algorithm is well carried out under the full closed-loop position control without any pole sensors and is completely insensitive to any motor parameters. This estimation is based on the principle that the initial pole-position is simply calculated by the reverse trigonometric function using the two <b>feedback</b> <b>currents</b> in the full closed-loop position control. The proposed algorithm consists of the predefined reference position profile, the information of <b>feedback</b> <b>currents,</b> speed, and relative position, and the reverse trigonometric function for the initial-pole position estimation. Comparing with the existing researches, the mathematical analysis is introduced to get a more accurate initial pole-position of the surface permanent magnet motor under the closed-loop position control.

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of selected control strategies {{on the level}} of low-order current harmonic distortion generated by an inverter connected to a distorted grid is investigated through a combina-tion of theoretical and experimental studies. A detailed theoret-ical analysis, based on the concept of harmonic impedance, estab-lishes the suitability of inductor <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> versus output <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> with respect to inverter power quality. Experi-mental results, obtained from a purpose-built 500 -W, three-level, half-bridge inverter with an – – output filter, verify the ef-ficacy of inductor <b>current</b> as the <b>feedback</b> variable, yielding an output current total harmonic distortion (THD) some 29 % lower than that achieved using output <b>current</b> <b>feedback.</b> A feed-forward grid voltage disturbance rejection scheme is proposed as a means to further reduce the level of low-order current harmonic distortion. Results obtained from an inverter with inductor <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> and optimized feed-forward disturbance rejection show a THD of just 3 % at full-load, representing an improvement of some 53 % on the same inverter with output <b>current</b> <b>feedback</b> and no feed-for-ward compensation.

The PSE consisted of two main subsystems, a sensor unit and an electronics module. The sensor unit contained three matched long-period (LP) seismometers aligned orthogonally in a triaxial set to measure one vertical and two horizontal components of surface motion. The horizontal component seismometers were very sensitive to tilt and were leveled to high accuracy by means of a two-axis motor-driven gimbal operated by ground command. A third motor adjusted the vertical component seismometer in the vertical direction. A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 6-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially. A gnomon and level sensor were mounted on the top center of the shroud. The shroud was modified slightly from the one used on Apollo 12.
