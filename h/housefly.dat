Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a <b>housefly</b> that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCockroaches and <b>houseflies</b> pose {{significant}} {{public health}} threat owning {{to their ability}} to mechanically transmit human intestinal parasites and other disease-causing microorganisms. This study aims at assessing the vectoral capacity of cockroaches and <b>houseflies</b> in the transmission of human intestinal parasites. Intestinal parasite external surface contamination of 130 cockroaches and 150 <b>houseflies</b> caught within dwelling places in Ilishan-Remo town, Ogun State, Nigeria was determined. Cockroaches (six parasite species) were more contaminated than <b>houseflies</b> (four parasite species). The most prevalent parasites were Trichuris trichiura (74. 0 %) and hookworm (63. 0 %) in <b>houseflies</b> and cockroaches respectively. There were significant differences in the prevalence of hookworm, T. trichiura and Taenia spp. isolated from cockroaches and <b>houseflies</b> (P< 0. 05). There is high contamination of human intestinal parasites in cockroaches and <b>houseflies</b> in human dwelling places in the study area, thus they have the ability to transmit these parasites to unkempt food materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} tri-ortho-cresylphosphate (TOCP) on {{poisoning}} by parathion and paraoxon in susceptible and resistant <b>houseflies</b> (Musca domestica L.) was investigated. TOCP influenced the penetration of parathion and paraoxon, {{and this could}} explain the contradictory results of both an antagonistic and synergistic effect of TOCP on parathion and paraoxon poisoning, described in the literature. Studies were also carried out on inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) and aliesterase (AliE) from susceptible and resistant <b>houseflies</b> by TOCP, parathion or paraoxon in vivo and in vitro. TOCP {{proved to be a}} poor ChE inhibitor, but 50 % of AliE in susceptible and 15 % in resistant <b>houseflies</b> were inhibited by this compound. It was concluded that at least 2 aliesterases were present in <b>houseflies,</b> one sensitive to inhibition by organophosphorus compounds, and the other one almost insensitive. In vitro TOCP protected ChE against inhibition by parathion or paraoxon. The importance of these findings for the explanation of resistance to organophosphorus compounds in insects was extensively discussed. It was concluded that penetration was an important factor in resistance of <b>houseflies</b> to parathion and paraoxon...|$|R
5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, he was joking about a <b>housefly</b> seeking revenge on a human {{in a conversation with}} his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies in an attempt to free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E

The potential role of <b>houseflies</b> in the epidemiology of this pathogen was investigated by examining the prevalence of A. caviae in <b>houseflies</b> collected from two South Carolina farms and one restaurant. Isolation was accomplished by culture of flies in alkaline peptone water followed by identification with Aeromonas-specific PCR using novel primers (APW-PCR). All isolates cultured from <b>houseflies</b> were identified as A. caviae by biochemical characteristics and direct sequencing approximately 800 bp of the 16 S rRNA gene. Aeromonas caviae was detected in 78 % (272 / 349) dairy farm flies, 55 % (54 / 99) pig farm flies and 39 % (77 / 200) restaurant flies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Faceflies, Musca autumnalis DeGeer (Diptera: Muscidae),and <b>houseflies,</b> Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), have a {{significant}} impact on livestock and dairy production throughout North America. Pyrethroid insecticide efficacy can be affected by exposure to direct sunlight, and the rate of photodegradation is substrate and formulation dependent. Insecticidetreated netting (ITN) is finding new applications in crop and livestock production systems. A baseline study using long-duration no-choice assays has been carried out to gauge the effectiveness of ITN treated with β-cyfluthrin, λ-cyhalothrin and bifenthrin on face flies and <b>houseflies.</b> RESULTS: After 12 weeks in direct sunlight, ITN treated with β-cyfluthrin was still highly insecticidal to face flies and <b>houseflies,</b> producing 100 % mortality in petri dish assays. However, sunlight reduced the insecticidal activity of λ-cyhalothrin, with 3 % of face flies and 50 % of <b>houseflies</b> surviving after exposure to ITN that had been deployed for 10 weeks. Insecticidal activity was greatly reduced on bifenthrin-treated netting, with 20 % of face flies and 50 % of <b>houseflies</b> surviving in assays with netting deployed for only 3 weeks. CONCLUSION: With careful choice of the pyrethroid applied, treated netting could be an important component of livestock integrated pest management programs focused on sustainable practices...|$|R
25|$|Cheese flies – Family Piophilidae - Most are {{scavengers}} {{in animal}} products and fungi. The best-known {{member of the}} family is Piophila casei. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6inch) long, found worldwide. This fly's larva infests cured meats, smoked fish, cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly iridescent and lie flat upon the fly's abdomen when at rest. At four mm (1/6inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common <b>housefly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vectors may be {{mechanical}} or biological. A mechanical vector {{picks up}} an infectious agent {{on the outside}} of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a <b>housefly,</b> which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious blood-borne diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and African sleeping sickness. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the potential for <b>houseflies</b> (Musca domestica) to mechanically transport and transmit porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) between pig populations under controlled field conditions. The study employed swine housed in commercial livestock facilities and a release-recapture protocol involving marked (ochre-eyed) <b>houseflies.</b> To assess whether transport of PRRSV by insects occurred, ochre-eyed <b>houseflies</b> were released and collected from a facility housing an experimentally PRRSV-inoculated population of pigs (facility A) and collected from a neighboring facility located 120 m to the northwest that housed a naïve pig population (facility B). All samples were tested for PRRSV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To assess transmission between the 2 populations, blood samples were collected from naïve pigs in facility B at designated intervals and tested by PCR. A total of 7 replicates were conducted. During 2 of 7 replicates (1 and 5), PCR-positive ochre-eyed <b>houseflies</b> were recovered in facility B and pigs in this facility became infected with PRRSV. Chi-squared analysis indicated that the presence of PRRSV in an insect sample was significantly (P = 0. 0004) associated with infection of facility B pigs. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was not recovered from other reported routes of transmission during the study period, including air, fomites, and personnel. In conclusion, while an insufficient number of replicates were conducted to predict the frequency of the event, <b>houseflies</b> may pose some level of risk for the transport and transmission of PRRSV between pig populations under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Several {{insects that}} act as vectors, {{including}} <b>houseflies</b> (Musca domestica L.), are often {{considered to be an}} important source of fungal contamination in human foods. <b>Houseflies</b> are also involved in the transmission of bacterial pathogens that may pose a serious hazard to human health. Thus, the rural population of South Africa, as typified by that in the Gauteng Province investigated in this study, is at high risk from fungal exposure disseminated by <b>houseflies</b> and it is therefore important to assess the role of flies in contaminating various food commodities. Eighty four samples of <b>houseflies</b> (captured fromhouseholds and pit toilets) were studied for their potential to carry fungal spores into food commodities. The fungi occurring in samples of rawmaize (15) and porridge (19) were also assessed. Fungal isolates were identified based on morphological characteristics by conventional identification methods. Fifteen genera of fungi were isolated and identified, of which Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Moniliella and Mucor were the most prevalent in all three sample types analysed. The incidence rates of fungal contamination per total fungal count isolated in <b>houseflies,</b> maize and porridge were recorded with mean fungal load of 2 × 108 CFU/ml, 1 × 107 CFU/g and 2 × 107 CFU/g respectively. Additionally, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, P. verrucosum, P. aurantiogriseum and M. suaveolens were the most frequent fungal isolates in <b>houseflies</b> with incidence rate of 34 %, 11 %, 27 %, 21 %, 22 %, 17 % and 32 % respectively.
