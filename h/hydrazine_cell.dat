40|$|Suspensions of Nitrosomonas europaea catalyzed the reductive {{dehalogenation}} of {{the commercial}} nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (2 -chloro- 6 -trichloromethylpyridine). The product of the reaction was identified as 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine by its mass fragmentation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. A small amount of 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine accumulated during the conversion of nitrapyrin to 6 -chloropicolinic acid in an aerated solution {{in the presence of}} ammonia (T. Vannelli and A. B. Hooper, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58 : 2321 - 2325, 1992). Nearly stoichiometric conversion of nitrapyrin to 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine occurred at very low oxygen concentrations and in the presence of hydrazine as a source of electrons. Under these conditions the turnover rate was 0. 37 nmol of nitrapyrin per min per mg of protein. Two specific inhibitors of ammonia oxidation, acetylene and allylthiourea, inhibited the rate of the dehalogenation reaction by 80 and 84 %, respectively. In the presence of D 2 O, all 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine produced in the reaction was deuterated at the methyl position. In an oxygenated solution and in the presence of ammonia or <b>hydrazine,</b> <b>cells</b> did not catalyze the oxidation of exogenously added 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine to 6 -chloropicolinic acid. Thus, 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine is apparently not an intermediate in the aerobic production of 6 -chloropicolinic acid from nitrapyrin...|$|R

However, due to issues of compression and storage, research has been on-going into alternative "hydrogen-storage" compounds that can deliver similar performance in a more convenient form. The nitrogen hydrides, ammonia and hydrazine, have been candidate materials for fuels for nearly 50 years, but rapid advances in the past 5 - 6 years have shown them to be front-runners in the race for commercial, high-performance, portable fuel cells.

The transition of GO to graphene was confirmed by various analytical techniques such as UV–vis spectroscopy, DLS, FTIR, SEM, and AFM. Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed that the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups {{from the surface of}} GO {{led to the formation of}} graphene with defects. The obtained results suggest that this approach could provide an easy technique to produce graphene in bulk quantity for generating graphene-based materials. In addition, SLE can be used as an alternative reducing agent compared to the widely used and highly toxic reducing agent called <b>hydrazine.</b> Further, the <b>cells</b> treated with S-rGO show a significant compatibility with PMEF cells in various assays such as cell viability, LDH leakage, and ALP activity.

Cost effective catalysts, namely, Cu nanoparticles (NPs), functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs) and Cu-NPs@f-MWCNTs composite are synthesized and loaded onto carbon cloths, which are employed as the electrodes. The cells are operated at room temperature. The Cu-NPs@f-MWCNTs composite contained 75 % and 25 % of Cu-NPs and f-MWCNTs, respectively. The morphology of the composite comprises of Cu-NPs flanked to the tubular structures of f-MWCNTs, {{which resulted in}} improved electrocatalytic activity, compared to pristine Cu-NPs (which tend to aggregate severely) and pristine f-MWCNTs.

The N-propylation proceeded quantitatively, whereas the ion-exchange reactions in 1 M KOH at 60 ◦C {{were accompanied by}} partial β-elimination of the imidazolium cations to yield copolymer grafts consisting of poly-(1 -vinyl- 3 -propylimidazolium hydroxide) and double bonds (polyethyne) (AEM 2), which exhibited an ion-exchange capacity (IEC) of 0. 85 mmol g− 1 and ionic conductivity of 10 mS cm− 1. AEM 2 showed alkaline stability at 60 ◦C but it gradually degraded at 80 ◦C for ca. 150 h. The copolymer-type AEM (AEM 3) with an IEC of 1. 20 mmol g− 1 was prepared through the copolymerization of NVIm with styrene on ETFE films, followed by the same N-propylation and ion-exchange reactions. AEM 3 was characterized to be a terpolymer, owing to partial β-elimination and showed higher alkaline durability in 1 M KOH at 80 ◦C. As a result, it exhibited higher conductivity (> 10 mS cm− 1) for 250 h.

40|$|The {{need for}} the {{development}} of new technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels requires the combination of different energy sources such as wind, solar, nuclear as well as new energy storage and powering devices. Amongst these new technologies fuel cells are a promising technology capable of transforming chemical energy stored in fuels into electric power at higher efficiencies than combustion processes. However, the commercialization of fuel cells has been limited due to the high costs associated with electrocatalysts needed for the corrosive environments in which proton-exchange membrane fuel cells operate. Electrocatalysts for such fuel cells are based on expensive noble metals such as platinum. Nevertheless, the resurging interest on the development of alkaline fuel cells presents a number of advantages addressing the limitations of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. Alkaline fuel cells operate at high pHs which allow the use of a wider variety of inexpensive and abundant materials such as transition and rare-earth metals. Moreover, faster kinetics have been reported in alkaline environments for both oxidation and reduction processes occurring at each of the electrodes. The discussion related to {{the first part of this}} dissertation focuses on the development of novel electrocatalysts for the oxidation of hydrazine for application in direct <b>hydrazine</b> alkaline fuel <b>cells.</b> <b>Hydrazine</b> is a carbon-free nontraditional fuel with high energy density (5 kWh/kg), which is often considered a green fuel since its oxidation only produces nitrogen and water and does not contribute to the production of greenhouse gases emissions. It has been reported that transition metal catalysts such as Ni and Co demonstrate better performances than the commonly used Pt catalyst. Based on these preliminary findings, we have developed novel electrocatalysts with enhanced performance due to the addition of a second metal. α-NiZn electrocatalysts have shown improved performance due to an intrinsic effect cause by the alloying of an electron-dense atom such as Zn with Ni. Moreover, enhanced performance was also observed by the addition of a second phase, La(OH) 3. La(OH) 3 promotes the catalytic oxidation of hydrazine by providing oxygen species to the surface of the electrode for the dehydrogenation of hydrazine. Extensive ex situ characterization of materials using a number of different electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy techniques in combination with in situ electrochemical infrared studies provided insightful knowledge about the role of the components in the mechanism of the reaction. The knowledge gained from the studies performed for the development catalyst for hydrazine oxidation was applied to a more complex reaction, the electrooxidation of ethanol in alkaline media. Complex kinetics have been reported for the oxidation reaction of ethanol resulting in only a partial oxidation producing acetate. Highly active Pd/SnO 2 catalysts were developed with three times the performance of Pd. Moreover, thorough understanding of the mechanisms of the ethanol reaction at different electrolyte concentrations was carried out using in situ infrared studies. Results show that better performances were obtained at 1 M KOH, but ethanol only partially oxidized to acetate. On the other hand, when the concentration of the electrolyte was reduced to 0. 1 M KOH complete oxidation of ethanol to CO 2 was observed. However, this resulted in higher overpotentials and lower rate constants. Mechanistic studies of reactions in both electrolytes concluded that higher concentrations of electrolyte allow for the oxidation of ethanol to occur at lower overpotentials due to the availability of hydroxide ions at the surface of the electrode, which participate in the oxidation of the adsorbed ethanol species. On the other hand, by the decreasing the concentration of electrolyte, diffusion of the hydroxide ions to the surface of the electrode is limited allowing the oxidation of ethanol to proceed to completion without desorbing the intermediate acetate product.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our program is to explore {{fundamental}} chemistry relevant {{to the discovery of}} energy efficient methods for the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N{sub 2 }) into more value-added nitrogen-containing organic molecules. Such transformations are key for domestic energy security and the reduction of fossil fuel dependencies. With DOE support, we have synthesized families of zirconium and hafnium dinitrogen complexes with elongated and activated N-N bonds that exhibit rich N{sub 2 } functionalization chemistry. Having elucidated new methods for N-H bond formation from dihydrogen, C-H bonds and Broensted acids, we have since turned our attention to N-C bond construction. These reactions are particularly important for the synthesis of amines, heterocycles and hydrazines with a range of applications in the fine and commodity chemicals industries and as fuels. One recent highlight was the discovery of a new N{sub 2 } cleavage reaction upon addition of carbon monoxide which resulted in the synthesis of an important fertilizer, oxamide, from the diatomics with the two strongest bonds in chemistry. Nitrogen-carbon bonds form the backbone of many important organic molecules, especially those used in the fertilizer and pharamaceutical industries. During the past year, we have continued our work in the synthesis of hydrazines of various substitution patterns, many of which are important precursors for heterocycles. In most instances, the direct functionalization of N{sub 2 } offers a more efficient synthetic route than traditional organic methods. In addition, we have also discovered a unique CO-induced N{sub 2 } bond cleavage reaction that simultaneously cleaves the N-N bond of the metal dinitrogen compound and assembles new C-C bond and two new N-C bonds. Treatment of the CO-functionalized core with weak Broensted acids liberated oxamide, H{sub 2 }NC(O) C(O) NH{sub 2 }, an important slow release fertilizer that is of interest to replace urea in many applications. The synthesis of ammonia, NH{sub 3 }, from its elements, H{sub 2 } and N{sub 2 }, via the venerable Haber-Bosch process {{is one of the most}} significant technological achievements of the past century. Our research program seeks to discover new transition metal reagents and catalysts to disrupt the strong N {triple_bond} N bond in N{sub 2 } and create new, fundamental chemical linkages for the construction of molecules with application as fuels, fertilizers and fine chemicals. With DOE support, our group has discovered a mild method for ammonia synthesis in solution as well as new methods for the construction of nitrogen-carbon bonds directly from N{sub 2 }. Ideally these achievements will evolve into more efficient nitrogen fixation schemes that circumvent the high energy demands of industrial ammonia synthesis. Industrially, atmospheric nitrogen enters the synthetic cycle by the well-established Haber-Bosch process whereby N{sub 2 } is hydrogenated to ammonia at high temperature and pressure. The commercialization of this reaction represents one of the greatest technological achievements of the 20 th century as Haber-Bosch ammonia is responsible for supporting approximately 50 % of the world's population and serves as the source of half of the nitrogen in the human body. The extreme reaction conditions required for an economical process have significant energy consequences, consuming 1 % of the world's energy supply mostly in the form of pollution-intensive coal. Moreover, industrial H{sub 2 } synthesis via the water gas shift reaction and the steam reforming of methane is fossil fuel intensive and produces CO{sub 2 } as a byproduct. New synthetic methods that promote this thermodynamically favored transformation ({Delta}G{sup o} = - 4. 1 kcal/mol) under milder conditions or completely obviate it are therefore desirable. Most nitrogen-containing organic molecules are derived from ammonia (and hence rely on the Haber-Bosch and H{sub 2 } synthesis processes) and direct synthesis from atmospheric nitrogen could, in principle, be more energy-efficient. This is particularly attractive given the interest in direct <b>hydrazine</b> fuel <b>cells...</b>|$|R
