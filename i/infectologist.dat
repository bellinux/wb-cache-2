40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether sociodemographic characteristics, {{consultations}} {{and care}} in special services {{are associated with}} scheduled infectious diseases appointments missed by people living with HIV. METHODS: This cross-sectional and analytical study included 3, 075 people living with HIV who {{had at least one}} scheduled appointment with an <b>infectologist</b> at a specialized health unit in 2007. A secondary data base from the Hospital Management & Information System was used. The outcome variable was missing a scheduled medical appointment. The independent variables were sex, age, appointments in specialized and available disciplines, hospitalizations at the Central Institute of the Clinical Hospital at the Faculdade de Medicina of the Universidade de S&# 227;o Paulo, antiretroviral treatment and change of <b>infectologist.</b> Crude and multiple association analysis were performed among the variables, with a statistical significance of p &# 8804; 0. 05. RESULTS: More than a third (38. 9 %) of the patients missed at least one of their scheduled infectious diseases appointments; 70. 0 % of the patients were male. The rate of missed appointments was 13. 9 %, albeit with no observed association between sex and absences. Age was inversely associated to missed appointment. Not undertaking anti-retroviral treatment, having unscheduled infectious diseases consultations or social services care and being hospitalized at the Central Institute were directly associated to missed appointments. CONCLUSIONS: The Hospital Management & Information System proved to be a useful tool for developing indicators related to the quality of health care of people living with HIV. Other informational systems, which are often developed for administrative purposes, can also be useful for local and regional management and for evaluating the quality of care provided for patients living with HIV...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: With the {{emergence}} of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1981, infectologists' care practices went through great changes. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe and analyze the experiences of <b>infectologists</b> in dealing with death and dying among their patients, over the course of the AIDS epidemic in the city of São Paulo. DESIGN AND SETTING: A qualitative approach was used. Twenty <b>infectologists</b> from five hospitals that treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /AIDS patients in the municipality of São Paulo were interviewed. METHODS: The sample was formed through the snowball process. The sample size was determined using the saturation criterion. To analyze the material obtained from the interviews, the procedure of thematic analysis was used. This consisted of finding the core meaning relating to the study objective, within the set of materials obtained. RESULTS: Analysis of the material obtained from the interviews led to three main themes: 1. The initial context of AIDS and its impact on infectologists; 2. Modifications to the infectologists' attachments to patients after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART); 3. Coping with death and dying. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of considering the distress, emotional overload and adaptive mechanisms relating to death and dying among patients, both in training and in professional practice...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{the year}} 2013, we are celebrating the 60 th {{anniversary of the}} {{isolation}} of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE) in Slovenia. Ever since its isolation, Slovenian <b>infectologists,</b> epidemiologists, virologists and other experts have been researching this disease. Methods: For this anniversary, we have historiographically analysed all qualified articles from this period and prepared a retrospective study of the appearance of the disease in Slovenia. Results: In certain parts of Slovenia, in the years following the Second World War, there was an increased presence of previously unknown diseases of the central nervous system. In 1953, Milko Bedjanič, Slava Rus and Jelka Vesenjak Zmijanac isolated a virus in the blood and thereby proved that the disease was indeed TBE. In the years that followed, virologists studied the cause of TBE, many epidemiologists researched its epidemic characteristics, entomologists and ornithologists studied the ecosystems of arboviral infections and <b>infectologists</b> studied the clinical and laboratory features of infections and the course of the disease as well as its possible consequences. Microbiologists perfected the technique of diagnosing this infection. They developed a vaccine and selected the groups that were legally obliged to be vaccinated. Conclusion: the disease has stabilised as an endemic type of TBE that clinicians can control, but the common effort of epidemiologists and the public health service directed towards vaccinating people against this disease has not been very successful and the disease is still too common...|$|R

Assoc. Prof., Department of Social Medicine. Faculty of Public Health, Kaunas University of Medicine. - Kaunas, 2005. -P. 68 Key words: tick-borne encephalitis, quality and accessibility {{of health care}} services Incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is increasing by data of Lithuanian health information center. Aim of the study – to assess accessibility and quality of health care services for TBE patients in Kaunas region. Objectives: to establish peculiarities of transmission TBE infection and opinion about TBE prophylaxis of reconvalescents; to evaluate duration of admission period of TBE patients to specialized hospital and peculiarities of monitoring after discharging and satisfaction with health care services; to determine standpoint of general practitioners (GP) on TBE prophylaxis and reconvalescents monitoring problems. Methods. Case histories of TBE patients treated in Kaunas Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases in years 2001 - 2002 (n= 187) analyzed. Questionnaires about state of health and assessment of quality of health care services during period of illness and reconvalescence were posted. 104 answers received. Questionnaires about standpoint on TBE control problems handed to 150 GP and returned by 101. Original questionnaires used. Differences between groups assessed using Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis tests, c 2 criterion, satisfaction dependences upon different factors analyzed by method of logistic regression. Results. Tick bites were noticed by 64. 7 percent of patient, 86. 1 percent of them visited forest. Patients have taken medical advice after 4. 2 (3. 6) days from symptoms onset, were admitted to hospital after 4. 5 (3. 6) days and to hospital of infectious diseases after 5. 1 (3. 8) days. Older patients and Kaunas and Kaunas district inhabitants were admitted to hospital after medical examination more quickly. TBE reconvalescents returned to work activities after 6 (5. 8) weeks, men more quickly than women. Disability established to 19. 2 percent of patients. After discharging 58. 7 percent of them observed in primary health care centers. Major part (91. 8 percent) observed by GP, 55. 7 percent by neurologist and only fifth part by <b>infectologist.</b> Almost half (46 percent) TBE reconvalescents don’t satisfied health care services in primary health care centers during period before admission and 12. 3 percent after discharging. Health care services in hospital and sanatorium assessed well by major part of patients. Respondents who described their state of health as poor assessed health care services worse more than those who described their state of health as good. GP suppose TBE as important problem of public health, but they are lacking knowledge of early diagnosing TBE and therapy principles. Ninety-two percent of GP think monitoring of reconvalescents with cooperation GP, neurologist and <b>infectologist</b> necessary. Conclusions and practical recommendations. It is necessary to decrease incidence of TBE by improving prophylaxis, explaining causes of TBE and increasing vaccination. In most cases patient were not satisfied primary health care services, so GP must have more knowledge in early differencial diagnostics of TBE and introduce universal system of monitoring and rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. An endophthalmitis {{following}} penetrating keratoplasty by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a devasting {{case with}} very poor visual outcomes. Objective. To determine {{the origin of}} an infection after a penetrating keratoplasty. Materials and methods. After an endophthalmitis an epidemiological study was undertaken {{with the approval of}} the ethics committee and support of a medical team comprised of an epidemiologist, <b>infectologist,</b> bacteriologist and ophthalmologists specializing in cornea. Factors that {{may have contributed to the}} risk of infection were assessed, for example, the processing and preservation of the cornea in the moment of the extraction, the characteristics of the donor, recipient and infecting bacterium, as well as the details pertaining to the surgical operation. Results. No risks factors were found in the institution, in the eye bank facilities, in the donor or in the receptor. However, sterile technique could not be guaranteed in the morgue where the corneal extraction occurred, and other isolated cases of endophthalmitis post-keratoplasty had been documented involving tissues from the same morgue that had been processed by two eye banks in the same city. Characteristics of the multi-resistant Pseudomonas sp. demonstrated its origin from a hospital environment due to its previous exposure to a variety of antibiotics. Conclusions. Corneal extraction site must guarantee an antiseptic preparation and aseptic tissue donor recuperation; although in this study it was not feasible to accurately establish the infection source, all of the findings led to suspect a possible contamination at the morgue. Introducci&oacute;n. Una endoftalmitis post-keratoplastia penetrante por Pseudomonas aeruginosa representa un caso devastador con muy pobre pronostico visual. Objetivo. Determinar el origen de una infecci&oacute;n luego de una queratoplastia penetrante. Materiales y m&eacute;todos. Se efectu&oacute; una investigaci&oacute;n epidemiol&oacute;gica de un caso de endoftalmitis con el soporte de un equipo humano compuesto por epidemi&oacute;logo, infect&oacute;logo, bacteri&oacute;logo y oftalm&oacute;logos especialistas en c&oacute;rnea. Se evaluaron los aspectos en los cuales pudiera existir el riesgo de adquirirse la infecci&oacute;n como en el momento de la extracci&oacute;n, el procesamiento y la preservaci&oacute;n de la de la c&oacute;rnea, las caracter&iacute;sticas del donante, el receptor y la bacteria infectante, adem&aacute;s de los detalles relacionados al evento quir&uacute;rgico. Resultados. No se encontraron riesgos en la instituci&oacute;n, en las instalaciones del banco de ojos, en el donante ni el receptor. Se encontr&oacute; que en el sitio de la extracci&oacute;n en la morgue no se pod&iacute;a garantizar una t&eacute;cnica esteril y se documento la presentaci&oacute;n de otros casos aislados de endoftalmitis pos queratoplastia penetrante con tejidos de la misma morgue y procesados por dos bancos de ojos de la misma ciudad. Las caracter&iacute;sticas de la Pseudomonas multirresistente demostraban que ven&iacute;a de un medio hospitalario con exposici&oacute;n previa a m&uacute;ltiples antibi&oacute;ticos. Conclusiones. El sitio de la extracci&oacute;n de las corneas debe garantizar una preparaci&oacute;n antis&eacute;ptica y una recuperaci&oacute;n as&eacute;ptica del tejido donante pues en este estudio aunque no se pudo establecer con certeza la fuente de la infecci&oacute;n, los hallazgos llevaron a sospechar una posible contaminaci&oacute;n en la morgue. ...|$|E

After it was recognized that host specificity {{did not exist}} for many species, new strains received species names according to the location at which the new strain was isolated. Later, molecular findings led to the hypothesis that Salmonella consisted of only one species, S. enterica, and the serotypes were classified into six groups, {{two of which are}} medically relevant.

40|$|Background. Staphylococcal sepsis {{represents}} a serious disease carrying high mortality rates. Risk factors, complications and preventive measures are known. At Maribor Teaching Hospital, patients with staphylococcal sepsis are treated {{at the same}} department at which the sepsis was diagnosed. Therefore some differences in treatment are observed at our hospital. Methods. Retrospective analysis of data of all patients with staphylococcal sepsis treated at Maribor Teaching Hospital. Results. Comparing our patients and the data published, {{no significant differences in}} epidemiology of staphylococcal sepsis were recognized. The factors predisposing to infection remain the same, the patients are mostly from higher age groups. Half of the patients had hospital-acquired staphylococcal sepsis. Primary localized infection was recognized in only 50 % of patients. Susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics is high, the percentage of MRSA is under 10 %. Despite the existing recommendations for treatment with antistaphylococcal penicillins, our patients were treated with various antibiotics, decreasing the mortality rate to 23 %. Conclusions. In view of the collected results, <b>infectologists</b> should be engaged in the diagnostic and treatment process in septic patients at all departments of Maribor Teaching Hospital.

40|$|Timely {{and proper}} {{management}} of injuries caused by a sharp object that has been contaminated with blood or other body fluids is important for preventing infections with blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B and C viruses, and HIV. According to the literature, most of community-acquired injuries in adults are needle stick injuries related to home health care provided by qualified nurses; in children, most common are accidental stick injuries with discarded needles outside their residences. Management of such injuries requires a thorough risk assessment of transmissible microbes through the exposure to infected blood, based on the possible source of blood/body fluid on a contaminated object, the susceptibility of the injured person, the type of the injury and {{the circumstances in which}} the injury occurred. Measures that are implemented in accordance with the risk include: counseling, vaccination against hepatitis B, follow-up of the serum markers of the blood-borne viruses, and in rare cases administration of post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV or hepatitis-B-specific immunoglobulins as well as a prompt introduction of hepatitis C treatment in case of acute infection. The presented guidelines will serve as a basis for primary care physicians, epidemiologists, and <b>infectologists</b> for an appropriate management of sharp injuries outside health care settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|In a {{pioneering}} cross-sectional study among Bolivian {{immigrants in the}} city of São Paulo, Brazil, the epidemiological profile, clinical manifestations and morbidity of Chagas disease were described. The feasibility of the management of Chagas disease at primary healthcare clinics using a biomedical and psychosocial interdisciplinary approach was also tested. Previously, a Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection rate of 4. 4 % among 633 immigrants was reported. The samples were screened using two commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) tests generated with epimastigote antigens, and those with discrepant or seropositive results were analyzed by confirmatory tests: indirect immunofluorescence (IFI), TESA-blot and a commercial recombinant ELISA. PCR and blood cultures were performed in seropositive patients. The majority of the 28 seropositive patients were women, of whom 88. 89 % were of child-bearing age. The predominant clinical forms of Chagas disease were the indeterminate and atypical cardiac forms. Less than 50 % received the recommended antiparasitic treatment of benznidazole. An interdisciplinary team was centered on primary healthcare physicians who applied guidelines for the management of patients. <b>Infectologists,</b> cardiologists, pediatricians and other specialists acted as reference professionals. Confirmatory serology and molecular biology tests, as well as echocardiography, Holter and other tests, were performed for the assessment of affected organs in secondary healthcare centers. The published high performance of two commercial ELISA tests was not confirmed. An interdisciplinary approach including antiparasitic treatment is feasible at the primary healthcare level for the management of Chagas disease in Bolivian immigrants. The itinerant feature of immigration was associated with a lack of adherence to antiparasitic treatment and was considered a main challenge for the clinical management of this population. This approach is recommended for management of the infected population in endemic and nonendemic areas, although different strategies are needed depending on the severity of the disease and the structure of the healthcare system...|$|R
40|$|Background: Injuries with sharp, {{potentially}} infected objects {{represent a}} danger, particularly {{due to the}} possibility of viral transmission, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus, and consequentially, the possibility of infections with these viruses. The possibility of a tetanus infection should always be excluded as well. In percutaneous exposure of patient’s blood to hepatitis B the possibility of infection ranges between 5 – 30 %, while in exposure to hepatitis C it is 3 – 10 % and in exposure to human immunodeficiency virus this rate is 0. 3 % (in exposure of mucous membranes 0. 09 %). Methods: The prospective investigation carried out in the period from 1997 to July 2004 was aimed at establishing the frequency and type of incidents as well as the categories of the affected health care workers along with the procedures and types of sharp objects involved in those incidents. A protocol with 20 incident-related questions was prepared. Post-exposure prophylaxis (immunoprophylaxis) against hepatitis B (specific anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin and/or anti-hepatitis B virus vaccine) and against human immunodeficiency virus infection (chemoprophylaxis) was carried out by <b>infectologists</b> according to state-of-the-art doctrine. Considering the possibility of infection with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus, the injured persons were subjected to a clinical, laboratory and serological follow up for at least 6 months or more following the incident. Exactly the same follow-up approach after injury was used also {{in the rest of the}} injured persons from Celje region. In co-operation with the Commission for Control of Nosocomial Infections, the <b>infectologists</b> prepared written guidelines regarding the post-exposure prophylaxis for health care workers in hospitals with the risk for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus transmission, and also participated in the implementation of immunoprophylaxis program against hepatitis B infection. Results: In the seven-year study period, there were 373 cases of percutaneous injuries with sharp objects and exposures of open wounds or eye mucosa to the blood or visibly hemorrhageous body fluids treated in 116 men and 257 women at a mean age of 36 years. The majority of incidents occurred in medical nurses and technicians (181), which were followed by orderlies and cleaning service staff (43), physicians (41) and other personnel (11). In 97 cases the incident occurred outside the hospital setting, to persons who were not employed in health care. In the majority of cases, i. e. in 255 instances (68. 4 %), the injury was caused by piercing with a hollow needle. The source of possible infectious substance was identified in 225 (60. 3 %) cases. The source of infection was found in hepatitis B virus carriers in 26 cases, in anti-hepatitis B virus antibody carriers in 4 and in human immunodeficiency virus carriers in 3 cases. At the time of incident, a sufficient quantity of protective antiHBs antibodies (≥ 10 ml U/ml) was established in 183 (49. 1 %) of the injured persons, mostly health care workers of the General Hospital Celje, due to previous immunoprophylaxis. Following the incident, the majority of the injured, i. e. 194 (52. 0 %) persons, received at least one revitalizing dose of vaccine against hepatitis B while 68 (18. 2 %) persons also received a passive prophylaxis with specific anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulin; a 4 -week chemoprophylaxis against human immunodeficiency virus was required in 2 persons. In the course of 6 -month follow up, none of the injured persons showed evidence of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus in the blood nor the presence of seroconversion; the 32 persons injured in 2004 are still being followed up. Conclusions: In health care institutions, the incidence of injuries with sharp objects can be reduced by ensuring a safe working environment, safe medical-technical equipment, organization of continuous education and training in the use of different techniques (workshops), as well as by appropriate use of sealed containers for sharp object collecting. The staff should be currently informed about the Commission for Control of Nosocomial Infections guidelines regarding the measures to be taken in the case of an incident, and, after having received a first aid intervention, should have the possibility of reporting as fast as possible (within 2 – 3 hours) to the infectological service for possible immuno- or chemoprophylaxis. In the future, it will be necessary to ensure an even wider vaccination of health care workers against hepatitis B, take care of an accurate registration of all incidents, and enable expert data analyses along with a permanent care for further improvement of the situation. </p...|$|R
