25|$|In Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a diffuse multifocal cortical hyperexcitability, which is age (maturation)-related. This diffuse epileptogenicity may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate emetic and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional neocortical seizure manifestations. An explanation for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> are susceptible to autonomic disorders {{as illustrated by the}} cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific to childhood.|$|E
25|$|In European {{history when}} child labour was common, {{as well as}} in {{contemporary}} child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.|$|E

25|$|Peace First, a {{non-profit}} organisation {{based in the}} United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum {{that can be used}} in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmopatic {{findings}} {{are more common}} but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism {{in children and adolescents}} are similar to those in adults. An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The encephalopathy will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of the child can be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and the bigger the delay from their potential development level. The child gets behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease.|$|E

2500|$|By nine weeks, a {{developing}} fetus can hiccup and react to loud noises. By {{the end of}} the second trimester it can hear. Among other mental feats, the fetus can distinguish between the voice of the mother and that of a stranger, and respond to a familiar story read to it. Taegyo holds that the best way to stimulate the developing brain of a fetus is to talk to it. [...] The belief <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> who were talked to in the mother's womb are faster language learners, more social, more athletic, and more emotionally sensitive. Talking to the fetus is also believed to increase the strength of the mother-child bond.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a recent}} review of the major {{research}} on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called [...] "the ratchet effect:" [...] innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered [...] "by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along." [...] The key point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> are born good at {{a particular kind of}} social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations. For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls [...] "imitative learning," [...] (as opposed to [...] "emulative learning" [...] characteristic of other primates) and second, [...] the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates). [...] Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the ratchet effect.|$|E

2500|$|Cognitive {{inhibition}} {{can be seen}} at {{work during}} studies in developmental psychology. [...] An experiment done by Friedman and Leslie explained children's performance in the false belief task as relying on a critical inhibitory process. What this demonstrated is that reaching the age of 3 or 4 triggers cognitive inhibition ability formation. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> who are 3 or 4 can suppress information from their cognitive experience in order to evaluate a situation from another's point of view. This is very important developmentally as it may interact with the formation of empathy: cognitive inhibition cannot be so great as to completely block one's experiences while evaluating another point of view, but must be strong enough to enable an accurate representation of that point of view. Other elements of cognitive inhibition that are studied in developmental psychology include memory formation [...] or memory inhibition. It has been demonstrated that intentional inhibition of memory commitment is not fully developed until adulthood, and is very difficult for children to accomplish. This illustrates the fact that cognitive inhibition tasks, such as those in memory processing, are a gradually acquired skill rather than instinctual. Other cognitive functions that are developed gradually throughout childhood include exercising self-control over retained representational structures of information and quickly adapting cognitive processing to changing behavioral situations. Both of these functions were determined to be present throughout development, but not at full capacity until young adulthood. Evidently, the ability to intentionally ignore irrelevant details and to focus attention and cognitive ability on more relevant details is not present in young children and is a highly developmentally-related process.|$|E

60|$|And now {{the voices}} of our Moral Instruction Leagues will be lifted, asking whether there is any reason why the {{appetite}} for perfection should not be cultivated in rationally scientific terms instead of being associated {{with the story of}} Jonah and the great fish and the thousand other tales that grow up round religions. Yes: there are many reasons; and one of them <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>children</b> all like the story of Jonah and the whale (they insist on its being a whale in spite of demonstrations by Bible smashers without any sense of humor that Jonah would not have fitted into a whale's gullet--as if the story would be credible of a whale with an enlarged throat) and that no child on earth can stand moral instruction books or catechisms or any other statement of the case for religion in abstract terms. The object of a moral instruction book is not to be rational, scientific, exact, proof against controversy, nor even credible: its object is to make children good; and if it makes them sick instead its place is the waste-paper basket.|$|E
