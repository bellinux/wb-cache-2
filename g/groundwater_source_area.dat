40|$|A {{detailed}} {{survey was conducted}} to quantify the spatial distribution of 14 C in Sphagnum moss and underlying soil collected in Duke Swamp. This wetland environment receives 14 C via groundwater pathways from a historic radioactive Waste Management Area (WMA) on Atomic Energy Canada Limited (AECL) 's Chalk River Laboratories (CRL) site. Trends in 14 C specific activities were evaluated with distance from the sampling location with the maximum 14 C specific activity (DSS- 35), which was situated adjacent to the WMA and close to an area of groundwater discharge. Based on a spatial evaluation of the data, an east-to-west 14 C gradient was found, due {{to the influence of}} the WMA on 14 C specific activities in the swamp. In addition, it was possible to identify two groups of sites, each showing significant exponential declines with distance from the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source</b> <b>area.</b> One of the groups showed relatively more elevated 14 C specific activities at a given distance from source, likely due to their proximity to the WMA, the location of the sub-surface plume originating from the WMA, the presence of marsh and swamp habitat types, which facilitated 14 C transport to the atmosphere, and possibly, 14 C air dispersion patterns along {{the eastern edge of the}} swamp. The other group, which had lower 14 C specific activities at a given distance from the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source</b> <b>area,</b> included locations that were more distant from the WMA and the sub-surface plume, and contained fen habitat, which is known to act as barrier to groundwater flow. The findings suggest that proximity to source, groundwater flow patterns and habitat physical characteristics can play an important role in the dynamics of 14 C being carried by discharging groundwater into terrestrial and wetland environments...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demand for}} {{groundwater}} by agriculture, industries, and municipalities have {{raised concerns about}} the future availability of groundwater in Iowa. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature began funding a comprehensive Water Resources Management program to be implemented by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. A key aspect {{of the program is}} to evaluate and quantify the groundwater resources across the state using computer simulation models. These models help answer questions such as: “How much water can be pumped from an aquifer over 10, 20, or 100 years?” or “Will my well go dry?” This report documents an intensive one-year investigation of the hydrogeology of the Silurian aquifer in East-Central Iowa. The hydrologic characteristics of the geologic layers included in the modeling of the Silurian aquifer were investigated. Additionally, a groundwater flow model was developed and {{can be used as a}} planning tool for future water resource development. A total of 43 aquifer pump tests and recovery tests and 261 specifi c capacity tests were used to calculate the aquifer parameters. The hydraulic properties of the Silurian aquifer were shown to vary considerably in both the lateral and vertical direction. The hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 0. 3 to 20. 2 feet per day, with an arithmetic mean of 3. 5 feet per day. Transmissivity values range from 43 to 21, 500 ft 2 /day. The storage coefficient of the Silurian aquifer ranges from 10 - 6 to 10 - 3. Recharge to most of the Silurian aquifer is through confi ning beds that include glacial till and various shale units. Due to the highly variable thickness and coverage of these confi ning units, the rate of recharge ranges from 10 - 4 inches per year over the southwestern half of the study area to 1. 8 inches per year over eastern portions of the study area where the confining beds are thin or absent. With this information, a numerical groundwater fl ow model of the Silurian aquifer was developed using three hydrogeologic layers. The model was created using Visual MODFLOW version 10. 1. Hydrologic processes examined in the model include net recharge, hydraulic conductivity, specific storage, general head boundaries, constant head boundaries, well discharge, river boundaries, and well interference. The modeling approach involved the following components: 1. Calibrating a pre-development steady-state model using water level data from historic records. 2. Calibrating a transient model using water-use data from 2006 to 2010. Simulated water levels were compared to observed water level measurements. 3. The calibrated model was used to predict future drawdowns in the cities of Marion and Coralville. The calibrated model provided good correlation for transient conditions. A root mean square error of 11. 9 feet was calculated for July 2010. This is a relatively small error for an aquifer that covers most of eastern Iowa. Simulated water level changes are most sensitive to recharge. The groundwater fl ow model was applied to two locations where new groundwater withdrawals are being proposed. Based on the groundwater flow model, increasing the withdrawal from the Silurian aquifer to 0. 6 billion gallons per year (bgy) in the City of Marion would create an additional 30 to 33 feet of drawdown near the proposed Marion wells, and 2 to 10 feet of additional drawdown would occur near the City of Hiawatha wells and at the Ralston hazardous waste site. The Silurian aquifer within a one-mile radius beneath the Ralston hazardous waste site is a protective groundwater source as defi ned by Iowa Administrative Code Chapter 53. 7 (1). Marion well 1 is within the one-mile radius and may need to be used as a standby well or properly abandoned. The proposed Silurian well locations are approximately two miles from the Ralston site and are outside the protected <b>groundwater</b> <b>source</b> <b>area.</b> Additional hydrologic data will be necessary to evaluate the potential impact the proposed wells may have on the Ralston site. The additional pumping stress caused by the proposed Silurian wells may cause the contaminant plumes to migrate toward the proposed Silurian wells. Based on the groundwater model, increasing the daily pumping of City of Coralville wells by 3 percent per year for 10 years would add an additional 10 to 30 feet of drawdown near existing Coralville wells 9 and 11, and approximately 48 to 56 feet of additional drawdown near proposed wells P- 13 and P- 14 compared to 2010 values. Actual drawdown at each well may be slightly higher due to well loss and a higher gallon per minute (gpm) value. These predictive drawdowns would place additional stress on the Silurian aquifer in the Coralville area. The current groundwater pumping level at wells 9 and 11 is at the same elevation as the top of the Silurian aquifer. Lowering the groundwater elevation further may have negative impacts on the production rate and the water quality of the Silurian aquifer. The City of Coralville may have to limit its future withdrawal of water from the Silurian aquifer to maintain the sustainability of the resource. Contingency plans should be prepared by the City of Coralville to evaluate alternative water sources. [URL]...|$|E

Thermotolerant coliforms (TTCs) were detected in 66 % of the investigated sources, including 95 boreholes, breaching the health-based recommendations for {{drinking water}}. A significant association (p<. 0. 05) was determined between the presence of TTCs {{and the depth of}} cumulative, long-term prior precipitation (both within the previous five days and within the past month).

However, the risk factor analysis further suggested, to a lesser degree, that the local topography and on-site hygiene were additionally significant. In summary, the analysis indicated that an important contamination mechanism was fecal pollution of the contributing groundwater, which was unlikely due to the presence of latrines; instead, infiltration from contaminated surface water was more probable. The reduction in fecal sources in the environment in Juba is thus recommended, for example, through constructing latrines or designating protection <b>areas</b> near water <b>sources.</b> The study results contribute to the understanding of microbiological contamination of <b>groundwater</b> <b>sources</b> in <b>areas</b> with low incomes and high population densities, tropical climates and weathered basement complex environments, which are common in urban sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} general methodology allowing the delimitation of protection areas for abstracted groundwater against persistent chemical contaminants for the setting up of: (1) remediation programmes {{in the event}} of contamination and (2) prevention programmes, in a general way. Since such substances are mainly transported by water circulation, this approach suggests delineating protection areas {{on the basis of the}} complete groundwater flow cycle, from the surface of the catchment zone to the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source</b> itself. <b>Areas</b> with the highest contribution rate to the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source</b> will be protected first and foremost. The method under consideration is essentially applied to diffuse contaminants, such as pesticides or nitrates released by agriculture. If pollution is local, a standard method must be applied to treat the problem at the root. The methodology proposes the following steps, which start from the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source</b> and are widened, upstream, to the catchment zone: Identifying the aquifer portion that supplies the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source.</b> Defining, on the ground surface, the catchment zone of the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source.</b> Quantifying the recharge and discharge processes. Calculating the contribution to the groundwater abstraction rate of any point i on the catchment zone surface (Ci) by the following equation:          Ci = Ii(1 -ei) Pi [m/s]    Ii : Infiltration of the precipitation or stream losses at point i [m/s].    ei : Discharge coefficient of water before reaching the main groundwater table (agricultural draining, perched water table, etc.), 0 ≤ e ≤ 1 [-].    Pi : Probability of a particle of water that reaches the groundwater table from point i at the surface going to the <b>groundwater</b> <b>source,</b> 0 ≤ P ≤ 1 [-]. Checking the results (water and mass balances). When the results are not satisfactory, the steps will have to be reiterated. Delineating protection areas (areas with the highest C will be primarily protected). With this approach, we propose not to confine ourselves taking the totality of the catchment zone as protection area against persistent contaminants (protection defined in most of the countries), but to define a smaller area of protection by selecting only the most contributive surfaces. As the acreage of the protection area can be considerably reduced, it will be possible to apply more severe regulations to it, which could never be done on the scale of the entire acreage of the catchment zone. Protection areas defined on this basis moreover allow target remediation solutions(1) which optimize the efficiency/cost ratio. They are, by their very concept, independent of the flux of contaminants at any given time and provide a tool for sustainable development and land planning. For each <b>groundwater</b> <b>source,</b> a rapid calculation based on the contribution field can be made to estimate the potential efficiency of the method and determine the remediation surface that is necessary to reduce contamination. In the same way, the effects of the potential development of the region can be evaluated. The contribution isoline that delimits the protection area can be proposed on the basis of this result. Three actual cases have been treated in order to test the method's applicability. The results are convincing in various porous or fractured aquifers. In the three sites, the results show that, with a similar remediation surface, remediation is more efficient when acting according to the concept of the methodology than when operating without spatial differentiation.

The AOC did not differentiate contaminant <b>source</b> <b>areas,</b> transport, or commingled contaminants. In response, a comprehensive re-evaluation of the river basin hydrogeology and groundwater chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) distribution was completed to facilitate demarcation of the AOC vapor phase removal action boundary and to minimize cleanup of contaminants not attributable to the facility. CVOCs, including TCE, are hydrophobic compounds that are heavier than water which tend to persist as residual contamination in aquifer matrix and bleed off slowly over time into the groundwater. In 2007, an integrated investigation and review of remediation reports filed with state regulators, USGS hydrogeologic reports, and historical groundwater elevation data was conducted.

The AAB system was installed to remediate contaminated <b>groundwater</b> in the <b>source</b> <b>area</b> and minimize the continued contribution to the dissolved plume extending approximately one mile downgradient.

40|$|Industrial organic {{solvents}} such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) {{constitute a}} principal class of groundwater contaminants. Cleanup of <b>groundwater</b> plume <b>source</b> <b>areas</b> {{associated with these}} compounds is problematic, in part, because the compounds often exist in the subsurface as dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs). Ganglia (or 'blobs') of DNAPL serve as persistent sources of contaminants {{that are difficult to}} locate and remediate (e. g. Fenwick and Blunt, 1998). Current understanding of the physical and chemical processes associated with dissolution of DNAPLs in the subsurface is incomplete and yet is critical for evaluating long-term behavior of contaminant migration, groundwater cleanup, and the efficacy of <b>source</b> <b>area</b> cleanup technologies. As such, a goal of this project has been to contribute to this critical understanding by investigating the multi-phase, multi-component physics of DNAPL dissolution using state-of-the-art experimental and computational techniques. Through this research, we have explored efficient and accurate conceptual and numerical models for <b>source</b> <b>area</b> contaminant transport {{that can be used to}} better inform the modeling of <b>source</b> <b>area</b> contaminants, including those at the LLNL Superfund sites, to re-evaluate existing remediation technologies, and to inspire or develop new remediation strategies. The problem of DNAPL dissolution in natural porous media must be viewed in the context of several scales (Khachikian and Harmon, 2000), including the microscopic level at which capillary forces, viscous forces, and gravity/buoyancy forces are manifested at the scale of individual pores (Wilson and Conrad, 1984; Chatzis et al., 1988), the mesoscale where dissolution rates are strongly influenced by the local hydrodynamics, and the field-scale. Historically, the physico-chemical processes associated with DNAPL dissolution have been addressed through the use of lumped mass transfer coefficients which attempt to quantify the dissolution rate in response to local dissolved-phase concentrations distributed across the <b>source</b> <b>area</b> using a volume-averaging approach (Figure 1). The fundamental problem with the lumped mass transfer parameter is that its value is typically derived empirically through column-scale experiments that combine the effects of pore-scale flow, diffusion, and pore-scale geometry in a manner that does not provide a robust theoretical basis for upscaling. In our view, upscaling processes from the pore-scale to the field-scale requires new computational approaches (Held and Celia, 2001) that are directly linked to experimental studies of dissolution at the pore scale. As such, our investigation has been multi-pronged, combining theory, experiments, numerical modeling, new data analysis approaches, and a synthesis of previous studies (e. g.

Exhaustive extraction with background groundwater removed most of the total As. These results indicate that As in the <b>source</b> <b>area</b> soils is geochemically labile. <b>Source</b> <b>area</b> soils are low in extractable Fe, Mn and Al, and characterization by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron microscopy indicated that As is present primarily as arsenate sorbed to (alumino) silicate minerals. Batch sorption experiments showed much less sorption on surficial aquifer sediments than on sediments from the Jackson Bluff Formation (JBF), a presumed confining layer. This limited capacity of the surficial aquifer sediments for As sorption is consistent with the similar As contents observed for these sediments within and upgradient of the As plume. The apparent stability of the As plume cannot be explained by sequestration of As within the surficial aquifer. Sorption to JBF sediments may contribute to As sequestration, but As enrichment in JBF sediments within the plume (i. e., as compared with JBF sediments upgradient) was not observed. These results indicate that neither the persistence of As in the <b>source</b> <b>area</b> soils or the apparent stability of the plume of As-contaminated groundwater at this site can be explained by geochemical controls on As mobility.

Another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time. Reduction of natural outflows, decreasing stored volumes, declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems. Groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping, induced salinity and other water quality changes, land subsidence, degraded springs and reduced baseflows. Human pollution is also harmful to this important resource.|$|R

40|$|Water Security is the {{protection}} of adequate water supplies for food, fiber, industrial, and residential needs for expanding populations, which requires maximizing water-use efficiency, developing new supplies, and protecting water reserves in event of scarcity due to natural, [manmade], or technological hazards ” (Tindall and Campbell, in press). Potable or clean freshwater availability is crucial to life and economic, environmental, and social systems. The amount of freshwater is finite and makes up approximately 2. 5 percent of all water on the Earth (fig. 1). Freshwater supplies are small and randomly distributed, so water resources can become points of conflict. Freshwater availability depends upon precipitation patterns, changing climate, and whether the source of consumed water comes directly from desalination, precipitation, or surface and(or) groundwater. At local to National levels, difficulties in securing potable water sources increase with growing populations and economies. Available water improves living standards and drives urbanization, which increases average water consumption per capita. per day), which is considered minimum need (United Nations Development Programme, 2006), the source of supply is considered stressed. The demand for water grows fastest {{in areas of the}} world experiencing freshwater scarcity. Adding further stress to quality of life issues are inadequate sanitary living conditions and contaminated water, which can result in cancer, liver and kidney damage or failure, nervous system disorders, damage to the immune system, birth defects, and waterborne diseases (United Nations, 2010). Additionally, certain naturally occurring water-borne chemicals are suspect carcinogens, such as arsenic in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, where problems associated with high arsenic levels arose due to switching from surface- to <b>groundwater</b> <b>sources.</b> Generally, <b>areas</b> of high-density populations stress water resources. Adding to this problem, population is increasing in areas where natural hazards—earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and droughts—are most severe (Hinrichsen and others, 1997). Such natural hazards can disrupt potable water distribution and destabilize population centers. Water stress affects 44 percent of the world’...|$|R
