500|$|There were {{a plethora}} of {{third-party}} hardware addons. The better known of these included the Kempston joystick interface, the Morex Peripherals Centronics/RS-232 interface, the Currah Microspeech unit (speech synthesis), Videoface <b>Digitiser,</b> RAM pack, the Cheetah Marketing SpecDrum, a drum machine, and the Multiface, a snapshot and disassembly tool from Romantic Robot. Keyboards were especially popular {{in view of the}} original's notorious [...] "dead flesh" [...] feel.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Digitiser</b> was {{replaced}} by GameCentral, which featured {{the same number of}} sub-pages, but none of the humour with then editor Tony Mott explaining [...] "Were not <b>Digitiser</b> so get over it" [...] to readers on the first edition.|$|E
50|$|For {{every person}} who hated <b>Digitiser,</b> there were dozens more who loved it, both for its fair and {{unbiased}} judgements of games, its informed style, and its unique and often bizarre tone. Doubtless, Biffos battles with his employers helped to give <b>Digitiser</b> a defiant, anti-establishment air.|$|E
50|$|Generally all HID or {{consumer}} grade USB peripherals are exempt, {{but more}} exotic devices like tablets, or <b>digitisers</b> or USB toggles require manual {{addition to the}} white list table of the KVM.|$|R
50|$|Utility {{software}} {{was available to}} drive hardware add-ons such as video <b>digitisers.</b> Office Productivity and graphics {{software was}} also bundled with the ST (HyperPaint II by Dimitri Koveos, HyperDraw by David Farmborough, 3D-Calc spreadsheet by Frank Schoonjans, and several others commissioned by Bob Katz, later of Electronic Arts).|$|R
3000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{engineering}} advantages to employing an analog beamformer, particularly related to the number of <b>digitisers</b> employed and the consequential simplification in all those processes associated with <b>digitisers</b> (maintaining alignment, power consumption/cooling, and data management), but if low sidelobe performance is required, this is offset by the increased difficulty in calibration of the array, especially for active arrays, where effective impedance of path depends upon the frequency, power on/off, and phase status of adjacent elements. Current capabilities are such as to favour the use of analog beamforming to produce a small number of beams, typically a single sum, also known as a [...] "sigma" [...] beam, and additionally a number of difference beams, also known as [...] "delta" [...] beams, and then either (a) sacrifice low sidelobe performance; (b) require complex calibration; or (c) attempt to mitigate the sidelobes with limited adaptive processing, such as [...] "sigma-delta" [...] processing [4] or other forms of reduced-dimension adaptive processing.|$|R
5000|$|Videoface <b>Digitiser</b> is a video <b>digitiser</b> {{interface}} for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer. It {{was produced}} by Data-Skip from The Netherlands and later on Romantic Robot from UK in 1987. It was originally sold for GBP 69, but the price dropped to 30 GBP within few years.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} for <b>Digitiser</b> to mock {{the names of}} contributors to its letters page. Generally, the more obvious the better (for example a reader with the surname [...] "Major" [...] could well find themselves being referred to as [...] "John"). Notable bits of name-calling included <b>Digitiser</b> viewer Matt Gander being rechristened [...] "non-shiny goose", and a Mr. Tedesco being called [...] "Safedeway", alluding to supermarket chains Tesco and Safeway.|$|E
5000|$|Campaigns {{were even}} waged to have Digitisers writing team fired - both within Teletext by its {{editorial}} minions, and beyond (by disgruntled Amiga, Sega, Sony, or Nintendo fans, {{not to mention}} the staff of Mean Machines and Official Nintendo magazines - whom <b>Digitiser</b> frequently poked fun at). Such reactions merely served to redouble Biffos resolve to be controversial and edgy, and as he often wrote on the letters pages, <b>Digitiser</b> [...] "hates everyone equally, man".|$|E
5000|$|The most {{controversial}} [...] "Reveal-O" [...] appeared {{right at the}} end of <b>Digitisers</b> life, on the final page of the final letters section. It purported to be a picture of [...] "the real Turner The Worm (a cartoon character from Teletext also created by Rose) being sick". Pressing the reveal button then uncovered an image that many have likened to a recently ejaculated penis.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{element of}} <b>Digitisers</b> other-worldly charm was its unusual {{take on the}} English language. Often this {{amounted}} {{to little more than}} using [...] "the" [...] in unusual places or adding curious suffixes to existing words (including, but not limited to -uss, -O, -ston, -Oh! and -me-do), but occasionally invented whole new sounds using words that never been used in that context, such as [...] "" [...] becoming an exclamation of joy.|$|R
25|$|Early {{oscilloscopes}} used {{cathode ray}} tubes (CRTs) as their display element (hence they were {{commonly referred to}} as CROs) and linear amplifiers for signal processing. Storage oscilloscopes used special storage CRTs to maintain a steady display of a single brief signal. CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with thin panel displays, fast analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as <b>digitisers)</b> are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose digital computer to process and display waveforms.|$|R
5000|$|Sibelius 8 (June 2015), {{with support}} of touchscreens and <b>digitiser,</b> scaling for high-DPI screens, annotations, {{subscription}} license model, removed 32-bit support.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{very common}} <b>Digitiser</b> phrase was the {{expression}} [...] "". It {{was used to}} mean erring or failing, to rebuke or discredit a persons opinion ("You, sir, have messed up."), as an adjective meaning substandard or faulty ("messed-up animation"), and as a noun meaning any negative thing ("there are several mess-ups"). The phrase, like many others, was embraced by the readers who often used it in their letters. The author Alex Garland was a <b>Digitiser</b> fan and named a chapter in his novel The Beach [...] "Messed Up" [...] in its honour.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} later backfired on Teletext, when Digitisers viewing figures {{plummeted to}} 400,000 per day from its peak of 1.5 million, and viewers {{spent the next}} nine months inundating the company with letters of complaint, demanding Digitisers that humour and characters be restored. After thousands of emails and letters had poured into Teletext {{they were forced to}} go back on their previous decision, and asked Biffo to reinstate the humour, and return <b>Digitiser</b> to its daily glory. However, for Biffo the damage had been done, and his last shreds of faith in the company had been shattered. - After Biffo handed in his notice in December 2002, he returned <b>Digitiser</b> to its earlier style for one final, four-month run as a thank you to the fans - which included a special ten-year anniversary celebration, complete with a glowing eulogy by author Alex Garland. The lights finally went out on just over ten years of <b>Digitiser</b> on 9 March 2003.|$|E
50|$|An {{essential}} component of the experiment is the data acquisition (DAQ) system, which manages the data flow from the detector electronics. The requirement for the experiment is to acquire raw data {{at a rate of}} 18 GB/s. This is accomplished by employing parallel data-processing architecture using 24 high-speed GPUs (NVIDIA Tesla K40) to process data from 12 bit waveform <b>digitisers.</b> The set-up is controlled by the MIDAS DAQ software framework. The DAQ system processes data from 1296 calorimeter channels, 3 straw tracker stations, and auxiliary detectors (e.g. entrance muon counters). The total data output of the experiment is estimated at 2 PB.|$|R
40|$|A {{non-destructive}} bunch length detector {{has been}} {{installed in the}} CLIC Test Facility (CTF 3). Using a series of down-converting mixing stages and filters, the detector analyzes the power spectrum of the electromagnetic field picked-up by a single waveguide. This detector evolved from an earlier system which was regularly used for bunch length measurements in the previous CLIC Test Facility, namely CTF 2 [1, 2]. Major improvements are increase of frequency reach from 90 GHz to 170 GHz, allowing for sub-ps sensitivity, and single shot measurement capability using FFT analysis from large bandwidth waveform <b>digitisers.</b> The results of the commissioning of the detector in 2006 are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Gossi the Dog - Perhaps <b>Digitisers</b> most {{controversial}} character, Gossi hosted a regular gaming gossip page. On one occasion, the Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld a complaint about the Gossi page, which alluded to Gossis master thrashing the talking cartoon {{dog with a}} belt. Gossis page also led to the dismissal of Tim Moore, who - while Rose was away on paternity leave - printed an unsubstantiated rumour about a fellow games journalist Dave Perry. [...] Teletexts editors allegedly used the absence of Rose (who remained useful to the company for his graphic design abilities), and the journalists complaint, {{as an excuse to}} fire Moore.|$|R

40|$|TOFu (Time-Of-Flight upgrade) is a fully {{digital data}} {{acquisition}} system based on 1 GSPS, 12 bit <b>digitisers</b> for the TOFOR (Time-Of-Flight spectrometer Optimised for Rate) fusion neutron spectrometer at JET. The system has been assessed, developed and subsequently tested during experimental campaigns at JET. A detailed presentation is provided, describing the electronics setup, as well as solutions to challenges related to time-alignment and synchronisation of the signal lines and <b>digitisers.</b> The system enables kinematic discrimination of spectral background, based on associated time and energy measurements. This technique has been tested with synthetic data, evaluated, and compared to experimental results. The kinematic background discrimination method is shown to provide improvements in signal-to-background ratio of up to 500 % in certain spectral regions. TOFOR is optimised for spectrometry of deuterium-deuterium fusion neutron emission at JET. The primary purpose of TOFu is to enable TOFOR to retain these spectrometric capabilities {{in the presence of}} a strong background of high-energy deuterium-tritium fusion emission neutrons, in a forthcoming deuterium-tritium fusion plasma campaign at JET. However, the improvement in signal-to-background ratio also allows for detailed studies of low-intensity spectral components, such as the contribution due to neutrons scattering off the internal wall of the JET tokamak before impinging on the TOFOR sight line. Satisfying experimental results pertaining to this aspect of spectral analysis with TOFu data are shown. Finally, a conceptual backscattering time-of-flight spectrometer, based on deuterated scintillator detectors is presented. The backscattering time-of-flight technique is shown to be able to provide high-resolution spectrometric capabilities of deuterium-tritium fusion plasma neutron emission. Studies with synthetic data are used to demonstrate these capabilities and the effects of the developed background discrimination techniques on deuterium-tritium fusion neutron spectra obtained with the instrument...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{faster and more}} {{accurate}} three-dimensional <b>digitisers</b> is increasing dramatically in on-line production areas, while the more traditional application fields (i. e. inverse engineering or rapid prototyping) are increasingly incorporating noncontact scanners as their accuracy grows. Recently, the authors have published a short review on three dimensional laser scanners (Forest & Salvi 2002). An excellent source of information for diving into the active three dimensional computer vision world {{can be found in}} (Besl 1988). This paper describes a numerical peak detector which performs at sub-pixel accuracy with very low computation, intended for use in three-dimensional laser scanners. Its performance in terms of detection error and computation time has been compared to other 4 numerical peak detection methods. This method has been optimised for fast computation in order to be included in a real-time vision architecture for fast range sensing. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{marks the}} first use of a fully digital trigger system and new CAEN V 1724 <b>digitisers</b> to create a Compton camera from two {{semiconductor}} double sided strip detectors. The system {{was designed to be}} able to identify and locate gamma ray emitting radionuclide within an energy range of 60 to 1408 keV. Compton images were produced at AWE Aldermaston and the University of Liverpool across an energy range of 80 to 1408 keV, using point sources, extended sources and also including special nuclear materials. The image at 80 keV is the lowest recorded energy for a Compton image using a two detector cryogenically cooled Compton camera. GAMOS simulations have been used to check the experimental data and provide evidence that indicates if pulse shape analysis was applied to the experimental data the image resolution would be improved by up to 4 mm at 662 keV...|$|R

5000|$|In late 2014, <b>Digitiser</b> {{received}} an online revival of sorts with {{the launch of}} Digitiser2000.com, a website featuring a mixture of games news and reviews, articles and humour, in the traditional <b>Digitiser</b> offbeat style, and featuring many of the characters and features previously seen in the Teletext era of Digi. The content for the new site is largely written by Paul [...] "Mr Biffo" [...] Rose and was essentially self-funded at launch; Rose has since enabled a crowdfunding page through Patreon to enable readers to contribute towards the site's running costs (though the site's core content will remain freely available for all to view).|$|E

40|$|As {{the cost}} of 3 D <b>digitisers</b> drops and PC price {{performance}} rises, opportunities for hand - computer co-operation improve. Architectural form may now be experimentally moulded or carved using manual techniques in close association with the computer. At any stage the model can be mechanically digitised and translated to a computer database for explorations that go beyond simple physical manipulation. In the virtual environment, the resulting forms can be rationalised using an ordering geometry or further de-rationalised. This potential for debasing intuitive, sensually haptic and responsive handwork through its translation into numerically cogent formulations is risky business. But it may also bring new and unlikely rewards. This paper considers the implications and aesthetics of negotiations between handcraft and consecutive or synchronous computer digitalisation of intentions. Two situations will be discussed and compared. The first {{is the nature of}} computer modelling and its representation per se, and the second is the relevance of using handcraft as a sponsor for computer-based manipulation and morphological experimenting. ...|$|R
40|$|Three Different Concepts of High Dynamic Range and Dependability Optimised Current Measurement <b>Digitisers</b> for Beam Loss Systems will be {{compared}} on this paper. The first concept {{is based on}} Current to Frequency Conversion, enhanced with an ADC for extending the dynamic range and decreasing the response time. A summary of 3 years’ worth of operational experience with such a system for LHC beam loss monitoring will be given. The second principle {{is based on an}} Adaptive Current to Frequency Converter implemented in an ASIC. The basic parameters of the circuit are discussed and compared with measurements. Several measures are taken to harden both circuits against single event effects and to make them tolerant for operation in radioactive environments. The third circuit is based on a Fully Differential Integrator for enhanced dynamic range, where laboratory and test installation measurements will be presented. All circuits are designed to avoid any dead time in the acquisition and have reliability and fail safe operational considerations taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The Australian Synchrotron AS {{is moving}} towards a {{continuous}} injection mode called top-up. During top-up the linac and booster synchrotron injection {{system will be}} in continuous operation rather than usedevery eight hours {{the way they are}} used at present. In order to monitor the performance of the injection system areal-time injection efficiency monitoring system has been developed. The system consists of several Fast CurrentTransformers [1] and matching <b>digitisers</b> [2] and is designed to count every beam pulse and measure the transmission efficiency through the whole accelerator complex. After calibrating the system using a properly matchedFaraday Cup at the electron gun, a transmission efficiency is then calculated at each stage of transferring the beamfrom 90 keV out of the gun to 3 GeV in the storage ring. The system is used to optimise the injection process inorder to maximise the injection efficiency and as an early warning system when equipment starts to fail and theinjection efficiency decreases...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{ever-increasing}} {{amount of data}} being created in digital formats, through the digitisation of existing analogue information {{and the creation of}} new 'born-digital' data from the sciences, arts, and humanities sectors. As well as generating new digital data, scientists, researchers, and scholars have begun to rely on digital content created by others. These data are at risk from technological obsolescence and from the inherent fragility of digital media. Digital curation is the management and preservation of digital data over the long-term. All activities involved in managing data from planning its creation, best practice in digitisation and documentation, and ensuring its availability and suitability for discovery and re-use in the future are part of digital curation. Digital curation can also include managing vast data sets for daily use, for example ensuring that they can be searched and continue to be readable. Digital curation is therefore applicable to a large range of professional situations {{from the beginning of the}} information life-cycle to the end; <b>digitisers,</b> metadata creators, funders, policy-makers, and repository managers to name a few examples...|$|R
5000|$|Noting that <b>digitisers</b> {{and related}} {{electronics}} technology had significantly progressed since {{the inception of}} FTMW spectroscopy, B.H. Pate at the University of Virginia [...] designed a spectrometer which retains many advantages of the Balle-Flygare FT-MW spectrometer while innovating in (i) the use of a high speed (>4 GS/s) arbitrary waveform generator to generate a [...] "chirped" [...] microwave polarisation pulse that sweeps up to 12 GHz in frequency in less than a microsecond and (ii) the use of a high speed (>40 GS/s) oscilloscope to digitise and Fourier transform the molecular free induction decay. The result is an instrument that allows the study of weakly bound molecules but which is able to exploit a measurement bandwidth (12 GHz) that is greatly enhanced compared with the Balle-Flygare FTMW spectrometer. Modified versions of the original CP-FTMW spectrometer have been constructed by a number of groups in the United States, Canada and Europe. The instrument offers a broadband capability that is highly complementary to the high sensitivity and resolution offered by the Balle-Flygare design.|$|R

The computer simulations {{are based on the}} exact solution of the wave equation using the boundary element method (BEM). The basic features of the HRTF are investigated with accurate geometric models of two heads and six pinnae which are captured by using state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3 -D) laser scanners and <b>digitisers.</b> These computer models are converted to valid BEM models and their frequency response is simulated. We present the results of simulated HRTFs, and show the inter-variability of the response among six baffled pinnae modelled in identical conditions. With current computing hardware power, and vigilant optimisation of the manipulated mesh models and the solving procedures, heads with pinnae (but without torso) can be investigated at least up to 10 kHz, and baffled pinnae can be investigated up to 20 kHz. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} implement individualised HRTFs in a 3 -D sound system or an auditory display, without the need for measurements in an anechoic chamber, if highly accurate 3 -D images of the head and pinnae are captured and modelled with BEM...|$|R
