5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating {{him through a}} maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E

Nels was rebuffed again in 1993, when he offered to pay for DNA testing on the evidence from the murder, now that the technology was available; he was told that the police had to have a suspect <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> with testing.

As the game progresses, the eponymous Kileak is revealed to be an ancient extraterrestrial creature that is the common ancestor of all life on Earth. The player controls an armored SJ 107 assault suit through the series of floor levels within a South Pole observation base. Each floor is connected by an elevator, which the player must find <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> to the level below.

The second was an observation and reconnaissance aircraft having the same configuration as the Fairchild-Republic A-10. The third was denominated IA-60 and was an advanced trainer and light attack platform powered by two Astafans conserving the basic airframe and canopy of the Pucará with T-tail incorporating high wings.

50|$|Separate {{privatization}} laws {{in individual}} republics soon replaced {{the federal law}}. SR Croatia replaced the federal law on privatization with its own privatization law in April 1991. The new law stipulated compulsory privatization {{and the elimination of}} public ownership, while publicly owned enterprises were to be transformed into joint-stock or limited liability companies.

25|$|On 24 November, Southampton lost at Sparta Prague by {{a single}} goal to remain second in the group. Despite {{dominating}} possession {{for most of the}} match, the Saints enjoyed few clear chances and went behind early on when defender Costa Nhamoinesu scored a volley from close range following a free kick, which was poorly defended by the Premier League club. Goalkeeper Fraser Forster made a number of saves to deny further goals, which Prague threatened to score later on in the game.

25|$|Kileak: The DNA Imperative is a first-person shooter, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} an International Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) polar operative Matt Coda in an armored SJ 107 assault suit. The player can advance and retreat, move {{from side to side}} and rotate the camera in any direction. The game is set in a South Pole observation base, which is composed of floors connected by elevators. On each floor, the player must find an elevator <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> to the level below.

25|$|To {{pass through}} Downtown Dallas, a route west along Dallas' Main Street, rather than Elm Street (one block to the north) was chosen, {{because this was}} the {{traditional}} parade route, and provided the maximal building and crowd views. The route on Main Street precluded a direct turn onto the Fort Worth Turnpike exit (which served also as the Stemmons Freeway exit), which was the route to the Trade Mart, because this exit was only accessible from Elm Street. The planned motorcade route thus included a short one-block turn {{at the end of}} the downtown segment of Main Street, onto Houston Street for one block northward, before turning again west onto Elm, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> through Dealey Plaza before exiting Elm onto the Stemmons Freeway.

25|$|The player {{controls}} Pac-Man {{through a}} maze of various dots, known as Pac-Dots, as well as four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal of the game is to consume all the Pac-Dots in a stage <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> to the next one. Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default—DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points to 15,000 or 20,000, or disable the bonus life altogether. The number of lives can be set to 1 life only or up to five lives maximum. High score cannot exceed 999,990 points; players may exceed that score, but the game keeps the last 6 digits.|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} {{called for}} the complete construction of the bridge, including the approaches {{on each side of}} the river and four piers with each consisting of two cylindrical columns of reinforced concrete. Construction of the bridge was complicated by the contract which stipulated that concrete had to be pumped dry, the concrete of each cylinder had to be poured in [...] "one continuous operation" [...] and that the wooden piles for the pier must project at least six feet into the concrete base. These stipulations required the use of a cofferdam to deposit the concrete, but boring in the river showed that it did not have a suitable bottom upon which to build. Tompkins would have to construct a [...] thick artificial bottom <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed.</b> To deposit in accordance with the contract, a tremie would be needed.

500|$|In each story, {{the player}} navigates through {{open-ended}} hub worlds known as [...] "Town Stages", {{where they can}} converse with townspeople and perform missions to advance the story. The main gameplay takes place in linear levels called [...] "Action Stages" [...] that become accessible as the game progresses. Although each character traverses the same levels, their unique abilities allow the player to access different areas of each stage and prevent them from accessing certain items. Scattered through each level are golden rings, which serve {{as a form of}} health. The rings can protect a character from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, at which point they will be scattered and blink before disappearing. The game begins with Sonic, Shadow, and Silver each assigned a limited number of lives. These lives are successively lost whenever, with no rings in their possession, the characters are hit by an enemy or obstacle or encounter other fatal hazard. The game ends when the player exhausts the characters' lives. Every few levels, players will encounter a boss stage; <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>proceed,</b> players must defeat the boss by depleting its health meter.|$|E
