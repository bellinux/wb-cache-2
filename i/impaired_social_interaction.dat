Autism has an estimated preva-lence of one percent [4, 5], and one of its most striking epidemiological features is a four-fold excess of affected male individuals. Autism, or the broader autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype, is an example of a highly heterogenous, multi-factorial disorder with substantial heritability [6 - 13], (see reviews in [14, 15]).

40|$|Individuals {{suffering}} from substance use disorders often show severely <b>impaired</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction,</b> preferring drugs of abuse to the contact with others. Their <b>impaired</b> <b>social</b> <b>interaction</b> is doubly harmful {{for them as}} (1) therapy itself is based and dependent on social interaction and as (2) social interaction is not available to them as an "alternative", i. e., non-drug reward, decreasing their motivation to stop drug use. We therefore developed an animal experimental model to investigate the neurobiology of dyadic social interaction- vs cocaine reward. We took care to avoid (a) engaging sexual attraction-related aspects of such a social interaction and (b) hierarchical difference as confounding stimuli. The cocaine- or social interaction stimulus was offered - in a mutually exclusive setting - {{within the confines of}} a conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus. In our paradigm, only four 15 -min episodes of social interaction proved sufficient to (i) switch the rats&# 39; preference from cocaine-associated contextual stimuli to social interaction CPP and (ii) inhibit the subsequent reacquisition/reexpression of cocaine CPP. The behavioral effect was paralleled by a reversal of brain activation (i. e., EGR 1 expression) in the nucleus accumbens, the central and basolateral amygdala, and the ventral tegmental area. Of relevance for the psychotherapy of addictive disorders, the most rewarding sensory component of the composite stimulus &# 39;social interaction&# 39; was touch. To test our hypothesis that motivation is encoded in neuron ensembles dedicated to specific reward scenarios, we are currently (1) mapping the neural circuits involved in cocaine- vs social interaction reward and (2) adapting our paradigm for C 57 BL/ 6 mice {{to make use of the}} plethora of transgenic models available in this species...|$|E

50|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} {{in which those}} affected experience <b>impaired</b> <b>social</b> <b>interactions,</b> communication, and behaviors.

However, the exact biological mechanism of self-understanding in autistic children is currently unknown. It has been found that there are significant differences in brain activation in self and other situations in autistic children when compared to children who do not have autism. In adults who do not have autism, during self-recognition tasks, the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule in the right hemisphere are activated. Children who do not have autism show activation in these areas when performing face processing tasks for their own faces and those of others. Children with autism, however, only show activation in these areas when recognizing their own faces. The activation in the inferior frontal gyrus is less in children with autism than in those who do not have autism.|$|R

Total cerebral volumes, sex, and ages were partialed out. Compared with controls, the putamen was significantly larger in the ASD group.
