40|$|The {{symmetry}} {{energy at}} sub and supra-saturation densities {{has a great}} importance in understanding {{the exact nature of}} asymmetric nuclear matter as well as neutron star, but, it is poor known, especially at supra-saturation densities. We will demonstrate here that the neutron to proton ratios from different kind of fragments is able to determine the supra-saturation behavior of symmetry energy or not. For this purpose, a series of Sn isotopes are simulated at different incident energies using the Isospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) model with either a soft or a stiff symmetry energy for the present study. It is found that the single neutron to proton ratio from <b>free</b> <b>nucleons</b> as well as LCP's is sensitive towards the symmetry energy, incident energy as well as isospin asymmetry of the system.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that nucleosynthesis in rapid, high-entropy expansions of proton-rich matter from high temperature and density {{can result in}} a wider variety of abundance patterns than heretofore appreciated. In particular, such expansions can produce iron-group nuclides, p-process nuclei, or even heavy, neutron-rich isotopes. Such diversity arises because the nucleosynthesis enters a little explored regime in which the <b>free</b> <b>nucleons</b> are not in equilibrium with the abundant 4 He. This allows nuclei significantly heavier than iron to form in the presence of abundant <b>free</b> <b>nucleons</b> early in the expansion. As the temperature drops, nucleons increasingly assemble into 4 He and heavier nuclei. If the assembly is efficient, the resulting depletion of free neutrons allows disintegration flows to drive nuclei back down to iron and nickel. If this assembly is inefficient, then the large abundance of <b>free</b> <b>nucleons</b> prevents the disintegration flows and leaves a distribution of heavy nuclei after reaction freezeout. For cases in between, an intermediate abundance distribution, enriched in p-process isotopes, is frozen out. These last expansions may contribute to the solar system’s supply of the p-process nuclides if mildly proton-rich, high-entropy matter is ejected from proto-neutron stars winds or other astrophysical sites. Also significant is the fact that, because the nucleosynthesis is primary, the signature of this nucleosynthesis may be evident in metal poor stars. 1...|$|R
