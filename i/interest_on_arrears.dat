Beauty there was, grace there was, strength, and enough of the rest to drive better men than George Skinner to beat their heads on piano-tops--but for the new-found life of him Conroy could not feel one flutter of instinct or emotion that turned to herward. He put up his feet and fell asleep, dreaming of a joyous, normal world recovered--with <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>arrears.</b> There were many things in it, but no one face of any one woman.|$|E
50|$|In money {{lending and}} in sales contracts, penalty interest, also called penalty APR (penalty annual {{percentage}} rate), default interest, interest for/on late payment, statutory interest for/on late payment, <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>arrears,</b> or penal interest, is punitive interest charged by a lender to a borrower if installments are not paid {{according to the}} loan terms. If an installment is not received according to the repayment terms, sometimes if not received {{by the end of}} the month, the borrower/buyer is charged penalty interest on the delayed installment/payment.|$|E
50|$|On Grainger’s {{death in}} 1861, he left debts of £128,582 and his {{personal}} estate amounted to only £16,913. Grainger’s debts included £30,000 owed to Clayton.

5000|$|Speculators in {{building}} ground usually grant sub-feus to builders {{at a high}} feu-duty. But where sub-feus are prohibited — {{they might have been}} prior to the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 — and there is much demand for building ground, the feuars frequently stipulate that the builder pay an annual rent rather than purchase the land outright. This annual rent is called a ground annual. Interest is not due <b>on</b> <b>arrears</b> of ground annuals and, like other real burdens, ground annuals may now be freely assigned and conveyed.|$|R
50|$|Summerville's first {{election}} {{victory was}} as a Toronto Board of Education trustee in 1920 and then elected as Toronto City Council Ward 1 alderman from 1922 to 1929. Summerville {{was elected to the}} Toronto Board of Control in 1929. His election caused controversy when it was discovered he was <b>on</b> <b>arrears</b> <b>on</b> some of his municipal taxes, and was thus ineligible to run and to take his seat on the board. As a result a by-election was called. Summerville, having paid his taxes, was allowed to run and he won the seat by a considerable margin. He stayed on the Board of Control for two years but lost his seat in 1930. He returned to council as alderman in 1935 and remained for two years until {{he was elected to the}} provincial legislature.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analysis of Irish mortgage arrears {{using a new}} loan-level dataset which incorporates data from four Irish banks. We identify the main characteristics of accounts in arrears and examine the role of ability-to-pay and equity factors in the recent hike in mortgage delinquency rates. We find that borrowers who took out their mortgage for buy-to-let purposes, those with high loan-to-value ratios and those with high repayment burdens are all {{more likely to be}} in arrears. This is also the case for borrowers with properties in regions that have suffered more severe economic shocks, as proxied for by changes in the regional unemployment rate. Our empirical analysis suggests that affordability issues and general macroeconomic developments have had an important and sizeable effect <b>on</b> <b>arrears</b> trends over time, suggesting that policy efforts to target the growing level of mortgage arrears need to take account of these issues.

The economy had deteriorated rapidly, starting in 1989, as the United States Agency for International Development (AID) pointedly interrupted disbursements of its grants to Honduras to signal displeasure {{with the economic}} policies of the old government and to push the new government to make economic reforms. Nondisbursal of those funds greatly exacerbated the country's economic problems. Funds from the multilateral lending institutions, which eventually would help fill the gap left by the reduction of United States aid, were still under negotiation in 1989 and would be conditioned first <b>on</b> payment of <b>arrears</b> <b>on</b> the country's enormous external debt.|$|R

40|$|Sound {{household}} {{financial conditions}} are relevant for both financial and monetary stability. Therefore, we analyse household financial fragility {{in a sample}} of euro area countries with the aim to shed some light {{on the nature of the}} large debt increase accumulated in recent years. We focus <b>on</b> household <b>arrears</b> <b>on</b> payment obligations, which are one of the most direct measures of financial stress of the sector. The probability of falling into arrears is derived from a life-cycle type of model and is investigated empirically using a cross-section and time series approach. We analyse cointegration and model arrears within an errorcorrection framework. The results suggest that the financial conditions of households might become more vulnerable to adverse shocks in their income and wealth.

40|$|Following this introduction, Part II {{explores the}} nature and {{purposes}} of prejudgment <b>interest,</b> focusing <b>on</b> the role that prejudgment interest plays in a claimant 2 ̆ 7 s remedy or damage award and exploring the historical distinction between liquidated and unliquidated claims. Part III builds on this historical distinction by examining two different approaches for calculating prejudgment interest where a meritorious liquidated claim is countered by a meritorious unliquidated counterclaim: (1) the Washington rule, {{also known as the}} <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the entire claim or <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the whole rule; and (2) the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the balance rule and its slight variation in California, which focuses on the distinction between a 2 ̆ 2 payment 2 ̆ 2 and a 2 ̆ 2 discount 2 ̆ 2. Based on those rules, Part IV argues that (1) Washington 2 ̆ 7 s continued reliance on Mall Tool Co. v. Far West Equip. Co., which applied the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the whole rule except in a very narrow situation, leads to unjust results in many cases; and (2) the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the balance rule is the better reasoned approach. Finally, Part V concludes that Washington should replace the rule established in Mall Tool Co. with the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the balance rule for awarding and calculating prejudgment interest, thereby making <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the whole {{the exception rather than the}} rule...|$|R

50|$|Nobel-prize winning {{economist}} Eugene Fama {{contends that}} paying <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> reserves has (in effect) increased {{the supply of}} short-term debt, which through standard demand/supply effects would increase bond yields.
