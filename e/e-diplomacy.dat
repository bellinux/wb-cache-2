40|$|This {{article focuses}} on Midwives 4 All, an <b>e-diplomacy</b> {{campaign}} launched by the Swedish MFA in 2015. The campaign aims to spread knowledge {{about the benefits of}} midwives and evidence-based midwifery. Within the campaign, the Swedish MFA, and in particular its Communications Department (UD-KOM), combines <b>e-diplomacy</b> and networking and the campaign has become one key activity within the Swedish feminist foreign policy. It is organizing diplomacy in new ways that regards both choices of channels and the networking with inter- and nongovernmental organizations. The limited impacts of the campaign are seen as consequences of the peripheral status of the issue and the lack of systematic structures for <b>e-diplomacy</b> so far. In spite of this the case indicates that <b>e-diplomacy</b> has the potential to raise and empower both new actor groups and new issues on the diplomatic agenda. ...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to define eDiplomacy and its three ideal-types of standardisation, power, and {{visibility}} and to analyse digital diplomacy’s application in practice by state and non-state actors. The questions this paper will try to answer are: 1) 	What are eDiplomacy and ediplomats? 2) 	To what extent can the practices of eDiplomacy be applied to the traditional and newly emerging diplomatic actors in terms of standardisation, power, and visibility? In this paper, <b>e-diplomacy</b> and its activities will be viewed as inherent to the practices of public diplomacy. However, the practice of digital diplomacy is not limited to that of public diplomacy. One of the reasons is that the reduction of <b>e-diplomacy</b> to public diplomacy misses much of the power and capacity that ICTs can potentially provide (Holmes, 2013, p. 5). Therefore, this paper will contribute to the academic field of digital diplomacy by expanding the prevailing framework in the literature on digital diplomacy. The arguments in this paper are based on the assumption that the hierarchical mentality and outmoded practices of traditional diplomatic actors no longer fit the reality of international relations. Consequentially, the old actors become marginalised by newly emerging ediplomats. In order to stay relevant in the field, diplomatic actors inevitably have to change their ways of thinking about digital technologies. Digital diplomacy and its implications on standardisation, power, and visibility allow diplomats to become active knowledge producers and influential public figures, thus bringing the diplomatic game to a new level...|$|E

In the theoretical part is described the background of governmental and institutional communication and terms essential for the thesis, such as social media, e-government and <b>e-diplomacy.</b> Theoretical knowledge is transferred into practice {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Based on the quantitative research of communication of the Czech government in the social media (Facebook, Twitter), there is observed efficiency of such communication at national and international level...|$|E
40|$|<b>E-diplomacy</b> is disrupting {{old ways}} of {{achieving}} foreign policy goals, writes Fergus Hanson for the Australian, and DFAT needs to catch up. Last week Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd set out {{his vision for}} the future of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He said he was "acutely conscious of a core fact: we now have 18 per cent fewer staff abroad than we did in 1996 ". That was a recognition of underfunding, but also perhaps a sign that things need to be done differently. And there are other, more efficient ways to do things. In leading foreign ministries the digital age is producing dramatic change. Every day a single American diplomat communicates with more than a quarter of a million Indonesians using Facebook. Australia 2 ̆ 7 s diplomatic service, by contrast, doesn 2 ̆ 7 t even use social media in Indonesia. Read the full article>...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} Media Relations Office (MRO) of the U. S. Embassy in Madrid {{regarding}} {{dissemination of}} information in support of American Public Diplomacy objectives is explained. How the MRO tracks {{the impact of the}} message on the audience is also explained. For this, the MRO has two components: the Press and Communications Office and the Information Resource Center, which work in coordination to disseminate the message. We will start by explaining what Public Diplomacy is, and will also highlight its response to the challenges posed by globalization, such as <b>e-diplomacy</b> and virtual diplomacy. Then we will explain the functioning of the MRO, focusing on issues such as communication plans for the Media and the public; continued Media relations to grant mutual understanding and the dissemination of the message; in-house databases to track currents news; the establishment of a coordinated global message and image; and information outreach in support of Public Diplomacy...|$|E
40|$|This report {{argues that}} the {{operations}} of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s diplomatic network are challenged {{by a lack of}} funding, the shift of global power towards Asia, the impact of technology, and the rising importance of public diplomacy. It {{argues that the}}re is an urgent need to rebuild Australia’s diplomatic network. This report follows the findings of two earlier inquiries by the Committee and identifies a chronic underfunding of DFAT over the last three decades. The previous inquiries concerned Australia’s relationship with the countries of Africa, and a review of the DFAT 2009 – 10 annual report. In the review of DFAT’s annual report, the Committee commented that there was a substantial question regarding DFAT’s future role and the adequacy of the services it provides on behalf of Australia. An underlying theme throughout this report is the effect of this underfunding on the spread and depth of Australia’s diplomatic network (Chapter Two), the activities undertaken at diplomatic posts (Chapter Three) and the ability to take up innovative forms of <b>e-diplomacy</b> (Chapter Four). DFAT has experienced cuts and financial constraints through successive governments and this has resulted in a diplomatic network which is seriously deficient and does not reflect Australia’s position within the G 20 and OECD economies. Australia has the smallest diplomatic network of the G 20 countries and sits at 25 th in comparison to the 34 nations of the OECD. Australia clearly is punching below its weight...|$|E
