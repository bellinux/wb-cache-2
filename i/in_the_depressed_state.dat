40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{quality of}} {{subjective}} experience of dysphoria may predict persistence of depression, independently of severity. This is {{tested in a}} clinic sample of adolescents with first episode of major depression using <b>the</b> <b>Depressed</b> <b>States</b> Checklist adapted for adolescents. METHOD: Ninety-four adolescents with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD) were followed up at 12 months. Self-devaluative components of dysphoric experience, ruminative style, over-general autobiographical memory, and self-reported and observer-rated measures of depression severity were assessed at presentation and evaluated as predictors of persistent MDD. RESULTS: Persistent MDD was predicted by the independent additive effects of the higher self-devaluative component of dysphoria, lower general intelligence and greater observer-rated severity of depression at presentation. Neither self-reported depression score, overgeneral memory retrieval nor ruminative style contributed. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of self-devaluative dysphoric experience increase the liability for persistence of first-episode MDD. Other affective-cognitive components also contribute. The adolescent version of <b>the</b> <b>Depressed</b> <b>States</b> Checklist is a useful brief measure of cognitive vulnerability for persistence in currently depressed young people...|$|R
40|$|Teasdale's {{differential}} activation hypothesis (DAH) {{has been}} proposed as one account of cognitive vulnerability to depression.

Empirical support for the predictions of this model derives from a combination of cross-sectional and prospective studies.

Postmenopausal women recalling the MT report severe mood {{disturbances}} or worsening depression during the transition (Blehar et al. 1998; Freeman et al. 2002). Mood elevation is reported less frequently than depression in the MT (Blehar et al. 1998; Kennedy et al. 2005). Our work reviewing longitudinal standardized clinical assessments in menopausal age women with bipolar disorder found {{a high degree of}} depression, 68  % over a 17 -month average duration, that was significantly greater than what subjects reported experiencing during their reproductive years (Marsh et al. 2008).

40|$|The {{limits of}} the {{cognitive}} deficits associated with depression were investigated with a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests. In addition, the various perspectives regarding the mechanism responsible for the cognitive changes were investigated using a dual-task paradigm. By comparing a clinically depressed group and a non-depressed control group as they performed a finger tapping task and either a simultaneous automatic or a relatively attention-demanding cognitive task, {{it was possible to}} address the issue of depression-related decreases in processing capacity. The proportional change in tapping rate, in the dual-task condition, relative to the single-task condition, served as an indicator of the resources necessary to perform the cognitive task. By comparing responsiveness to a task emphasis manipulation, designed to shift priority from a manual to a cognitive task, it was possible {{to address the issue of}} resource allocation. Finally, by comparing left- and right-hand decrement scores during simultaneous performance of either a verbal or a spatial task, it was possible to address the issue of hemispheric specialization. The results do not provide strong support for the theory of a decrease in central capacity in major depression. Instead, the findings are suggestive of a capacity limitation specific to processing spatial information. As such, the findings are more consistent with a multiple resource model of attention. In addition, the results offer some support for the model of impaired allocation of attentional resources in response to task demands.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in bipolar type I (BD I) and schizoaffective (SQA) patients during a 2 -year period in a naturalistic study. METHODS: This study was based on the data generated by the Bipolar Comprehensive Outcome Study, a prospective, non-interventional, observational study of participants with BD I and SQA disorder. Mixed-Model Repeated Measures Analysis was used to analyze changes in the SF- 36 and EQ- 5 D. RESULTS: Participants exhibited low health status at baseline with SF- 36 mean scores of 46. 7 ± 10. 5 and 36. 9 ± 12. 9 (best imaginable health= 100, normal population≈ 50) for physical and mental components, respectively. No significant differences were found between the ratings of the BD I and SQA patients on HRQoL. The SF- 36 SMC improved significantly over 24 months although SPC scores remained consistent across the study. On the whole, the lowest SMC score was observed among the depressed patients (38. 20), followed by the patients with a mixed state (39. 01) and the manic patients (39. 83). LIMITATIONS: The observational design may have limited the causal relationships and the generalizability within the current findings. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL was significantly impaired in all stages of BD and SQA when compared to the general population.

40|$|IMPORTANCE Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) and {{bipolar disorder}} (BD) {{are difficult to}} distinguish clinically during the depressed or remitted states. Both mood disorders are characterized by emotion regulation disturbances; however, {{little is known about}} emotion regulation differences between MDD and BD. Better insight into these differences would be helpful for differentiation based on disorder-specific underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Previous studies comparing these disorders often allowed medication use, limiting generalizability and validity. Moreover, patients with MDD and BD were mostly compared during the depressed, but not the remitted, state, while state might potentially modulate differences between MDD and BD. OBJECTIVE To investigate positive and negative emotion regulation in medication-free patients with MDD and BD in 2 mood states: depressed or remitted. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study conducted from May 2009 to August 2013 comparing behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging emotion regulation data of 42 patients with MDD, 35 with BD, and 36 healthy control (HC) participants free of psychotropic medication recruited from several psychiatric institutions across the Netherlands. INTERVENTION A voluntary emotion regulation functional magnetic resonance imaging task using positive and negative pictures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent responses during emotion regulation. RESULTS In the remitted state, only patients with BD showed impaired emotion regulation (t = 3. 39; P <. 001; Cohen d = 0. 70), irrespective of emotion type and associated with increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity compared with those with MDD and healthy control participants (P =. 008). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> <b>state,</b> patients with MDD and BD differed with regard to happy vs sad emotion regulation (t = 4. 19; P <. 001; Cohen d = 1. 66) associated with differences in rostral anterior cingulate activity (P <. 001). Patients with MDD regulated sad and happy emotions poorly compared with those with BD and healthy control participants, while they demonstrated no rostral anterior cingulate difference between happy and sad emotion regulation. In contrast, patients with BD performed worse than those with MDD on sad emotion regulation but normal on happy emotion regulation, and they demonstrated significantly less rostral anterior cingulate activity while regulating happy compared with sad emotions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Medication-free patients with MDD vs BD appear to differ in brain activations during emotion regulation, both while depressed and in remission. These different neuropathophysiological mechanisms between MDD and BD may be useful for further development of additional diagnostic tool...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of tryptophan- 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO) (EC 1. 13. 1. 12) and, {{to a lesser}} extent, pineal indoleamines, both in vitro and in vivo, is examined in this study. Rat liver TDO is a cytosolic enzyme which {{plays a crucial role}} in the {{regulation of}} circulating tryptophan (TRP) levels. Stimulation of this enzyme by heme enhances the catabolism of TRP, making less TRP available for uptake into the brain and other tissues, and for protein synthesis. At pH 7, the enzyme has an approximate Km of 100 μM, is subject to substrate inhibition immediately beyond Sopt([S] at Vmax), and response of the enzyme is cooperative in both uninhibited and inhibited regions. Hill analysis of the uninhibited region reveals a biphasic plot and two classes of binding sites. Negative cooperativity is brought about through deprotonation of the enzyme. Substrate iphibition also occurs at both acidic and basic pH values with concomitant shifts in Sopt. The results obtained indicate that substrate inhibition could be an additional mechanism whereby the flux through the TRP-kynurenine pathway is regulated. TDO is subject to a diurnal rhythm, with peak activity during the pre-dark period and the loweSt activity towards the end of the dark period. It is possible that the enzyme controls the synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5 -HT), and that the circadian rhythm in TDO activity is due to the endogenous rhythm of melatonin (aMT) production by the pineal gland. In the present study, aMT displaces TRP from bovine serum albumin (BSA) in vitro, and it is therefore possible for the indoleamine to regulate the availability of TRP for uptake into the brain for conversion to its derivatives. Chronic intraperitoneal administration of aMT affects physiological hepatic parameters in rats, such as TDO activity and stromal fatty acid composition, whilst no observable effect is demonstrable with respect to protein synthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, membrane fatty acid composition and pineal indole biosynthesis. On the other hand, chronic treatment of rats with antidepressants, the tricyclic desmethylimipramine (DMI) and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), fluoxetine, reveals significant negative alterations in TDO concentrations and pineal indole amine synthesis. Combining aMT with any of these two drugs normalises the activity of the hepatic enzyme. DMI is found to be an effective inhibitor of TDO in the micromolar range in vitro, and also affects total enzyme concentrations in vivo. Fluoxetine has no effect on TDO in vitro, but in vivo also reduces total enzyme levels in the liver. However, the SSRI does not affect conjugation between apo- and holoenzyme. Instead, it decreases extant holoenzyme levels. Indoleamine synthesis by the pineal gland, in organ culture, is altered by both antidepressants, although in different ways. DMI increases N-acetylserotonin levels and reduces the output of methoxyindole acetic acid and meth 6 xytryptophol. Fluoxetine treatment markedly reduces aMT concentrations and also brings about high levels of the 5 -HT catabolites, 5 -hydroxytryptophol and 5 -hydroxyindole acetic acid. Insulin also lowers aMT synthesis significantly in pineal organ cultures, via a mechamsm that involves inhibition of the enzyme, N-acetyl transferase, that regulates aMT synthesis. The effects of insulin on pineal indole metabolism are due to the observation that a carbohydrate rich diet which induces insulin release elevates plasma TRP and brain 5 -HT, but has no effect on pineal TRP and indole amine synthesis. It could thus be possible for insulin to have an effect on the pineal, since the latter is outside the blood brain barrier. The finilings of this study support the biogenic amine deficiency hypothesis, implicating some of the major biogenic amines such as noradrenaline (NA), 5 -HT and aMT in depression. There is believed to be a deficiency of NA and 5 -HT at their respective synapses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> <b>state.</b> The drug DMI could act, firstly, by inhibiting TDO and thus increasing plasma TRP levels, and could, secondly, stimulate NA release and inhibit NA reuptake at the pineal membrane. The combined effect would be to enhance aMT synthesis, with eventual remission. Fluoxetine, on the other hand, appears to utilize a slightly different mode of action to DMI, which seems to focus on the preservation of 5 -HT. The fact that aMT counteracts the effects of both antidepressants, and restores the activity of TDO to that of the controls, is also consistent with the observation that the therapeutic action of drugs such as these coincides willi the restoration of normal plasma levels of the neurohormone in depressives. In view of the biogenic amine deficiency hypothesis of depression and the contentious claim that TDO is the major peripheral determinant of brain TRP, brain 5 -HT and ultimately aMT, the regulation of TDO is investigated and discussed. The study concludes that TDO activity is regulated by a number of endogenous compounds which are mainly derivatives of TRP, such as aMT and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and exogenous substances, of which DMI and fluoxetine are but two. In addition, modulation of IDO activity in depression appears to be an important aspect of antidepressant action. aMT, the product of the pineal gland, also has the potential to increase plasma TRP and hence forebrain TRP levels, and ultimately 5 -HT concentrations, firstly by displacing TRP from serum albumin and secondly by inhibiting TDO. ...|$|E

From <b>the</b> analysis of various nonverbal behaviours {{it can be concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> <b>state</b> is indicated by nonverbal elements in a logical "or-" rather than "and-connection" or in a hierarchical way. It is maintained that the relationship of psychological relevant states (mood) and nonverbal behaviour needs to be studied by intra-individual comparisons to reveal the specifically close relationships effective in everyday communication. With regard to the pragmatic aspect of communication, elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonverbal signalling system seem to possess different levels of generality. However, from decoding studies it can be shown that even very subtle behavioural differences can be detected by an observer. Thus specific signals can become effective in interaction given a familiarity with the idiosyncratic usage...|$|R

500|$|Kolkata is {{the main}} {{commercial}} and financial hub of East and North-East India and home to the Calcutta Stock Exchange. It is a major commercial and military port, and is <b>the</b> only city <b>in</b> eastern India to have an international airport. Once India's leading city, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decades following India's independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade-unionism, which included frequent strikes that were backed by left-wing parties. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, several factories were closed and businesses relocated. The lack of capital and resources added to <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> city's economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet: the [...] "dying city". The city's fortunes improved after the Indian economy was liberalised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s and changes in economic policy were enacted by the West Bengal state government.|$|R
40|$|The {{baseline}} EEG sleep {{patterns of}} 10 young depressed patients, 20 patients with anorexia nervosa, 10 patients with bulimia nervosa, and 10 healthy subjects {{were found to}} be indistinguishable, except for an increased REM density <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> patients. <b>In</b> eating disorder patients, a concomitant major depressive episode had no influence on EEG sleep. The results of the cholinergic REM sleep induction test revealed a significantly faster induction of REM sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> patients when compared with the eating disorder patients and the control subjects. This indicates a subthreshold hypersensitivity of the REM sleep triggering cholinergic transmitter system in depressives, but not in eating disorder patients...|$|R

However, the damage of the cyclone and <b>the</b> generally <b>depressed</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> Northern Territory economy left Kwong in a poor financial situation. <b>In</b> 1902 <b>the</b> family set up a store and business in Cairns, Queensland where he sold mostly Chinese goods. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the store}} he had an office where he dispensed Chinese herbal remedies.|$|R
40|$|The excitability {{of short}} {{segments}} (5 – 7 mm) of bundles of canine Purkinje fibers was depressed {{by exposure to}} 15 – 18 mM K+, to 15 – 18 mM K+ plus 5 x 10 - 6 epinephrine or norepinephrine, to low K+, and to low Na+. <b>The</b> <b>depressed</b> segment was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center chamber of a three-chamber bath; {{the ends of the}} bundle were exposed to normal Tyrode solution. Each method of depression resulted in slow and probably decremental conduction with an effective conduction velocity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle chamber of about 0. 05 m/sec, or one-way block, or two-way block with summation of <b>the</b> graded responses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> region. <b>The</b> action potential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> segment (<b>the</b> slow response) differs from the normal action potential in its response to applied stimuli. A second active depolarization can be evoked by cathodal stimulation during much of the slow response. <b>The</b> response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressed</b> segment is graded. <b>The</b> response of <b>depressed</b> fibers may depend on excitatory events similar to those responsible for the slow component of the cardiac action potential. It is suggested that the slow response can propagate, at least decrementally, in fibers <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> rapid, Na+-dependent upstroke is absent, and can cause reentrant excitation by so doing...|$|R
