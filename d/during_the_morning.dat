5|$|Lee's plan, however, {{was based}} on faulty intelligence, {{exacerbated}} by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.|$|E
5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was {{disappointed}} in the lack of tactical flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British {{should have known better}} than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage.

50|$|With {{the help}} of CARE, a food program was started. The first grade teacher noticed a great {{difference}} in his 6-8 year olds. Before, many children in the area only ate once a day (in the afternoon or evening), and were tired <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>mornings.</b> <b>The</b> poorer families with many children and little income even skipped a day or two. In this situation, the lunch provided by the school helped increase the students' receptivity.|$|R

Shortly thereafter, MFR stopped monitoring the system. After re-curving just east of Madagascar, Helisanonina dissipated according to the JTWC on April 18. While the storm was weakening, it passed close to Rodrigues without causing any known impact.|$|E
