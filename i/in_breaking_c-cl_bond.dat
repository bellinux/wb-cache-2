40|$|International audienceBIOCHLOR is a {{well-known}} simple tool for evaluating the transport of dissolved chlorinated solvents in ground-water, ideal for rapid screening and teaching. This work extends the BIOCHLOR model for the calculation of stable isotope ratios of carbon and chlorine isotopes in chioroethenes. An exact solution for the three-dimensional reactive transport of a chain of degrading compounds including sorption is provided in a spreadsheet and applied for modeling the transport of individual isotopes C- 12,C- 13, Cl- 35, Cl- 37 from a constant source. The model can consider secondary isotope effects that can occur <b>in</b> the <b>breaking</b> of <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bonds.</b> The model is correctly reproducing results for delta C- 13 and delta Cl- 37 modeled by a previously published 1 -D numerical model without secondary isotope effects, and is also reproducing results from a microcosm experiment with secondary chlorine isotope effects. Two applications of the model using field data from literature are further given and discussed. The new BIOCHLOR-ISO model is distributed as a spreadsheet (MS EXCEL) along with this publication.

40|$|The role of {{chlorine}} as a substituent upon ionization, protonation and electrophilic addition of HCl {{has been studied}} by means of computational chemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy. Gas-phase carbon 1 s photoelectron spectra of four chlorinated methanes (CClnH 4 −n, n= 1, 2, 3, 4), six chlorinated ethenes (C 2 ClnH 6 −n) and seven chlorinated propenes are recorded. The spectra are analyzed by means of theoretical modeling and ionization energies for each inequivalent carbon are extracted. Furthermore, ground-state potentials for each site are computed and thereby the ionization energies can be decomposed into contributions from the ground state and relaxation, e. g. delocalization of charge in the final state. It is found that chlorine primarily acts by making the ground-state potential of the neighboring carbon more positive. However, upon ionization, chlorine also donates {{a significant amount of}} electrons both to a neighboring carbon and to a second-nearest π-bonded neighbor. Activation energies for the electrophilic addition of HCl to the chlorinated ethenes and propenes are computed and probably we overestimate the energies by about 10 % compared to experimental results. Protonation enthalpies are predicted with uncertainties of 0. 09 eV or less. We find that chlorine upon protonation act as an effective electron donor via the π-system if in a neighboring position to the protonated carbon and that the effective donation is much larger for protonation than for ionization and electrophilic addition. The explanation is that the protonated site has an enhanced ability to accept electrons compared to if the same site is ionized or is subject to an electrophilic addition. At room temperature, both 3 -chloropropene and 2, 3 -dichloropropene possess two stable rotational conformers. As a part of the theoretical modeling of a spectrum, we predict a theoretical vibrational lineshape for each chemical inequivalent site in the molecule. As the theoretical lineshapes for each of these rotamers are qualitatively different, the relative intensities of the vibrational lineshapes could be optimized and thereby relative populations could be determined. Adsorption of 1, 1 -dichloroethene (Cl 2 C=CH 2) to a Si(111) - 7 × 7 surface is studied by means of XPS. It is found that 1 / 3 of the molecules <b>break</b> one <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bond</b> and 2 / 3 <b>break</b> both <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bonds</b> when chemisorbing to the surface. Physisorption spectra were compared to gas-phase spectra of the same compound, and it is found that except for broadening caused by the polarizable surface, the gas-phase spectrum constitutes an excellent model for the spectrum of the physisorbed species. We recommend that gas-phase spectra are used on a routine basis when assigning spectra of physisorbed species. Comparing to experiments, we find that we are able to compute theoretical ionization energies within chemical accuracy, e. g. within 0. 04 eV. However, our computed <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bond</b> lengths have deviations in the range of 0. 6 pm whereas the desired accuracy is ± 0. 1 pm. The inaccuracy is related to a very slow basis set convergence for chlorine, making it a demanding substituent to model. </p...|$|R

Almost all total available energy was transferred into the internal modes of the parent CF 2 Cl radical on the product state, while the relative translational energy of Cl− was significantly low due to the elongation of two <b>C–Cl</b> <b>bonds.</b> In the case of a halocarbon-water cluster system, the geometry optimization of neutral complex CF 2 Cl 2 (H 2 O) 3 showed that one of the Cl atoms interacts with n orbital of water molecules of trimer and the other Cl atom existed as a dangling Cl atom.

Earlier studies used methyl chloroformate as a photolytic precursor for the CH 3 OCO, methoxy carbonyl (or methoxy formyl) radical, which is an intermediate in many reactions {{that are relevant to}} combustion and atmospheric chemistry. That work evidenced two competing <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bond</b> fission channels, tentatively assigning them as producing ground-and excited-state methoxy carbonyl radicals. In this study, we measure the photofragment angular distributions for each <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bond</b> fission channel and the spin-orbit state of the Cl atoms produced. The data shows bond fission leading to the production of ground-state methoxy carbonyl radicals with a high kinetic energy release and an angular distribution characterized by an anisotropy parameter, â, of between 0. 37 and 0. 64. The bond fission that leads to the production of excited-state radicals, with a low kinetic energy release, has an angular distribution best described by a negative anisotropy parameter. The very different angular distributions suggest that two different excited states of methyl chloroformate lead to the formation of ground- and excited-state methoxy carbonyl products. Moreover, with these measurements we were able to refine the product branching fractions to 82 % of the <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bond</b> fission resulting in ground-state radicals and 18 % resulting in excited-state radicals.

This study presents a solid theoretical derivation to prove whether the isotopologue distributions of organochlorines are binomial or not, and investigates {{the implications of}} the distributions to relevant experimental studies. During synthetic reactions, the <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bonds</b> with stronger strengths are more readily to be formed with heavy isotopes. The chlorine KIEs are higher during the breakages of the stronger <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bonds</b> than during the breaking of the weaker ones. For a synthetic organochlorine, if the rate-limiting step during a chlorination reaction is the formation of <b>C-Cl</b> <b>bonds,</b> then chlorine KIE takes effect in the reaction, resulting in always higher chlorine isotope ratio on the reaction position than that of the initial chlorine atoms from the chlorine source. Chlorine KIEs vary during different chlorination reactions, leading to inconsistent chlorine isotope ratios on different reaction positions of asymmetric reaction intermediates and final products. If the rate-determining step is the generation of reactive chlorine atoms and the initial isotope ratio of the chlorine source is constant, then the chlorine isotope ratios on the reaction positions of all intermediates and final products are equivalent, demonstrating that the isotopologues follow binomial distribution. After physical changes and dechlorination reactions, organochlorines in the environment are unlikely binomially distributed. Experimental data show that the detected isotopologues of all the investigated organochlorines disobeyed binomial distribution. This study may bring a new perspective about the chlorine isotopologue distributions of organochlorines, and the proposed solutions may help to obtain better data for quantification and CSIA-Cl of organochlorines.
