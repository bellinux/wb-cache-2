In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the <b>export</b> <b>quota</b> was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E

The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E

25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals for components has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced <b>export</b> <b>quota</b> on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E

We assume N (identical) large countries non-cooperatively set their import (or <b>export)</b> <b>quotas</b> to maximize domestic welfare. We show that the equilibrium in which all countries use import quotas differs from, and is superior to, the equilibrium in which countries use <b>export</b> <b>quotas.</b> The difference arises because the elasticity of the residual foreign import demand schedule differs between the two equilibria...|$|R

The 1969 crop was heavily damaged by a hurricane, {{and to meet}} its <b>export</b> <b>quota,</b> the government drafted in the army, implemented a seven-day working week, and postponed public holidays to lengthen the harvest.

2500|$|A 2011 report [...] "China's Rare-Earth Industry", {{issued by}} the US Geological Survey and US Department of the Interior, {{outlines}} industry trends within China and examines national policies that may guide {{the future of the}} country's production. The report notes that China's lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons; China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: [...] "Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the <b>export</b> <b>quota</b> during the past several years." [...] In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually; by 2011, only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers were authorized. The government's future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: [...] "According to China's draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [...] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The <b>export</b> <b>quota</b> for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [...] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{concerns}} have intensified {{due to the}} actions of China, the predominant supplier. [...] Specifically, China has announced regulations on exports and a crackdown on smuggling. On September 1, 2009, China announced plans to reduce its <b>export</b> <b>quota</b> to 35,000 tons per year in 2010â€“2015 to conserve scarce resources and protect the environment. On October 19, 2010, China Daily, citing an unnamed Ministry of Commerce official, reported that China will [...] "further reduce quotas for rareearth exports by 30 percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over-exploitation". The government in Beijing further increased its control by forcing smaller, independent miners to merge into state-owned corporations or face closure. At the end of 2010, China announced that {{the first round of}} export quotas in 2011 for rare earths would be 14,446 tons, which was a 35% decrease from the previous first round of quotas in 2010. China announced further export quotas on 14 July 2011 for {{the second half of the}} year with total allocation at 30,184 tons with total production capped at 93,800 tonnes. In September 2011, China announced the halt in production of three of its eight major rare-earth mines, responsible for almost 40% of China's total rare-earth production. In March 2012, the US, EU, and Japan confronted China at WTO about these export and production restrictions. China responded with claims that the restrictions had environmental protection in mind. In August 2012, China announced a further 20% reduction in production. These restrictions have damaged industries in other countries and forced producers of rare-earth products to relocate their operations to China. The Chinese restrictions on supply failed in 2012, as prices dropped in response to the opening of other sources. The price of dysprosium oxide was 994USD/kg in 2011, but dropped to 265USD/kg by 2014.|$|E

Incomplete information the government has is about the unit-production cost of the domestic firm.

Uganda's <b>export</b> <b>quota</b> rose only by about 3,013 bags, however, bringing it to just over 2.3 million bags. Moreover, Uganda's entire quota increase was allocated to arabica coffee, which was grown primarily in the small southeastern region of Bugisu.
