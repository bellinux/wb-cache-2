Many separation methods have been used to separate out the neptunium, operating on small and large scales.

40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> was carried out. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> reviewed include: once-through <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> in LWRs, PHWRs, HTGRs, and fast gas cooled breed and burn reactors; single-pass recycle schemes: plutonium recycle in LWRs and direct-use of spent PWR fuel in CANDU reactors (DUPIC); multi-pass recycle schemes: transmutation of transuranics in LWRs, fast reactors, double strata systems, and molten salt reactors. Mass flow calculations for the <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> at equilibrium {{were carried out}} based on data available in the open literature, and results were {{used to compare the}} performance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> with respect to uranium utilization, waste management, proliferation resistance, and economics. Potential for mid-century deployment was assessed based on these results. Once-through <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> based on solid fuel thermal reactors are found to be the best candidates for mid-century deployment because the substantial increase in electricity costs entailed by reprocessing schemes is unlikely to be justified by the afforded reductions in long-term proliferation and waste management risks. Furthermore, once-through cycles present lower proliferation and waste management risks in the short-term and their inefficient use of uranium is not likely to become an important issue before the middle of the century even under a high growth scenario. by Etienne Parent.

5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cycle</b> and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{power is}} an {{important}} and, the authors believe, essential component of a secure nuclear future. Although nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> create materials that have some potential for use in nuclear weapons, with appropriate <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles,</b> nuclear power could reduce rather than increase real proliferation risk worldwide. Future <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> could be designed to avoid plutonium production, generate minimal amounts of plutonium in proliferation-resistant amounts or configurations, and/or transparently and efficiently consume plutonium already created. Furthermore, a strong and viable US nuclear infrastructure, of which nuclear power is a large element, is essential if the US is to maintain a leadership or even participatory role in defining the global nuclear infrastructure and controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. By focusing on new <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> and new reactor technologies, {{it is possible to}} advantageously burn and reduce nuclear materials {{that could be used for}} nuclear weapons rather than increase and/or dispose of these materials. Thus, the authors suggest that planners for a secure nuclear future use technology to design an ideal future. In this future, nuclear power creates large amounts of virtually atmospherically clean energy while significantly lowering the threat of proliferation through the thoughtful use, physical security, and agreed-upon transparency of nuclear materials. The authors must develop options for policy makers that bring them as close as practical to this ideal.

40|$|At current {{consumption}} and current prices, the proven reserves for natural uranium will last only about 100 years. However, the more abundant thorium, burned in breeder reactors, such as large High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors, {{and followed by}} chemical reprocessing of the spent fuel, could stretch the 100 years for uranium supply to 15, 000 years. Thorium-based <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> are also viewed as more proliferation resistant compared to uranium. However, several barriers to entry caused all countries, except India and Russia, to abandon their short term plans for thorium reactor projects, in favour of uranium/plutonium <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles.</b> In this article, based on the theory of resonance integrals and original analysis of fast fission cross sections, the breeding potential of 232 Th is {{compared to that of}} 238 U. From a review of the literature, the fuel economy of thorium-based <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> is compared to that of natural uranium-based cycles. This is combined with a technical assessment of the proliferation resistance of thorium-based <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles,</b> based on a review of the literature. Natural uranium is currently so cheap that it contributes only about 10 % of the cost of nuclear electricity. Chemical reprocessing is also very expensive. Therefore conservation of natural uranium by means of the introduction of thorium into the fuel is not yet cost effective and will only break even once the price of natural uranium were to increase from the current level of about $ 70 /pound yellow cake to above about $ 200 /pound. However, since fuel costs constitutes {{only a small fraction of}} the total cost of nuclear electricity, employing reprocessing in a thorium cycle, for the sake of its strategic benefits, may still be a financially viable option. The most important source of the proliferation resistance of 232 Th/ 233 U <b>fuel</b> <b>cycles</b> is denaturisation of the 233 U in the spent fuel by 232 U, for which the highly radioactive decay chain potentially poses a large radiation as well as a detection risk to would-be proliferators. However, countries with proliferation ambitions could give the U-mixture to terrorist groups directly after chemical separation, before significant build-up of the radioactive decay chain, which would significantly reduce the proliferation resistance of the mixture. A roadmap for overcoming some of these barriers to market entry is suggestedTHRIP; South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation[URL]...|$|R
