50|$|The Malutang Dam is a concrete-face rock-fill dam (CFRD) on the Panlong River in Malipo County, Yunnan Province, China. The {{primary purpose}} of the dam is {{hydroelectric}} power generation and the power plant was constructed in two stages. Stage I consists of a 40 m tall gravity dam which diverted water through a 3460 m long tunnel to a 100 MW above ground power station downstream. Construction on Stage I began in 2002 and the first of 50 MW Francis turbine-generators was commissioned in October 2004, the second in January 2005. Stage II was the construction of a 156 m tall CFRD (Malutang Dam) 200 m downstream of the <b>Stage</b> I <b>dam.</b> <b>Stage</b> II's power station contains three 100 MW Francis turbine generators. Construction on Stage II began in August 2005 and the reservoir began to fill in October 2009. In December 2009, the first 100 MW generator was operational and the last two by May 2010.

40|$|ABSTRACT: the Ord {{river is}} one of western Australia’s major river systems. In the 1960 s and 70 s two dams were {{constructed}} across the Ord. Together these dams allowed the development of stage 1 (∼ 13000 ha) of the Ord irrigation project (oip) centred on the town of Kununurra and the generation of power from a hydroelectric station, below the Ord river <b>dam.</b> <b>Stage</b> 2 (∼ 64000 ha) irrigation developments are now proposed and combined water demands (Stage 1 & 2) total ∼ 1200 GL/annum. Since the conceptualisation of the OIP, the ecological and social values of the river system have gained importance via legislation. The requirement for an environmental water provision will halve {{the amount of water}} for irrigation expansion. This paper explores the environmental values of water in the Ord, from a pre and post dam perspective and details an approach being undertaken to assess changes to ecosystem function in relation to altered flow...|$|R

40|$|A {{case study}} is {{presented}} in this paper which describes finite element analysis of staged construction of the upstream tailings dam Aitik, located in north of Sweden. The purpose of the study is to evaluate stability of the dam for current and future raisings and to strengthen the dam with optimum volume of rockfill banks on the downstream side when stability of the dam is not satisfactory during a construction stage. The finite element method was utilized to model the consolidation process and stability of the <b>dam</b> during the <b>staged</b> construction. The study has shown that stability of the dam during raisings was reduced due to build-up of excess pore pressures. Therefore, the dam was strengthened with rockfill banks on the downstream side to carry out the construction of the dam at a planned rate of raising. An optimization analysis was performed {{in order to reduce the}} volume of the rockfill necessary for stabilizing the dam. With the use of the finite element based optimization approach discussed in this paper, stability of the <b>dams</b> during <b>staged</b> construction can be enhanced by utilizing a minimum volume of rockfill banks.

40|$|Mt. Kroppefjall is {{situated}} {{just south of}} the Middle Swedish (Younger Dryas) ice-marginal zone. Its abundance of lake basins makes it very suitable for detailed shore displacement studies close to the Younger Dryas ice margin. Altogether 12 lakes at altitudes between 157 and 78 m were studied and all but one situated above the marine limit contained marine sediments. The dating of their isolation from the sea resulted in a shore displacement curve from c. 11, 200 to c. 98 M) BP. The relative uplift almost ceased between 10, 900 and 10, 300 BP, which is mainly related to an ice readvance in the Lake Vanern basin. This period of balance between uplift and sea level rise was preceded by a relative uplift rate of 5 m/lW yr and followed by as high rates as 7 - 8 m/ 100 yr, possibly caused by a delayed uplift effect and perhaps also a local fall in sea level caused by the rapidly receding ice margin. The time difference between the formation of two delta surfaces at Odskolts Moar is estimated at 60 & 800 years. Shoreline diagrams along the Swedish west and east coasts, mainly based on a number of shore displacement curves, reveal large anomalies that are believed to have been caused by dammings and drainages of the Baltic basin.

This tool will work {{in accordance with the}} conditions of the water level. When the water level go up, the door dam will open automatically dam the door will close when the water level drops. The method used in constructing the dam door prototype based automated ATmega 16 using the method of design that consists of several stages: (1) identification of requirements, (2) Needs Analysis, (3) design of hardware and software, (4) tool-making, (5) Testing Tool and (6) Operational Equipment. The hardware consists of (1) The minimum ATmega 16 as the main controller, (2) water level sensor (water level control) as the water level detector, (3) and infrared light sensor photodiode as a detector height of the dam doors, (4) DC motors as driver door dam and (4) LCD as the viewer height and the height of the dam door.

The relationships of Bengoh Dam and Sarawak River stage are thoroughly analyzed and discussed based on four scenarios namely a) before dam construction, b) after dam construction and reservoir fully filled with water, c) after dam construction but reservoir empty, and d) constant flow release after dam construction. Besides, each scenario will be further analyzed with the operation of barrage gates at Sarawak River mouth, both in fully opened or closed modes. InfoWorks RS was employed to model Sarawak River using January 2000 hydrological data.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} seismic {{behaviour}} {{of an existing}} homogeneous earth dam using a fully coupled finite element effective stress approach {{in conjunction with a}} recently developed multi-surface, elasto-plastic constitutive model for structured soils. The model is calibrated using laboratory test results for the embankment material and the foundation soils. The initial state variables (stress, hardening parameters) are determined by simulating a simplified geological history of the foundation soil, <b>dam</b> construction <b>stages</b> and reservoir impounding, prior to the application of the earthquake shaking at the bedrock level. The paper critically reviews the role of the constitutive model parameters, the hysteretic damping introduced by the model and the additional viscous damping parameters in the accumulation of permanent displacements and in the development and subsequent dissipation of excess pore water pressures due to the seismic loading. The analyses, carried out with reference to a set of earthquake records related to different return periods, show that the overall behaviour of the system in terms of displacements is characterised by a more enhanced deformation pattern of the downstream slope as compared with the upstream one. The large plastic strains accumulation induced throughout the shaking is followed by the development of excess pore water pressures inside the dam and the foundation deposit. Nonetheless, the results are indicative of a satisfactory dynamic performance of the dam, even when subjected to severe seismic loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|Decision {{analytic}} modelling (DAM) is {{a mathematical}} technique {{which is used}} to structure and synthesise evidence in order to inform decision making, given uncertainty. Decision models are an ideal tool for undertaking economic evaluations as they enable a wide range of data on costs and effects to be synthesised within the model in order to derive cost-effectiveness outcomes. The iterative framework for economic appraisal has been proposed as good practice for undertaking economic evaluations (1), and DAM plays a key role within this framework. In particular there is a role for early <b>stage</b> <b>DAM</b> prior to primary research, to provide an indication of the potential cost-effectiveness of a new health technology (2) given current evidence, and the use of value of information (VOI) techniques to help inform further research priority setting. In practice, support and funding for early <b>stage</b> <b>DAM</b> and full exploitation of VOI techniques is rare. The aim of this thesis is to examine the role for early decision analytic modelling in informing research priorities and the design of future studies in a health care setting. This thesis explores the feasibility, merits and drawbacks of undertaking early DAM and considers potential reasons as to why it has not been more widely implemented. This thesis demonstrates the value and importance of early DAM; in both an ‘ideal’ setting and also in a less desirable, time-constrained setting. Applying early DAM and VOI techniques enables researchers to provide relevant conclusions and recommendations to decision makers, who can make informed decisions as to whether a new intervention should be adopted (or rejected), or whether further information is required to help make the decision; as opposed to making decisions based on subjective reasoning. There is considerable merit with employing early DAM for health care research, such as reduced uncertainty, reduction of costs and efficiency gains, however, some drawbacks exist in terms of whether it is always viable to fully exploit VOI analyses, which may hinder widespread support both inside and out-with the health economics community...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Rainfall {{scarcity}} and variability present serious {{challenges to}} water security for many rural communities throughout the world's drylands. Sand dams [...] weirs built across ephemeral or seasonal rivers [...] provide an appropriate water harvesting and storage option for many regions. The structures quickly fill with sediment during rainy season flow events and store water underground in interstitial pores, thereby limiting evaporation, contamination and {{the prevalence of}} disease-carrying vectors. The size of deposited sediment particles largely determines sand dam effectiveness; fine materials do not transmit or yield usable quantities of water under a dam's modest head conditions. Many researchers and practitioners propose building sand <b>dams</b> in <b>stages</b> to limit capture of fine particles. I apply field and remotely-sensed data and statistical analysis to evaluate hypotheses about the catchment and reach-scale conditions required to optimize sediment deposition. I also use the results of unsteady HEC-RAS flow models to quantify the sensitivity of sedimentation processes to spillway height. The results of the statistical analyses show a negative correlation between mean catchment slope and median particle size collected by sand dams. Modeled results indicate that sedimentation is relatively more sensitive to variations in spillway height than {{to changes in the}} hydrograph, especially when a dam is short. However, sensitivities to a given modeled parameter vary by site. Based on the results, I recommend that the need for spillway staging be evaluated on a site-by-site basis, accounting for costs and expected benefits, and that designs incorporate progressively taller stages...|$|R

Dam removal started on June 1, 2011, and was completed on August 26, 2014. We hypothesized that, as portions of the Glines Canyon dam were removed, the woody debris and sediment from behind the dam would create logjams, fill in existing bars, and decrease the average sediment size in the channel downstream. Our research was conducted two to six kilometers downstream from the dam site. Sediment sizes were surveyed bimonthly and/or following large flood events at four sites during the study period. Surface sediment size was recorded every meter along a cross section for a minimum of 100 m.
