50|$|In April 1996, the SOG {{responded to}} the Port Arthur shootings by Martin Bryant {{reported}} to have killed over 30 people and possessed a 5.56mm AR-15 assault rifle and a 7.62mm FN FAL assault rifle together with large quantities of ammunition. Bryant was intellectually disabled and mentally ill. On a Sunday morning, Bryant travelled to the Seascape tourist accommodation facility and killed the couple who owned the bed and breakfast. Shortly afterwards he drove a short distance to Port Arthur, a popular tourist attraction, and started shooting people at around 1330 hours. Uniform police quite a distance away were dispatched. He killed 31 people and injured 19 changing between rifles. He left Port Arthur at about 1345 hours carjacking a BMW and ambushed a car taking a male hostage before returning to Seascape at about 2pm. The male hostage was secured in the house before he set the BMW on fire. Two uniform police arrive witnessing the BMW alight and were fired upon taking cover in a culvert. At about 1530 hours negotiators made contact with Bryant. At 1537 hours, an SOG contingent departed Hobart, 85km away, by helicopter together with a contingent by car at 404pm. At about 2100 hours two SOG officers joined the uniform officers in the culvert and at about 2300 hours crawled out about 200m to safety. Continuous fire came from various directions from Seascape using differing weapons augmented by weapons the owners possessed including a 7.62mm SKS assault rifle. A sniper made it as close as 75m from Seascape. The operator's radio light was not concealed and ever transmit Bryant saw the red light and fired upon the operator. Bryant advised the negotiator that he saw police. The SOG thought he may possess night vision {{not aware of the}} radio light. The SOG believed that in addition to the confirmed hostage that the owner couple were still alive and were hostages. The SOG formed a perimeter under constant fire. No fire was returned by the SOG due to risk to hostages. Twelve officers from the Victoria Police Special Operations Group arrived by a chartered plant at 2300 hours to provide assistance. An <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> was prepared to rescue the three hostages with an estimated in excess of 30% casualty rate for the operators. No movement by a hostage had been witnessed. A decision was made to wait it out. Between 0400 and 0600 hours there was a lull in the firing. At about 0745 hours a fire started with Bryant at about 0825 hours running out on fire and unarmed. Nearly 200 rounds had been fired from Seascape. 35 people had been killed and 23 wounded.|$|E

40|$|At the {{extraordinary}} EU Council of 21 July European leaders have {{to accomplish a}} triple-mission. First, they should {{pave the way to}} restoring solvency in Greece by initiating debt reduction. Softening the Greek debt burden implies i) reducing the interest rate on official lending, ii) requesting from the EFSF support for an immediate bond buy-back programme, and iii) asking the ESRB for an immediate evaluation of the risks to financial stability involved in a future restructuring of the sovereign debts in the euro area. Second, they should promote immediate growth-enhancing measures to be financed through unused EU structural funds and EIB loans (€ 16 bn). The available funds shall be used to i) raise the quality of higher education, ii) finance wage subsidies in manufacturing and tourism so as to generate an internal devaluation at contained domestic-demand costs; and ii) create research laboratories (i. e. lighthouse innovation projects) that would support an upgrading of the Greek value chain. Third, they should address risks to financial stability in the euro zone by breaking the vicious circle between sovereign debt and banking risk. The EFSF should be able to guarantee national deposit insurance schemes; at the same time, the European Banking Authority should assume stronger supervisory powers.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that wine is highly {{sensitive}} to storage conditions such as temperature and humidity, it is a challenging task for a regional distribution hub to provide reliable wine storage facilities for maintaining wine quality during storage. This is especially true when an incident occurs unexpectedly that violates the criteria of suitable storage conditions. Improper incident handling and storage conditions may cause damage to the taste of wine, resulting in depreciation of the wine's value. Therefore, controlling and monitoring risk in real-time during wine storage is critical to providing a quick response to prevent the wine quality from deterioration. In this paper, a RFID-based risk control and monitoring system (RCMS), which integrates radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and case-based reasoning (CBR), is proposed for monitoring real-time physical storage conditions and for formulating an <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> for handling incidents. In the retrieval process of the CBR engine, genetic algorithms (GA) are applied to search for case clusters by considering the best combination of multi-dimensional parameters. With the help of RCMS, a shortlist of critical control actions, possible causes of incidents and corresponding actions can be generated {{to reduce the risk of}} deteriorating wine quality and possible compensation costs being incurred, while customer satisfaction can be maintained.

According to the list of priorities that has been set by Ministry of Environment and WB in 1997 an <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> should be carried out to address the water pollution issues in Barada Basin. Huge amounts of wastewater (domestic, industrial, and agricultural) are discharged every day to the land, Barada and Awaj Rivers without sufficient treatment. In order to address the problem a feasible integrated solution should be set to recover the deterioration of environment that has already happened and prevent any further contamination. Taking in consideration the effects on the economic growth, attempts should be made to find an optimal policy reflecting a trade off between the economic growth and conservation of the environment in general and water resources in particular. In this paper, the water pollution problem in Barada Basin has been analyzed. Simulations of a mathematical model have been run in order to find an optimal feasible policy improving the environmental status in Barada Basin. This model includes an ecological model that describes the behavior of the pollutants and an economic model that describes the market instruments.

Under the intense pressure from the United States, the ruling party of Taiwan rammed through the legislature the first law governing the island 2 ̆ 7 s booming cable-television industry on July 16, 1993. The authority of the USTR to target trading partners of the United States for their unsatisfactory protection of United States intellectual property rights comes from the Special 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Special 301 provision is designed to use the threat of unilateral retaliation by the United States to pressure its trade partners to reform their currently deficient intellectual property practices. The idea is the carrot and the stick, where the carrot is the right to export to the United States as a most favored nation, and the stick is the trade sanction. This paper will trace and analyze the interaction between the United States and Taiwan in the process of resolving disputes on intellectual property protection, and will discuss the implications of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s experience, which can be useful for understanding conflicts over intellectual property protection in other countries...|$|E

In the total disabled {{population of the}} state, the proportion of in-seeing disabled persons is ranked first. In rural areas, proportion of in-seeing disabled population is near about {{two times more than}} the urban areas. The proportion of in-seeing disabled males is also significantly higher than that of the females. Highest proportion and intensity of in-seeing disabled population is observed in Nandurbar and Nanded districts. Nandurbar is a tribal district located in Satpura mountainous region. Poor economic condition, mountainous region, imbalance diet to pregnant women and children are important causes of high proportion of in-seeing disabled population, while, Nanded is located in south eastern part of Maharashtra, in rain-shadow zone.

40|$|In 2015, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention {{reported}} that the most common, costly but preventable health problems are heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and arthritis. Literature shows preventable chronic diseases have increased in the current healthcare system. Healthcare leaders are calling {{for a change in}} the current faulty healthcare delivery system to personalized healthcare. A patient-centered approach focuses on the health gains that can be made in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease with a higher level of patient engagement. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is advocating patient-centered care (PCC) to focus on the health gains that could be made in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease with a higher level of patient engagement. To aid in empowering veterans to take ownership of their healthcare the VHA has endorsed use of Personalized Health Plans (PHP). VHA directed primary care healthcare professionals to use a patient-centered approach to encourage veterans to make a holistic self-evaluation then create personalized goals or PHP, focusing on their whole being, not just their medical illnesses to improve health and wellbeing. However, patient-centered care with documentation of PHPs across the VHA has met some resistance. In fiscal year 2014, October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2014, a midwestern VHA primary care administration, reported their clinics only initiated 66 PHPs from 32 patient aligned care teams (PACTs) that each saw approximately 270 veterans a day. The administration required an <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> to promote patient-centered care and increase the number of PHPs. To intervene in this dilemma, Lewin’s Change Theory and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Model for Improvement, known for accelerating process improvement, were used as the framework for this process improvement project to evaluate if the utilization of a change agent would facilitate implementation of PHP. The change agent used multiple strategies of guidance, facilitation, and inspiration in three successive one-month Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to promote PHP among 29 patient aligned care teams (PACTs). The use of a change agent did promote the implementation of PHP. After the change agent became involved the total number of PHPs increased across these midwestern primary care clinics. However, the increase in PHPs per PACT was not as high as desired. The aim was for PACTs to initiate 3 PHPs a week or 12 PHPs a PDSA Cycle. Over the three-month intervention, the aim of 12 PHPs initiated per PACT a month occurred just ten times, only 39 % of the aim was met. Several factors could have restrained PACTs from rapidly increasing their numbers of PHPs, including time restraints and electronic health record limitations. Recommendations to facilitate PHP implementation are to decrease barriers and increase facilitators to this change in practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{coast of}} Bohai Bay, {{north-western}} Yellow Sea, {{is critical for}} waterbirds migrating along the East Asia-Australasian Flyway. Between 1994 and 2010, a total of 450 km 2 of offshore area, including 218 km 2 of intertidal flats (one third of the original tidal area in the bay), has been reclaimed along the bay for two industrial projects. This has caused the northward migrants to become concentrated in an ever smaller remaining area, our core study site. The spring peak numbers of two Red Knot subspecies in the East Asia-Australasian Flyway, Calidris canutus piersmai and C. c. rogersi, in this so far little affected area increased from 13 % in 2007 to 62 % in 2010 of the global populations; the spring peak numbers of Curlew Sandpiper C. ferruginea increased from 3 % in 2007 to 23 % in 2010 of the flyway population. The decline in the extent of intertidal mudflats also affected Relict Gulls Larus relictus, listed by IUCN as ‘Vulnerable’; during normal winters 56 % of the global population moved from the wintering habitats that were removed in Tianjin to the relatively intact areas around Tangshan. Densities of wintering Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, and spring-staging Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus and Sanderling Calidris alba have also increased in the remaining areas.

40|$|Population {{modeling}} is {{now widely}} used in threatened species management and for predicting the impacts and benefits of competing management options. However, some argue {{that the results of}} models must be used with caution, particularly when data are limited. This is important, as even the simplest models would generally require more data (and knowledge) than are available in order to have complete confidence in model predictions. In particular, population models often suffer from a lack of data on demographic rates, spatial distribution, dispersal, management responses, habitat correlations and the magnitude of temporal variations. A number of authors identify behavioral and physiological responses of animals to anthropogenic noise. Assessing population level impacts of noise on cetacean populations is essential to understanding how noise impacts on the future viability of marine mammal populations. This assessment will be particularly challenging due to the difficulties associated with identifying a clear link between behavioral responses of animals and physiological impacts, observing and measuring changes in cetacean population parameters and the long lag-times over which population changes manifest in long-lived species. The urgency of the conservation situation for many of these socially important species demands <b>immediate</b> <b>action,</b> despite pervasive uncertainty. Adaptive management provides a coherent framework for action and continuous improvement under uncertainty. I review the elements of adaptive management and discuss the role of population modeling in that context. I discuss Bayesian approaches to enhancing inferential power and reducing uncertainty in model parameter estimation. I then review approaches to characterizing irreducible uncertainty with Monte Carlo methods and sensitivity analysis and conclude with a brief discussion of formal decision tools available to assist with decision making under severe uncertainty. I propose that urgently needed action should not be postponed due to uncertainty and that adaptive management provides a coherent framework for instituting <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> with a <b>plan</b> for learning...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{many studies}} focus on climate skeptics {{to explain the}} lack of support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> on climate change, this {{research}} examines the effect of moderate believers in climate science. Using data from a representative survey of 832 Indiana residents, we find that agreement with basic scientific conclusions about climate change is the strongest predictor of support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action,</b> and the strength of that agreement is an important characteristic of this association. Responses indicate widespread acceptance of climate change, moderate levels of risk perception, and limited support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action.</b> Half of the respondents (50 %) preferred “more research” over “immediate action” (38 %) and “no action” (12 %) as a response to climate change.
