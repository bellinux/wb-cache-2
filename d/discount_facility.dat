40|$|ABSTRACT- Goals: Increasing {{competition}} and growing risks are major challenges. In a fiercely competitive industry, credit card issuers {{need to develop}} a loyal customer base and motivate their card holders to use their cards at a sufficient level to assure profitability. Objectives: The objectives {{of this article is to}} know the weightage given by the customer to the different attributes of the credit cards and to design a consumer model of credit card to retain customer loyalty. Results: It is a convenience sample of several cities and metros which shares almost major characteristics of Indian consumers. This study has identified four schemes like Medi-claim facility (M, Assigned Value- 1), Insurance facility (I, Assigned Value- 2), <b>Discounts</b> <b>facility</b> for purchases (D, Assigned Value- 3) and Wide Acceptance in different sectors (W, Assigned Value- 4) as independent variables that provides stability and sustainability to the firm-customer relationship. The loyalty model of customer has developed through the conjoint analysis by taking the utilities of different service factors associated with the credit cards. The highest service factor score was 25. 891 and 20. 274 at the different timings of (2002 - 05) and (2006 - 09) respectively. Conclusions: In order to develop sustainable relationships, marketers of credit cards should leverage involvement in their customers by employing strategies such as branding, positioning, and attractive and flexible service benefits to retain the customer loyalty. Further, credit card customers have an affinity towards high service quality with an affordable cost, therefore making value a prime consideration for achieving loyalty...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{empirical}} {{evidence for the}} existence, magnitude, and economic impact of stigma associated with banks borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s <b>discount</b> window <b>facility.</b> We find that, {{during the height of}} the financial crisis, banks were willing to pay an average premium of at least 37 basis points (and 150 basis points after Lehman’s bankruptcy) to borrow from the Term Auction Facility rather than from the discount window. The incidence of stigma varied according to bank characteristics and market conditions. Finally, we find that discount window stigma is economically relevant since it increased banks’ borrowing costs during the crisis. Our results have important implications for the provision of liquidity by central banks. Discount window; Financial crises; Monetary policy; Bank liquidity; Banks and banking - Costs; Auctions...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of the New Consensus in monetary policy has been followed by a renewal of interest in central banks’ operating procedures, and specifically {{in the role of}} open market operations. There is a general view that overnight interest rates are most effectively controlled by standing or <b>discount</b> window <b>facilities,</b> rather than open market operations, and this view will probably now extend also to lender-of-last-resort intervention. The paper argues that this reduced role for open market operations is only in the context of controlling overnight rates of interest. In spite of the emphasis on control of overnight interest rates, medium and long-term interest rates remain the crucial instruments in the monetary transmission mechanism. Longer-term interest rates are susceptible to influence by open market operations, and their importance grows with financial development. central banks; monetary policy; open market operations...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide detailed information on the whole range of benefits now available and to collect views and attitudes towards benefits from a broad spectrum of the workforce in order to provide valuable information to those responsible for reviewing and implementing personnel policies in the future. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions a) Company Questionnaire Responsibility for deciding benefits policy, details of available benefits (pensions, sick pay, death in service, medical insurance, personal insurance, assistance with housing/removal expenses, holidays, <b>discount</b> <b>facilities,</b> loan schemes, share incentives and profit sharing, bonus, training, cars and car allowances, subsidised meals, fees to professional association, company social facilities and clubs, day nurseries, flexibility of working hours). Reasons for provision of benefits, expected change in number and/or value of benefits, additional benefits provided since 1970, staff status, choice of benefits, change resulting from EEC membership, cost of benefits. b) Individual Questionnaires There were two types of questionnaire: i. Management Attitudes ii. Employees' attitudes Questions asked for i. and ii. : Present entitlement to benefits, most important benefits (reasons), benefits not received which respondent would most like to have (in order of priority), opinion on company's reasons for providing benefits, whether choice between benefits and cash desirable, whether differential benefits according to staff status desirable. Questions asked for i. only: Personal opinion of/satisfaction with benefits (reasons), importance of benefits when seeking a new job, source of information on benefits (satisfaction with), suggested improvements for benefit schemes. Questions asked for ii. only: Expected improvements in benefit provisions, opinion of trade union involvement in negotiations for more benefits (priorities), expectation of effect of EEC membership on benefits. Differences between UK and EEC benefits mentioned to respondent (i. e. longer annual holidays, higher state pensions, more public holidays) who was then asked to list differences in order of importance (reasons).

40|$|Formal art {{education}} equips students with skills to produce artworks. A formal {{art education}} {{may increase the}} opportunity for employment, however, art-related employment is very limited. Art graduates would be better equipped to market and manage art establishments or their own careers if art education were to be supplemented with basic business skills. Artists who wish to earn unsupplemented incomes from their art should undertake to acquire business acumen. This includes being presentable to the market place in attitude and appearance. It also includes aptitude in art, marketing and management. Role models and non-models {{of success and failure}} in business should also be observed. Art graduates should adopt applicable tried and tested business methods. Good marketing is a mix of business activities which identifies and creates consumer needs and wants. Marketing activities involve research, planning, packaging, pricing, promoting and distributing products and services to the public to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organisational objectives. Art products include artworks, frames, art books and art materials. Art-related services include the undertaking of commissions, consulting, teaching, free parking, convenient shopping hours, acceptance of mail or telephone orders, exhibitions, ease of contact, approval facilities, wrapping, delivery, installations (picture hanging), quotations, <b>discounts,</b> credit <b>facilities,</b> guarantees, trade-ins, adjustments and restorations. Good management is a mix of business activities which enables a venture {{to meet the challenges of}} supply and demand. There is a blueprint for management competence. The three dimensions of organisational competence are collaboration, commitment and creativity. Self-marketing and management is an expression of an artist's most creative being. It is that which can ensure and sustain recognition and income. Artists, like other competent organisations and entrepreneurs from the private sector, should operate with efficient manufacturing, marketing, management and finance departments. They are also equally important and therefore demand equal attention. Artistic skill together with business acumen should equip the artist to successfully compete in the market place. There are no short-cuts to becoming an artist but there are short-cuts to becoming a known and financially stable artist. Understanding marketing and management could mean the difference between waiting in poverty and frustration for a "lucky break" (which may only happen after an artists's death) and taking control. Success should be perpetuated through continuous effort. ...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 4 th Annual Asia Pacific Conference on Transportation and the Environment This paper {{describes}} the on-going Hydrogen Infrastructure Transition (HIT) modeling efforts with the Beijing case study. HIT uses dynamic programming to generate optimal decisions on when, where, at what sizes and by what technologies {{to build up}} a regional hydrogen infrastructure while minimizing the <b>discounted</b> value of <b>facility</b> cost, environmental disbenefit and travel time disbenefit. In the case study, we use the 380 -kilometer Beijing urban expressway network for spatial representation and 2010 ~ 2060 as the transition study period. We relied on Beijing Master Plan, demographic projection and traffic data in estimating spatial distribution and temporal growth of hydrogen demand. Gaseous fueling station, natural gas steam reforming onsite, water electrolysis onsite, water electrolysis central plant, coal gasification central plant (with and without carbon dioxide sequestration), tanker truck and pipeline are identified as the 8 potential technologies to be selected by the optimization algorithm. The dynamic optimization algorithm of the HIT model incorporates station citing and sizing, pipeline length and flowrate, station module expansion, onsite-to-refueling-only switch, sequestration upgrade, technology evolvement, and availability of by-product hydrogen. Based on the data assumption, we find that $ 2. 5 billion (in 2010 worth) is the minimum cost for Beijing to transition to an equilibrium hydrogen infrastructure of 2 coal gasification plants, 350 km pipeline and 100 refueling stations. The revenues can breakeven all the costs if hydrogen is charged to the consumers at $ 2. 15 /kgH 2 from 2010 to 2060 and $ 0. 95 /kgH 2 after 2060. UCD-ITS-RP- 05 - 38, Civil Engineering...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a project undertaken to develop ranking procedures to prioritise projects {{designed to improve}} {{the ability of the}} road network to safely carry cyclists. The project was completed for Main Roads Western Australia. The project involved reviewing current Australian policies and procedures, conducting a state of the art review of literature in the relevant fields and relating all information to Western Australian (WA) conditions. The work was completed with a focus on the WA Government’s road safety strategy of providing safer roads for cyclists. In the development of the procedure for ranking bicycle projects considerable research was undertaken to provide the necessary background and justification for the approach adopted in the procedures that follow. In essence the procedures draw together the quantitative and qualitative aspects associated with cycling projects, whether they be benefits or costs. Within the quantitative assessment valuations are placed on: · the safety implications of reduced crashes, and a lower risk of crashes. · the benefits of any change in modal choice and the presence of new users through the associated health, operational and resource cost savings. · the benefits of reductions in bicycle theft that a facility may provide, and · the total cost of the project including planning, design, construction and maintenance of the new <b>facility.</b> <b>Discounted</b> over the evaluation period this assessment provides a typical benefit cost ratio for the project. From a qualitative perspective issues related to Level of Service, Coherence and Directness, Attractiveness and Comfort of the Facility, Safety, Environment and Health, Strategic Issues and the effect on other users are all catered for in an event tree analysis. The final ranking of projects is then completed using a combination of the quantitative and qualitative assessment results to provide a prioritised list of all cycling projects considered...|$|R
