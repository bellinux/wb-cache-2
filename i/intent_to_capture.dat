The third and eighth prototypes were specially modified for speed, with unique outer wing panels of reduced span. The third prototype crashed during testing. The record flight was made using a special version of the DB 601 engine that offered [...] and had a service life of just 30 minutes. Prior to setting this absolute speed record over a short, measured course, Ernst Udet flew the second prototype to a 100 km closed course record of 634.32 km/h on 5 June 1938. Udet's record was apparently set using a standard DB 601a engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between [our personal experiences] and our idealizations of knowledge leads us into counterproductive strategies {{for learning and}} thinking" (Papert 1993). This discrepancy has driven most research towards understanding how people fail to accomplish a task, while few researchers have focused on looking at those instances where people have developed strategies for correcting their failure. This work has as its core belief that by identifying the strategies of correction we will develop better ways to assist in learning. However, to successfully assist in learning, {{we need to take}} into account both general rules of behavior and individual solutions. To explore this, we look at a concrete example from posture control, balance, to understand how learning modifies it. This research focuses on identifying an algorithm looking at the process of correction during dynamic balance. We outline an experiment whereby healthy subjects attempt to learn to balance on a two-degrees of freedom platform through external-focus feedback. The <b>intent</b> is <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> and analyze how the structure of old and new-learned body synergies for dynamic balance changes over time.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Safeguards R&D collaboration agreement between the US DoE and the EURATOM Community, Sandia National Laboratories, JRC-ITU (Ispra) and DG-Energy (Luxembourg) engaged in a collaborative project aiming at providing Safeguards authentication for a nuclear facility owned sensor or instrument. The main underlying idea is to use operator's owned devices for Safeguards purposes. The concept is the Enhanced Data Authentication System (EDAS). EDAS transparently captures, authenticates, and encrypts communication data that is transmitted between operator control computers and connected sensor points utilized in nuclear processes controls. The <b>intent</b> is <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> information as close to the sensor point as possible to assure the highest possible confidence in the authenticity of the collected data. To achieve this, an EDAS prototype was demonstrated at JRC, Ispra. In its current version, EDAS can be used with sensors or instruments that can be interfaced via an RS- 232 or RS- 485 communication port both for data output and input (configuration). The demonstration included the real-time authentication of data coming from sensors used in Process Monitoring (i. e., pressure sensors Mensor 6180 and 6100) or Surveillance (i. e., Laser Measurement System SICK LMS- 200). The paper discusses the motivation behind EDAS, describes its most relevant technical features, and details the results of the demonstration held at Ispra in April 2010 for both EURATOM and IAEA inspectorates.
