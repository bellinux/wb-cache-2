40|$|The main {{objective}} of regional autonomy is to empower regions {{in order to}} be more independent financially. However, some researches indicate that local governments still strongly depend on central government assistance through grant. This research examined flypapers effect as one of indicators to see the effectiveness of regional autonomy. It analyzed about how local governments allocate the available resources in terms of revenue that sourced from grant proxied by General Allocation Fund (GAF) and Revenue Sharing Fund (RSF) or its own income especially for public needs. This research used data sample of regional budget realization report of 9 regencies and 4 municipalities in South Sumatera province period 2008 until 2011. Analysis tool that was used in this research is multiple linear regressions. The research result shows that GAF, RSF, and Regional Owned Revenue (ROR) have significant influence on <b>infrastructure</b> <b>expenditure</b> partially and simultaneously. Positive coefficient value of GAF and RSF is greater than the coefficient value of ROR which is negative. It implies that effect of grants is greater than the effect of ROR on <b>infrastructure</b> <b>expenditure.</b> This result suggests there has been a Flypaper Effect on local government's response of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Local government’s behavior in setting <b>infrastructure</b> <b>expenditure</b> policy is more stimulated by the amount of grant received in the current year than its regional own revenue.

On the other hand, private sector organisations have a larger pool of sources from which to seek funding, equity investors, capital markets, banks etc., this can be from local to international markets. Therefore, private sector involvement in infrastructure provision has been widely used as a preferred method of financing these projects. The South African government can no longer carry the financial burden in it's fiscal policy to finance all the infrastructure projects needed in this country, and it is also up to the private sector to seek funding for projects that will be economical strong enough to service its own debt.

40|$|In {{the past}} half a century, Egypt has {{experienced}} remarkable progress {{in the provision of}} infrastructure in all areas, including transportation, telecommunication, power generation, and water and sanitation. Judging from an international perspective, Egypt has achieved an infrastructure status that closely corresponds to what could be expected given its national income level. The present infrastructure status is the result of decades of purposeful investment. In the past 15 years, however, a worrisome trend has emerged: Infrastructure investment has suffered a substantial decline, which may be at odds with the country’s goals of raising economic growth. Improving infrastructure in Egypt would require a combination of larger <b>infrastructure</b> <b>expenditures</b> and more efficient investment. The analysis provided in this paper suggests that an increase in <b>infrastructure</b> <b>expenditures</b> from 5 to 6 {{percent of gross domestic product}} would raise the annual per capita growth rate of gross domestic product by about 0. 5 percentage points in a decade’s time and 1 percentage point by the third decade. If the increase in infrastructure investment did not imply a heavier government burden (for instance, by cutting down on inefficient expenditures), the corresponding increase in growth of per capita gross domestic product would be substantially larger, in fact twice as large by the end of the first decade. This highlights the importance of considering renewed infrastructure investment in the larger context of public sector reform.
