5|$|<b>Farming</b> <b>is</b> a major {{occupation}} in New Zealand, although {{more people are}} employed as sales assistants. Most New Zealanders earn wage or salary income, with a median personal income in 2013 of NZ$28,500.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> now practiced in most countries.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{cockroaches}} {{have become}} popular as medicine and cockroach <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> rising. The cockroaches are fried {{twice in a}} wok of hot oil, which makes them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese. Fried cockroaches are ground and sold as pills for stomach, heart and liver diseases.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the modern}} road names to {{identify}} the location: Lea House <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> near Lea House Road; Two Gates <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> by the junction of Sycamore Road and Willows Road; Barnbrook <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> by the cross-roads of Linden Road and Bournville Lane; Row Heath <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> at the junction of Franklin Road and Oak Tree Lane, and Barnbrook Hall Farm later became the recreation ground for female staff at Cadbury’s; Fordhouse <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> half way up Fordhouse Lane near The Worthings; Bullies <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> located on Cartland Road, close to the junction with Pineapple Road; Pineapple <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> {{at the bottom of}} Vicarage Road, just across the railway lines from Hazelwell Hall; Dawberry Farm stood near Dawberry Fields Road and Harton Way.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 about 2.7 million private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> in operation. About 57 {{percent of}} these were smaller than five hectares. Of the {{remaining}} <b>farms,</b> 25 percent <b>were</b> between five and ten hectares and 11 percent were between ten and fifteen hectares. Only 7 percent of private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> larger than fifteen hectares. Whereas {{the majority of the}} private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> below optimum size, the majority of state <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> excessively large. Only 12 percent of the latter <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> below 200 hectares, and 60 percent were larger than 1,000 hectares.|$|R
30|$|From Table  6, {{it may be}} {{observed}} that marginal-small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly Cluster 3 farms (91.67 %), i.e. smaller farms with higher off-farm income. Medium <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> Cluster 2 (56.52 %) and Cluster 3 (30.43 %) farms i.e. diversified farms and small farms with higher off-farm income. Noticeably, large <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> distributed across all clusters, perhaps due to their higher flexibility in allocation of land resources among different crops/enterprises. Alternatively, Cluster 1 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly (75.00 %) large farms, Cluster II <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> largely Medium (56.52 %) and Large (41.67 %) farms, Cluster 3 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly Marginal-small <b>farms</b> (82.86 %) and Cluster 4 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> Large <b>farms</b> (71.43 %). The distribution of clusters across the farm size differed significantly (Likelihood ratio sig. value[*]=[*]. 00) indicating heterogeneous nature of farm types across farm sizes.|$|R
5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> more common in the northwestern provinces of the country, where such tracts of land exist. China does have a native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Sheep <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> practiced {{extensively}} in Wales, with lamb and mutton being the meats most traditionally {{associated with the}} country. Beef and dairy cattle are also raised widely, {{and there is a}} strong fishing culture. Fisheries and commercial fishing are common and seafood features widely in Welsh cuisine.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's early {{economy was}} based on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. During the 1880s {{agricultural}} products became the highest export earner and farming was a major occupation within New Zealand. <b>Farming</b> <b>is</b> still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their occupation during the 2006 census, although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector. The largest occupation recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people. Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).|$|E

2500|$|... "Family farm" [...] and [...] "corporate farm" [...] {{are often}} defined as {{mutually}} exclusive terms, {{with the two}} having different interests. This mostly stems from the widespread assumption that family <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> small <b>farms</b> while corporate <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> large-scale operations. While {{it is true that}} the majority of small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> family owned, many large <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> also family businesses, including some of the largest farms in the US.|$|R

5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> {{believed to be a}} major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> {{reflected in the}} age of many of the farmhouses. Manor Farm, on Scot Lane (not to be confused with at least two other Manor Farms in the locality) is thought to date from 1495 and, as such, is probably the oldest building in the village. Presently (2007) occupied by Mr and Mrs Slater; the building has recently (2002) undergone a sympathetic extension to incorporate an old semi-derelict barn onto the main house for use as a garage and workshop. Mr Slater, a Chartered Engineer, is interested in bringing the art of clock making back to the village. Rookery Farmhouse, in Breach Hill Lane, is dated at 1720, with later 18th century additions to either side of the central rear wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{key role}} women have in <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> to {{maintain}} {{ownership of the}} main sources of production in rural areas. In traditional China, women {{were not allowed to}} own land or property. Land was inherited through the sons, and if there was no son in the family, it was taken by a close male relative. In less populated areas, women do more agricultural work than men because of shifting cultivation. In more populated areas, men do more work than women because extensive plough cultivation is used. Female involvement is high in the double-cropping rice area. Other types of work women perform in the countryside include pig and poultry rearing, spinning, weaving, basket-making, and other handicrafts. This type of work supplements agricultural income.|$|E
50|$|The Aguçadoura Wave <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> the world's {{first wave}} <b>farm.</b> It <b>was</b> located 5 km {{offshore}} near Póvoa de Varzim north of Porto in Portugal. The <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> designed to use three Pelamis Wave Energy Converters {{to convert the}} motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity, totalling to 2.25 MW in total installed capacity. The <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> officially opened on 23 September 2008, by the Portuguese Minister of Economy. The wave <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> shut down two months after the official opening in November 2008.|$|R

5|$|The {{principal}} use {{of slavery}} was in agriculture, {{the foundation of}} the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two. An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the Economy of Xenophon or that of Pseudo-Aristotle) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> disputed. It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman latifundia.|$|E
5|$|Juniata County has a {{relatively}} low population density. The most population-dense parts of the county are the boroughs of Mifflintown and Mifflin. The most common races in the county are white (96.8% of all residents) and black (0.6% of all residents). Between 1940 and 2005, Juniata County's population grew faster than all but two other counties in Pennsylvania. Susquehanna Township had the fastest-growing population of any borough or township in the county during this time period. Livestock <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> the largest industry in the county, although there are other industries as well, including crop farming and tourism. Manufacturing jobs {{are the most common}} jobs in the county. The county's median household income is $34,698 per year and its median family income is $39,757 per year. The poverty rate is 9.5% and the unemployment rate is 5.4%. The median house value in the county was $87,000 in 2000. The main roads in Juniata County are Pennsylvania Route 235, Pennsylvania Route 35, Pennsylvania Route 104, U.S. Route 11/U.S. Route 15, U.S. Route 22/U.S. Route 322, Pennsylvania Route 74, Pennsylvania Route 850, and Pennsylvania Route 333.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
50|$|Today the Game <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> home to over 200 animals. For many people, {{visiting the}} game <b>farm</b> <b>is</b> a yearly tradition. The Long Island Game <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} oldest and most {{well-known}} establishments in Manorville, and has been one of the town's major landmarks since its opening.|$|R
50|$|Wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> often {{built on}} land {{that has already}} been {{impacted}} by land clearing. The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind <b>farms</b> <b>is</b> minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations. If wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition.|$|R

Most of the world's largest {{offshore}} wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> located in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. The two largest offshore wind <b>farm</b> <b>are</b> currently the 630 MW London Array and Gwynt y Môr.|$|R
5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased desertification. Desert <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
