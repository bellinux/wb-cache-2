50|$|AGVs (some {{known as}} {{automated}} guided carts or AGCs) use tape for the guide path. The tapes {{can be one}} of two styles: magnetic or colored. The AGC is fitted with the appropriate guide sensor to follow the path of the tape.One major advantage of tape over wired guidance is that it can be easily removed and relocated if the course needs to change. Colored tape is initially less expensive, but lacks the advantage of being embedded in high traffic areas where the tape may become damaged or dirty. A flexible magnetic bar can also be embedded in the floor like wire but works under the same provision as magnetic tape and so remains unpowered or passive. Another advantage of magnetic <b>guide</b> <b>tape</b> is the dual polarity. small pieces of magnetic tape may be placed to change states of the AGC based on polarity and sequence of the tags.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) is {{a mobile}} Robot used in {{industrial}} applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or a warehouse. An AGV {{can also be}} called a laser guided vehicle (LGV) or self-guided vehicle (SGV). In Germany the technology is also called Fahrerlose Transport system (FTS). AGV’s are extensively adopted in Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS), AGV’s Navigate on Their own {{with the help of}} various guiding mechanisms; broadly these mechanisms are classified as wired & wireless guidance mechanisms. In this project we mainly concentrate on wireless guidance mechanism which makes use if <b>guide</b> <b>tape</b> (colored in this case) for navigation. Basically this type of AGV’s act as a line follower robot which follows the <b>guide</b> <b>tape</b> which is imprinted on the shop floor. The <b>guide</b> <b>tape</b> is sensed by the onboard sensors which are present on the AGV; the sensor used for this purpose is an optical sensor which uses Infrared LED’s. AGV’s can be controlled by one centralized or onboard computer which i present in the AGV; in this project we use of an Onboard microcontroller which acts as a machine control unit (MCU) to control & coordinate all the parameters of an AGV.

50|$|A tape {{transport}} is {{the collection}} of parts of a magnetic tape player or recorder that the actual tape passes through. Transport parts include the head, capstan, pinch roller, tape pins, and <b>tape</b> <b>guide.</b> The <b>tape</b> transport {{as a whole is}} called the transport mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The tape {{transports}} used in {{the system}} were made as simple and fool-proof as possible, consisting of a read-write headassembly, two reel drive motors, and a <b>tape</b> <b>guide.</b> The <b>tape</b> system used 10 tracks across a 1/2 in tape on 10 in reels.Maximum reel speed was 920 inches per second (23.4 metres per second).

40|$|A general {{automotive}} {{navigation system}} is a satellite navigation system designed for use in automobiles. It typically uses GPS to acquire position data to locate the user on a road in the unit's map database. In the other side an automated guided vehicle or so called automatic guided vehicle (AGV) is a system designed to perform an unmanned travel of a vehicle. This vehicle {{can be used in}} many area especially dangerous places such as at harbor, surveying and military purpose. There are two main sensors AGV use for navigation, a wired sensor and a wireless sensor. The purpose of this project is to combine the concept of both systems to produce a prototype of an AGV navigated by a combination of GPS receiver and digital compass instead of using camera, <b>guide</b> <b>tape,</b> laser, inertial or gyroscopic. The project called as GPS Navigation System. The whole project can be divided into two main parts. The first part is concern on the hardware development where all electronics component are connected via the circuit design using wire wrapping technique. A GPS receiver, digital compass, RF receiver, and keypad are the input components while RF transmitter, LED, and LCD display are the output components. All of this input and output devices are connected to a PIC 14 F 8550 microcontroller. The second part is about software programming which used to control the whole operation of the system. The program is written using MikroBasic and downloaded to the PIC 18 F 4550 using PIC programmer after compiled into a *. hex file. As a conclusion, this system is designed to enable user to control and define the destination of a vehicle from a base station wirelessly and the advantage comes from the key component, GPS receiver which enable the vehicle to do movement in any direction according to the signal received from the base station without need a track...|$|E

50|$|A typical 9-track unit {{consisted}} of a tape transport—essentially all the mechanics that moved tape from reel to reel past the read/write and erase heads—and supporting control and data read/write electronics. The transport typically {{consisted of}} supply motor, take-up motor, hubs for locking the tape reels in place, a capstan motor (though not necessarily a pinch roller, see below), tape head assembly, miscellaneous rollers which kept the tape in a precise path during operation, and vacuum columns which prevented tape 'snatch'. Data could become corrupted by stretched tape or variations in tape speed, so the transport had to <b>guide</b> the <b>tape</b> through without damaging its edges, move it with minimal wow and flutter, {{and give it a}} tension that was low but sufficient to keep the tape in constant contact with the read/write head.|$|R

50|$|Reel-to-reel or open-reel {{audio tape}} {{recording}} is {{the form of}} magnetic tape audio recording in which the recording medium is held on a reel, rather than being securely contained within a cassette.

50|$|One {{significant}} advantage {{offered by}} DASH recorders over the analog recorders {{of the day}} was that 'proper' tape biasing was unimportant, as there is no means for the tape to 'color' the sound of the recorded data.

2500|$|Many delay {{processors}} {{based on}} analog tape recording, such as Ray Butts' EchoSonic (1952), Mike Battle's Echoplex (1959), or the Roland Space Echo (1973), used magnetic tape as their {{recording and playback}} medium. Electric motors <b>guided</b> a <b>tape</b> loop through a device {{with a variety of}} mechanisms allowing modification of the effect's parameters. In the case of the popular Echoplex EP-2, the [...] play head was fixed, while a combination record and erase head was mounted on a slide, thus the delay time of the echo was adjusted by changing the distance between the record and play heads. In the Space Echo, all of the heads are fixed, but the speed of the tape could be adjusted, changing the delay time. Thin magnetic tape was not entirely suited for continuous operation, however, so the tape loop had to be replaced {{from time to time to}} maintain the audio fidelity of the processed sounds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{radio station}} WKAP in Allentown, Pennsylvania, {{introduced}} a tape delay system consisting of an external playback head, which was spaced {{far enough away}} from the record head to allow for a six-second delay.

It is believed that {{this was the first time}} a telephone call-in show was broadcast with the telephone conversation [...] "live" [...] on the air. The FCC rules at the time prohibited the broadcasting of a live phone conversation. However, there was no rule prohibiting a taped playback of a phone call, provided that a [...] "beep" [...] tone was heard by the caller every 15 seconds so that the caller knew he was being recorded. The six-second delay constituted a [...] "taped" [...] phone conversation, thus complying with FCC regulations, that being a legal fiction.|$|R

40|$|Transport {{properties}} {{of a standard}} compact - cassette tape system are measured and software techniques devised to configure a low - cost,direct digital recording system. Tape - velocity variation is typically ± 10 % of standard speed over tape lengths of 5 µm. with occasional variations of ± 40 %. Static tape - skew can result due to axial movement of the tape reel when it spools. Dynamic tape skew occurs and is primarily caused by tape - edge curvature with a constant contribution due to the transport mechanism. Spectral skew components range from 0. 32 Hz to 8 Hz with magnitude normally within one 10 kbit/ sec- bit cell. The pinch roller works against the friction of the <b>tape</b> <b>guides</b> to cause <b>tape</b> deformation. Average values of tape deformation are 0. 67 µm, 0. 85 µm and 1. 08 µm for C 60,C 90 and C 120 tape respectively. Parallel,software encoding / decoding algorithms {{have been developed for}} several channel codes. Adaptive software methods permit track data rates up to 3. 33 k bits/sec in a rnultitrack system using a simple microcomputer. For a 4 - track system,raw error rates vary from 10 ˉ⁷ at 500 bits/sec/track to 10 ˉ⁵ at 3. 33 kbits/sec/track. Adaptive software reduces skew - induced errors by 50 %. A skew - correction technique has been developed and implemented on an 8 - track system at a track data rate of 10 k bits/sec. Real - time error correction gives a theoretical corrected error rate of 10 ˉ¹¹for a raw error rate of 10 ˉ⁷. Multiple track errors can cause mis - correction and interleaving is advised. Software algorithms have been devised for Reed - Solomon code. With a more powerful microprocessor this code m ay be combined with the above techniques in a layered error-correction scheme. The software techniques developed may be applied to N tracks with an N - bit computer. Recording density may be increased by using thin - film,multitrack heads and a faster computer.
