50|$|Returning {{from his}} first {{expedition}} to Italy, Henry II gathered an army to march against Poland. The previous year in 1003, Henry II had formed an alliance with the pagan Slavic Lutici tribe. As a consequence of their military alliance, Henry II halted Christianization efforts among the Slavic peoples. The new alliance with the Western Slavs against Poland was controversial, however. Many German nobles had hoped for continued missionary work and the <b>direct</b> <b>submission</b> of the Elbe Slavs. In addition, many German nobles opposed the war because they had developed family ties with Poland during Otto III's reign. Similarly, members of the clergy, including Bishop Bruno of Querfurt, saw future tithe payments and Polish support for missionary work in Prussia evaporating due to the war.|$|E

[...] However, he also secretly sent the officer Wei Renji (魏仁濟) to Song—which controlled the Central Plains region and had by that point forced Southern Tang into submission as a vassal—asking to directly submit to Song's Emperor Taizu (as Liu Congxiao had). The Song emperor accepted Chen's submission, and also wrote an edict to Li Yu explaining his decision in accepting a <b>direct</b> <b>submission</b> from Li Yu's subject. Li Yu responded, [...] "Chen Hongjin is treacherous, like a rat looking in both directions. He is not worth listening to." [...] Emperor Taizu issued a second explanatory edict to Li Yu, and Li Yu then acquiesced.

[...] He also commissioned Chen's sons Chen Wenxian (陳文顯) as deputy military governor and Chen Wenhao (陳文顥) as the prefect of Zhang Prefecture (漳州, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian). In summer 964, Chen Hongjin's mother died, but Emperor Taizu then formally recalled him to governmental service. [...] It was said that Chen levied heavy taxes on the people and allowed the rich to substitute mandatory labor with money, in order to submit rich tributes to the Song emperor. Further, his administration was plagued by corruption, and the people were distressed.|$|E

The telecommunication services have impacted {{the frequency and}} mode of communication of users. The Short Message Service (SMS) {{is one of the}} widely used services by subscribers due to the ability for recipients to read messages at their convenience. SMS uses computing devices such as routers and servers for delivery of messages to subscribers on a network. Not all messages sent by subscribers are delivered. An evaluation of the log files for SMS delivery indicated a high failure rate due to Absent Subscriber. This work aims to propose a solution to reduce the incidence of Absent Subscriber error. The proposed solution prevents the <b>direct</b> <b>submission</b> of the message for delivery. The proposed model was simulated using Java.

40|$|Oryzabase (&#x 22;[URL] is a {{comprehensive}} rice science database ^ 1 ^. It houses a variety of genetic resources, relevant literatures, gene dictionary, DNA sequences, and basic information such as developmental biology and anatomy. In {{order to keep the}} gene dictionary up-to-date, literature annotation has been conducted manually since 1995. However as the publication of journal articles increases year by year after genomic sequences were released, it became more difficult to update the dictionary timely and in high quality without sufficient annotators. To overcome this difficulty, we applied machine learning and text-mining to extract known and unknown genes from journals. The machine extraction followed by manual annotation achieved promising results and increased efficiency in manual annotation. Furthermore a <b>direct</b> <b>submission</b> system where rice researchers can deposit new genes according to the standardized nomenclature ^ 2 ^ became operational in 2008.

40|$|Citation {{data can}} be used to {{evaluate}} the editorial policies and procedures of scientific journals. Here we investigate citation counts for the three different publication tracks of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). This analysis explores the consequences of differences in editor and referee selection, while controlling for the prestige of the journal in which the papers appear. We find that papers authored and "Contributed" by NAS members (Track III) are on average cited less often than papers that are "Communicated" for others by NAS members (Track I) or submitted directly via the standard peer review process (Track II). However, we also find that the variance in the citation count of Contributed papers, {{and to a lesser extent}} Communicated papers, is larger than for <b>direct</b> <b>submissions.</b> Therefore when examining the 10 % most-cited papers from each track, Contributed papers receive the most citations, followed by Communicated papers, while <b>Direct</b> <b>submissions</b> receive the least citations. Our findings suggest that PNAS "Contributed" papers, in which NAS-member authors select their own reviewers, balance an overall lower impact with an increased probability of publishing exceptional papers. This analysis demonstrates that different editorial procedures are associated with different levels of impact, even within the same prominent journal, and raises interesting questions about the most appropriate metrics for judging an editorial policy's success...|$|R
