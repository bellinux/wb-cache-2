40|$|Abstract—A cooperative, {{sequential}} {{process of}} molecular recog-nition governs leukocyte capture, rolling, and arrest on inflamed endothelium. Flowing neutrophils are captured via heterotypic adhesive interactions mediated by endothelial E-selectin, whereas homotypic interactions between neutrophils are mediated by L-selectin. To elucidate how each selectin facilitates the transi-tion to CD 18 -mediated stable adhesion, E-selectin and L-selectin were expressed at defined site density in a murine pre-B-cell line. Direct observation of two-body collisions revealed that 30 % of neutrophil interactions with E-selectin transfectants formed dou-blets at low shear rate G = 14 s− 1 whereas a threshold shear rate 14 s− 1 ≤ G ≤ 110 s− 1 {{was necessary for}} L-selectin adhesion. Ad-hesion via L-selectin resisted rupture at high shear stress, while E-selectin tethered doublets remained intact longer once formed. Moreover, higher expression of L-selectin (1100 sites/µm 2) than that of E-selectin (220 sites/µm 2) was required for comparable <b>heterotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> efficiency. With a threefold rise in active CD 18 upregulated on chemotactically stimulated neutrophils, ho-motypic adhesion efficiency increased 10 -fold compared to less than 5 -fold for <b>heterotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> to selectin transfectants. Co-expression of E-selectin and ICAM- 1 boosted adhesion efficiency threefold more than either receptor alone over the range of active CD 18 expression. These data {{are the first to}} quantify adhesion efficiency mediated by selectin tethering and conformational ac-tivation of β 2 -integrin in neutrophils in shear flow.

40|$|In {{the early}} stages of breast cancer metastasis, {{epithelial}} cells penetrate the basement membrane and invade the surrounding stroma, where they encounter fibroblasts. Paracrine signaling between fibroblasts and epithelial tumor cells contributes to the metastatic cascade, but {{little is known about the}} role of adhesive contacts between these two cell types in metastasis. Here we show that MCF- 7 breast cancer epithelial cells and normal breast fibroblasts form <b>heterotypic</b> <b>adhesions</b> when grown together in co-culture, as evidenced by adhesion assays. PCR and immunoblotting show that both cell types express multiple members of the cadherin superfamily, including the atypical cadherin, cadherin- 23, when grown in isolation and in co-culture.

The DAH postulates that tissues are visco-elastic liquids, and as such possess measurable tissue surface tensions.

The surface tensions correspond to the mutual sorting behavior: the tissue type with the higher surface tension will occupy an internal position with regard to a tissue with a lower surface tension. Differences in homo and <b>heterotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> presumed to be adequate to account for the phenomenon without requiring cell type specific adhesion systems. According to DAH, cellular movement and assortment is governed by the spontaneous rearrangement of cells, {{in much the same way}} as a liquid to obtain a more thermodynamically stable equilibrium.

Whereas homotypic ALCAM-ALCAM interactions have been implicated {{in the development and}} maintenance of tissue architecture and tumor progression, heterotypic ALCAM-CD 6 interactions act to initiate and stabilize T-cell-dendritic-cell interactions affecting T-cell activation. The ability to resist the forces acting on the individual bonds during these highly dynamic cellular contacts is thought to be crucial for the (patho) physiology of ALCAM-mediated cell adhesion. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to characterize the relationship between affinity, avidity and the stability of ALCAM-mediated interactions under external loading, at the single-molecule level. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton resulted in enhanced ALCAM binding avidity, without affecting the tensile strength of the individual bonds. Force spectroscopy revealed that the ALCAM-CD 6 bond displayed a significantly higher tensile strength, a smaller reactive compliance and an up to 100 -fold lower dissociation rate in the physiological force window in comparison to the homotypic interaction.

40|$|In {{multicellular}} organisms, {{cells are}} interconnected by cell adhesion molecules. Nectins are immunoglobulin (Ig) -like cell adhesion molecules that mediate homotypic and <b>heterotypic</b> cell-cell <b>adhesion,</b> playing key roles in tissue organization. To mediate cell-cell adhesion, nectin molecules dimerize in cis {{on the surface}} of the same cell, followed by trans-dimerization of the cis-dimers between the neighboring cells. Previous cell biological studies deduced that the first Ig-like domain of nectin and the second Ig-like domain are involved in trans-dimerization and cis-dimerization, respectively. However, to understand better the steps involved in nectin adhesion, the structural basis for the dimerization of nectin must be determined. In this study, we determined the first crystal structure of the entire extracellular region of nectin- 1. In the crystal, nectin- 1 formed a V-shaped homophilic dimer through the first Ig-like domain. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of the first Ig-like domain identified four essential residues that are involved in the homophilic dimerization. Upon mutating the four residues, nectin- 1 significantly decreased cis-dimerization {{on the surface of}} cultured cells and abolished the homophilic and heterophilic adhesion activities. These results indicate that, in contrast with the previous notion, our structure represents a cis-dimer.

From the distance dependence of the protein-protein interaction potential, we demonstrate directly that the full-length extracellular domains adhere in a head-to-head orientation. The absence of long-range electrostatic protein-protein attraction further indicates that the salt bridges between the binding surfaces only influence the interaction at short range. Despite {{the loss of a}} stabilizing disulfide bond in domain 1 (D 1) of CD 2, adhesive failure occurs abruptly with no evidence of partial protein unfolding during detachment. Finally, these measurements between extended membrane surfaces directly confirm that the low-affinity CD 2 -CD 48 bond generates weak adhesion and that lateral receptor mobility is required for the development of appreciable adhesion. This is the first direct measurement of the range and magnitude of the forces governing <b>heterotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> mediated by cell surface proteins. These results both verified the head-to-head CD 2 -CD 48 docking alignment and demonstrated the ability to elucidate the structure-function relationships of adhesion proteins from the measured distance dependence of their interaction potentials...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{discrete}} model of malignant invasion using a thermodynamic argument. An {{extension of the}} Potts model is used to simulate a population of malignant cells experiencing interactions due to both homotypic and <b>heterotypic</b> <b>adhesion</b> while also secreting proteolytic enzymes and experiencing a haptotactic gradient. In this way we investigate the influence of changes in cell–cell adhesion on the invasion process. We demonstrate that the morphology of the invading front is influenced by changes in the adhesiveness parameters, and detail how the invasiveness of the tumour is related to adhesion. We show that cell–cell adhesion has less of an influence on invasion compared with cell–medium adhesion, and that increases in both proteolytic enzyme secretion rate and the coefficient of haptotaxis act in synergy to promote invasion. We extend the simulation by including proliferation, and, following experimental evidence, develop an algorithm for cell division in which the mitotic rate is explicitly related {{to changes in the}} relative magnitudes of homotypic and heterotypic adhesiveness. We show that although an increased proliferation rate usually results in an increased depth of invasion into the extracellular matrix, it does not invariably do so, and may, indeed, cause invasiveness to be reduced...|$|E
40|$|In cell {{suspensions}} {{subjected to}} high-shear rotatory motion, human PMN (polymorphonuclear cells) adhered to E-selectin-expressing CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) cells (CHO-E), and formed homotypic aggregates when challenged by E-selectin–IgG fusion protein, by a mechanism that involved β 2 integrins. Both heterotypic and homotypic PMN adhesion {{was accompanied by}} tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110  kDa protein (P 110). This event was prevented by blocking anti-(β 2 integrin) antibodies and by inhibitors of Src-family kinases, suggesting that {{it was part of}} an ‘outside-in’ signalling that was initiated by integrin engagement. Interestingly, Src-family kinase inhibitors prevented β 2 -integrin-mediated (i) homotypic PMN adhesion triggered by E-selectin–IgG, (ii) <b>heterotypic</b> CHO-E/PMN <b>adhesion</b> in mixed-cell suspensions, and (iii) firm adhesion of PMN to CHO-E monolayers under physiological flow. Similarly to PMN treated with Src-family kinase inhibitors, PMN from hck−/−fgr−/− and hck−/−fgr−/−lyn−/− mice showed significant impairment of β 2 -integrin-mediated adhesion to CHO-E. Moreover, the expression of β 2 integrin activation epitopes at the sites of cell–cell contact in CHO-E/PMN conjugates was abolished by Src-family kinase inhibitors. One component of P 110 was identified as the FAK (focal adhesion kinase) Pyk 2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2), which was phosphorylated in a β 2 integrin- and Src-family-kinase-dependent manner. Thus, Src-family kinases, and perhaps Pyk 2, mediate a signal necessary for β 2 integrin function in PMN tethered by E-selectin...|$|R
40|$|Background: The mucin MUC 16 {{expresses the}} repeating peptide epitope CA 125 {{that has been}} known for decades to be a well-validated cancer marker that is overexpressed on the cell surface of ovarian cancers and other {{malignant}} tumors. In spite of recent efforts to make mouse monoclonal antibodies to MUC 16 to treat ovarian cancer, a human monoclonal antibody against this mucin has not been described. MUC 16 interacts with mesothelin, a protein that mediates <b>heterotypic</b> cancer cell <b>adhesion,</b> indicating that MUC 16 and mesothelin {{play an important role in}} the peritoneal implantation and metastasis of ovarian tumors. Therefore, a suitable candidate for therapeutic targeting of MUC 16 would functionally block the interaction of MUC 16 and mesothelin. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report the generation of a novel immunoadhesin, HN 125, against MUC 16 that consists of a functional MUC 16 binding domain of mesothelin (IAB) and the Fc portion of a human antibody IgG 1. The yield for purified HN 125 proteins is over 100 &# 181;g/mL of HEK- 293 culture supernatant. We show that HN 125 has high and specific affinity for MUC 16 -expressing cancer cells by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. HN 125 has the ability to disrupt the <b>heterotypic</b> cancer cell <b>adhesion</b> mediated by the MUC 16 -mesothelin interaction. Moreover, it elicits strong antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity against MUC 16 -positive cancer cells in vitro. Conclusion/Significance: This report describes a novel human immunotherapeutic agent highly specific for MUC 16 with potential for treating ovarian cancer and other MUC 16 -expressing tumors. Because of its lower immunogenicity in patients, a fully human protein is the most desirable format for clinical applications. We believe that the methods developed here may apply to the generation of other tumor-targeting immunoadhesins when it is difficult to obtain a human monoclonal antibody to a given antigen for clinical applications. The resultant immunoadhesins can have advantages usually found in monoclonal antibodies such as ease of purification, high binding affinity and effector functions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Metastatic cascade in {{malignant}} tumors, including breast cancer, {{starts with}} localized {{invasion of the}} host tissue. This process, requiring that tumor cells separate from each other, includes loss of homotypic and <b>heterotypic</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> and cell-cell contact inhibition, acquisition of motility, exacerbated by "epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition", and production of proteolytic enzymes which degrade basal membrane and extracellular matrix. In this sense, aside from urokinase type plasminogen activator, increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{is one of the}} earliest and most sustained events in tumor progression, playing a role in angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. MMPs are a family of 23 zinc metalloproteinases, secreted as latent pro-enzymes, activated by proteolytic cleavage, and inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. The most commonly connected MMPs with the processes of metastasis are MMP- 2 (gelatinase A) and MMP- 9 (gelatinase B), due to their ability to degrade collagen type IV, major component of vascular basement membrane. MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 are also required for the switch to the "angiogenic phenotype" during tumor progression and activation of dormant tumor cells. The association of the increase in serum MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 activity and clinical stage suggests the usefulness of these parameters as markers in the follow-up and prognosis of breast cancer patients. The concept of "stromal-directed therapy" of cancer, with MMP-inhibitors directed against MMPs as targets, is based on the observed MMP up-regulation in tumors...|$|R
