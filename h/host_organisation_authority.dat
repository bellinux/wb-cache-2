After hosting the event in 2007, Åre saw many positive effects and the <b>host</b> <b>organisation</b> now aims to go from good to great, making the 2019 event an even greater success. The study will examine how experienced learning gained by the <b>host</b> <b>organisation</b> from 2007 is utilized and adapted in the planning process towards 2019. Therefore, qualitative interviews with the current members of the <b>hosting</b> <b>organisation</b> were conducted in order to further understand this process.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Sport Management in the Faculty of Business and Management Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyVolunteer tourism, {{as a form of}} leisure and/or recreation, is {{one of the fastest growing}} forms of tourism globally. It has also become a critical human resource for many organisations in the Western Cape, South Africa who rely on the support of volunteer tourists. A review of the current literature showed that most volunteer tourism research studies is volunteer-tourist-centred and focus on the motivations for participation and the benefits of participation to the volunteer tourist. Very few studies consider the effect of volunteer tourism on the <b>host</b> <b>organisation</b> and within the South African context only two volunteer tourist profile studies exist. Both studies excluded <b>host</b> <b>organisation</b> factors that indicated how <b>host</b> <b>organisations</b> benefited from <b>hosting</b> volunteer tourists. This research study focussed on creating a comprehensive profile of volunteer tourists at SANCCOB (a non-profit seabird rehabilitation centre) in Table View, Western Cape, South Africa. The profile included demographic factors, motivational factors and SANCCOB specific information. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-administered, online questionnaire and from the data, five conclusions were made. Firstly, the demographic factors of volunteer tourists that participated in SANCCOB’s international volunteer programme was similar to other South African based volunteer tourism studies. Secondly, to experience something different and new was the most important motivational factor for volunteer tourists. Thirdly, volunteer tourists derived considerable benefit from volunteering at SANCCOB. Fourthly, volunteer tourists continued to support SANCCOB through social and financial activities after completing the programme, indicating that SANCCOB (as a <b>host</b> <b>organisation)</b> benefited from <b>hosting</b> volunteer tourists and that as a result, a mutually beneficial relationship exists between this <b>host</b> <b>organisation</b> and the volunteer tourist. Lastly, this study provided SANCCOB with valuable information for volunteer management, as well as future marketing and fundraising campaigns...|$|R
