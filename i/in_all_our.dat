She similarly produced and hosted news and documentary programming for television on both the English and French services of the CBC.|$|E

[...] Camp meeting sites had long been supported by the Central Pennsylvania Conference. The Pennsylvania legislature chartered the campground in 1873.|$|E
500|$|Jamie Edwards, who {{had helped}} record and tour for Happiness... was heavily {{utilized}} during the recording process and was becoming {{a big part of}} the band, considered by some to be the unofficial fifth member of the band at that time. Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to do with that stuff. He was very influential. We had him <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> writing sessions. It was a very creative time that was cool because we were all in a room, kind of working together.” ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{the above}} {{framework}} physicists were then able to calculate {{to a high}} degree of accuracy some of the properties of electrons, such as the anomalous magnetic dipole moment. However, as Feynman points out, it fails totally to explain why particles such as the electron have the masses they do. [...] "There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers. We use the numbers <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> theories, but we don't understand them – what they are, or where they come from. I believe that from a fundamental point of view, this is a very interesting and serious problem." ...|$|E

500|$|Goodridge {{completed}} Beauty Revealed in 1828, likely {{from looking}} at herself in a mirror. Several works have been cited as possible inspirations, including John Vanderlyn's Ariadne Asleep on the Island of Naxos and Horatio Greenough's sculpture Venus Victrix. Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster {{when he was a}} new widower, and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone. The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say [...] "We are yours for the taking, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> ivory loveliness, with our tenderly stippled nipples". Ultimately, however, Webster married another, wealthier woman.|$|E
500|$|Douglas H. Erwin, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} Artificial Life, noted that life forms from fruit flies to humans have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – human beings have only some 20,000. [...] "How could humans, <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> diversity of cell types and complexity of neurons, require essentially {{the same number of}} genes as a fly, or worse, a worm (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans)?" [...] asks Erwin. He answered his own question about the [...] "astonishing morphological diversity" [...] of animals coming from [...] "such a limited number of genes", praising Carroll's [...] "insightful and enthusiastic" [...] style, writing in a [...] "witty and engaging" [...] way, pulling the reader into the complexities of Hox and PAX-6, as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms and much else.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} thing.... We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

[...] The game features high-definition 3D models, reworked textures, improved lighting, and remastered music tracks. MDK2 HD was originally released exclusively on Beamdog in October 2011, and was later released on Steam in July 2012.|$|E
