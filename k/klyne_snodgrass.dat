He concludes that, [...] "Thomas, rather than representing the earliest form, has been shaped by this harmonizing tendency in Syria. If the Gospel of Thomas were the earliest, we would have to imagine that each of the evangelists or the traditions behind them expanded the parable in different directions and then that in the process of transmission the text was trimmed back to the form it has in the Syriac Gospels. It is much more likely that Thomas, which has a Syrian provenance, is dependent on the tradition of the canonical Gospels that has been abbreviated and harmonized by oral transmission." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bernard Brandon Scott, {{a member}} of the Jesus Seminar, {{questions}} the authenticity of the parable's context, suggesting that [...] "the parable originally circulated separately from the question about neighborliness" [...] and that the [...] "existence of the lawyer's question in [...] and , in addition to the evidence of heavy Lukan editing" [...] indicates the parable and its context were [...] "very probably joined editorially by Luke." [...] A number of other commentators share this opinion, with the consensus of the Jesus Seminar being that verses [...] were added by Luke to [...] "connect with the lawyer's question." [...] On the other hand, the [...] "keen rabbinic interest in the question of the greatest commandment" [...] may make this argument invalid, in that Luke may be describing a different occurrence of the question being asked. Differences between the gospels suggest that Luke is referring to a different episode from Mark and Matthew, and <b>Klyne</b> <b>Snodgrass</b> writes that [...] "While one cannot exclude that Luke has joined two originally separate narratives, evidence for this is not convincing."

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in {{equivalent}} social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice. For example, anti-slavery campaigner William Jay described clergy who ignored slavery as [...] "following the example of the priest and Levite". Martin Luther King, Jr., in his [...] "I've Been to the Mountaintop" [...] speech, described the Samaritan as [...] "a man of another race". [...] Sundee Tucker Frazier saw the Samaritan more specifically {{as an example of a}} mixed-race person. <b>Klyne</b> <b>Snodgrass</b> wrote: [...] "On the basis of this parable we must deal with our own racism but must also seek justice for, and offer assistance to, those in need, regardless of the group to which they belong." ...|$|E
