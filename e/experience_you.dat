500|$|Bigelow was {{motivated}} to start work on Strange Days shortly {{after a series}} of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, [...] "I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that <b>experience.</b> <b>You</b> got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live." [...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E

500|$|Bruckheimer {{said the}} {{decision}} to film in 3D was made due to its being [...] "immersive filmmaking; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen." [...] Bruckheimer described it as the first major [...] "exterior movie" [...] to be shot in 3D, as Avatar was mostly done in sound stages. At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. [...] "You are on an adventure and with the 3D <b>experience</b> <b>you</b> are inside that adventure." [...] While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, {{the decision was made}} to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion. The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar, which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Carey {{announced}} a world tour in April 2003. , [...] "" [...] was her most extensive tour, lasting over eight months and performing sixty-nine shows in venues worldwide. Before tickets {{went on sale}} in the US, venues were switched from large arenas to smaller, more intimate theater shows. According to Carey, the change was made {{in order to give}} fans a more intimate show, and something more Broadway-influenced. She said, [...] "It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an <b>experience.</b> <b>You</b> experience a night with me." [...] However, while smaller productions were booked for the US leg of the tour, Carey performed at stadia and arenas in Asia and Europe, and performed for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China. In the UK, it was Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London; she performed in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell {{had similar}} praise, {{describing}} it as [...] "pleasantly innocent and uplifting", though he awarded it a lower score than other reviewers {{as he felt}} the US$9.99 price was too high for the game's length. This criticism was not universal, as reviewers such as Jason Hill of The Age called the A$13 Australian price [...] "reasonable" [...] and described the length as not [...] "overstay its welcome". Critics such as GamePros Terry Terrones and GameTrailers echoed the same praises as other reviewers for the game; GameTrailers {{said that it was}} [...] "less a game and more an <b>experience.</b> <b>You</b> don't necessarily [...] "play" [...] Flower; you interact with it," [...] while Terrones noted the music as {{the best part of the}} game's presentation. Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph felt that Flower would [...] "reignite the 'video games as art' debate" [...] and was of the opinion that it was a [...] "wonderful work of art" [...] in addition to a game. The positive reception surprised the developers, as they had expected a mixed reaction.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every now and then to remind you this is not the common <b>experience.</b> <b>You</b> need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole you’ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it.

500|$|The {{sequences}} on the Grid were wholly shot in 3D, utilizing cameras {{specifically designed}} for it, and employed a 3D technique that combined other special effects techniques. The real-world sequences were filmed in 2D, and eventually altered using the three-dimensional element. Bailey stated {{that it was a}} challenge shooting Tron: Legacy in 3D because the cameras were bigger and heavier, and variations needed to be taken into account. Despite these concerns, he opined that it was a [...] "great reason {{to go to the movies}} because it's an <b>experience</b> <b>you</b> just can't recreate on an iPhone or a laptop". In some sequences the image shows a fine mesh pattern and some blurring. That is not interference or a production fault, but indicates that that sequence is a flashback and to simulate an older form of video representation technology. Stunt work on the film was designed and coordinated by 87Eleven, who also designed and trained fight sequences for 300 and Watchmen. Olivia Wilde described it as an honor to train with them.|$|E

You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season.

[...] While he praised its visuals and air traffic control, he considered the game to be simpler than Flight Simulator 2000 because of its less detailed lessons, interfaces and flight physics.

Writing for Computer Games Magazine, Denny Atkin stated {{that the use of}} turbulence [...] "really sets FU3 apart from the competition", and that the game's simulation of air traffic is [...] "like no other sim".

[...] PC Gamer UKs Dean Evans wrote that the game has [...] "a poetic grandeur", as well as an [...] "astonishing attention to detail" [...] greater than that of its predecessors. He praised its flight lessons and weather, and he considered the graphics to be [...] "unbelievably delicious".

It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation; [...] "In my <b>experience,</b> <b>you</b> assert control over a computer—show it who's the boss—by making it do something unique. That means programming it....If you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel better about it ever afterwards". In the book, Crichton predicts a number of events in the history of computer development, that computer networks would increase in importance as a matter of convenience, including the sharing of information and pictures that we see online today which the telephone never could. He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as [...] "the hula hoops of the '80s", and saying [...] "already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading." [...] In a section of the book called [...] "Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard", Crichton again seeks his revenge on the medical school teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college. Within the book, Crichton included many self-written demonstrative Applesoft (for Apple II) and BASICA (for IBM PC compatibles) programs.|$|E
