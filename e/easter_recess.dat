25|$|Strickland {{spoke on}} both {{the first two days}} of the session, 6 April 1571 and 7 April 1571; on the second of these he put forward a motion to {{reintroduce}} six bills to reform the Book of Common Prayer, which had been defeated in the previous parliament; the Speaker allowed the bills to be read, but the Queen had previously directed that Parliament should not debate such matters, and this earned the house a royal reprimand. Then on the last day before the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> 14 April 1571, Strickland introduced his own bill to reform the prayer book – among other measures it proposed to abolish confirmation, prevent priests from wearing vestments and end the practice of kneeling at the Communion. The bill was given a first reading against the vigorous opposition of the Privy Counsellors present, but after further argument the House voted to petition the Queen for permission to continue discussing the bill before any further action was taken, and the House adjourned.|$|E
25|$|The Polish–Prussian {{alliance}} angered Catherine II, who recalled von Stackelberg {{and replaced}} him with Yakov Bulgakov. This, however, changed little: Russia was still occupied with the Ottomans, and the Prussians played their own game, further giving Catherine a pause before ordering any intervention. Bulgakov was further outmaneuvered by the Polish reformers when King Stanisław August drew closer to {{leaders of the}} reform-minded Patriotic Party (Stanisław Małachowski, Ignacy Potocki, Hugo Kołłątaj, Stanisław Staszic and others). Finally the reformers pulled a quasi-coup d'etat, voting for a new constitution, the Constitution of May 3, 1791, {{when most of the}} pro-Russian deputies (Muscovite Party) were away for the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess.</b> The Constitution which drastically reformed the Commonwealth coincided {{with the end of the}} Russo-Turkish war. The members of the Muscovite Party, who felt secure with the previous status quo and under Russian protection, formed the Targowica Confederation, and requested Catherine II to intervene to restore their freedoms. A month after the Constitution was signed Bulgakov informed the Polish king that Russian forces were responding to their request and entering Poland in order to 'restore order' - although in fact they were there to abolish the constitution which threatened the Russian control over Poland. The Prussians were also appalled at the possibility of strong constitutional monarchy at their border. Poland forces, numerically inferior to Russians (at about 1:3), were eventually defeated in the War in Defense of the Constitution. The Constitution was abolished, and the Second Partition of Poland took place.|$|E
500|$|Reforms {{were opposed}} by {{conservative}} elements, including the Hetmans' Party. The reform's advocates, threatened with violence from their opponents, managed to move {{debate on the}} new constitution forward by two days from the original May 5, while many opposed deputies were still away on <b>Easter</b> <b>recess.</b> The ensuing debate and adoption of the Constitution of 3 May {{took place in a}} quasi-coup d'état: recall notices were not sent to known opponents of reform, while many pro-reform deputies arrived early and in secret, and the royal guard were positioned about the Royal Castle, where the Sejm was gathered, to prevent Russian supporters from disrupting the proceedings. On May 3 the Sejm met with only 182 members present, about a half of its [...] "dual" [...] number (or a third, if one was to count all individuals eligible {{to take part in the}} proceedings, including the Senate and the king). The bill [...] was read out and adopted overwhelmingly, to the enthusiasm of the crowds gathered outside.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his New York radio career, Kaufman {{produced}} multi-racial rock 'n' roll shows {{three or}} four times a year, usually during the <b>Easter</b> school <b>recess,</b> the week before Labor Day, and between Christmas and New Year at the Brooklyn Fox Theater. Those shows featured the top performers of the era and introduced new acts, such as The Delicates, Dionne Warwick, The Shirelles, Chuck Jackson, The Zombies, Little Anthony and the Imperials, the Ronettes, the Shangri-Las, Gene Pitney, Ben E. King, The Tymes, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Bobby Vinton (who was the leader of the house band when he asked for a chance to perform as a singer), The Lovin' Spoonful, Cream, and The Who, among many others.|$|R
5000|$|Tiberi {{has been}} {{critical}} of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and has expressed agreement with House Speaker Paul Ryan's framework to replace it. On February 17, 2017, Tiberi commented to the Ripon Society that his plan to change the ACA is more complex than a single piece of legislation. It involves relying on the regulatory power of Tom Price as HHS Secretary, the Budget Reconciliation process, and bi-partisan legislation. His comments also suggested that he no longer thinks a full repeal of the ACA is necessary. He said [...] "it’s not just about repealing. Maybe it’s about modifying some provisions of the Affordable Care Act." [...] The conservative Club for Growth ran a television ad criticizing the congressman for his positions on healthcare. The ad accuses Tiberi of blocking President Trump's efforts to repeal the ACA. Tiberi refused to hold townhall meetings to discuss healthcare policy during the February and <b>Easter</b> 2017 congressional <b>recesses.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{proposed}} {{reforms were}} {{opposed by the}} conservatives, including the Hetmans' Party. Threatened with violence by their opponents, the advocates of the draft began {{the debate on the}} Government Act two days early, while many opposing deputies were away on <b>Easter</b> <b>recess.</b> The debate and subsequent adoption of the Government Act was executed as a quasi-coup d'état. No recall notices were sent to known opponents of reform, while many pro-reform deputies secretly returned early. The royal guard under the command of the King's nephew Prince Józef Poniatowski were positioned about the Royal Castle, where the Sejm was gathered, to prevent opponents from disrupting the proceedings. On May 3, the Sejm convened with only 182 members, about half its [...] "dual" [...] number. The bill was read and overwhelmingly adopted, to the enthusiasm of the crowds outside. A protest was submitted the next day by a small group of deputies, but on May 5 the matter was officially concluded and protests were invalidated by the Constitutional Deputation of the Sejm. It {{was the first time in}} the 18th century that a constitutional act had been passed in the Commonwealth without the involvement of foreign powers.|$|E
60|$|In the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> our Northchester member had {{his house}} full, and among his guests {{was one of}} the most {{influential}} men of the day, who, though not a cabinet minister himself, was known to have immense influence with Government and in Parliament, from his great weight and character.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps two {{or three}} weeks, {{certainly}} not more. After the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, {{will have to go}} up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> was {{not spent}} at the Grange, but at Lady Leonora's pretty house in Surrey. She had invited the party in so {{pressing}} a manner that Flora {{did not think it}} right to decline. Meta expressed some disappointment at missing Easter among her school-children, but she said {{a great deal about the}} primroses and the green corn-fields, and nightingales--all which Ethel would have set down to her trick of universal content, if it had not appeared that Sir Henry was there too, and shared in all the delicious rides.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not till}} {{two or three}} days after his visit to St. Diddulph's that he met Colonel Osborne. The <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> was then over, and Colonel Osborne had just {{returned}} to London. They met on the door-steps of [...] "The Acrobats," [...] and the Colonel immediately began with an apology. [...] "I have been so sorry to be away just when you are here;--upon my word I have. But I was obliged {{to go down to the}} duchess's. I had promised early in the winter; and those people are so angry if you put them off. By George, it's almost as bad as putting off royalty." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{found that}} his work in {{mathematics}} and classics was already some time in arrears, and a [...] "test" [...] he had sent to his correspondence Tutor during those troublous days after the meeting with Bonover in the Avenue, came back blottesquely indorsed: [...] "Below Pass Standard." [...] This last experience was so unprecedented and annoyed him so much that for a space he contemplated retorting with a sarcastic letter to the tutor. And then came the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> {{and he had to}} go home and tell his mother, with a careful suppression of details, that he was leaving Whortley, [...] "Where you have been getting on so well!" [...] cried his mother.|$|E
60|$|He was {{detained}} in London all the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> by his father's illness. Lord Ormersfield was bound {{hand and foot}} by a severe attack of rheumatism, caught almost immediately after his going to London. It seemed to have taken a strong hold of his constitution, and lingered on for weeks, {{so that he could}} barely move from his armchair by the fire, and began to give himself up as henceforth to be a crippled old man--a view out of which Louis and Sir Miles Oakstead tried by turns to laugh him; indeed, Sir Miles accused him of wanting to continue his monopoly of his son--and of that doubly-devoted attention by which Louis enlivened his convalescence.|$|E
60|$|It was {{understood}} that the House would adjourn for the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> on the 8th instant. There were therefore only two nights remaining for government business before the holidays. On {{the first of these}} (Friday, April the 3rd), Mr. O'Connell had announced that he should state his views at length on the condition of Ireland, and the causes of these agrarian outrages. Accordingly, when {{the order of the day}} for resuming the adjourned debate was read, he rose at once to propose an amendment to the motion. He sat in an unusual place--in that generally occupied by the leader of the opposition--and spoke from the red box, convenient to him from the number of documents to which he had to refer. His appearance was of great debility, and the tones of his voice were very still. His words, indeed, only reached those who were immediately around him and the ministers sitting on the other side of the green table, who listened with that interest and respectful attention which became the occasion.|$|E
6000|$|She wrote {{again and}} again to Lucy imploring her sister to come to her, urging that as {{circumstances}} now were she could not show herself at the house in Queen's Gate. To these Lucy always replied; but she did not reply by coming, and hardly made it intelligible why she did not come. Aunt Emmeline hoped, she said, that Ayala would very soon be able to be at Queen's Gate. Then there was a difficulty about the carriage. No one would walk across with her except Tom; and walking by herself was forbidden. Aunt Emmeline did not like cabs. Then there came a third or fourth letter, in which Lucy was more explanatory, but yet not sufficiently so. During the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> which would take place in the middle of April, Augusta and Mr. Traffick would be married. The happy couple were to be blessed with a divided honeymoon. The interval between Easter and Whitsuntide would require Mr. Traffick's presence in the House, and the bride with her bridegroom were to return to Queen's Gate. Then they would depart again for the second holidays, and when they were so gone Aunt Emmeline hoped that Ayala would come to them for a visit. [...] "They quite understand," [...] said Lucy, [...] "that it will not do to have you and Augusta together." ...|$|E
50|$|In Mexico, school usually ends in {{the second}} week of July and resumes the third week of August {{depending}} on what scheduling system a school uses, and whether it is high school or college. Christmas holiday is 2 weeks. Also there is the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> which lasts 2 weeks.|$|E
50|$|The conference {{started on}} 31 March 1558/9; the disputation began, and was stopped because of {{disagreement}} on rules, and was adjourned (as it turned out, permanently), on April 3 (a Monday). The timing {{coincided with the}} <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> of Parliament. It {{has been argued that}} the event was staged to discredit the Catholic position on reform, and Patrick Collinson states that the disputation was manipulated to that end. It took place in Westminster Hall.|$|E
50|$|Rooney, {{angry at}} the loss of his hangout and at the Brothers for ruining his friend's life, {{develops}} another prank with the help of Caesar, Williams and Corbett. The night before <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> the boys sneak onto the grounds and decapitate the statue of St. Basil. During an assembly the next day, Rooney presents Dunn with a duffel bag containing the missing saint's head. Brother Constance shows up, knowing he's found the vandals, and quietly orders them out of the assembly.|$|E
5000|$|When {{receiving}} The Spectator magazine's Parliamentarian of the Year {{award in}} November 2014, Mordaunt revealed {{that she had}} delivered a speech in the House of Commons just before the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> in 2013 on poultry welfare so as {{to use the word}} [...] "cock", as a forfeit for a misdemeanour during Naval Reserve training. Mordaunt used the word “cock” six times and “lay” or “laid” five times. Following her admission, she was accused by Labour MP Kate Hoey of trivialising parliament.|$|E
50|$|Brown apologised for {{a second}} time on 22 April, at the first Prime Minister's Questions {{following}} the Parliamentary <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> after Nadine Dorries asked him if he would like to take the opportunity to apologise to her. On 25 April, it was confirmed that Dorries intended to take legal action against McBride for the false allegations which had been made against her. On 7 September 2009 it was confirmed that Dorries would sue McBride and Derek Draper, and also take legal action against 10 Downing Street.|$|E
50|$|In 1777 Hely-Hutchinson became Secretary of State. When Henry Grattan in 1782 moved {{an address}} to the king {{containing}} a declaration of Irish legislative independence, Hely-Hutchinson supported the attorney-general's motion postponing the question; but on 16 April, after the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> he read a message from the Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Portland, giving the king's permission for the House to take the matter into consideration, and he expressed his personal sympathy with the popular cause which Grattan on the same day brought to a triumphant issue. Hely-Hutchinson supported the opposition on the regency question in 1788, and one of his last votes in the House was in favour of parliamentary reform. In 1790 he exchanged the constituency of Cork for that of Taghmon in County Wexford, for which borough he remained member till his death at Buxton, Derbyshire on 4 September 1794.|$|E
50|$|The post of Minister of State {{was created}} by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1977 and {{commenced}} in 1978, and under the Act a Minister of State may be delegated a power or duty of the Minister of the Government they support. The position was created to replace the post of Parliamentary Secretary, the junior rank of ministers which had existed from 1924 until 1978. In the original act of 1977 the number of Ministers of State was limited to 10, but in 1980 this was raised to 15, and in 1995 it was raised to 17, and in 2007 it was raised to 20. Brian Cowen asked all 20 Ministers of State to resign on 21 April 2009. He re-appointed a reduced number of 15 ministers the following day, when the Dáil resumed after the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To avert a {{possible}} government shutdown, the Trump administration face an April 28 deadline—the expiration of the December 10, 2016 continuing resolution (H.R. 2028) (Public Law 114-254). Discussion time on controversial {{issues such as}} funding for a border wall defunding Planned Parenthood, was limited by the two-week <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> that began on April 7. The government was shutdown during the Clinton and Obama administrations {{as a result of}} clashes between Republicans in Congress and Democrats in the White House. In late April 2017, Republicans have control of both Congress and the White House. A shutdown would result in [...] "government agencies locking their doors, national parks refusing visitors and federal workers being told not to report to work". The appropriations process cannot be accomplished without consulting the Democrats—unlike rolling back federal regulations with Congressional Review Acts and attempts to repeal Obamacare.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977, whilst at Oxford reading Theology at St Stephen's House, Oxford he re-founded the [...] "St Stephen's House Rover Crew" [...] as an {{independent}} venture, {{with the blessing of}} the then Principal, Dr David Hope (now David Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes). In 1979 he discovered that the British Boy Scouts, still existed as a single Troop in Lewisham. A former Principal of St Stephen's House, had been the Chaplain to the Lewisham Troop of the British Boy Scouts. In that year, travelling to Lewsiham during the <b>Easter</b> <b>recess,</b> he sought out Charles Brown, Chief Commissioner and Grand Scoutmaster. The Rover Crew at St Stephen's House by then had been registered with the University authorities as the Oxford University Rover Crew and was admitted as an affiliated Group to the BBS. He was made Commissioner for Oxfordshire. In 1983, when Vicar of Holy Trinity, Nottingham, Charles Brown appointed him as the Chief Commissioner. In 2000, the then Grand Scoutmaster, Ted Scott, who had joined the BBS/OWS in 1926, asked Michael Foster if he would become Grand Scoutmaster, allowing him to retire.|$|E

50|$|Journalists {{and media}} organisations have long {{expressed}} {{concern over the}} introduction of a data retention scheme. This criticism, however, reached its peak in March 2015, after the Government agreed to accept amendments to the Bill outlined in a report by the JPCIS. On 9 March, the chair of the Australian Press Council, Professor David Weisbort said that if the Bill was passed into law as it stood the field of journalism would be adversely affected as whistleblowers would no longer be willing to come forward. Alarmed by growing criticism from the media, and committed to passing the Bill before the scheduled <b>Easter</b> <b>recess</b> of both Houses of Parliament, the Government assembled a team of high-ranking public servants including national security adviser, Andrew Shearer and Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Andrew Colvin, to meet with executives from News Corporation, Fairfax, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and representatives from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) to discuss their concerns. On 16 March 2015, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed he had written to Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressing the Labor Party's concerns about the Bill's effect on the freedom of the press and journalists' ability to protect their sources, and stating that if the Government did not change the Bill to protect journalistic sources, the Labor Party would move to amend the Bill in the Senate. Following negotiations with the Labor Party, the Government agreed to amend the Bill and introduce a warrant system. Law enforcement and other agencies seeking to view the metadata of journalists can only do so where a judicial officer or a legal member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has issued a warrant. This warrant can only be granted after arguments from both the agency seeking the metadata and a public interest advocate are heard.|$|E
