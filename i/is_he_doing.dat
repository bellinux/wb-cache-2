Kipnis batted [...]455 in five games, and hit for the cycle on September 17 in the Clippers’ victory that {{clinched}} the International League title. His big game was voted {{second in the}} 2010 Fans Choice [...] "Best Game" [...] Minor League Baseball Yearly Awards. Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here?' We were teasing him, and all he does is go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ... What's that about? He goes out and hits for the cycle.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the series}} {{does not have}} many lead characters, there are many {{recurring}} characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father [...] "split the show". Shiban noted that [...] "...the boys were looking for Dad, and {{they were looking for}} a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like – 'what is Dad doing? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'" [...] They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural for the second season because of his recurring role on the series Grey's Anatomy. Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.|$|E
