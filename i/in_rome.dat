5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors.

Caligula took things a step further and had those <b>in</b> <b>Rome,</b> including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus <b>in</b> <b>Rome.</b> It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even <b>in</b> <b>Rome.</b> Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
