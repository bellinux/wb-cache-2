30|$|When <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> the Al alloy, {{the most}} intuitionistic {{criterion}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of the milling cutter is the surface quality of the workpiece, which is associated with not only the initial condition of the milling cutter, but also the wear or fracture in the machining process. Surface roughness Ra and Rz values of as-machined workpieces are both measured. It is well acknowledged that the Ra value is the most commonly-used parameter, which can fully reflect micro-geometrical features of the surface. Besides, the Rz value is also widely used for evaluating the surface quality of the Al alloy workpiece during the <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> process, since it can reflect the existence and the severity of the surface texture caused by the milling cutter to a certain extent. The surface texture is one of the critical criteria for evaluating the machining quality of many Al alloy workpieces after the <b>finish</b> <b>milling,</b> such as the mobile phone shells, and such the surface texture is mostly parallel to the feed direction. As a result, when measuring the surface roughness by the surface profilometer, the scanning direction is selected to be perpendicular to the surface texture (the feed direction), and thus the Rz value that can fully reflect the surface texture can be obtained.|$|E

40|$|In the {{generation}} process of sculptured surface machining {{by means of}} multi-axis hard <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> no absolute accuracy can be guaranteed. The relative motion of the applied ball-end milling tool is always performed with systematic deviations. These deviations are influenced especially due to the stiffness of the milling tool, pre-defined process control and disturbance parameters as well as initial environmental conditions {{with respect to the}} forecasted relative motion of the milling tool. According to the state-of-the art and the results presented in this paper, the prediction and compensation of machining induced geometrical shape errors on generated work pieces surfaces, is still an interesting research field. Representation models for describing the influence of different process control variables and disturbance factors that influence and provoke shape deviations are well known and provide sufficient accuracy. However, when considering high-precision high-speed hard <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> applications with long slender ball-end milling tools, adapting existing best practice representation models for describing conventional milling process is not holistically applicable. The reason for this issue are unbridgeable limitations of the economies of scales in modelling of chipping mechanics when considering small values for the thickness of the uncut chip. Especially in <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> of complex multi-curved sculptured surfaces the description of the work piece (material and geometrical shape) and the designed process layout provoke permanently changing engagement conditions between the work piece surface and the applied milling tool. To predict and compensate machining induced shape errors while generating complex multi-curved sculptured surfaces by multi-axis milling, unique information on the local engagement conditions between the work piece surface and the milling tool geometry is an essential initial condition. For this purpose a novel technique was introduced and verified to derive the local surface curvature radius, which corresponds to each discreet NC tool path point and the orientation of the desired local surface normal vector. By combining the ability of calculating an unique geometrical solution by the vector analysis based technique in combination of the process representation model, a surface feature based life cycle monitoring of a ball-end milling tool becomes holistically feasible. The developed technique was virtually proven by predicting and compensating process induced shape deviations on a high-speed hard <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> process layout adapted on a specific work piece geometry. At the end the general applicability of the developed technique was proven too. Like proposed before, the engagement conditions between the work piece surface and the applied milling tool geometry changed permanently multiple times during the whole surface generating operation. Local peak amplitudes were noted, which may provoke unacceptable shape deviations while the final physical milling process (not presented in this paper). To satisfy the application-related requirements for higher added value (cost reduction) and greater efficiency (capacities and resources), the developed technique was applied virtually within the process design phase in the scope of seconds, before ramping up the final physical machining process...|$|E

40|$|In milling of {{flexible}} workpieces, like axial-flow compressor impellers with thin-wall blades and deep channels, interference occurrence between workpiece and tool shaft {{is a great}} adverse issue. Even though interference avoidance plays a mandatory role in tool path generation stage, the generated tool path remains just a nominally interference-free one. This challenge is attributed {{to the fact that}} workpiece flexibility and dynamic response cannot be considered in tool path generation stage. This paper presents a strategy in process parameters planning stage, aiming to avoid the interference between tool shaft and flexible workpiece with dynamic response in milling process. The interference problem is formulated as that to evaluate the approaching extent of two surfaces, i. e., the vibrating workpiece and the swept envelope surface generated by the tool undergoing spatial motions. A metric is defined to evaluate quantitatively the approaching extent. Then, a minimax opt imization model is developed, in which the optimization objective is to maximize the metric, so as the interference-free can be guaranteed while constraints require the milling process to be stable and process parameters to fall into preferred intervals in which material removal rate is satisfactory. <b>Finish</b> <b>milling</b> of impeller using a conical cutter governed by a nominally interference-free tool path is numerically simulated to illustrate the dynamics responses of the spatially distributed nodal points on the thin-wall blade and approaching extent of the time-varying vibrating blades to the tool swept envelope surface.

By simulating the chatter stability lobes in the time-domain and analyzing the influences of different spindle speeds on the vibration amplitudes of the tool under a fixed chip-load condition, conclusions could be drawn as follows: In rough milling, higher machining efficiency can be achieved by selecting a spindle speed corresponding to the axial depth of cut in accordance with the simulated chatter stability lobes, and in <b>finish</b> <b>milling,</b> lower surface roughness can be achieved by selecting a spindle speed well beyond the resonant frequency of machining system...|$|E
40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of rough machining operations can produce significant productivity improvement in mould and die making {{because most of the}} metal is removed in the roughing stage. In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional rough milling strategy for mould core machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different tool paths. The first tool path is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of concave tool path segments, the convex hull based tool path can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second tool path is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line tool path, which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout. The large staircases left behind by these two tool paths are refined by using the third tool path which is a contour-parallel tool path that cuts the mould core layer by layer in an upward manner. After applying these three tool paths, the stock material left on the mould core surface can be post-processed by the subsequent <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> operation.

Coordinate values of point cloud distributed at a particular surface were used as a surface properties descriptor, which was fedinto SOKN where representative neurons for curvature, slope and spatial surface properties were established. On the basis of this approach, the surface patch boundaries were reorganized in such a manner that the finished machining strategies gave the best possible surface roughness results.

During the <b>finish</b> <b>milling</b> process cutting velocities of up to 400 m/min for Ti 6242 and 150 m/min for Udimet 720 LI are tested. To evaluate the different process parameters, forces are experimentally measured and the wear behavior is analyzed. Subsurface material properties are directly affecting the service performance of thermo-mechanically highly loaded parts such as aero engine components. For this purpose, surface processes subsequent to machining operations are conducted to induce a beneficial state of residual stresses. The paper on hand investigates material properties of technical surfaces that have been machined with parameter sets characterized by high cutting velocities v(ind. c) = 100 m/min to 400 m/min for Ti 6242 and v(ind. c) = 50 m/min to 150 m/min for Udimet 720 LI. Therefore, different tool geometries have been tested with regards to maximum tool life at optimized material removal rates.
