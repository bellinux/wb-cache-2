40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a summary of}} the <b>flannelboard</b> {{presentation}} on how farm people accept new ideas. It is based on the findings of 35 research studies conducted during the past 20 years {{in various parts of the}} United States, including Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New York, West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. 1 The findings of these studies are presented in a framework which will be useful to people who are faced with the problem of diffusing new ideas and practices.

40|$|A study {{examined}} two different {{methods used to}} increase story comprehension. These methods were implemented using two kindergarten classes from the Secaucus New Jersey Public School District during a 4 -week instructional period. The students from one classroom listened to stories proceeded by dramatization. Retelling techniques used were role playing, puppet theater, <b>flannelboard,</b> and pantomiming. The other sample had the same stories orally read to them, however, these were followed by teacher instruction and an art activity related to the story. Both groups were then given reduced photocopies of the main parts {{of the story and}} asked to put these sequencing strips in correct order by gluing them onto construction paper. Results indicated that those students who used dramatization had greater comprehension. Findings suggest (by a significant 21. 35 -point difference) that children who reenact a story become more emotionally involved and therefore more interested.

40|$|A {{research}} {{experiment was}} performed in the Utah State University Child Development Laboratory {{on a group of}} pre-school children consisting of ten boys and ten girls between the ages of three and four years in an attempt to discover that teaching method which will best sustain a child 2 ̆ 7 s interest while teaching a foreign language in an experimental situation. The procedure involved the evaluation of three different methods. 1) German conversation in a group utilizing audio-visual aids, 2) Group singing of a German song, and 3) Telling a story in German using a flannel board with illustrations. These three methods were performed three times each over a five-week period. The results showed that there was not statistically a significant difference. The findings did show, however, that the <b>flannelboard</b> story sustained the interest of the group best, next the singing of a German song and the least effective was conversation in German. The results did indicate that the interest of the children dropped considerably from the first to the third time that the conversation method was performed. The interest of the children increased considerably from the first to the third time that the singing of a German Bong was performed. The interest of the children appeared to stay about the same over the three times that the flannel-board story was performed. Femininity and masculinity appear to influence the responses of children to a language-learning situation. That method which will best sustain children 2 ̆ 7 s interest in a language-learning situation appears to be dependent on where the children are in their familiarity with the language...|$|E
40|$|Problem [...] The {{development}} of diabetes produces {{a state of}} shock for the child and his or her family. The single most important factor in coping with both the physical and emotional impact of diabetes is education. Only when there is a clear understanding {{on the part of the}} child and the family of what diabetes is, how it can be managed, how to prevent emergencies, and how to cope with complications should they arise, will these feelings begin to be resolved. There are very limited educational materials available to help the pre-school to elementary age children with diabetes understand their disease. Main Procedure [...] A support group for families who have children with diabetes was developed. The objectives were formulated in relationship to the needs of the support group. The following materials were created to help the children understand about their disease: 1. A <b>flannelboard</b> explanation of diabetes was used to help the children understand diabetes. 2. A green puppet to sing and talk to the children about the problems of being different and how to say no without calling attention to oneself was created. 3. A homemade robot was made that could turn a negative message into a positive one. A discussion of what's good about today and the importance of having a positive attitude followed. 4. A game called Diabetes Challenge was created. The game called for the recognition of foods and their exchange areas and also asked challenging questions about diabetes. 5. Containers from three fast-food restaurants were used with food exchanges marked on them so children could select wisest choices for their meal plan. 6. Marionettes and stick puppets were created to perform the puppet show "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" and then the sequel "The Girl 'Who Cried Reaction". The sequel was written by the researcher in an attempt to illustrate the importance of being believed. 7. A school booklet was developed for families to inform their schools about diabetes. 8. A video tape was created to be used by parents to inform their school about diabetes. Understanding diabetes and learning to care for it well is an ongoing task. Diabetes in a child is a way of life. It involves the whole family and all those outside the family that are caring for the child. It is the writer's hope that this project will be utilized as a resource for presenting important information to children who have diabetes.
