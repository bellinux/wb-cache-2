40|$|The <b>human</b> <b>B-lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> (HBLV), ' {{recently}} {{isolated from}} the peripheral blood of six patients affected by various hematological disorders (1), was shown by detailed molecular and morphological characterizations to be a unique member of the Herpesviridae family (2, 3). HBLV is an enveloped virus, 200 nm in diameter, with an electron-dense icosahedral core composed of 162 capsomers (1, 3) containing a large double-stranded DNA genome (> 110. 000 bp). As {{a result of these}} observations, the taxonomic designation human herpesvirus- 6 (HHV- 6) was proposed (4, 5). Despite extensive seroepidemiological studies and attempts to obtain HBLV isolates from diversified patients, no definite etiological association with human disease has been established to date. HBLV can infect fresh normal mononuclear cells in vitro, yielding characteristic morphologically altered lymphocytes, capable of surviving in culture for 15 - 20 d. Based primarily on the study of freshly isolated cells from infected patients, a B lymphocyte tropism was initially suggested for HBLV (1). However, subsequent in vitro studies demonstrated that HBLV could also infect cell line...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the cellular tropism of <b>human</b> <b>B-lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> (HBLV) (also designated Human Herpesvirus- 6) in vitro by infecting fresh MN cells from normal human adult peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, tonsil, and thymus. Cultures {{from all the}} sources examined contained infectable cells, {{as shown by the}} appearance of characteristic enlarged, round-shaped, short-lived cells expressing HBLV-specific markers. Detailed immunological analysis demonstrated {{that the vast majority of}} these cells expressed T cell-associated antigens (i. e., CD 7, CD 5, CD 2, CD 4, and to a lesser extent, CD 8). The CD 3 antigen and the TCR-alpha/beta heterodimer were not detectable on the surface membrane, but were identified within the cytoplasm of HBLV- infected cells, by both immunofluorescence and radioimmunoprecipitation assay. A proportion of the HBLV-infected cell population also expressed the CD 15 and class II MHC DR antigens. By means of immunoselection procedures it was possible to show that a consistent proportion of HBLV- infectable cells were contained within the CD 3 -depleted immature T cell population, while the depletion of CD 2 + cells completely abrogated the infectability of the cultures. Northern blot analysis confirmed the T cell origin of HBLV-infected cells, demonstrating the expression of full size TCR-alpha and -beta chain mRNA. In addition to fresh T cells, HBLV was able to infect normal T lymphocytes expanded in vitro with IL- 2 for greater than 30 d. These results indicate that HBLV is selectively T cell tropic in the course of the in vitro infection of normal mononuclear cells and may therefore be directly involved in the pathogenesis of T cell related hematological disorders. In particular, in light of the cytopathic effect exerted in vitro on CD 4 + T lymphocytes, a possible role of HBLV in immune deficiency conditions should be considered...|$|E

40|$|Peripheral {{blood from}} {{patients}} with a novel tropical splenic lymphoma, characterized by splenomegaly and circulating naive CD 5 -negative villous B lymphocytes, has been screened for evidence of an association with the <b>B-lymphotropic</b> <b>viruses,</b> Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV 8). No increased prevalence of EBV, HCV and HHV 8 was demonstrated using serological and molecular techniques, compared with a geographical, age-matched control group. However, lymphoma patients had markedly raised EBV antibody levels without a concomitant increase {{in the rate of}} detection of viral genomes in the peripheral blood. This phenomenon also occurred in patients with hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly, a condition that occurs in the same geographical area and that is clinically indistinguishable from tropical splenic lymphoma, adding further weight to the suggestion that there may be an aetiological association between these two disorders...|$|R
40|$|Kaposi sarcoma–associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) is a <b>B-lymphotropic</b> <b>virus</b> {{whose primary}} site of replication is the oropharynx. KSHV can infect both T and B cells from primary tonsillar explant cultures. However, T cells {{do not support}} lytic replication, while B cells spontaneously produce substantial amounts of infectious virus. Here, we provide evidence for a mechanism by which activated T cells may promote or stabilize latency of KSHV infection in B cells. When mixed cultures of B cells and activated T cells were exposed to KSHV, little spontaneous virus production was observed. Removing T cells from the mix or treating the mixed culture with immune suppressants enhanced virus production. Adding back activated T cells to purified infected B cells efficiently suppressed KSHV production, primarily due to CD 4 + T cells. This suppressive activity required T cell activation and direct cell-cell contact, but not prior exposure to KSHV antigen. Suppression was not MHC restricted and {{did not result in}} killing of the target cell. We therefore propose that oropharyngeal T cells activated by a variety of stimuli can recognize ligands on infected target B cells, leading to signaling events that prevent spontaneous lytic activation and promote latent infection in this compartment...|$|R

40|$|The {{association}} of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with nasopharyngeal carcinoma {{is supported by}} the presence of EBV genomes in the epithelial elements of the tumor and by elevated antibody titers to EBV-specific antigens in the patients; the levels of these titers are related to the clinical course of the disease. However, since most laboratory data suggest that EBV is a <b>B-lymphotropic</b> <b>virus,</b> it is unclear how the virus becomes associated with the epithelial elements of the nasopharynx. The purpose of the present work was to find a human model system to study this association. A human epithelial line (U) was found that could be directly infected by EBV, and viral functions, the induction of EBV nuclear antigen and cellular DNA synthesis, were demonstrated. The U line was established in 1957 by the late H. J. Van Kooten (Kok-Doorschodt at the University of Utrecht), and although it is no longer diploid, it exhibits density inhibition. When U cells were infected with EBV, EBV nuclear antigen was expressed in 6 to 16 % of the cells, 1 and 2 days after infection with B 95 - 8 virus, but not with the P 3 HR- 1 strain. No evidence for virus replication was obtained; immunofluorescence staining for early antigens and virus capsid antigens gave negative results. Quantitative adsorption experiments for EBV indicated that the adsorption capacity of U cells is significant (60 % of Raji cells). The present results also demonstrated that infection with the virus overcomes block(s) in cellular DNA synthesis caused by 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine. The induction of DNA synthesis was determined by increased incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into the cells. The highest level of isotope incorporation was observed at about 15 h after infection and thereafter decreased. Analysis of the induced DNA indicated that it was of cellular origin...|$|R
40|$|X-linked {{lymphoproliferative}} disease (XLP) {{is a primary}} immunodeficiency caused by mutations in SH 2 D 1 A which encodes SAP. SAP functions in signalling pathways elicited by the SLAM family of leukocyte receptors. A defining feature of XLP is exquisite sensitivity to infection with EBV, a <b>B-lymphotropic</b> <b>virus,</b> but not other viruses. Although previous studies have identified defects in lymphocytes from XLP patients, the unique role of SAP in controlling EBV infection remains unresolved. We describe a novel approach to this question using female XLP carriers who, due to random X-inactivation, contain both SAP + and SAP - cells. This represents the human equivalent of a mixed bone marrow chimera in mice. While memory CD 8 + T cells specific for CMV and influenza were distributed across SAP + and SAP - populations, EBV-specific cells were exclusively SAP +. The preferential recruitment of SAP + cells by EBV reflected the tropism of EBV for B cells, and the requirement for SAP expression in CD 8 + T cells for them to respond to Ag-presentation by B cells, but not other cell types. The inability of SAP - clones to respond to Ag-presenting B cells was overcome by blocking the SLAM receptors NTB-A and 2 B 4, while ectopic expression of NTB-A on fibroblasts inhibited cytotoxicity of SAP - CD 8 + T cells, thereby demonstrating that SLAM receptors acquire inhibitory function {{in the absence of}} SAP. The innovative XLP carrier model allowed us to unravel the mechanisms underlying the unique susceptibility of XLP patients to EBV infection {{in the absence of a}} relevant animal model. We found that this reflected the nature of the Ag-presenting cell, rather than EBV itself. Our data also identified a pathological signalling pathway that could be targeted to treat patients with severe EBV infection. This system may allow the study of other human diseases where heterozygous gene expression from random X-chromosome inactivation can be exploited...|$|R
40|$|Summary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is {{associated}} with around one-third of cases, but young adult cases are rarely EBV associated. In this study, known oncogenic DNA viruses, including human adenoviruses, papovaviruses and the human herpesviruses- 6 (HHV- 6) and- 8 (HHV- 8) were not detected in Hodgkin's disease lesions. These results suggest that an as yet unidentified infectious agent {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of non-EBV-associated Hodgkin's disease. Keywords: Hodgkin's disease; adenovirus; papovavirus; herpesvirus; Southern blot; polymerase chain reaction There is substantial evidence linking Hodgkin's disease (HD) with the <b>B-lymphotropic</b> herpesvirus Epstein-Barr <b>virus</b> (EBV).

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{is a human}} {{herpesvirus}} that {{establishes a}} lifelong latent infection of B cells. Within the immune system, apoptosis is a central mechanism in normal lymphocyte homeostasis both during early lymphocyte development {{and in response to}} antigenic stimuli. In this study, we found that latent membrane protein 2 A (LMP 2 A) inhibited B-cell receptor (BCR) -induced apoptosis in Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines. Genistein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine-specific protein kinases, blocked BCR-induced apoptosis and EBV reactivation in the cells. These findings indicate that LMP 2 A blocks BCR-induced cell apoptosis and EBV reactivation through the inhibition of activation of tyrosine kinases by BCR cross-linking. The <b>B-lymphotropic</b> herpesvirus Epstein-Barr <b>virus</b> (EBV) is a ubiquitous human virus (21, 37) that establishes a lifelong persistent infection in memory B lymphocytes (2). It is an important pathogen because of its association with the devel-opment of various lymphoid and epithelioid malignancies (21, 29). Whereas primary infection by EBV is usually asymptomatic during childhood, delayed primary infection can manifest itsel...|$|R
40|$|The <b>B-lymphotropic</b> Epstein-Barr <b>virus</b> (EBV) encodes two isoforms of latent {{membrane}} protein 2 (LMP 2), LMP 2 A and LMP 2 B, which are expressed during latency in B cells. The function of LMP 2 B is largely unknown, whereas LMP 2 A blocks B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling transduction and induction of lytic EBV infection, thereby promoting B-cell survival. Transfection experiments on LMP 2 B in EBV-negative B cells and the silencing of LMP 2 B in EBV-harboring Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Akata cells suggest that LMP 2 B {{interferes with the}} function of LMP 2 A, but the role of LMP 2 B {{in the presence of}} functional EBV has not been established. Here, LMP 2 B, LMP 2 A, or both were overexpressed in EBV-harboring Akata cells to study the function of LMP 2 B. The overexpression of LMP 2 B increased the magnitude of EBV switching from its latent to its lytic form upon BCR cross-linking, as indicated by a more-enhanced upregulation and expression of EBV lytic genes and significantly increased production of transforming EBV compared to Akata vector control cells or LMP 2 A-overexpressing cells. Moreover, LMP 2 B lowered the degree of BCR cross-linking required to induce lytic EBV infection. Finally, LMP 2 B colocalized with LMP 2 A as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence and restored calcium mobilization upon BCR cross-linking, a signaling process inhibited by LMP 2 A. Thus, our findings suggest that LMP 2 B negatively regulates the function of LMP 2 A in preventing the switch from latent to lytic EBV replication...|$|R
40|$|Viruses that {{naturally}} infect cells expressing both MHC I and MHC II molecules render themselves potentially visible to both CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells through the de novo expression of viral antigens. Here we use one such pathogen, the <b>B-lymphotropic</b> Epstein-Barr <b>virus</b> (EBV), {{to examine the}} kinetics of these processes in the virally-infected cell, comparing newly synthesised polypeptides versus the mature protein pool as viral antigen sources for MHC I- and MHC II-restricted presentation. EBV-transformed B cell lines were established in which the expression of two cognate EBV antigens, EBNA 1 and EBNA 3 B, could be induced and then completely suppressed by doxycycline-regulation. These cells were used as targets for CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cell clones {{to a range of}} EBNA 1 and EBNA 3 B epitopes. For both antigens, when synthesis was induced, CD 8 epitope display rose quickly to near maximum within 24 h, well before steady state levels of mature protein had been reached, whereas CD 4 epitope presentation was delayed by 36 – 48 h and rose only slowly thereafter. When antigen expression was suppressed, despite the persistence of mature protein, CD 8 epitope display fell rapidly at rates similar to that seen for the MHC I/epitope half-life in peptide pulse-chase experiments. By contrast, CD 4 epitope display persisted for many days and, following peptide stripping, recovered well on cells in the absence of new antigen synthesis. We infer that, in virally-infected MHC I/II-positive cells, newly-synthesised polypeptides are the dominant source of antigen feeding the MHC I pathway, whereas the MHC II pathway is fed by the mature protein pool. Hence, newly-infected cells are rapidl...|$|R
40|$|Herpesvirus papio (HVP) is a <b>B-lymphotropic</b> baboon <b>virus</b> with an {{estimated}} 40 % homology to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We have cloned and sequenced ori-Lyt of herpesvirus papio and found a striking degree of nucleotide homology (89 %) with ori-Lyt of EBV. Transcriptional elements form {{an integral part of}} EBV ori-Lyt. The promoter and enhancer domains of EBV ori-Lyt are conserved in herpesvirus papio. The EBV ori-Lyt promoter contains four binding sites for the EBV lytic cycle transactivator Zta, and the enhancer includes one Zta and two Rta response elements. All five of the Zta response elements and one of the Rta motifs are conserved in HVP ori-Lyt, and the HVP DS-L leftward promoter and the enhancer were activated in transient transfection assays by the EBV Zta and Rta transactivators. The EBV ori-Lyt enhancer contains a palindromic sequence, GGTCAGCTGACC, centered on a PvuII restriction site. This sequence, with a single base change, is also present in the HVP ori-Lyt enhancer. DNase I footprinting demonstrated that the PvuII sequence was bound by a protein present in a Raji nuclear extract. Mobility shift and competition assays using oligonucleotide probes identified this sequence as a binding site for the cellular transcription factor MLTF. Mutagenesis of the binding site indicated that MLTF contributes significantly to the constitutive activity of the ori-Lyt enhancer. The high degree of conservation of cis-acting signal sequences in HVP ori-Lyt was further emphasized by the finding that an HVP ori-Lyt-containing plasmid was replicated in Vero cells by a set of cotransfected EBV replication genes. The central domain of EBV ori-Lyt contains two related AT-rich palindromes, one of which is partially duplicated in the HVP sequence. The AT-rich palindromes are functionally important cis-acting motifs. Deletion of these palindromes severely diminished replication of an ori-Lyt target plasmid...|$|R
40|$|B-lymphotropic herpesviruses {{naturally}} infecting Old World primates share biologic, epidemiologic, pathogenic, {{and molecular}} features {{with the human}} pathogen Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These related gammaherpesviruses have colinear genomes with considerable nucleotide homology. The replicative cycle genes share {{a high degree of}} homology across species, whereas the transformation-associated EBV latent genes appear to be much more divergent. For example, the EBV BamHI Nhet fragment, which encodes {{all or part of the}} EBV latent infection membrane proteins, cross-hybridizes poorly to DNA from nonhuman primate B-lymphotropic herpesviruses. A viral DNA fragment corresponding to this region of the EBV genome was isolated from the baboon B-lymphotropic herpesvirus, herpesvirus papio, and used to clone a herpesvirus papio cDNA corresponding to EBV LMP 2 A. At least three tyrosine kinase interaction motifs are conserved despite significant amino acid divergence of the herpesvirus papio LMP 2 A first exon from the EBV homolog. Functionally, the herpesvirus papio LMP 2 A is tyrosine phosphorylated and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cell proteins similar to EBV LMP 2 A. The 12 hydrophobic LMP 2 transmembrane domains are well conserved. Two CBP (Jk) binding sites important for EBNA- 2 -induced transactivation of the LMP 2 A promoter are also present in the herpesvirus papio LMP 2 A promoter, and the simian LMP 2 A promoter is also responsive to EBV EBNA- 2 -induced transactivation in human B cells. Thus, transcriptional regulation, splicing, kinase interaction sites, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the LMP 2 A homologs have been conserved despite significant sequences heterogeneity in the preterminal repeat regions of these human and nonhuman primate EBVs. The conservation of the LMP 2 gene, despite its apparent nonessential role for in vitro EBV infection, suggests an important role for LMP 2 A in vivo. The similarities between these <b>human</b> and simian <b>B-lymphotropic</b> herpesviruses, and the LMP 2 genes in particular, suggest that the function of LMP 2 in vivo could be addressed by using recombinant LMP 2 A-mutant simian viruses and experimental infection of Old World primates...|$|R
