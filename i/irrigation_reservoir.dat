40|$|Understanding the {{environmental}} factors that regulate fish recruitment {{is essential for}} effective management of fisheries. Generally, first-year survival, and therefore recruitment, is inherently less consistent in systems with high intra- and interannual variability. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs</b> display sporadic patterns of annual drawdown, which can pose a substantial challenge to recruitment of fishes. We developed species-specific models using an 18 -year data set compiled from {{state and federal agencies}} to investigate variables that regulate the recruitment of walleye Sander vitreus and white bass Morone chrysops in <b>irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in south-west Nebraska, USA. The candidate model set for walleye included only abiotic variables (water-level elevation, minimum daily air temperature during winter prior to hatching, annual precipitation, spring warming rate and May reservoir discharge), and the candidate model set for white bass included primarily biotic variables (catch per unit effort (CPUE) of black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, CPUE of age- 0 walleye, CPUE of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and CPUE of age- 3 and older white bass), each of which had a greater relative importance than the single abiotic variable (minimum daily air temperature during winter after hatching). Our findings improve the understanding of the recruitment of fishes in <b>irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and the relative roles of abiotic and biotic factors...|$|R

40|$|Recruitment of walleye (Sander vitreus Mitchill) {{is limited}} in <b>irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of the Republican River basin in southwestern Nebraska. The causal {{mechanism}} for this limited recruitment is unknown, but {{may be related to}} a lack of suitable spawning habitat. Patch occupancy models were developed to describe variation in detection probability and habitat selection during spawning season using shoreline electrofishing data. Detection of adult walleye was negatively affected by water temperature, silt substrate, and woody cover. Adult walleye selected sites with cooler water temperatures and greater fetch at Enders Reservoir, and large rock substrate and no cover at Hugh Butler Lake; these characteristics are limited to areas on or near the riprap dams in both reservoirs. Walleye eggs were also only found in these areas. We conclude that patch occupancy modeling provided valuable information when considering habitat improvement projects and propose a management approach for the addition of walleye spawning habitat in <b>irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Phytoplankton primary {{productivity}} of eleven <b>irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs</b> located in five river basins in Sri Lanka was determined {{on a single}} occasion together with light climate and nutrient concentrations. Although area-based gross {{primary productivity}} (1. 43 – 11. 65 g O 2 m− 2 d− 1) falls within the range already established for tropical water bodies, net daily rate was negative in three water bodies. Light-saturated optimum rates were found in water bodies, with relatively high algal biomass, but photosynthetic efficiency or specific rates were higher in water bodies with low algal biomass, indicating nutrient limitation or physiological adaptation of phytoplankton. Concentrations of micronutrients and algal biomass in the reservoirs are largely altered by high flushing rate resulting from irrigation release. Underwater light climate and nutrient availability control the rate of photosynthesis and subsequent areabased primary production to a great extent. However, morpho-edephic index or euphotic algal biomass in the most productive stratum of the water column {{is not a good}} predictor of photosynthetic capacity or daily rate of primary production of these shallow tropical <b>irrigation</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> <br /...|$|R
