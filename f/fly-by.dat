5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a <b>fly-by</b> of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, Venera 1 {{became the first}} planetary probe. It revealed {{the presence of the}} solar wind and performed the first <b>fly-by</b> of the planet Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the Mariner 2 <b>fly-by</b> of Venus in 1962. The first {{spacecraft to}} perform a <b>fly-by</b> of Mars was Mariner 4, which reached the planet in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth. In August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|Neptune {{differs from}} Uranus in its typical level of {{meteorological}} activity. Voyager 2 observed weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby, but no comparable phenomena on Uranus during its 1986 <b>fly-by.</b>|$|E
5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were <b>fly-by</b> missions. These missions {{were able to}} photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, and even then from considerable distances. The Deep Impact mission {{was the first to}} eject material from a comet's surface, and the mission garnered large publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers.|$|E

5|$|Since Voyager 2s <b>fly-by,</b> the {{brightest}} rings (Adams and Le Verrier) have been imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope and Earth-based telescopes, owing to advances in resolution and light-gathering power. They are visible, slightly above background noise levels, at methane-absorbed wavelengths {{in which the}} glare from Neptune is significantly reduced. The fainter rings are still far below the visibility threshold.|$|E
5|$|Following his Navy service {{he worked}} at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) until 1986 as an {{engineering}} contractor for Allied Bendix Aerospace working on the Deep Space Network project, as well as on several spacecraft projects. During the 1986 Voyager 2 <b>fly-by</b> of Uranus, he worked with the Radio Science Experiment, using the spacecraft carrier signal to deduce information about Uranus’ atmosphere and rings.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus' sub-surface ocean floor. In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close <b>fly-by</b> of Enceladus' south pole, flying within 48.3km (30mi) of the surface, {{as well as through}} a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential oasis of habitability.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 1997, the NEAR Shoemaker {{spacecraft}} passed within 1,212km of Mathilde while {{moving at}} a velocity of 9.93km/s. This close approach allowed the spacecraft to capture over 500 images of the surface, and provided data for more accurate determinations of the asteroid's dimensions and mass (based on gravitational perturbation of the spacecraft). However, only one hemisphere of Mathilde was imaged during the <b>fly-by.</b> This was only the third asteroid to be imaged from a nearby distance, following 951 Gaspra and 243 Ida.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{beyond the}} manned lunar landings, NASA {{investigated}} several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (Apollo X,) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using {{the space in}} the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop {{to be built in}} orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the Apollo Telescope Mount, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus <b>fly-by</b> mission.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought {{he had seen a}} ring around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager <b>fly-by,</b> it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E

5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter <b>fly-by</b> mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{proposal}} for an asteroid mission was submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA). Named the Asteroidal Gravity Optical and Radar Analysis (AGORA), this spacecraft was to launch some time in 1990–1994 and perform two flybys of large asteroids. The preferred target for this mission was Vesta. AGORA would reach the asteroid belt either by a gravitational slingshot trajectory past Mars or {{by means of a}} small ion engine. However, the proposal was refused by the ESA. A joint NASA–ESA asteroid mission was then drawn up for a Multiple Asteroid Orbiter with Solar Electric Propulsion (MAOSEP), with one of the mission profiles including an orbit of Vesta. NASA indicated they were not interested in an asteroid mission. Instead, the ESA set up a technological study of a spacecraft with an ion drive. Other missions to the asteroid belt were proposed in the 1980s by France, Germany, Italy and the United States, but none were approved. Exploration of Vesta by <b>fly-by</b> and impacting penetrator was the second main target of the first plan of the multi-aimed Soviet Vesta mission, developed in cooperation with European countries for realisation in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding.|$|E
25|$|In September 1979, Pioneer 11, {{the first}} space probe to conduct <b>fly-by</b> {{observations}} of Saturn and its moons, sent data showing Titan's surface {{to be extremely}} cold by Earth standards, and much below the temperatures generally associated with planetary habitability.|$|E

25|$|After the <b>fly-by</b> of Saturn, {{the camera}} {{platform}} of Voyager 2 locked up briefly, putting plans to officially extend {{the mission to}} Uranus and Neptune in jeopardy. The mission's engineers were able {{to fix the problem}} (caused by an overuse that temporarily depleted its lubricant), and the Voyager 2 probe was given the go-ahead to explore the Uranian system.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Voyager 1 made a <b>fly-by</b> of Saturn {{that showed}} the F-ring to be {{composed}} of three narrow rings {{that appeared to be}} braided in a complex structure; it is now known that the outer two rings consist of knobs, kinks and lumps that give the illusion of braiding, with the less bright third ring lying inside them.|$|E
