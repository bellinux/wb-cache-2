They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards.

5000|$|Darrell Waltrip of Fox Sports {{said that}} he [...] "didn't see {{anything}} wrong with what happened. Matt needed to win that race to have any chance to advance to the next Chase round. True, Joey had already punched his ticket to the next round two weeks ago winning at Charlotte. Sure he could have played it safe, backed off and finished second to Matt but why back off? He had a fast race car. The kid is paid to win races for his sponsors, owner and team, plus don't lose sight of this: If he backs off and lets Matt win, then he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Matt and his extremely fast Toyota in the next round of the Chase.

5000|$|In the 1940s, Accardo {{continued}} to gain {{power in the}} Outfit. As the 1940s progressed, it became evident {{that a number of}} Outfit bosses and members were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> serious consequences for their parts in the extortion of the Hollywood movie industry's unions. However, because Nitti was claustrophobic, he was fearful of serving a second prison term, the first for tax evasion. So, Nitti committed suicide in 1943. Paul [...] "The Waiter" [...] Ricca, who had been the de facto boss since Capone's imprisonment, became the boss in name as well as in fact and named Accardo as underboss. Ricca and Accardo would run the Outfit either officially or as the powers behind the throne for the next 30 years, until Ricca's death in 1972. When Ricca subsequently received a 10-year prison sentence for his part in the Hollywood scandal, Accardo became acting boss. Three years later, as a parole condition, Ricca was barred from contact with mobsters. Accardo then became boss of the Outfit. In practice, he shared power with Ricca, who remained in the background as a senior consultant.|$|E

40|$|Exhibited in the Library East Commons Exhibition Gallery spring {{semester}} 2009. Resulted from Dr. Allison Whitney's poster assignment for ENGL 1102 - English Composition II - Science Fiction – Image, Sound, Text, an undergraduate course {{offered in the}} School of Literature, Communication and Culture (LCC). My poster has three main pictures or elements in it. They are an outline of the continent of Africa, {{a picture of a}} soldier carrying another soldier over his back, and a picture of a crashed helicopter. The outline of Africa was chosen to show where this movie takes place. The picture of the soldier carrying the other soldier was added to go along with line "Leave no man behind". It is an example of what the soldier has to do bring he fellow comrade to safety. At the bottom of the poster a picture of a crashed or shot down helicopter was added to correlate with the title of the movie, Black Hawk Down. The helicopter is a black hawk helicopter and it is "downed" or damaged. The colors chosen for the poster also have a reason behind it. Like the original Black Hawk Down poster the orange or brown color was used a lot. The whole poster was given an orange tint over it to represent the desert/dirt of Africa, and also to blend the pictures together. The color of the title was also kept similar to the original poster, because red can represent blood and blood occurs some much in the movie. The main elements relate to the theme of how air technology, although usually great, can be damaging to the one who uses it. The helicopters give the soldiers a sense of extra protection. They can move quickly with them and while the soldiers are on the ground they have protection in the air that can see more than they can. Especially in Africa, where most countries don’t have any military strength that can threaten that of the United States', one would think that with helicopters, the militants in Africa don’t stand a chance. The outline of Africa on the poster tells the audience not only where the movie occurs, but who the army is up against. They are usually untrained civilians sometimes children that have guns and not much else in terms of military technology. The crashed helicopter in the poster represents the problems that the army is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face.</b> First, they probably didn’t think {{that was going to happen}} and now they have to go save the soldiers and pilots that were in the helicopter, which is presented in the line, "Leave no man behind". The picture of the soldier carrying another soldiers shows that they have a mission to rescue the crashed soldiers. They have to carry them out, because they cannot use another helicopter in fear of another one getting shot down...|$|E
