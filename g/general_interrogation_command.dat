40|$|Abstract: A new {{wireless}} sensing network {{paradigm is}} presented for structural monitoring applications. In this approach, both power and data <b>interrogation</b> <b>commands</b> are conveyed via a mobile-agent that {{is sent to}} sensor nodes to perform intended interrogations, which can alleviate several limitations of the traditional sensing networks. Furthermore, the mobile-agent provides computation power to make near real-time assessments on the structural conditions. This paper will discuss such prototype systems, which are used to interrogate impedance-based sensors for structural health monitoring applications. Our wireless sensor node is specifically designed to accept various energy sources, including wireless energy transmission, and to be wirelessly triggered on an as-needed basis by the mobile-agent or other sensor nodes. The capabilities of this proposed sensing network paradigm are demonstrated in the laboratory and the field...|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{networking}} is {{an important}} first-line component in any structural health monitoring (SHM) application. We present how an interdisciplinary team of structural, mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers are tackling a large-scale civil infrastructure SHM application by proposing a new variant on sensor networking. Most sensor arrays are typically interrogated via conventional wired networks, which require centralized processing and powering. Conversely, recent technology advances in embedded architectures and power harvesting have allowed wireless networks to be developed, where each individual sensor is individually powered and communicates with neighboring sensors or substations via hopping protocols. This work will present a hybrid approach to sensor array interrogation, where both power and data <b>interrogation</b> <b>commands</b> are conveyed via an autonomous aerial vehicle that is sent (via remote piloting or GPS autopilot programming) to each sensor or node to perform the individual interrogation. Power {{does not have to}} reside at the sensor node, relaxing battery or other such powering requirements. This work will discuss such a prototype system, which will be used to interrogate impedancebased and capacitive-based preload sensors on a full-scale bridge...|$|R
2500|$|Jordan {{asserted}} he was {{a scapegoat}} [...] "because he is a reservist, is considered expendable". [...] It was his belief that interrogation procedures were the responsibility of Colonel Thomas Pappas, the intelligence brigade commander and highest-ranking officer at Abu Ghraib, and Captain Carolyn Wood, leader of a unit within the interrogation center called the <b>Interrogation</b> <b>Command</b> Element. [...] Neither of these two officers has been charged, although Pappas was fined $8,000 for approving the use of dogs during an interrogation without higher approval. [...] During the trial, witnesses for the prosecution appeared to support some of Jordan's claims. Pappas testified that Jordan's responsibilities involved {{improving the quality of}} life for soldiers at the base and [...] "improving the flow of intelligence information". [...] He admitted that he advised Jordan to [...] "let the experienced interrogators run the interrogations." [...] Pappas also testified that Jordan was not in charge of the military police who ran the prison and who were responsible for some of the abuses. He further stipulated that military police were in charge of the November 24, 2003 weapons search which he had personally observed, and found no issues with. [...] Other soldiers testified that Jordan was not present during any of the abuses.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{argues that}} the {{representation}} of pain in Beckett’s writing exposes the paradox in his work concerning {{the relationship of the}} individual suffering subject and the community. Making reference to studies of pain and literature generally and to salient studies of Beckett, the essay shows how the narration of pain in Beckett’s prose works in particular is closely linked to its more <b>general</b> <b>interrogation</b> of subject-object relations. As the preeminent agent, source as well as repository of pain, writing in Beckett itself comes to occupy, in a transpositional manner, the poles of subject, object and work. If ‘pain’ names the subject-object continuum (and thus a community of subject and object), that very conjunction exposes the co-habitants to their own mutual espacement – qua subject and object. The common feeling (of pain, of pains at each of the poles) is countermanded in advance by separation. The conjunction gives rise to a sapping, devastating and agonising attempt to conjure an image (of and as the object), an image which holds out the possibility of the felicity, or at least palliation, offered by community (and the work). The image is, however, both a wounding regime (which impedes utterance) and a generative regime (in that the thwarting of utterance restores the compulsion to continue to attempt to conjure the image through writing). The two components, pain and community, are illustrated with specific reference to Texts for Nothing, through an analysis of which a new conjuncture of the themes of pain, community {{and the role of the}} work of art is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{reproductive}} technologies – {{in particular}} in genetic screening and selection – have occasioned renewed interest in the moral justifiability {{of the reasons that}} motivate the decision to have a child. The capacity to select for desired blood and tissue compatibilities has led to the much discussed ‘saviour sibling’ cases in which parents seek to ‘have one child to save another’. Heightened interest in procreative reasons is to be welcomed, since it prompts a more <b>general</b> philosophical <b>interrogation</b> of the grounds for moral appraisal of reasons-to-parent, and {{of the extent to which}} such reasons are relevant to the moral assessment of procreation itself. I start by rejecting the idea that we can use a distinction between ‘other-regarding’ and ‘future-child-regarding’ reasons as a basis on which to distinguish good from bad procreative reasons. I then offer and evaluate three potential grounds for elucidating and establishing a relationship between procreative motivation and the rightness/wrongness of procreative conduct: the predictiveness, the verdictiveness, and the expressiveness of procreative reasons. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This report {{explains}} the Twiddler's syndrome, a well known human entity, in a canine model. We also describe a modified technique to implant internal cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) in dogs to prevent Twiddler's syndrome. Our original {{study was to}} identify the factors influencing the DFT measurement and a canine model was selected as it is the best proven electrophysiological model. During the course of the study, one of the dogs was evaluated for device failure at three weeks following implantation. While under <b>general</b> anesthesia, <b>interrogation</b> of the dog's ICD showed that the right ventricular (RV) pacing threshold was high and ventricular capture was intermittent. When examined under fluoroscopy, it was noted that the defibrillator lead was dislodged from the right ventricular apex. A surgical revision of the device pocket showed that the leads were twisted in an almost braided fashion- as if "twiddled" into position around the device [Figure 1 (arrow) ]. We suspect that this "twiddling " resulted in shortening and pulling of the lead from the ventricular myocardium causing intermittent capture and device failure...|$|R

Friedman finds that while Capra's ideas were popular with depression-era and prewar audiences, they became less relevant to a prospering post-war America. Capra had become [...] "disconnected from an American culture that had changed" [...] during the previous decade. Biographer Joseph McBride argues that Capra's disillusionment was more related to the negative effect that the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) had on the film industry in <b>general.</b> The HUAC <b>interrogations</b> in the early 1950s ended many Hollywood careers. Capra himself was not called to testify, although he was a prime target of the committee due to his past associations with many Hollywood blacklisted screenwriters.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{implementing}} a damage detection strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure {{is referred to}} as structural health monitoring (SHM). The authors' approach is to address the SHM problem {{in the context of a}} statistical pattern recognition paradigm. In this paradigm, the process can be broken down into four parts: (1) Operational Evaluation, (2) Data Acquisition and Cleansing, (3) Feature Extraction and Data Compression, and (4) Statistical Model Development for Feature Discrimination. These processes must be implemented through hardware or software and, in general, some combination of these two approaches will be used. This paper will discuss each portion of the SHM process with particular emphasis on the coupling of a <b>general</b> purpose data <b>interrogation</b> software package for structural health monitoring with a modular wireless sensing and processing platform. More specifically, this paper will address the need to take an integrated hardware/software approach to developing SHM solutions...|$|R

At first, a survey of voice recognition and synthesis technology was undertaken to develop a working knowledge base.

The potential voice recognition applications fell into five <b>general</b> categories: programming, <b>interrogation,</b> data entry, switch and mode selection, and continuous/time-critical action control. The ratings of the first three categories showed the most promise of being beneficial to flight deck operations. Possible applications of voice synthesis systems were categorized as automatic or pilot selectable and many were rated as being potentially beneficial. In addition, voice system implementation guidelines and pertinent performance criteria are proposed. Finally, {{the findings of this study}} are compared with those made in a recent NASA study of a 1995 transport concept...|$|R

40|$|Pilots' use of and {{responses}} to a traffic alert and collision-avoidance system (TCAS 2) in simulated air carrier line operations are discribed in Volume 1. TCAS 2 monitors the positions of nearby aircraft by means of transponder <b>interrogation,</b> and it <b>commands</b> a climb or descent which conflicting aircraft are projected to reach an unsafe closest point-of-approach within 20 to 25 seconds. A different level {{of information about the}} location of other air traffic was presented to each of three groups of flight crews during their execution of eight simulated air carrier flights. A fourth group of pilots flew the same segments without TCAS 2 equipment. Traffic conflicts were generated at intervals during the flights; many of the conflict aircraft were visible to the flight crews. The TCAS equipment successfully ameliorated the seriousness of all conflicts; three of four non-TCAS crews had hazardous encounters. Response times to TCAS maneuver commands did not differ {{as a function of the}} amount of information provided, nor did response accuracy. Differences in flight experience did not appear to contribute to the small performance differences observed. Pilots used the displays of conflicting traffic to maneuver to avoid unseen traffic before maneuver advisories were issued by the TCAS equipment. The results indicate: (1) that pilots utilize TCAS effectively within the response times allocated by the TCAS logic, and (2) that TCAS 2 is an effective collision avoidance device.
