5|$|In 1938, Fingleton {{made what}} turned out to be his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, a series in which he found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 in each of his first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong time, falling three times for single figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw in which every innings passed 400.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E

25|$|Film {{production}} in Turkey increased drastically after World War II. With {{a total of}} 49 films produced in 1952, this single year equaled a greater output produced in Turkey than all previous years combined.

Following the brutality of the police after the stockade, public opinion turned against them, the 13 miners charged with treason were all acquitted and police numbers were dramatically cut.|$|E

25|$|Valenzuela in 1981 {{was named}} the opening day starter as a rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 24 hours before his {{scheduled}} start and Burt Hooton {{was not ready to}} fill in. Valenzuela shut out the Houston Astros 2–0. He started the season 8–0 with five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. Punctuating this dominance on the mound, Valenzuela had an unusual, flamboyant wind-up (looking skyward <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> apex of every pitch), which drew attention of its own. It was a habit which he claims to have developed spontaneously, although not until joining the Dodgers.|$|E
25|$|Macleod unsuccessfully contested the Western Isles {{constituency}} at the 1945 general election. There was no Conservative Party in the seat, so Macleod advertised an inaugural meeting. He and his father, {{a lifelong}} Liberal but {{an admirer of}} Winston Churchill, were the only attendees, so Macleod elected his father Association Chairman and he selected his son as Parliamentary candidate, in due course receiving a letter of endorsement from Churchill. Macleod came bottom of the poll, obtaining 2,756 votes out of 13,000. Macleod's father died {{at the start of}} 1947, <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> onset of the exceptionally bitter winter.|$|E

Besides and parallel to making sculptures he organized the local historical collection at St. István Museum of Székesfehérvár with placing the objects found at excavations in a correctly reconstructed environment created by artist between 1952–56. This activity has been recognized and honored by the British Museum.|$|E

25|$|He {{is known}} for {{introducing}} in 1874 a new, more aggressive form of obstructionism in the British House of Commons. This new form was directed not <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Government but at the institution of parliament itself, and lacked the previous traditional restraint exercised by oppositions who realised that they could expect like treatment when they attained government. This involved giving long speeches to delay passage (also known as filibustering) of Irish coercion acts and to generally obstruct {{the business of the}} House to force the Liberals and Conservatives to negotiate with Irish nationalists. Obstruction was opposed by Home Rule Party leader Isaac Butt but approved of by most Irish nationalists.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} Mahmud IV at Jenné has been {{attributed}} to several causes. Details are sparse on the nature of both armies. The overarching theme in why the battle turned out the way it did revolves around the ability of each side to rally its forces. In few other instances are the effects of imperial collapse {{in the face of a}} changing political and military environment so well demonstrated. The Mali which faced off against the pashalik forces and its native allies was not the grand military of Mansa Musa. In fact, it had reversed back to its pre-imperial structure <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time when leaps forward in technology and organization were essential to the empire’s survival.|$|E
25|$|In his Divina commedia ("Divine comedy"; set in {{the year}} 1300), Dante Alighieri {{employed}} the concept of taking Virgil as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of Purgatorio). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to Limbo <b>just</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth {{and deeper into the}} various punishments of Hell, until, {{at the center of the}} world, Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of Cocytus. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other side of the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.|$|E
