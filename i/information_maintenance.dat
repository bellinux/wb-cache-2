40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} computational {{support for}} the maintenance of Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) systems to more effectively use <b>maintenance</b> <b>information.</b> A common cause of inefficient and ineffective maintenance has been the difficulty in getting reliable, just-in-time <b>information</b> for in-situ <b>maintenance</b> work. To reduce this inefficiency in the maintenance environment, accessibility and accuracy of <b>maintenance</b> <b>information</b> must be improved. Our approach, therefore, is the development of a user interface that will produce superimposed computer graphics of equipment/facility-specific <b>maintenance</b> <b>information</b> onto a live video stream on portable computing devices, such as laptops and PDAs.

40|$|Abstract. The {{peer-to-peer}} {{systems have}} become an extremely popular platform for large-scale content sharing. A lot of research papers discussed the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based p 2 p algorithms to promise that idle resources may be efficiently harvested. However, p 2 p systems are composed of components with extremely heterogeneous availabilities and for nodes which join/leave the system frequently, the system will generate a lot of <b>information</b> <b>maintenance</b> traffic such as routing information update traffic and data copy traffic to keep {{the efficiency of the}} DHT based p 2 p algorithms. In this paper, we suggest the mobile nodeID based p 2 p algorithm to reduce the overhead by exploiting the heterogeneity of participant nodes efficiently. Unlike the DHT based p 2 p algorithms, the nodeID of a node changes according to its characteristic to support the p 2 p system efficiency and each nodes takes the different responsibility in accordance with its nodeID. We classify nodes into the two types according to the characteristics of nodes: the reliable nodes and the leaf nodes. The reliable node which is the more stable and more reliable node acts as the more important role of the routing and the replication. The leaf node which joins/leaves very frequently acts as the simple role to minimize the <b>information</b> <b>maintenance</b> traffic. The reliable node has the load-balanced ID to balance the loads and the leaf node has the load-free ID to reduce the responsibility. We examine the efficiency of our p 2 p algorithm via a event driven simulation and show that the <b>information</b> <b>maintenance</b> traffic reduces and the routing process is more efficient...|$|E
