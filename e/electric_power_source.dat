40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1989. Includes bibliographical references. Microfiche. xii, 147 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThis {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} alternative approach for determining the optimal mix of Japan's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> through a multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis. The present priority of Japan's <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry is to attain the optimal mix of <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> In determining such an optimal mix, the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry recognizes the significance of an approach that considers security of power supply {{in the future and}} environmental aspects, but the emphasis has still been placed on economic aspects only. Most of the fuels used for generating power in Japan are imported from overseas. In other words, future power supply depends heavily on overseas sources. Emissions from the thermal power plants have caused the "greenhouse effect" and "acid rain. " Recently, the agitation against nuclear power development is accelerating throughout the country, concerning the safety of nuclear power plants. Therefore, the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> industry should consider security of power supply (strategic aspect), emission problems (environmental aspect), and public opinion on safety (social aspect) in addition to the economic aspects in determining the optimal mix of <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> In this study, a multi-objective programming model is developed for the determination of optimal mix of <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> with special attention to economic, technological, and institutional conditions. Since it is difficult to predict future conditions due to uncertainties such as changes in technology, natural disasters, changes in values, and other unforeseeable changes, scenario analysis is utilized in this study. As this problem belongs to the domain of public decision making which contains a wide range of interest groups (decision makers), it is desirable that the optimal solutions satisfy the conditions of equity as well as efficiency. In this study, the Rawlsian equity criterion and the utilitarian equity criterion are considered to attain the optimal mix of <b>power</b> <b>sources.</b> Empirical results determined by the MCDM analysis are compared with the results of two major studies on <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> - one by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the other by the Japanese Institute of Energy Economics...|$|R
50|$|An {{electrolytic}} {{process is the}} use of electrolysis industrially to refine metals or compounds at a high purity and low cost. Some examples are the Hall-Héroult process used for aluminium, or the production of hydrogen from water. Electrolysis is usually done in bulk using hundreds of sheets of metal connected to an <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b> In the production of copper, these pure sheets of copper are used as starter material for the cathodes, and are then lowered into a solution such as copper sulfate with the large anodes that are cast from impure (97% pure) copper. The copper from the anodes are electroplated on to the cathodes, while any impurities settle {{to the bottom of the}} tank. This forms cathodes of 99.999% pure copper.|$|E
50|$|Recombination {{usually take}} place in the whole volume of a plasma (volume recombination), {{although}} in some cases it is confined to some special region of it. Each kind of reaction is called a recombining mode and their individual rates are strongly affected by the properties of the plasma such as its energy (heat), density of each species, pressure and temperature of the surrounding environment. An everyday example of rapid plasma recombination occurs when a fluorescent lamp is switched off. The low-density plasma in the lamp (which generates the light by bombardment of the fluorescent coating {{on the inside of the}} glass wall) recombines in a fraction of a second after the plasma-generating electric field is removed by switching off the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to this requirement, the Armament Division of General Electric resurrected an old idea: the multi-barrel Gatling gun. The original Gatling gun {{had fallen out of}} favor because of the need for an external power source to rotate the barrel assembly, but the new generation of turbojet-powered fighters offered sufficient electric power to operate the gun, and electric operation was more reliable than gas-operated reloading. With multiple barrels, the rate of fire per barrel could be lower than a single-barrel revolver cannon while providing a greater overall rate of fire. The idea of powering a Gatling gun from an external <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> was not a novel idea {{at the end of the}} World War II, as Richard Jordan Gatling himself had done just that with a patent he filed in 1893.|$|E
50|$|Wind power gives {{variable}} power {{which is very}} consistent {{from year to year}} but which has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> <b>sources</b> to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing <b>sources,</b> sufficient hydroelectric <b>power,</b> exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems. In addition, weather forecasting permits the <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.|$|R
