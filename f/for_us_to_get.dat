One hurdle was resolved in 2008, when the international governing bodies for men's and women's lacrosse merged to form Federation of International Lacrosse. [...] Another obstacle is insufficient international participation.

[...] Decrying the [...] "tragic" [...] conflict, he urged [...] "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time."

500|$|Aaliyah {{admitted}} in court documents {{that she had}} lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with R. Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him. In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah [...] "got villainized" [...] over her relationship with R. Kelly and the scandal over the marriage {{made it difficult to}} find producers for her second album. [...] "We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was hard <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> producers on the album." [...] Hankerson also expressed confusion over why [...] "they were upset" [...] with Aaliyah given her age at the time.|$|E

Experiments beginning in 2015 FY have used plutonium targets, with a schedule containing 10 to 12 shots for 2015, {{and as many as}} 120 over the next 10 years. Plutonium shots simulate the compression of the primary in a nuclear bomb by high explosives, which has not seen direct testing since the Comprehensive Test Ban. Tiny amounts of plutonium are used in these tests, ranging from less than a milligram to 10 milligrams. Similar experiments are also carried out on Sandia's Z machine.

2500|$|Commenting {{on the use}} of the Oslo Session String Quartet, Rygg said, [...] "We {{worked a}} lot with {{simulating}} stringed instruments, so it's always good <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some people in and play the real thing. I suppose strings and piano are our instruments of preference; those are the sounds we like to work with. That timbre, you know? In terms of writing music — not that we really write music per se, but say we did write music, we'd write it for strings and piano." [...] Adding, [...] "A lot of times when we get musicians into the studio we just get them to play along with preliminary ideas or themes. We can record hours of music and end up using one minute of it. But this time we had the body of the songs before the string quartet came, and we wrote down a part for them. It was a little more disciplined than before." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Anne Rice has {{consistently}} and aggressively prevented fan fiction based {{on any of}} her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous Interview with the Vampire and its sequels in The Vampire Chronicles). She, along with Anne McCaffrey (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and Raymond Feist, have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net. George R.R. Martin, who was selected by Time magazine {{as one of the}} [...] "2011 Time 100" [...] and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers. Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, creators of the Liaden universe, strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe, Lee saying that [...] "Nobody else is going to get it right.

[...] Of the est seminar itself, Convy recalled that when another attendee complained of a headache during the course, the group leader told him to [...] "experience it", and when another attendee wet his pants, he was told to [...] "experience the warmth". [...] In a scene from the film, a woman exclaims to Friedrich Bismark {{in the middle of a}} seminar: [...] "I peed in my pants and it felt good." [...] During actual filming on Semi-Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. [...] She related to Convy that Erhard was [...] "pleased" [...] with the role, and she wished him success in the film.

2500|$|Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. Eurogamers review {{stated that}} the jump timing {{sometimes}} feels [...] "off by {{a fraction of a}} fraction of a second" [...] and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing. In IGNs review, Chris Roper also reported issues with the control system stating that the game's heavily physics-based gameplay [...] "left a few corners on {{what should have been a}} razor-sharp control scheme". He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration [...] "isn't as quick as it could be" [...] but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that [...] "there are instances where it doesn't do what you want it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." [...] This is an issue that has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that [...] "The Z [...] movement is an incredibly hard thing <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right. There's times when it annoys me actually." [...] He went on to say they would continue refining it, suggesting improvements via a future update IGN's review commented that the story mode ended [...] "in a somewhat disappointing manner" [...] and the story as a whole doesn't make sense.|$|E
