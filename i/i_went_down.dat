500|$|What happened? I {{signed a}} shitty deal, but luckily it was non-exclusive. I {{got tired of}} doing Strapping so I said, 'I can't do it anymore.' Then I freaked out and went into a hospital. My lawyer said that I was under mental duress when I signed the {{contract}} so the contract is void. At that point it was like, 'I just won't do another Strapping record.' Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> saying 'CM was the shittiest label ever.' And they went down as saying that I was 'a complete, arrogant psychopath.' ...|$|E
500|$|According to Kubrick's {{brother-in-law}} Jan Harlan, {{the director}} was adamant the trims were {{never to be}} seen, and that he burned the negatives, which he had kept in his garage, shortly before his death. This was confirmed by former Kubrick assistant Leon Vitali: [...] "I'll tell you right now, okay, on Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Barry Lyndon, some little parts of 2001, we had thousands of cans of negative outtakes and print, which we had stored in an area at his house where we worked out of, which he personally supervised the loading of it to a truck and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to a big industrial waste lot and burned it. That's what he wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning I used to go down [...] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had in his head and play it right would have been an agonizing process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested that I should be deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{going on}} tour with her Harajuku Lovers Tour (2005), Stefani {{revealed}} {{that she was}} going to release a second album in 2006, stating: [...] "I have a bunch of leftover tracks from making 'Love. Angel. Music. Baby.'. And two months ago, Pharrell called me up, he was like, 'Come down to Miami and write some more songs!' And I'm like, 'OK!' <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> there and wrote four songs and played three of them tonight. They're really fresh". In September 2006, during the Fashion Week, MTV News interviewed Swizz Beatz and he said to be working with Stefani as well, claiming: [...] "She's always taking it to the next level. I love her background for music. She likes a lot of Caribbean sounds with hard beats". They worked on [...] "Now That You Got It", which was selected to be the fourth single from The Sweet Escape (2006). For the single version, Stefani enlisted Damian Marley, son of Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley, giving the single a [...] "reggae" [...] feel to it. It was released to mainstream radio in the United States, on August 26, 2007, while in the United Kingdom, it was released on October 15, 2007. Two remixes were included on the CD single, both featuring Marley. The [...] "remix" [...] version uses the same instrumentation as the original single, but has a more reggae-infused rendition and an added verse sung by Marley; the [...] "" [...] version features the song's original beat mixed with the remix version.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} brief scene of an {{astronaut}} on Mars uncovering a stone slate featuring {{the cover of the}} album Oops!... I Did It Again. A scientist back on Earth sees it through a video transmitter and says, [...] "Cute. What is it?" [...] As the astronaut replies, [...] "Oh, it's cute alright. It couldn't be...", the ground begins to shake as a large stage rises from the ground. Spears then descends from a platform onto a stage in a red catsuit as the track begins to play. As she continues to sing and dance, she suspends the astronaut mid-air above her. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes of Spears wearing a short white top and skirt, lying barefoot on a white web pad with dancers on the ground around her. During its bridge, Spears does a flip in the air to where the astronaut is and appears in a white jacket, short black leather skirt, and leather boots. As a symbol of his love for her, the astronaut gifts Spears with the Heart of the Ocean, the blue diamond from the blockbuster film Titanic (1997). She questions that she [...] "thought the old lady [...] dropped it into the ocean in the end", to which he responds, [...] "Well, baby, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> and got it for you". Spears comments [...] "Oh, you shouldn't have" [...] and walks away, the astronaut shrugs and leaves. The video concludes as Spears and her performers continue to dance.|$|E

2500|$|She did {{not claim}} that she fought until being wounded, {{but she did}} say her weapon jammed {{immediately}} and {{that she could not}} have done anything anyway.

He had noticed the Welsh No. 8 Eddie Butler, had not played for three weeks and he had a hunch he would not be fit.

2500|$|In November 2010, Lynch {{released}} two electropop music singles, [...] "Good Day Today" [...] and [...] "I Know", {{through the}} independent British label Sunday Best Recordings. Describing why he created them, {{he stated that}} [...] "I was just sitting and these notes came and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> and started working with Dean [...] and then these few notes, 'I {{want to have a}} good day, today' came and the song was built around that". The singles were followed by an album, Crazy Clown Time, which was released in November 2011 and described as an [...] "electronic blues album". The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed and performed by Lynch and Dean Hurley.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} the {{four members of}} the band after they were hit by pies. Guitarist Brian James recalled: [...] "That was organised by this photographer called Peter Kodick, Stiff had assigned him to do the thing. They thought it was a jolly wheeze to surprise us with a few cream cakes, little knowing that we would relish it, get into to it and enjoy the whole experience". After the photo session, Damned bassist Captain Sensible noted: [...] "...I had more pie on my face {{than any of the other}} buggers and on the back of the sleeve I had my back to the picture, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> a photo booth and got some pictures, cut one out and said 'put that on there' so I would have something to show my relatives, because I didn't think we'd be invited to make another album".|$|E

2500|$|While Liston {{publicly}} denied {{taking a}} dive, Sports Illustrated writer Mark Kram said that years later Liston told him, [...] "That guy [...] was crazy. I didn't {{want anything to}} do with him. And the Muslims were coming up. Who needed that? So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> I wasn't hit." [...] The fact that Liston didn't complain about the clear breach of boxing rules (being declared knocked out without a count) and Ali's obvious state of bewilderment, shouting at Liston [...] "Nobody will believe this" [...] and asking his handlers [...] "Did I hit him?" [...] confirmed most people's belief that Liston took a dive. There have been a number of unproven theories as to the background to the purported dive including that Liston was threatened by the Muslims, or agreed to lose in return for a share in the more marketable Ali's future purses.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his victory}} over Molina, Khan {{returned}} to the UK, for a fight against 33 year old Julio Díaz (40-7-1, 29 KOs) on 27 April 2013 in a 143lbs 'catch-weight' bout. The fight {{took place at the}} Motorpoint Arena in Sheffield. Khan was able to control some of the fight and managed to survive a fourth-round knockdown from Diaz. Khan managed to hold on throughout the fight to go onto win the fight by a fairly close unanimous decision. The scorecards; Phil Edwards 114–113 – Steve Gray 115–113 – Terry O'Connor 115–112. In the aftermath, Khan praised Díaz, He caught me while I was off balance, and I couldn't get my stance back. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> I kept moving to recompose myself. That's what happens. There are little things to work on when we go back in the gym." [...] Khan stated the fight could be his last in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{afterward}} I {{resolved to}} visit my town of Taal; nothing was left of it except {{the walls of the}} church and convento. All the rest, the government house, the walks of the rope factory, the warehouse, everything was buried beneath a layer of stones, mud, and ashes more than 10 spans [...] thick; only here and there could be seen an upright post, the only remnant of a comfortable dwelling. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the river and found it completely filled up, with a boat belonging to the alcalde and many of private persons buried in the mud. After incredible efforts I finally succeeded in unearthing in what had once been the church and sacristy, the chests which contained the sacred vestments and vessels. Nearly all of them were demolished by the rocks and beams which had fallen upon them, and filled with foul-smelling mud that had ruined or disfigured their contents. With the aid of some natives of Bauang, I likewise recovered some property from among the ruins of the convento.|$|E

2500|$|At about dawn on October 26, {{the card}} game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp {{went home to}} bed. Clanton testified later that he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, McLaury and Clanton {{had no place to}} go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Clanton, who had been {{drinking}} all night, in front of the telegraph office. Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Clanton insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Clanton was armed and covered his gun for him, recalling that Clanton told him [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'... <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open."

2500|$|Frustrated, {{she left}} Decca and signed with United Artists, where she teamed with the {{producer}} Allen Reynolds, who offered her the creative freedom she wanted {{and helped her}} develop her own style and phrasing. The first album, Crystal Gayle, was released in 1974 and produced her first top-ten country hit, [...] "Wrong Road Again" [...] (number 6). By 1976, she had the first of her 20 number one country singles with [...] "I'll Get Over You", which also became her first single on Billboard's Hot 100 (number 71) and adult contemporary chart (number 40). The following year, she had two more top-2 country hits, [...] "You Never Miss a Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)" [...] (number 1) and [...] "I'll Do It All Over Again" [...] (number 2), before achieving her greatest success. Gayle recalled what her sister Loretta Lynn had said: [...] "'You record what I couldn't record — you do MOR, middle of the road', [...] "and {{that was the best}} advice I could get.

I was determined to get him into the kitchen somehow; so, tying a rope to his tail, I let him slide down the stone stairs by his own weight. He started all right, but 'getting way' on him, I could hold the rope no more, and away he went sliding headlong down the stairs, like an avalanche down Mont Blanc... he smashed the door open... and slid right into the kitchen... till at last he brought himself to an anchor under the kitchen table. This sudden and unexpected appearance of the armour-clad sea monster, bursting open the door... instantly created a sensation. The cook screamed, the house-maid fainted, the cat jumped on the dresser, the dog retreated behind the copper and barked, the monkeys went mad with fright, and the sedate parrot has never spoken a word since." ...|$|E
