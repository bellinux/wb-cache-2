40|$|This study reconsiders the {{acquisition}} of relative clauses {{based on data from}} two sentence-repetition tasks. Using materials modeled on the relative constructions of spontaneous child speech, we asked four-year-old English- and <b>German-speaking</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> repeat six different types of relative clauses. Although English and German relative clauses are structurally very different, the results were similar across studies: intransitive subject relatives caused fewer errors than transitive subject relatives and direct object relatives, which in turn caused fewer errors than indirect object relatives and oblique relatives; finally, genitive relatives caused by far the most problems. Chal-lenging previous analyses in which {{the acquisition}} of relative clauses has been explained by the varying distance between filler and gap, we propose a multifactorial analysis in which the acquisi-tion process is determined primarily by the similarity between the various types of relative clauses and their relationship to simple sentences. 1.

It is estimated that 43–78% of the variance in age to ESRD could be due to heritable modifying factors, with parents as likely as <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> more severe disease in studies of parent-child pairs.|$|R
50|$|The runic {{inscription}} {{suggests that}} {{those to whom}} the stone is dedicated, the father Holmfastr and his son Arnfastr, were burned, possibly {{in a case of}} arson known as quickfire, a method commonly used in Scandinavian feuds. Arnfastr and his brother Véfastr share the common name element fastr with their father, Holmfastr.

We use data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and <b>Children</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that early childhood financial problems are associated with worse adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes, controlling for both income {{and a set of}} standard variables. The estimated effect of financial problems is almost always larger in size than that of income.

It is also shown in the dullness that Steinbeck describes has settled over families who have lost young ones to malnutrition or other such diseases.

50|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese society, {{members of}} the younger generation <b>show</b> their respect <b>to</b> {{members of the}} older generation by offering a cup of tea. Inviting their elders to restaurants for tea is a traditional holiday activity. In the past, people of a lower social class served tea to the upper class in society. Today, with the increasing liberalization of Chinese society, this rule and its connotations have become blurred. Sometimes parents may pour a cup of tea for their <b>children</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their care, or a boss may even pour tea for subordinates at restaurants to promote their relationship; however, on formal occasions, the basic rule remains in effect.|$|R

30|$|Regarding the {{experimental}} procedure, in the baseline phase, three sessions were {{performed with the}} <b>child</b> <b>to</b> ascertain the baseline’s stability.

In this phase, there was no intervention {{on the part of the}} researcher in the choice of cards by the child, nor was reinforcement offered depending on the choice. To perform the evaluation, the pictures of ADL actions were spread out on a table, and the researcher displayed the pictures of the objects, one at a time, and asked the <b>child</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the image that represented the use of the referenced object.
