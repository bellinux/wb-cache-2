5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} The Man in the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction.

25|$|It {{follows from}} the {{functional}} equation of the Riemann zeta-function that the Z-function is real for real values of t. It is an even function, and real analytic for real values.

Moreover, the real zeros of Z(t) are precisely the zeros of the zeta-function along the critical line, and complex zeros <b>in</b> the Z-function <b>critical</b> strip correspond to zeros off the critical line of the Riemann zeta-function <b>in</b> its <b>critical</b> strip.|$|R
5|$|The D-1 was {{manufactured}} solely at No. 9 Plant (UZTM) in Sverdlovsk {{from late}} 1943 to 1949.

5|$|A {{doctor at}} Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people {{injured in the}} fire had been admitted, many {{suffering}} from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation. State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from baseball, Black {{went on to}} become a sportscaster, automobile salesman, and insurance salesman. He lived with his wife, Joyce, and his two daughters, Stevie and Donna, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. In December 1957, Black was injured in a car accident in Virginia, leaving him <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> condition. He recovered and spent the following summer teaching for the city recreation department. The following year, on April 21, 1959, Black died in Cuyahoga Falls while watching an Indians game at his home.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, arms and hands, and he was <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Fisher {{again was}} {{required}} {{to become involved in}} the U.S. 1942-43 internment of Japanese Americans on the West Coast of the United States upon his return from Europe. At that time, the case of Korematsu v. United States, challenging the U.S. government’s power to exclude citizens of Japanese ancestry from military zones, came before the United States Supreme Court. While the Department of Justice's Herbert Wechsler (an Assistant Attorney General) was in charge of defending the government's position before the Supreme Court, significant consultation with Fisher was required, as he was again with the legal affairs section of the War Department. During this period, Fisher was involved <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> drafting of the government's brief submitted to the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the Portland Water Bureau {{expressed}} their {{surprise at the}} cost of running the fountain, which at the time was consuming $34,000 in water and $13,000 in electricity each year. Also in 1988, a 26-year-old Vancouver man was drowned when he attempted to swim through a small water pipe and got wedged under a concrete slab. He was taken to the Oregon Health & Science University and was listed <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> condition. According to Portland police, he had been drinking alcohol.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} Mach2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake ramps were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach0.85, {{reducing the amount of}} titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small vanes mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional ejection seat for each crew member.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that United Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|More than 300individuals {{were injured}} during the raid, {{including}} women and children; {{some of them}} <b>in</b> <b>critical</b> condition.

While two of them who were shot in the back, another protester was shot in the thigh and subsequently died at the SMC; the fourth {{was shot in the head}} later and died instantly. At least 25,000mourners took part at the funeral procession, which was held in Sitra on 18February for the three protesters originating from the island.|$|E
