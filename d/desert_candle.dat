50|$|Caulanthus inflatus, the <b>desert</b> <b>candle,</b> is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Brassicaceae, native to the Mojave Desert of California and Nevada, and the southern Sierra Nevada and Transverse Ranges in the United States. It is found at elevations between 150 - 1500 m.|$|E
5000|$|Eremurus × isabellinus is {{a hybrid}} of garden origin, derived from the {{crossing}} of E. stenophyllus with E. olgae. The first crossing was made by Sir Michael Foster at Great Shelford,http://www.parksandgardens.org/places-and-people/site/5621?preview=1 England, {{at the end of}} the 19th century, and replicated in France by the Vilmorin nursery at Verrières-le-Buisson in 1902. The name of the hybrid is derived from the isabelline colour of the original F1 hybrid flowers. [...] The genus is often known by the common names foxtail lily and <b>desert</b> <b>candle.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The pair take up {{residence}} in a <b>deserted</b> farmhouse, which <b>Candle</b> names [...] "Apple Press Farm." [...] When he is fully recovered, Liir goes to the Conference of the Birds. As the Princess of the Swans had told Chistery, the Birds had until now been little concerned with the fate of other Animals under the Wizard's anti-Animal laws because, being flying creatures, they were relatively safe. However, the Birds were a potential threat to the Emerald City's efforts to divide those groups who might oppose them, like the tribes of the Vinkus and the Munchkinlanders, because they can see and report on {{what is going on}} throughout Oz. This is why the dragons are attacking Birds, and why the Conference is huddled up in Kumbricia's Pass, afraid to fly. The Conference wants Liir to destroy the dragons and recover the broom (taken by the dragons) in order to become their human ambassador, a request that Liir reluctantly agrees to fulfill.|$|R
40|$|Maternally {{deposited}} carotenoids are {{a prominent}} component of egg yolk and are vital {{for the development}} and growth of the embryo. In most studies of avian yolk carotenoids, eggs are destructively sampled and this may limit both the number of clutches studied and the research questions addressed. We describe an empirical field trial for a nondestructive biopsy method to extract small samples (0. 05 ml) of egg yolk for highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of yolk carotenoid concentrations. We sampled 180 clutches (N = 44 biopsies) of two species of introduced thrushes (genus Turdus) from agricultural habitats in central North Island, New Zealand. Once the protocol was established, all biopsied eggs from clutches that were not depredated or <b>deserted</b> before <b>candling</b> {{were found to be}} developing normally after 3 – 5 d of incubation (N = 28) and all hatched. Biopsy samples (> 0. 02 g) produced concentrations of yolk carotenoids (and variances) that were statistically indistinguishable from whole yolk destructive samples. In addition, our samples (> 0. 02 g) confirmed previously reported differences in yolk carotenoid concentrations between the two thrush species and revealed a significant decline in yolk carotenoid concentration with laying order. Further examination of how variability in yolk carotenoid concentration and identity influences offspring sex, success, and survival or, later in life, reproductive success and ability to efficiently incorporate dietary carotenoids into both integument and immune tissues will require larger sample sizes. Studies to date have been restricted by the number of destructive samples that investigators are willing (or permitted) to obtain from wild species. Thus, we hope that our nondestructive method of sampling yolk will promote further examination of the links between carotenoid uptake from the environment and maternal investment in the avian yolk.

50|$|Caulanthus is a genus {{of plants}} in the mustard family. Plants of this genus may be known as jewelflowers. They are also often {{referred}} to as wild cabbage, although this common name usually refers to wild variants of Brassica oleraceae, the cabbage plant. Jewelflowers are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they are often found in warm, arid regions. Many species have an enlarged, erect stem rising from a basal rosette of leaves. Flowers arise directly {{from the surface of the}} stem; many species have colorful, bell-shaped flowers. The best-known of the fourteen species is probably the <b>desert</b> <b>candle.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Desert</b> <b>candle</b> (_Euphorbia abyssinica_ J. F. Gmel.) (further {{referred}} to as EAG) is a succulent tree of dry deciduous and evergreen montane forest, woodland and shrub savanna. It occurs widely throughout dryland Africa, where it is appreciated as a live fence because it is easily propagated from untreated mature branch cuttings. |$|E
6000|$|An {{old man of}} {{seventy-five years}} lay dying. For a {{lifetime}} he had turned a deaf ear to religion, and steeped his soul in every current crime. He had robbed the orphan and plundered the widow; he had wrested from the hard hands of honest toil the rewards of labour; had lost at the gaming-table the wealth with which he should have endowed churches and Sunday schools; had wasted in riotous living the substance of his patrimony, and left {{his wife and children}} without bread. The intoxicating bowl had been his god-his belly had absorbed his entire attention. In carnal pleasures passed his days and nights, and to the maddening desires of his heart he had ministered without shame and without remorse. He was a bad, bad egg! And now this hardened iniquitor was to meet his Maker! Feebly and hesitatingly his breath fluttered upon his pallid lips. Weakly trembled the pulse in his flattened veins! Wife, children, mother-in-law, friends, who should have hovered lovingly about his couch, cheering his last moments and giving him medicine, he had killed with grief, or driven widely away; and he was now dying alone by the inadequate light of a tallow <b>candle,</b> <b>deserted</b> by heaven and by earth. No, not by heaven. Suddenly the door was pushed softly open, and there entered the good minister, whose pious counsel the suffering wretch had in health so often derided. Solemnly the man of God advanced, Bible in hand. Long and silently he stood uncovered in the presence of death. Then with cold and impressive dignity he remarked, [...] "Miserable old sinner!" ...|$|R
