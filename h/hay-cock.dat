60|$|Fitzpiers, however, disregarded her {{resistance}} {{by reason of}} its mildness, stooped and imprinted the purposed kiss, then sunk down on the next <b>hay-cock,</b> panting with his race.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I know he'll {{lead you}} to ruin!' cried Ellen, half crying: 'a boy that comes from nowhere and nobody knows, and sleeps on a <b>hay-cock</b> all night, no better than a mere tramp!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Each city, each town, {{and every}} village, [...] Affords us either an alms or pillage. [...] And {{if the weather}} be cold and raw. [...] Then in a barn we tumble on straw. [...] If warm and fair, by yea-cock and nay-cock, [...] The fields will afford us a hedge or a <b>hay-cock.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{my country}} up there. I was born amongst the mountains. I looked after the cows, and slept in <b>hay-cocks,</b> {{and cut the}} trees in winter. They {{used to call me}} a 'black sheep,' a 'loafer' in my village." ...|$|R
60|$|No {{answer was}} necessary, {{for the two}} lads indulged in a {{friendly}} scuffle among the <b>hay-cocks,</b> while Mrs. Grant went off to repeat the tale in the kitchen, whence {{the sound of a}} muffled roar soon assured me that Seth was enjoying the joke as well as the rest of us.|$|R
60|$|Fitzpiers saw in {{a moment}} that, having taken to open ground, she had placed herself at his mercy, and he {{promptly}} vaulted over after her. She flitted a little way down the mead, when all at once her light form disappeared {{as if it had}} sunk into the earth. She had buried herself in one of the <b>hay-cocks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ah, me! to be shaken with {{coughing}} and broken with {{old age and}} pain, [...] Without laughter, a show unto children, alone with remembrance and fear; [...] All emptied of purple hours as a beggar's cloak in the rain, [...] As a <b>hay-cock</b> out on the flood, or a wolf sucked under a weir.|$|E
6000|$|... "I used to fancy {{that sort}} of thing years ago, but I'm afraid I should find it a little slow now, though you {{describe}} it in such an inviting manner that I would be tempted to try it, if a <b>hay-cock</b> came in my way; for, upon my life, it's deused heavy work loafing about at these watering-places all summer. Between ourselves, there's a deal of humbug about this kind of life, as you will find, when you've tried it as long as I have." ...|$|E
60|$|Ragged, dirty, thin, and {{worn-out}} he looked; {{one foot}} was bare, the other {{tied up in}} the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own back to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt. He seemed to have hidden himself behind the <b>hay-cock,</b> but in his sleep had thrown out the arm that had betrayed him. He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed him, and once when he moved, he groaned as if in pain, but still slept on quite spent with weariness.|$|E
60|$|Then twenty-five excited ladies flew {{across the}} hall to behold Jocko sitting on the great cake {{in the middle of}} the table, his feet bathed in cream from the {{overturned}} pitcher, while all around lay the ruins of custards, tarts, biscuits, and sauce, not to mention nice napkins made into <b>hay-cocks,</b> spoons, knives, and forks, on the floor, and the best silver teapot in the fireplace.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. King stood {{a moment}} to {{look out at the}} {{beautiful}} stillness of early dawn, the trees and meads so gravely calmly quiet, and the silver dew lying white over everything; the tanned <b>hay-cocks</b> rising up all over the field, the morning star and waning moon glowing pale as light of morning spread over the sky. Then a cock crew somewhere at a distance, and Mrs. Shepherd's cock answered him more shrilly close by, and the swallows began to twitter under the eaves.|$|R
6000|$|At {{first he}} had rushed off into the melancholy meadows, among the sodden <b>hay-cocks</b> still {{standing}} among the green growth of grass; but a shower, increasing the damp forlornness of the ungenial day, made him turn homewards. When, late in the afternoon, Ethel came into the schoolroom for some Cocksmoor stores, she found him leaning over his books on the table. This was his usual place for study; {{and she did not}} at once perceive that the attitude was only assumed on her entrance, so kneeling in front of her cupboard, she asked, 'What success?' ...|$|R
60|$|And then, {{the next}} day, Clara came. They {{were to have}} tea in the hayfield. Miriam watched the evening drawing to gold and shadow. And all the time Paul was {{sporting}} with Clara. He made higher and higher heaps of hay that they were jumping over. Miriam did not care for the game, and stood aside. Edgar and Geoffrey and Maurice and Clara and Paul jumped. Paul won, because he was light. Clara's blood was roused. She could run like an Amazon. Paul loved the determined way she rushed at the <b>hay-cock</b> and leaped, landed on the other side, her breasts shaken, her thick hair come undone.|$|E
6000|$|... "'O, quick! quick!' cried Sally, panting with haste. 'Draw up {{the basket}} and then get me in, for I saw Mr. Cotton in the market, and ran all the way home, so that I might get in before he came.' Up came the heavy basket, bumping and {{scraping}} on the way, and smelling, O, so nice! Down went the rope, and with a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together, we hoisted poor Sally half-way up to the window, when, sad to tell, the rope slipped and down she fell, only being saved from broken bones by the <b>hay-cock</b> under the window.|$|E
60|$|By and by he fell asleep, {{the lads}} trooped up to bed, the house grew still, {{and nothing but}} the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence of the summer night. Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing, for the big basket was always piled with socks, full of portentous holes, and {{thinking}} of the lost boy. She had decided that baby had been mistaken, and did not even disturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child's fancy, for the poor man got little time to himself till the boys were abed, and he was busy writing letters. It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house. As she paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps, something white caught her eye on one of the hay-cocks scattered over the lawn. The children had been playing there all the afternoon, and, fancying that Nan had left her hat as usual, Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it. But as she approached, she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief, but a shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it. She hurried round the <b>hay-cock,</b> and there lay Dan, fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Teddy {{saw him at}} the window, and {{he called}} to him, but he went away and hid behind the <b>hay-cocks</b> on the lawn. I found him there just now fast asleep, and half dead with weariness and pain. He ran away from Page a month ago, and has been making his way to us ever since. He pretends {{that he did not}} mean to let us see him, but go on to the city, and his old work, after a look at us. It is evident, however, that the hope of being taken in has led him here through every thing, and there he is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back." ...|$|R
60|$|The road led up the mountain, where a {{view that}} is much praised exists. It is the {{counterpart}} of that which is seen everywhere, when one touches on the eastern verge of the Jura, and first gets sight of Switzerland proper. These views are divided into that which embraces {{the valley of the}} Aar and the Oberland range, and this which comprises the basin of the Leman, and the mountains that surround it. Mont Blanc, of course, is included in the other. On the whole, I prefer the first, although the last is singularly beautiful. We got clear weather near the summit, and stopped a few minutes to dissect the elements of this scene. The view is very lovely, beyond a question; but I think it much inferior to that which has been so often spoken of between us above VÃ©vey, notwithstanding Mont Blanc enters into this as one of its most conspicuous objects. I have, as yet, nowhere seen this mountain to so much advantage. In size, as compared with the peaks around it, it is a hay-stack among <b>hay-cocks,</b> with the advantage of being a pile of shining ice, or frozen snow, while everything else near it is granite. By insulating this mountain, and studying it by itself, one feels its mild sublimity; but still, as a whole, I give the preference greatly to the other view. From this point the lake is too distant, the shores of Savoy dwindle in the presence of their mightier neighbour, and the mysterious-looking Valais, which in its peculiar beauty has scarcely a rival on earth, is entirely hid from sight. Then the lights and shades are nearly lost from the summit of the Jura; and, after all, it is these lights and shades, the natural chiaroscuro, that finishes the picture.|$|R
6000|$|When {{you have}} a theory of any kind, proofs of it are apt to seek you out, and I, who am rather fond of my faith in New England's {{influence}} of this sort, had as pretty an instance of it the day after my arrival as I could wish. A colored brother of Massachusetts birth, as black as a man can well be, and of a merely anthropoidal profile, was driving me along shore {{in search of a}} sea-side hotel when we came upon a weak-minded young chicken in the road. The natural expectation is that any chicken in these circumstances will wait for your vehicle, and then fly up before it with a loud screech; but this chicken may have been overcome by the heat (it was a land breeze and it drew like the breath of a furnace over the <b>hay-cocks</b> and the clover), or it may have mistimed the wheel, which passed over its head and left it to flop a moment in the dust and then fall still. The poor little tragedy was sufficiently distressful to me, but I bore it well, compared with my driver. He could hardly stop lamenting it; and when presently we met a young farmer, he pulled up. [...] "You goin' past Jim Marden's?" [...] "Yes." [...] "Well, I wish you'd tell him I just run over a chicken of his, and I killed it, I guess. I guess it was a pretty big one." [...] "Oh no," [...] I put in, [...] "it was only a broiler. What {{do you think it was}} worth?" [...] I took out some money, and the farmer noted the largest coin in my hand; [...] "About half a dollar, I guess." [...] On this I put it all back in my pocket, and then he said, [...] "Well, if a chicken don't know enough to get out of the road, I guess you ain't to blame." [...] I expressed that this was my own view of the case, and we drove on. When we parted I gave the half-dollar to my driver, and begged him not to let the owner of the chicken come on me for damages; and though he chuckled his pleasure in the joke, I could see that he was still unhappy, and I have no doubt that he has that pullet on his conscience yet, unless he has paid for it. He was of a race which elsewhere has so immemorially plundered hen-roosts that chickens are as free to it as the air it breathes, without any conceivable taint of private ownership. But the spirit of New England had so deeply entered into him that the imbecile broiler of another, slain by pure accident and by its own contributory negligence, was saddening him, while I was off in my train without a pang for the owner and with only an agreeable pathos for the pullet.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{the young}} man was {{returning}} from his labour, he was taken up by the skirt of his doublet by this female daemon, and carried a height into the air. He was soon missed by his Master and some other servants that had been at labour with him, and after diligent enquiry no news could be heard of him, until at length (near half an hour after) he was heard singing and whistling in a bog or quagmire, where they found him in a kind of trance or extatick fit, to which he hath sometimes been accustomed (but whether before the affliction he met with from this spirit I am not certain). He was affected much after such sort, as at the time of those fits, so that the people did not give that attention and regard to what he said as at other times; but when he returned again to himself (which was about an hour after) he solemnly protested to them that the daemon had carried him so high that his master's house seemed to him to be but as a <b>hay-cock,</b> and that during all that time he was in perfect sense, and prayed to Almighty God not to suffer the devil to destroy him; and that he was suddenly set down in that quagmire.|$|E
60|$|The {{manner in}} which the water flowed out of the lake, beneath the leafy arches of the trees that lined the sides of the stream, has already been mentioned, and it has also been said that the rock, which was a {{favorite}} place of rendezvous throughout all that region, and where Deerslayer now expected to meet his friend, stood near this outlet, and at no great distance from the shore. It was a large, isolated stone that rested {{on the bottom of the}} lake, apparently left there when the waters tore away the earth from around it, in forcing for themselves a passage down the river, and which had obtained its shape from the action of the elements, during the slow progress of centuries. The height of this rock could scarcely equal six feet, and, as has been said, its shape was not unlike that which is usually given to beehives, or to a <b>hay-cock.</b> The latter, indeed, gives the best idea not only of its form, but of its dimensions. It stood, and still stands, for we are writing of real scenes, within fifty feet of the bank, and in water that was only two feet in depth, though there were seasons in which its rounded apex, if such a term can properly be used, was covered by the lake. Many of the trees stretched so far forward, as almost to blend the rock with the shore, when seen from a little distance, and one tall pine in particular overhung it in a way to form a noble and appropriate canopy to a seat that had held many a forest chieftain, during the long succession of unknown ages, in which America, and all it contained, had existed apart, in mysterious solitude, a world by itself; equally without a familiar history, and without an origin that the annals of man can reach.|$|E
