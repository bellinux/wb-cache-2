25|$|Yield {{management}} {{has become part}} of mainstream business theory and practice over the last fifteen to twenty years. Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), yield management is a set of yield maximization strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>complex</b> because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and distribution channel management. Yield management is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. Yield management strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing yield management strategies.|$|E
500|$|However, Michael Lapidge {{argues that}} however {{unpalatable}} the hermeneutic style seems to modern taste, {{it was an}} important part of late Anglo-Saxon culture, and deserves more sympathetic attention than it has received from modern historians. In the view of historian David Woodman, [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] should [...] "be accorded recognition as an individual author of no little genius, a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also had the ability to write Latin that is as enduringly fascinating as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>complex...</b> In many ways the diplomas of [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] represent the stylistic peak of the Anglo-Saxon diplomatic tradition, a fitting complement to Æthelstan's own momentous political feats and to the forging of what would become England." ...|$|E

Like other Pemberton Belt plutons, the Salal Creek Pluton is generally thought by geologists to be the root of a deeply eroded volcano.

60|$|First, {{when any}} complex idea (for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>complex</b> {{ideas that are}} most liable to confusion) {{is made up of}} too small a number of simple ideas, and such only as are common to other things, whereby the {{differences}} that make it deserve a different name, are left out. Thus, he that has an idea made up of barely the simple ones of a beast with spots, has but a confused idea of a leopard; it not being thereby sufficiently distinguished from a lynx, and several other sorts of beasts that are spotted. So that such an idea, though it hath the peculiar name leopard, is not distinguishable from those designed by the names lynx or panther, and may as well come under the name lynx as leopard. How much the custom of defining of words by general terms contributes to make the ideas we would express by them confused and undetermined, I leave others to consider. This is evident, that confused ideas are such as render the use of words uncertain, and take away the benefit of distinct names. When the ideas, for which we use different terms, have not a difference answerable to their distinct names, and so cannot be distinguished by them, there it is that they are truly confused.|$|E

6000|$|But this {{involved}} {{accuracy of}} the thing makes {{it very difficult to}} do what I now have to do, to describe this accumulation of truth. It is very hard for a man to defend anything of which he is entirely convinced. It is comparatively easy when he is only partially convinced. He is partially convinced because he has found this or that proof of the thing, and he can expound it. But a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it. He is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it. And the more converging reasons he finds pointing to this conviction, the more bewildered he is if asked suddenly to sum them up. Thus, if one asked an ordinary intelligent man, {{on the spur of the}} moment, [...] "Why do you prefer civilization to savagery?" [...] he would look wildly round at object after object, and would only be able to answer vaguely, [...] "Why, there is that bookcase [...] . and the coals in the coal-scuttle [...] . and pianos [...] . and policemen." [...] The whole case for civilization is that the case for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>complex.</b> It has done so many things. But that very multiplicity of proof which ought to make reply overwhelming makes reply impossible.|$|E
