In structural models of the actomyosin complex, this helix on actin was assigned {{a prominent role in}} the strong binding of myosin to actin. Substitution of <b>I</b> <b>341</b> with alanine reduced the strong binding of actin to myosin subfragment- 1 (S 1) 9 -fold compared to wild-type actin. In addition, the Vmax of the actin-activated S 1 ATPase was reduced 4 -fold with no change in the Km. In contrast, substitution of I 345 with alanine had no significant effect on either the strong binding to S 1 or the actin activation of S 1 ATPase. The <b>I</b> <b>341</b> A actin filaments were found to slide in the in Vitro motility assays at a lower mean velocity (1. 6 (0. 4 µm/s) than wildtype actin filaments (2. 6 (0. 3 µm/s).

Here, we report a genetic strategy to identify residues that function in autoinhibition of a novel calmodulin-activated Ca(2 +) -pump with an N-terminal regulatory domain (isoform ACA 2 from Arabidopsis). Mutant pumps with constitutive activity were identified by complementation of a yeast (K 616) deficient in two Ca(2 +) -pumps. Fifteen mutations were found that disrupted {{a segment of the}} N-terminal autoinhibitor located between Lys(23) and Arg(54).

A highly conservative substitution at Asp(219) (D 219 E) still produced a deregulated pump, indicating that the autoinhibitory structure in the stalk is highly sensitive to perturbation.

40|$|The {{development}} of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer is urgently needed. Exploitation of radioiodide uptake by the overexpressed sodium iodide symporter (NIS) has been widely proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy. However, radioiodide uptake is insufficient for tumour destruction. The proto-oncogene PBF binds NIS and inhibits its plasma membrane retention, thereby repressing critical radioiodide uptake in thyroid cancer. This thesis demonstrated that PBF, also upregulated in breast cancer, similarly repressed NIS in breast cancer cells, where phosphorylation of PBF at Y 174 was key to NIS interaction and could be disrupted via treatment with the Src inhibitor dasatinib. Mutation of a predicted Src consensus sequence (EEN/AAA 170 - 172 AAA) abrogated pY 174 PBF and radioiodide uptake repression. In the presence of dasatinib-resistant Src (T <b>341</b> <b>I),</b> dasatinib no longer rescued PBF repression of NIS, indicating that Src specifically mediates PBF phosphorylation. Inhibition of N-myristoylation also significantly increased radioiodide uptake. Combined Src and myristoylation inhibition induced a ~ 70 % increase of radioiodide uptake {{in the absence of}} PBF overexpression. Thus, disrupting Src phosphorylation of PBF by targeted mutagenesis and Src kinase inhibition reveal radioiodide uptake into breast cancer cells can be significantly enhanced through therapeutic approaches focused on Src:PBF:NIS and myristoylation, making radioiodide treatment of breast cancer potentially viable...|$|R

40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} a {{metabolic}} and lysosomal storage disorder caused by the functional defect of the α-galactosidase A enzyme; this defect is due to mutations in the GLA gene, that is composed of seven exons and {{is located on the}} long arm of the X-chromosome (Xq 21 – 22). The enzymatic deficit is responsible for the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes of different cellular types, mainly in those ones of vascular endothelium. It consequently causes a cellular and microvascular dysfunction. In this paper, we described five novel mutations in the GLA gene, related to absent enzymatic activity and typical manifestations of Fabry disease. We identified three mutations (c. 846 _ 847 delTC, p. <b>E</b> <b>341</b> X and p. C 382 X) that lead to the introduction of a stop codon in positions 297, 341 and 382.

The studied patients presented some clinical manifestations, such as cornea verticillata, hypo-anhidrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, cerebrovascular disorders and renal failure, that, considering the null enzymatic activity, suggest that the new mutations reported here are related to the classic form of Fabry disease.

40|$|Cbl {{proteins}} are ubiquitin ligases (E 3 s) {{that play}} a significant role in regulating tyrosine kinase signaling. There are three mammalian family members: Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c. All have a highly conserved N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, a catalytic RING finger domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain that mediates interactions with Src homology 3 (SH 3) containing proteins. Although both Cbl and Cbl-b have been studied widely, little is known about Cbl-c. Published reports have demonstrated that the N terminus of Cbl and Cbl-b have an inhibitory effect on their respective E 3 activity. However, the mechanism for this inhibition is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate that the N terminus of Cbl-c, like that of Cbl and Cbl-b, inhibits the E 3 activity of Cbl-c. Furthermore, we map the region responsible for the inhibition to the EF-hand and SH 2 domains. Phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine (Tyr- 341) in the linker region of Cbl-c by Src or a phosphomimetic mutation of this tyrosine (Y <b>341</b> <b>E)</b> is sufficient to increase the E 3 activity of Cbl-c.

The decreased affinity of the Y <b>341</b> <b>E</b> mutant Cbl-c for UbcH 5 b results in a more rapid turnover of bound UbcH 5 b coincident with the increased E 3 activity.

Mutations found in four families caused amino acid substitutions A <b>341</b> <b>E,</b> A <b>341</b> V, Q 256 K, and H 385 P, which drastically decreased expression of the PIGV protein. Hyperphosphatasia resulted from secretion of ALP, a GPI-anchored protein normally expressed on the cell surface, into serum due to PIGV deficiency. In contrast, a previously reported PIGM deficiency, {{in which there is a}} defect in the transfer of the first mannose, does not result in hyperphosphatasia. To provide insights into the mechanism of ALP secretion in HPMR patients, we took advantage of CHO cell mutants that are defective in various steps of GPI biosynthesis. Secretion of ALP requires GPI transamidase, which in normal cells, cleaves the C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide and replaces it with GPI. The GPI-anchored protein was secreted substantially into medium from PIGV-, PIGB-, and PIGF-deficient CHO cells, in which incomplete GPI bearing mannose was accumulated. In contrast, ALP was degraded in PIGL-, DPM 2 -, or PIGX-deficient CHO cells, in which incomplete shorter GPIs that lacked mannose were accumulated. Our results suggest that GPI transamidase recognizes incomplete GPI bearing mannose and cleaves a hydrophobic signal peptide, resulting in secretion of soluble ALP. These results explain the molecular mechanism of hyperphosphatasia in HPMR...|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{and many}} other countries, obesity {{is viewed as a}} public health crisis that must be handled. Many social and {{individual}} solutions to the problem are proposed in research and policy. On an individual level, many Americans try to get rid of their fat with a multitude of weight loss practices as part of a healthy lifestyle. Obesity rates, feelings towards fatness, and weight control behaviors are significantly affected by a number of sociocultural factors. In this project I explore the relationship between the desire to lose weight and weight control practices with income. Using data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009 - 2010 (N= 4, <b>341),</b> <b>I</b> explore how income is associated with body satisfaction and weight control behaviors. I then examine if specific weight loss strategies differ by SES among those who have tried to lose weight (N= 1, 512). Results indicate that income impacts the desire to lose weight, weight loss attempts (OR=. 778, CI=. 663 -. 913), and some weight control strategies such as exercise (OR= 1. 392, CI= 1. 055 - 1. 836), switching to lower calorie foods (OR= 1. 364, CI= 1. 027 - 1. 813), and eating less fat to lose weight (OR= 1. 449, CI= 1. 094 - 1. 919). However, other sociodemographic characteristics, such as education, gender, and race, played very important roles in predicting these behaviors. Overall, these findings suggest that an individual’s socioeconomic status influences feelings about one’s weight and what one does to change it, but it is only one piece of the puzzle. This study has several implications; most notably that one-size-fits-all obesity solution policy platform cannot be created if real changes are expected.

Specifically, the V 3 region (<b>E.</b> coli <b>341</b> - 534) of this gene has been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired amplicon (V 3 U 341 F/ 534 R) and shotgun sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that extensive length polymorphisms in the V 3 region are a consistent and major cause of differential amplification leading to taxonomic bias in ancient microbiome reconstructions based on amplicon sequencing. We conclude that systematic amplification bias confounds attempts to accurately reconstruct microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16 S rRNA V 3 amplicon data generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis indicates that alternative 16 S rRNA hypervariable regions will present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun metagenomics approach in ancient microbiome reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the Lyα forest at z � 0. 4 from which we {{conclude}} that at least 20 % of the total baryons in the universe are located in the highly-ionized gas traced by broad Lyα absorbers. The cool photoionized low-z intergalactic medium (IGM) probed by narrow Lyα absorbers contains about 30 % of the baryons. We further find that the ratio of broad to narrow Lyα absorbers is higher at z � 0. 4 than at 1. 5 � z � 3. 6, implying that a larger fraction of the low redshift universe is hotter and/or more kinematically disturbed. We base these conclusions on an analysis of 7 QSOs observed with both FUSE and the HST/STIS E 140 M ultraviolet echelle spectrograph. Our sample has <b>341</b> H <b>I</b> absorbers with a total unblocked redshift path of 2. 064. The observed absorber population is complete for log NHI � 13. 2, with a column density distribution f(NHI) ∝ N −β HI. For narrow (b ≤ 40 kms− 1) absorbers β = 1. 76 ± 0. 06. The distribution of the Doppler parameter b at low redshift implies tw...|$|R
