2500|$|On April 5, {{documentary}} filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of {{a meeting}} Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, {{even if it meant}} hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, injure tight end Vernon Davis' ankles and go after kick returner Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback Alex Smith; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, [...] "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, I got the first one. I got the first one. <b>Go</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> Go lay that motherfucker out." [...] Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on Steve Gleason and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to Yahoo! Sports without Gleason's approval. However, the Saints were not penalized for illegal hits during that game, which they lost 36–32.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} Web 2.0's social impact, critics such as Andrew Keen argue that Web 2.0 {{has created a}} cult of digital narcissism and amateurism, which {{undermines}} the notion of expertise by allowing anybody, anywhere to share and place undue value upon their own opinions about any subject and post any kind of content, regardless of their actual talent, knowledge, credentials, biases or possible hidden agendas. Keen's 2007 book, Cult of the Amateur, argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as [...] "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings". In a 1994 Wired interview, Steve Jobs, forecasting the future development of the web for personal publishing, said [...] "The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you - you have to <b>go</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> They can make themselves available, but if nobody wants {{to look at their}} site, that's fine. To be honest, most people who have something to say get published now." [...] Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association has been vocal about his opposition to Web 2.0 {{due to the lack of}} expertise that it outwardly claims, though he believes that there is hope for the future.|$|E
