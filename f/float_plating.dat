These correspond to the Green’s functions for forcing of a <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>floating</b> beam, respectively. For finite water depths the solutions are written as series which are readily summable. When the fluid depth is large, or infinite, the solutions simplify to a sum of special functions, summed over three roots of a fifth-order polynomial.

40|$|The {{formation}} of scour patterns at bridge piers {{is driven by}} the forces at the boundary of the water flow. In most experimental scour studies, indirect processes have been applied to estimate the shear stress using measured velocity profiles. The estimations are based on theoretical models and associated assumptions. However, the turbulence flow fields and boundary layer in the pier-scour region are very complex and lead to low-fidelity results. In addition, available turbulence models cannot account accurately for the bed roughness effect. Direct measurement of the boundary shear stress, normal stress, and their fluctuations are attractive alternatives. However, most direct-measurement shear sensors are bulky in size or not compatible to fluid flow. A sensor has been developed that consists of a <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> with folded beam support and an optical grid on the back, combined with a high-resolution optical position probe. The folded beam support makes the <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> more flexible in the sensing direction within a small footprint, while maintaining high stiffness in the other directions. The <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> converts the shear force to displacement, and the optical probe detects the plate s position with nanometer resolution by sensing the pattern of the diffraction field of the grid through a glass window.

Three <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> overlays are used to cover parts of the open-loop resonator filter to increase the coupling between resonators and move the transmission zeros to the desired frequencies to enhance harmonic suppression. A design procedure developed based on an equivalent circuit model of such new type of filter is proposed. Two experimental prototypes are designed and fabricated to verify the proposed design method. The measured results agree well with the simulations. The measured insertion losses of the prototypes in the passband are all less than 2 dB. One prototype is designed to suppress the third, fourth, and fifth harmonics with suppression greater than 30 dBc.

Substrate movement influences fouling communities and so understanding of how species assemblages are related to specific substrate conditions is crucial as a management tool. Here we describe the species assemblage of the community after six months of development on granite plates in Paranaguá Bay. Species richness was similar in the two treatments, with 12 species on <b>floating</b> (constant depth) <b>plates</b> and 15 on stationary (variable depth) plates. However, species composition differed, with the community on <b>floating</b> <b>plates</b> being dominated by the native bivalve Mytella charruana (66. 1 ± 5. 5 % cover) and that on stationary plates dominated by the barnacles Fistulobalanus citerosum (49. 8 ± 3. 5 % cover) and the introduced Amphibalanus reticulatus (33. 9 ± 3. 7 % cover). Other introduced species were Garveia franciscana, on one stationary plate, and Megabalanus coccopoma also on one stationary plate and not very abundant on half of the <b>floating</b> <b>plates</b> (< 2 %). Thus, stationary plates were more susceptible to introduced species that may become very abundant, suggesting that this type of substrate should be a priority in management for bioinvasion control.

A Commission went to France to investigate, and a special level [...] "Vickers platform" [...] was adopted, to which the wheels and trail were secured for accurate shooting. A major change {{in the line of}} shooting required the platform to be relaid. Setting up and adjusting the platform was labour-intensive. The US manual describes it:"The platform consists of wooden beams which assemble to form a triangular platform. The spade must be removed and a special bracket fitted on the trail when using this platform. This bracket travels in a groove which gives a bearing for the bracket and also provides a means of traversing the piece 52° on the platform. The main objects {{in the use of the}} firing platform are: To provide a reliable support for the wheels and rear end of the trail, so as to prevent sinking or movement when firing on soft ground; to ensure the gun remaining on the target when firing; and to provide means for shifting the trail transversely through an angle of 52° (26° each side of center). By using the traversing gear on the carriage a total traverse of 30° on each side of the center is obtainable...

40|$|The {{steady state}} {{interaction}} of two electrically biased parallel plates {{immersed in a}} flowing plasma characteristic of low earth orbit is studied numerically. Fluid equations are developed to describe {{the motion of the}} cold positively charged plasma ions, and are solved using finite-differences in two dimensions on a Cartesian grid. The behavior of the plasma electrons is assumed to be described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Results are compared to an analytical and a particle simulation technique for a simplified flow geometry consisting of a single semi-infinite negatively biased plate. Comparison of the extent of the electrical disturbance into the flowing plasma and the magnitude of the current collected by the plate is very good. The interaction of two equally biased parallel plates is studied as a function of applied potential. The separation distance at which the current collected by either plate decreases by five and twenty percent is determined as a function of applied potential. The percent decreases were based on a non-interacting case. The decrease in overall current is caused by a decrease in ionic density in the region between the plates. As the separation between the plates decreases, the plates collect the ions at a faster rate than they are supplied to the middle region by the oncoming plasma flow. The docking of spacecraft in orbit is simulated by moving two plates of unequal potential toward one another in a quasi-static manner. One plate is held at a large negative potential while the other floats electrically in the resulting potential field. It is found that the <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> does not charge continuously negative as it approaches the other more negatively biased plate. Instead, it charges more and then less negative as ionic current decreases and then increases respectively upon approach. When the two plates come into contact, it is expected that the electrically <b>floating</b> <b>plate</b> will charge rapidly negative to a potential near that of the other plate...|$|R

After reviewing the previous work on propagation of through-cracks due to transverse loads, the three-dimensional problem of part-through cracks is simplified as two-dimensional using the well known approximation by line springs. These nonlinear springs describe the relation of rotation and additional in-plane expansion due to part-through crack to the bending moment and normal force transmitted through the crack. The problem of several radial cracks emanating from a small loaded area is analyzed.
