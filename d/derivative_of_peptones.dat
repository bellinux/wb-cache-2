Methods: In the present study, the effect of different concentration <b>of</b> <b>peptones</b> on a recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line grown in three serum-free suspension cultures was determined. Six <b>peptones</b> <b>of</b> different origins and available amino acid profiles were investigated regarding their impact on cell growth, productivity, and metabolic pathways changes.

30|$|The {{response}} surface plot of Fig.  1 d–f shows the effect <b>of</b> <b>peptone</b> concentration and temperature on the yield and activity of biosurfactants produced by L. paracasei N 2. It {{can be seen}} from Fig.  1 that increase in peptone concentration up to 6  g/L and temperature from 30 to 35  °C stimulates the production of biosurfactant. The linear coefficients <b>of</b> <b>peptone</b> concentration on the yield, antimicrobial activity and surface tension reduction of biosurfactants also show the positive effect <b>of</b> increased <b>peptone</b> concentration on production of biosurfactant by L. paracasei N 2. The maximum yield and biosurfactant activities were observed at a <b>peptone</b> concentration <b>of</b> 6  g/L in the culture medium. The results of this study are in accordance with those reported by Rodrigues et al. (2006 a). They found that the optimum medium composition for biosurfactant production from S. thermophilus A was at a <b>peptone</b> concentration <b>of</b> 5.0  g/L and that, below this concentration, the yield of biosurfactant was low, as observed in the present study. However, in the present study, when the peptone concentration was more than 6  g/L and temperature above 35  °C, a decrease in the yield and activities of biosurfactant was observed. The negative and significant (p[*]<[*] 0.05) effect of the quadratic term <b>of</b> <b>peptone</b> concentration on yield and antimicrobial activity of biosurfactant as well as its positive and significant (p[*]<[*] 0.05) effect on the reduction of surface tension confirm the decline in yield and activity of biosurfactant (Table  4). The inhibiting effect of high concentration <b>of</b> <b>peptone</b> may be explained by the retro-inhibition effect of glutamine on glutamine synthetase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of biosurfactants. Studies have indicated a direct relationship between increased glutamine synthetase activity and enhanced biosurfactant production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown in nitrate and proteose peptone media (Mulligan and Gibbs 1989). The nitrogen source is an important key to the regulation of biosurfactant production (Burkovski 2003). It represents a fundamental macronutrient for cellular metabolism. When the medium is nitrogen-limited, the protein synthesis is blocked and the cellular metabolism is switched to carbohydrate synthesis, and hence biosurfactant production is enhanced (Mulligan and Gibbs 1989). Conversely, an excess of nitrogen source, as observed in this study with increasing peptone concentration, leads to a decrease in the biosurfactant synthesis, driving the metabolism towards cell growth (Abalos et al. 2002).|$|R
