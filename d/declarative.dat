40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the observation that}} disjunction cannot take wide scope in negative non-wh-questions and <b>declaratives</b> with a preposed negative element. This rules out the alternative question reading for non-wh-questions with preposed negation and the wide scope or read-ing for neg-inverted <b>declaratives.</b> We show that effects parallel to the ones associated with preposed negation can be reproduced in affirma-tive non-wh-questions and <b>declaratives</b> when focus is involved. We propose that preposed negation in non-wh-questions and preposed neg-ative adverbials in <b>declaratives</b> necessarily contribute focus marking (in particular, verum focus) and argue {{that the lack of}} wide scope disjunction reading in both <b>declaratives</b> and non-wh-questions results as a by-product of the interaction between focus and the LF syntax of disjunctive structures, which we argue involves ellipsis...|$|R

5|$|The album {{revealed}} {{a more personal}} side of the singer, illustrated in its <b>declarative</b> theme of emancipation from her previous marriage, and from her personal and professional setbacks. Although it shared similar vocal production {{as well as an}} inclination to her signature pop and R ballads, the album also encompassed a variety of dance-oriented and uptempo styles. It {{was meant to be a}} continuation, or a second part of her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Carey collaborated with a number of artists on the album, including T-Pain, Damian Marley and Young Jeezy. Though considered by critics very similar to the formula its predecessor had been built on, E=MC² included other genres she had never explored, such as reggae, and her continued recording of gospel-influenced hymns.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a <b>declarative</b> main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} embedded <b>declaratives</b> {{and their}} force of expressing assertion, {{a topic that}} was debated by Anna-Lena Wiklund and Marit Julien in both numbers of this working paper series 2009. Two questions are focused: “Is the assertedness of V 2 de­claratives in Mainland Scandinavian structurally inherent?” and “Can also embedded non-V 2 <b>declaratives</b> express assertion?” The answer here is yes on both questions, which means that I take a third position beside the ones raised in the previous debate. A swear word test, originally proposed by Julien, but rejected by Wiklund, is also scrutinized. It is shown that swear words actually {{can be used to}} discriminate between asserted and non-asserted <b>declaratives.</b> However, the dividing line does not go between V 2 and non-V 2 clauses, as assumed by Julien...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an account of}} the semantic content and conventional discourse effects of a range of sentence types in English, namely falling <b>declaratives,</b> polar interrogatives and certain kinds of rising <b>declaratives</b> and tag interrogatives. The account aims to divide the labor between compositional semantics and conventions of use in a principled way. We argue that falling <b>declaratives</b> and polar interrogatives are unmarked sentence types. On our account, differences in their conventional discourse effects follow from independently motivated semantic differences combined with a single convention of use, which applies uniformly to both sentence types. As a result, the Fregean ‘illocutionary force operators’ Assertion and Question become unnecessary. In contrast, we argue that rising <b>declaratives</b> and tag interrogatives are marked sentence types. On our account, their conventional discourse effects consist of the effects that are dictated by the basic convention of use that is common to all sentence types considered here, augmented with special effects that are systematically connected to their formal properties. Thus, a central feature of our approach is that it maintains a parallelism between unmarked and marked sentence types on the one hand, and basic and complex discourse effects on the other...|$|R

Background 1. 1. Previous analysis. <b>Declaratives</b> The present study is based on results of my previous investigation of rhythm and tonal courses in Mongolian <b>declaratives.</b> Focus in <b>declaratives</b> is signaled by a tonal peak that tends to get the greatest value in the utterance.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} how word order interacts with prosody in the expression of sentence modality and different focus constructions in different varieties of Catalan and Spanish. We analyze a corpus obtained by means of two tasks: a) a production test designed to elicit different focus constructions by means of question-answer pairs from short picture stories and b) the Discourse Completion Task methodology. The collected data were prosodically and syntactically annotated. Our data confirm that in Catalan and Spanish the intonational prominence tends to be located in clause-final position but this is completely true only for broad focus <b>declaratives,</b> since the main prominence can also fall on clause-initial position in Eastern Catalan and Basque Spanish informational focus <b>declaratives</b> or remain in situ in both informational and contrastive focus <b>declaratives</b> (especially in val_cat or Spanish). As for interrogative modality, an important distinction is made between languages that can present subject-verb inversion in direct questions (val_cat and Spanish) and languages that cannot (Eastern Catalan).

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the present study}} is to de-scribe the basic {{prosodic}} differences between <b>declaratives</b> and polar questions in Fataluku, an underdocumented Papuan language spoken in the island nation of East Timor. Two robust prosodic differences between statements and questions are observed, namely, the duration of the final vowel and the intonational tune at the right margin of the sentence. Declara-tives have a shorter final vowel that carries a low f 0, while questions have a much longer final vowel that has a rising-falling f 0 pat-tern. I postulate a L % boundary tone for <b>declaratives</b> and a L+HL % boundary tone for questions, proposing that the final syllables of questions are lengthened to accommodate the more complex sequence of final tones. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} intonational {{properties}} {{of different types}} of interrogatives in Persian in the framework of the autosegmental-metrical theory of intonation. The structures studied are different types of yes/no questions, WH-questions, tag questions, and echo questions. The results, which are based on a total of nearly 400 read utterances recorded in laboratory conditions, show that the Persian Accentual Phrase (AP) with the pitch accent (L+) H* is present in all question types. Yes/no questions, whose accentuation follows the same constraints as <b>declaratives,</b> are characterized by a high Intonational Phrase boundary tone (H%), and have a greater pitch excursion and more final lengthening on the last AP than <b>declaratives.</b> The inclusion of particles and words such as aya, m?ge, and hi&# 269; in the question adds an AP but does not change the core intonation pattern. In (multiple) WH-questions, which have a falling intonation similar to <b>declaratives,</b> the (final) WH-word is the nuclear pitch accent, followed by the deaccentuation of the upcoming elements. Echo questions end high and the boundary tone of their final AP can be either high or low. Contrastive focus APs are higher and longer than ordinary APs and deaccent what follows, even if it includes a WH-word...|$|R

25|$|<b>Declarative</b> {{programming}} languages {{describe what}} computation {{should be performed}} and not how to compute it. <b>Declarative</b> programs omit the control flow and are considered sets of instructions. Two broad categories of <b>declarative</b> languages are functional languages and logical languages. The principle behind functional languages (like Haskell) is to not allow side effects, which {{makes it easier to}} reason about programs like mathematical functions. The principle behind logical languages (like Prolog) is to define the problem to be solved– the goal– and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself. The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is backtracked and another path is systematically attempted.|$|E
25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and anterograde amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for <b>declarative</b> memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} <b>declarative</b> memories. This type of dissociation between <b>declarative</b> and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming.

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} realizations of Damascene Arabic (DA) intonation contours {{with regard to}} four syntactic categories: <b>declaratives,</b> continuatives, yes/no-questions and wh-questions. The study used the British nuclear framework, describing the nucleus and three optional elements (pre-head, head and tail). Contours were transcribed using INSTINT (Hirst & Di Cristo, 1998) 1. The speech material was collected from two Damascene informants who read a series of prompts. Utterances were chosen from the collected data to represent {{a wide range of}} possible realizations {{for each of the four}} syntactic categories. Analysis of contour elements was then conducted with Praat version 4. 4. 16 (Boersma & Weenink, 2006). <b>Declaratives</b> showed global downdrift 2, with stressed syllables higher and unstressed syllables lower. <b>Declaratives</b> exhibited a prehead with mid pitch, falls on the nuclei, and utterance final fall in the tail. Certain stressed non-nuclear syllables were particularly prominent and showed a large F 0 change. Unusual realizations included a curving rise-fall pattern in the head and tail, as well as a local final rise to sustained Mid in the tail. Continuatives followed a global rising pattern throughout the utterance.
