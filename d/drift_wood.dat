60|$|Such {{a bridge}} as this answers {{a very good}} {{temporary}} purpose, and in still water, as, for example, over narrow lakes or very sluggish streams, where {{there is very little}} current, a floating structure of this kind is sometimes built for permanent service. Such bridges will not, however, stand on broad and rapid rivers liable to floods. The pressure of the water alone, in such cases, would very much endanger all the fastenings; and in cases where <b>drift</b> <b>wood</b> or ice is brought down by the stream, the floating masses, not being able to pass under the bridge, would accumulate above it, and would soon bear upon it with so enormous a pressure that nothing could withstand its force. The bridge would be broken away, and the whole accumulation--bridge, drift-wood, and ice--would be borne irresistibly down the stream together.|$|E
60|$|Leaving our mules with an attendant, {{we began}} to climb the rough and rocky gorge which, as the breadth diminishes, becomes {{exceedingly}} picturesque. In one part, {{the side of a}} limestone hill hundreds of feet in height, has slipped into the chasm, half filling it with gigantic boulders: through these the noisy stream whirls, now falling in small cascades, then gliding over slabs of sheet rock: here it cuts grooved channels and deep basins clean and sharp as artificial baths in the sandstone, there it flows quietly down a bed of pure sparkling sand. The high hills above are of a tawny yellow: the huge boulders, grisly white, bear upon their summits the <b>drift</b> <b>wood</b> of the last year's inundation. During the monsoon, when a furious torrent sweeps down from the Wagar Hills, this chasm must afford a curiously wild spectacle.|$|E

The evening before, the youth {{went down to the}} rocks and into the copse, {{collecting}} all the <b>drift</b> <b>wood</b> the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down, and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door, so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day. As soon as his task was done, he paused and looked out towards the mainland, thinking of Christmas Eve last year, and the merry dance they had had. The night was still and cold, and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost sea across to the opposite coast, when, suddenly, he noticed a boat, which seemed steering straight for the island. At first he could hardly stand for joy, the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful; but as the boat drew near there was something, he could not tell what, that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life, and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours. Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack, and waited for what might happen next.|$|E

The study of some large specimens of E. sebastiani, collected at the type locality, shows that there are several relevant morphological differences between the two species and thus both species names must be regarded as distinct.

The mighty roaring of the conflagration, together with our solitary and somewhat unsafe position (for {{there was no one}} within six miles of us,) rendered the scene very impressive. Occasionally, one of us would remove his pipe from his mouth and say, [...] "Superb! magnificent!

60|$|John Meredith walked meditatively {{through the}} clear {{crispness}} of a winter night in Rainbow Valley. The hills beyond glistened with the chill splendid lustre of moonlight on snow. Every little fir {{tree in the}} long valley sang its own wild song to the harp of wind and frost. His children and the Blythe lads and lasses were coasting down the eastern slope and whizzing over the glassy pond.

On the right the lights of Ingleside gleamed through the maple grove with the genial lure and invitation which seems always to glow in the beacons of a home where we know there is love and good-cheer and a welcome for all kin, whether of flesh or spirit. Mr. Meredith liked very well on occasion to spend an evening arguing with the doctor by the <b>drift</b> <b>wood</b> fire, where the famous china dogs of Ingleside kept ceaseless watch and ward, as became deities of the hearth, but to-night he did not look that way.

60|$|The Carabidæ consist chiefly {{of seven}} {{peculiar}} genera of Anchomenini comprising fifty-one species, and several endemic species of Bembidiinæ. They are highly peculiar and {{are all of}} small size, and may have originally reached the islands in the crevices of the <b>drift</b> <b>wood</b> from N.W. America which is still thrown on their shores, or, more rarely, {{by means of a}} similar drift from the N.-Western islands of the Pacific.[75] It {{is interesting to note that}} peculiar species of the same groups of Carabidæ are found in the Azores, Canaries, and St. Helena, indicating that they possess some special facilities for transmission across wide oceans and for establishing themselves upon oceanic islands. The Staphylinidæ present many peculiar species of known genera. Being still more minute and usually more ubiquitous than the Carabidæ, there is no difficulty in accounting for their presence in the islands by the same means of dispersal. The Nitidulidæ, Ptinidæ, and Ciodidæ being very small and of varied habits, either the perfect insects, their eggs or larvæ, may have been introduced either by water or wind carriage, or through the agency of birds. The Curculionidæ, being wood bark or nut borers, would have considerable facilities for transmission by floating timber, fruits, or nuts; and the eggs or larvæ of the {321} peculiar Cerambycidæ must have been introduced by the same means. The absence of so many important and cosmopolitan groups whose size or constitution render them incapable of being thus transmitted over the sea, as well as of many which seem equally well adapted as those which are found in the islands, indicate how rare have been the conditions for successful immigration; and this is still further emphasized by the extreme specialisation of the fauna, indicating that there has been no repeated immigration of the same species which would tend, as in the case of Bermuda, to preserve the originally introduced forms unchanged by the effects of repeated intercrossing.|$|E
40|$|Typhoon Man-yi caused heavy {{rainfall}} in Kyoto and Shiga area during September 15 - 16, 2013. Since sea water temperature around the Japanese Archipelago {{was higher than}} usual by 1 - 2 ℃ in the summer season, both the typhoon and rainy front delivered extraordinary water vapor to Kyoto and Shiga area. Rainfall intensity in short periods was not so high but longer ones such as 12, 24 and 48 hrs reached almost equal to the maximum records. Total average rainfall in the Yodo river basin was up to 269 mm which is estimated more than 200 years return period. During the flood, several multipurpose dams located upstream of the Yodo river basin had effectively controlled inflow discharges coordinately. Especially in the Katsura river basin, Hiyoshi dam operated from 1998 by the Japan Water Agency had drastically cut the peak flow discharge from 1, 694 m 3 /s to 148 m 3 /s. This remarkable flood control operation was based on advanced rainfall monitoring and runoff prediction systems. Cooperated decision making by the Kinki Regional Management Bureau, MLIT and the Japan Water Agency had successfully guided dam operation based on downstream flood flow predictions. Without this operation, more severe flood damages may {{have occurred in the}} downstream reaches of the Katsura river including Kameoka, Arashiyama and Kyoto city areas. Additionally, huge <b>drift</b> <b>woods</b> up to 13, 500 m 3 have been accumulated in Hiyoshi dam reservoir during the flood. They have been delivered both from upstream mountains and river channels. Without trapping by the dam, they have been directly discharged downstream and might have increased flood damages by clogging at crossing bridges and flowing into inundated area. Moreover, flood peak cut by Hiyoshi dam might have decreased additional production of <b>drift</b> <b>woods</b> from the downstream river channel. These multiple functions should be studied further to clarify the total benefit of flood control dams. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, 16 marine-derived fungi were {{isolated}} from {{four types of}} marine materials including float, algae, animals and <b>drift</b> <b>woods</b> along with the coast of Jeju Island, Korea and evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated RAW 24. 7 cells. The broth and mycelium extracts from the 16 fungi were prepared and the broth extract (BE) of Eurotium amstelodami (015 - 2) inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells without cytotoxicity. By further bioassay-guided isolation, three compounds including asperflavin, neoechinulin A and preechinulin were successfully isolated from the BE of E. amstelodami. It was revealed that asperflavin showed no cytotoxicity up to 200 μM and significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO and PGE 2 production in a dose-dependent manner. In the western blot results, asperflavin suppressed only inducible NOS (iNOS), but COX- 2 were slightly down-regulated. Asperflavin was also observed to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6. In conclusion, this study reports a potential use of asperflavin isolated from a marine fungus, E. amstelodami as an anti-inflammatory agent via suppression of iNOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as no cytotoxicity...|$|R

Lithofacies and ichnofossil examination indicate coastal, lacustrine, paludal and lagoonal sedimentation. Valuable new data are supplied by trace fossils, a feature not considered {{yet in the}} literature on the Upper Cretaceous of the North Sudetic Basin. Trace fossils are overall abundant in {{the upper part of the}} Nowogrodziec Member and overlying part of the Czerna Formation. The following ichnogenera: Thalassinoides, Ophiomorpha, Asterosoma, Palaeophycus, Planolites, Skolithos, Teredolites, Chondrites, Cylindrichnus, Arenicolites, Rosselia, Teichichnus, Phycodes, Phycosiphon, and Schaubcylindrichnus are represented. The trace fossils represent the Skolithos, Teredolites and Cruziana ichnofacies. The Cruziana Ichnofacies is typified by the richest trace fossil assemblage characteristic of its archetypal, proximal and stressed expressions. An upper shoreface to foreshore origin of these sediments is documented using lithofacies and the ichnofossils Ophiomorpha and Thalassinoides in the exposed part of the Żerkowice Member. Dominance of kaolinite, lack of burrows and upward passage into paludal deposits is interpreted to indicate a lacustrine origin of variegated clayey mudstone at the base of the Nowogrodziec Member. The changes of depositional environments are interpreted as resulting from separation of the area from the open sea by a sand barrier formed due to the termination of the forced regression. Siltstones containing plant roots and fragments of <b>drifted</b> <b>wood</b> showing the trace fossil Teredolites clavatus, together with coal-seams containing Thalassinoides isp., are assigned to indicate a coastal plain, paludal deposition of the overlying part of the Nowogrodziec Member and incursion of marine waters. The fining upward sequence constituting the top part of the Nowogrodziec Member and showing almost archetypal Cruziana Ichnofacies substituted by its expression indicative of highly stressed, brackish conditions are shown to indicate extensive drowning of the area and lagoonal sedimentation. Termination of the drowning, embodied in a maximum flooding surface, is indicated in a bed of coaly mudstone at the top of the Nowogrodziec Member. Sedimentation on a periodically prograded brackish bay shoreface is inferred from lithofacies, ichnofossils and body fossils for the deposits overlying the Nowogrodziec Member and topping the examined succession. The trace fossils indicate Cruziana Ichnofacies and Skolithos Ichnofacies in the expression of slightly stressed environ- ments. The whole examined part of the Czerna Formation is interpreted as a fifth-order transgressive-regressive cycle...|$|R
