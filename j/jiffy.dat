25|$|<b>Jiffy</b> is a {{brand of}} baking mixes marketed by the Chelsea Milling Company in Chelsea, Michigan, that has been {{producing}} mixes since 1930. The company was previously named Chelsea Roller Mill. They {{are known for their}} products being packaged in a recognizable, small box with the brand's logo in blue. <b>Jiffy</b> was created as the first prepared baking mix in the United States by Mabel White Holmes.|$|E

That year Hicks Muse gained entry into Latin America with its {{purchases}} of cash-starved Mexican companies, including Seguros Commercial America, one of the country's largest insurers.

25|$|Beginning in the 1990s the Board of Supervisors updated the Buchanan Field Airport Master Plan. Commercial {{development}} of adjacent property such as Sam's Club, Taco Bell, Sports Authority, and <b>Jiffy</b> Lube was allowed in 1992. The future direction of this airport {{is always in}} question because of its location on prime property {{in the middle of}} the city of Concord with no room to grow, and noise concerns. The County has developed a new airport in Byron in the eastern part of the county.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{the company}} began {{expansion}} into the food service and institutional industries due {{to a decline in}} the home-baking products market. In 2015, this expansion effort was significantly increased, in order to better-enable the company to fulfill the needs of these industries and markets. Expansion plans were in part based upon company projections predicting that many company employees will be retiring between 2006 and 2018. In 2015, 173 of the company's employees are qualified for retirement. Expansion plans include the introduction and implementation of more modern equipment, which requires fewer personnel to operate, and an increased capacity for storage. In 2013, as part of the plans to keep the company moving forward into the future, a new research and development facility was built that cost over $6 million. The company plans for the expansions to conclude by fall 2017. In 2013, Chelsea Milling Company produced 180 million boxes of <b>Jiffy</b> mix during their busy season, which runs from September through January.|$|E
500|$|Suresh Krishnamoorthy of [...] The Hindu summarised, [...] "Magadheera {{is not for}} the weak-hearted, {{those who}} do not like the sight of blood and neither is it for those who like movies with storylines that are much-closer-to-everyday- reality. But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The way he has used the {{flashback}} as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a <b>jiffy</b> is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers." [...] B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, [...] "Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart-touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film." [...] He added, [...] "After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain", and rated the film 3 out of 5.|$|E

2500|$|On February 16, 1978, Duty and Anthony Trombitas, {{whom he had}} met {{about four}} to five days earlier, robbed the <b>Jiffy</b> Mart {{convenience}} store on Falcon Road in Altus, {{north of the border}} with Texas. During the robbery, which netted some beer and money, ranging in various accounts from $7.66 to $18, the two men abducted store clerk Linda Hall (no relation). After driving her to a barn in Tillman County, Duty raped Hall and shot her {{in the back of the}} head three times with a [...]22 caliber pistol. Trombitas then hit her with a stick, which Duty identified as a broom handle. Though left for dead, Hall was able to walk a mile (1.6km) to a house for help and recovered at Tillman County Memorial Hospital. The two men drove off to Frederick, then Electra, and proceeded to Fort Worth. Upon hearing a radio report about her on the next day, Duty said, [...] "I was surprised that she was still alive." [...] Duty returned to Altus the following month, presuming that law enforcement officers were going to catch up with him anyway. He was arrested on the street after calling the police and hanging up from a payphone at another <b>Jiffy</b> Mart near the downtown square.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{evolution}} of technique in his illustration, Grossman has said, [...] "I {{was impressed by the}} way David Levine and the Push Pin artists were using line to develop a bulgy three-dimensional feeling in their work. I found an old airbrush in my dad's shop and discovered a <b>jiffy</b> way to outbulge them all. For a while I diligently pursued outline-less-ness as the secret to a real stereoscopic three-dimensional look. I felt my line work belonged to a different world {{that had nothing to do}} with the airbrush and went its separate way. Lately I find a strong line reasserting itself in my pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{expectations}} placed on women {{by their own}} religions, society also holds certain biases against women of certain religions that causes them to have less success in the job market. [...] This is seen most often among Muslim women who express their religion by [...] wearing modest clothing and traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs. This was proven by {{a study by the}} Bristol school of Sociology that showed that Muslim women were 70 percent more likely to be unsuccessful in looking for work than Christian and nonreligious women. [...] These numbers stem from discriminatory actions on various levels of society that often lead Muslim women to lose their jobs or have trouble finding jobs. For example, on the local level, a woman was fired from a <b>Jiffy</b> Lube for wearing her hijab to work because it apparently violated the company's [...] "no hat" [...] rule. The company suffered no repercussions for this action. [...] On the federal level, the court case Webb v Philadelphia ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, which is a requirement for women in her religion, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality and therefore could be terminated for her choice to wear it. This ruling makes this type of discrimination precedent for similar situations and makes it harder to traditional Muslim women to find and hold professional careers. There are laws against this type of discrimination, such as America's Title XII of their Civil Right's Act of 1964 which makes it illegal for businesses to discriminate against their employees [...] based on their sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, but even so this sort of religious and gender discrimination often intersect and lead to the feminization of poverty within certain communities.|$|E
2500|$|As of January 1, 2017 {{only the}} host of the event, Insane Clown Posse has {{accepted}} an invitation, and no one has declined. On January 2, 2017 Esham declined the invite stating in part [...] "I do not wish to put myself, my family or my team in any position to sustain bodily harm". Also on January 2, 2017 Wolfpac accepted the invite to perform, March and take part in the Family Psypher. On January 2, 2017 Killa C declined the invite (as he is now a devout Christian and no longer does horrorcore). Also on the same day other artist, 2 Live Crew, Glasses Malone and Kissing Candice accepted the invite. A few hours later Anybody Killa, Big Hoodoo, Blahzay Roze, DJ Clay, Jumpsteady, Lyte, JellyRoll, Vanilla Ice, Lil Wyte and Kung Fu Vampire all accepted invites for the March. A few hours later in the mid evening of January 2, 2017 Twiztid and Scum accepted their invites. Late in the night of January 2, 2017 Liquid Assassin and Bukshot accepted their invites to the March. On January 3, 2017 artists Necro and Sewerside accepted their invites, while The R.O.C. declined. In the early afternoon on January 3, 2017 Project Born accepted their invites to the March. On January 4, 2017 the list updated to show that Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Lex [...] "The Hex" [...] Master, G-Mo Skee, Boondox and Young Wicked have all declined via a post on Facebook. Since Young Wicked will not take part in the March, Axe Murder Boyz too will not take part. On January 5, 2017 Zug Izland accepted their invite for the March. On January 11, 2017 Lo Key accepted his invite for the March. On January 12, 2017, MC Chris declined his invite stating in part, [...] "I do not have a problem with Juggalos, but I will decline the invite because I have a upcoming fall tour, and am dependent on the DC market to make a living". On January 13, 2017 Potluck announced that they were no longer performing together, and have officially disbanded, thus they will not perform at the 2017 Juggalo March On Washington. On February 26, 2017 it was announced by the venue that Sam Hunt is scheduled to perform at the <b>Jiffy</b> Lube Center on September 16, 2017 and there never was any Insane Clown Posse or Psychopathic Records event ever scheduled to perform that night.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{contract}} is written down, {{there is a}} basic presumption that the written document will conterms of an agreement, and when commercial parties sign documents every term {{referred to in the}} document binds them, unless the term is found to be unfair, the signed document is merely an administrative paper, or under the very limited defence of non est factum. The rules differ in principle for employment contracts, and consumer contracts, or wherever a statutory right is engaged, and so the signature rule matters most in commercial dealings, where businesses place a high value on certainty. If a statement is a term, and the contracting party has not signed a document, then terms may be incorporated by reference to other sources, or through a course of dealing. The basic rule, set out in Parker v South Eastern Railway Company, is that reasonable notice of a term is required to bind someone. Here Mr Parker left his coat in the Charing Cross railway station cloakroom and was given a ticket that on the back said liability for loss was limited to £10. The Court of Appeal sent this back to trial for a jury (as existed at the time) to determine. The modern approach is to add that if a term is particularly onerous, greater notice with greater clarity ought to be given. Denning LJ in J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw famously remarked that [...] "Some clauses which I have seen would need to be printed in red ink {{on the face of the}} document with a red hand pointing to it before the notice could be held to be sufficient." [...] In Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd a car park ticket referring to a notice inside the car park was insufficient to exclude the parking lot's liability for personal injury of customers on its premises. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Ltd Bingham LJ held that a notice inside a <b>jiffy</b> bag of photographic transparencies about a fee for late return of the transparencies (which would have totalled £3,783.50 for 47 transparencies after only a month) was too onerous a term to be incorporated without clear notice. By contrast in O'Brien v MGN Ltd Hale LJ held that the failure of the Daily Mirror to say in every newspaper that if there were too many winners in its free draw for £50,000 that there would be another draw was not so onerous on the disappointed [...] "winners" [...] as to prevent incorporation of the term. It can also be that a regular and consistent course of dealings between two parties lead the terms from previous dealings to be incorporated into future ones. In Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd the Court of Appeal held that Mr Hollier, whose car was burnt in a fire caused by a careless employee at Rambler Motors' garage, was not bound by a clause excluding liability for [...] "damage caused by fire" [...] on the back of an invoice which he had seen three or four times in visits over the last five years. This was not regular or consistent enough. But in British Crane Hire Corporation Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd Lord Denning MR held that a company hiring a crane was bound by a term making them pay for expenses of recovering the crane when it sunk into marshland, after only one prior dealing. Of particular importance was the equal bargaining power of the parties.|$|E
