50|$|RTTY {{uses the}} ITA2 (Baudot code) {{character}} code. ITA2 is a five bit code with 32 possible code points. Four code points {{are used for}} null (BLANK), space (SPACE), carriage return (CR), and line feed (LF). Two code points are used for a letter shift (LTRS) or a <b>figure</b> <b>shift</b> (FIGS). The remaining 26 code points are used for characters in the letters and figures sets. Consequently, ITA2 can represent 52 (2*26) additional characters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>figure</b> <b>shift</b> (FIGS) and {{letter shift}} (LETRS) {{characters}} determined how {{the receiving end}} interpreted the string of characters up to the next shift character. Because {{of the danger of}} a shift character being corrupted, some operators would type a pair of shift characters when changing from letters to numbers or vice versa. So they would type 55M88 to represent a full stop. Such doubling of characters was very helpful for the statistical cryptanalysis used at Bletchley Park. After encipherment, shift characters had no special meaning.|$|E

The style of many of these <b>figures</b> <b>shifted</b> from the traditional gloss-coat enamel paint to the matte-finished acrylic paint, which allows for greater detail and historical accuracy. The change was largely inspired by the introduction of very high quality painted figures from St. Petersburg, Russia.|$|R

Forty-two functional control positions are provided, some of which as used for functions such as carriage return, line feed, <b>figures</b> <b>shift,</b> letters shift, unshift-on-space and the signal bell. The removable Electrical Service Unit (LESU) is an integrated chassis housing the line fuse, convenience receptacle, terminal blocks for wiring options and mounting facilities for optional sub-assemblies.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a method for}} loading surface electrode ion traps by electron impact ionization. The method relies on the property of surface electrode geometries that the trap depth can be increased {{at the cost of}} more micromotion. By introducing a buffer gas, we can counteract the rf heating assocated with the micromotion and benefit from the larger trap depth. After an initial loading of the trap, standard compensation techniques can be used to cancel the stray fields resulting from charged dielectric and allow for the loading of the trap at ultra-high vacuum.

50|$|The {{mood for}} this {{movement}} is set with flowing arpeggios over which a romantic wide-spanning theme is floated. Textures {{such as these}} proliferate, contrasting strongly with the outer movements. A continually repeated falling figure acts as an accompaniment, giving an overall impression of stillness. At the marking Molto tranquillo, this <b>figure</b> <b>shifts</b> to the right hand and the theme to the left hand. The music climaxes with frenetic arpeggios in the right hand as the bass slips lower down the keyboard and the main theme is grandly sounded in chords written over four staves. The music dies away {{with the return of}} the repeated figure.|$|R

50|$|At 106 bars in length, {{the large}} {{exposition}} section contains {{most of the}} musical ideas presented in the first movement. After the opening whip-crack and snare drum roll, the piano is introduced, providing a methodical accompanying figure as the winds present the first subject. Soon, the piano stops and the orchestra roars to life with each section adding to the theme, eventually drifting into an eerie, dream-like statement from the piano. This soliloquy is short-lived as the orchestra reenters with a blues-influenced <b>figure,</b> <b>shifting</b> between major and minor modes. The second subject begins with an awkward dissonance (A and B), but quickly establishes itself as a richly melodic section, reminiscent of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{alphabet}} {{used in the}} ARQ-M protocol {{is based}} on the CCITT Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 more commonly known as Baudot. [...] This alphabet has five bits, and therefore has 25 or 32 different possible symbols. It uses letters <b>shift</b> and <b>figures</b> <b>shifts</b> to select different sets of characters similar to a typewriter. The ARQ-M alphabet being synchronous always has to send data and does not have gaps between characters. It does not include start and stop bits that would be used in asynchronous transmissions and so saves on those two bits per character. In asynchronous transmissions a steady stop signal indicates that there is nothing to send. A prolonged start signal can be used for signalling, for example to select a destination for a telex connection.|$|R

40|$|The ghost {{figure in}} twentieth-century fictions {{perfectly}} embodies the inclusion and normalization of formerly monstrous others {{that results from}} the loss of referents, questioning of boundaries, and destabilization of the self in the postmodern era. In an era of gross commodification, with all foundational truths under constant scrutiny, we adjust our self-constructs, unable to impose labels and meanings with certainty and, as recent depictions of spectres illustrate, supposed others become more of a daily presence. With identification and interpretation possible only in context, the beholder's hesitation is a space that contains the ghost. Dubiety regarding phantoms is lessening because uncertainty about former adversaries is increasingly giving way to an understanding of multiplicity in supposed others. [...] This thesis shows the ghost <b>figure</b> <b>shifting</b> from fearful other to nearly human. Chapter One explains the theory behind this dissertation. Chapter Two discusses the simultaneous absence and presence of a ghost in both Henry James's The Tum of the Screw and Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House. Chapter Three explores how two 1970 s novels, Stephen King's The Shining and Peter Straub's Ghost Story, cast ghosts as both independent and specular at once. Chapter Four focuses exclusively on Toni Morrison's Beloved in which the ghost is normalized almost instantaneously. Chapter Five analyzes Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride and Michael Ondaatje's Ani/'s Ghost to show just how ubiquitous, elusive, and specular the ghost figure has become. Ultimately, the distinction between ghost and human has become so tenuous that the only productive response is to accept that the ghost and human, however different, are one...|$|R

Electric utility companies have the options of reducing their use of fossil fuels, switching to alternative energy sources, increasing efficiency, or offsetting carbon emissions. This study determined the cost and profitability of sequestering carbon in green ash plantations, {{and the number of}} tons of carbon that can be sequestered. The profitability of green ash is $ 2, 342 and $ 3, 645 per acre on site indices (measurement of soil quality) 65 and 105 land, respectively, calculated with a 2. 5 % alternative rate of return (ARR). These <b>figures</b> <b>shift</b> to –$ 248 and –$ 240 calculated with a 15. 0 % ARR. If landowners who have an ARR of 2. 5 % can sell carbon credits for $ 10 per ton of carbon, profits will increase by $ 107 per acre on poor sites and $ 242 on good sites. Over one rotation (cutting cycle), 38. 56 net tons of carbon can be sequestered on an acre of poor quality land and 51. 35 tons on good quality land. The cost of sequestering carbon, without including revenues from timber production and carbon credits, ranges from a high of $ 15. 20 per ton on poor sites to $ 14. 41 on good sites, calculated with a 2. 5 % ARR; to a high of $ 8. 51 per ton on poor sites to $ 7. 63 on good sites, calculated with a 15. 0 % ARR.
