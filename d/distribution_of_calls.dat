40|$|In this paper, we analyse a {{model of}} a regular tree loss network that {{supports}} two types of calls: unicast calls that require unit capacity on a single link, and multicast calls that require unit capacity on every link emanating from a node. We study the behaviour of the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> in the core of a large network that has uniform unicast and multicast arrival rates. At sufficiently high multicast call arrival rates the network exhibits a 'phase transition', leading to unfairness due to spatial variation in the multicast blocking probabilities. We study the dependence of the phase transition on unicast arrival rates, the coordination number of the network, and the parity of the capacity of edges in the network. Numerical results suggest that the nature of phase transitions is qualitatively different when there are odd and even capacities on the links. These phenomena are seen to persist even with the introduction of nonuniform arrival rates and multihop multicast calls into the network. Finally, we also show the inadequacy of approximations such as the Erlang fixed-point approximations when multicasting is present...|$|E

40|$|The {{social network}} {{maintained}} by a focal individual, or ego, is intrinsically dynamic and typically exhibits some turnover in membership {{over time as}} personal circumstances change. However, the consequences of such changes {{on the distribution of}} an egoâs network ties are not well understood. Here we use a unique 18 -mo dataset that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to track changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making the transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that individuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how interactions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego, these social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable turnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus, as new network members are added, some old network members either are replaced or receive fewer calls, preserving the overall <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> across network members. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as the time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort required to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional investments...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} mate-quality {{recognition}} in passerines showed that females use subtle differences in sound production to assess males. We analysed long calls of brown skuas, Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi, {{to test whether}} vocal performance could serve {{as an indicator of}} individual quality in a nonpasserine species. Measurements of vocal performances focused on two acoustic parameters for which motor constraints have been reported in passerines, namely âvocal deviationâ and âpeak performanceâ. As potential indicators of individual quality we measured body size, body condition (body mass corrected for size) and mean reproductive success. We found a triangular <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between note repetition rate and frequency bandwidth. Males performing long calls closer to the performance limit had a higher mean reproductive success than males that show long calls with a larger vocal deviation. Similarly, males calling with a high peak performance were more successful breeders than males with low peak performance. Our findings indicate that long calls of brown skuas are limited by motor constraints similar to vocalizations in passerines. We show that differences in vocal performance reflect male's reproductive success with more successful breeders producing the more difficult calls. This implies that limits on vocal performance due to motor constraints present a suitable mechanism for mate-quality recognition in nonpasserine birds. ...|$|E

Call centres {{have been}} {{presented}} as a poster child for many things ranging from a leap in management success, to a locale of total panoptic power, to electronic sweatshops, to the latest effort in deskilling physical and emotional labour for corporate profi t, to an outpost of corporate empire. Proponents of these positions frame their assertions with theoretical positions that advance particular views of either ânatureâ or âsociety â as the commonsensically-present âactive ingredient â behind the forces at play. Aided by actor-network theory, this article attempts to avoid these theoretically-constructed positions to describe how {{some of the many}} and varied actors (both human and non-human) contribute to the day-to-day production of call centres and call centre work in and of them-selves.

We have developed a software platform, the ontology-based Nurse Call System (oNCS), which supports the transition to mobile and wireless nurse call buttons and uses an intelligent algorithm to address nurse calls. This algorithm dynamically adapts to the situation at hand by taking the profile information of staff and patients into account by using an ontology. This article describes a probabilistic extension of the oNCS that supports a more sophisticated nurse call algorithm by dynamically assigning priorities to calls based on the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} kind of call. The probabilistic oNCS is evaluated through implementation of a prototype and simulations, based on a detailed dataset obtained from 3 nursing departments of Ghent University Hospital. The arrival times of nurses at the location of a call, the workload <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> among nurses, and the assignment of priorities to calls are compared for the oNCS and the current nurse call system. Additionally, the performance of the system and the parameters of the priority assignment algorithm are explored. The execution time of the nurse call algorithm is on average 50. 333 ms. Moreover, the probabilistic oNCS significantly improves the assignment of nurses to calls. Calls generally result in a nurse being present more quickly, the workload distribution among the nurses improves, and the priorities and kinds of calls are taken into account...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The current, place-oriented nurse call {{systems are}} very static. A patient {{can only make}} calls with a button which is fixed to a wall of a room. Moreover, the system {{does not take into}} account various factors {{specific}} to a situation. In the future, there will be an evolution to a mobile button for each patient so that they can walk around freely and still make calls. The system would become person-oriented and the available context information should be taken into account to assign the correct nurse to a call. The aim of this research is (1) the design of a software platform that supports the transition to mobile and wireless nurse call buttons in hospitals and residential care and (2) the design of a sophisticated nurse call algorithm. This algorithm dynamically adapts to the situation at hand by taking the profile information of staff members and patients into account. Additionally, the priority of a call probabilistically depends on the risk factors, assigned to a patient. Methods The ontology-based Nurse Call System (oNCS) was developed as an extension of a Context-Aware Service Platform. An ontology is used to manage the profile information. Rules implement the novel nurse call algorithm that takes all this information into account. Probabilistic reasoning algorithms are designed to determine the priority of a call based on the risk factors of the patient. Results The oNCS system is evaluated through a prototype implementation and simulations, based on a detailed dataset obtained from Ghent University Hospital. The arrival times of nurses at the location of a call, the workload <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> amongst nurses and the assignment of priorities to calls are compared for the oNCS system and the current, place-oriented nurse call system. Additionally, the performance of the system is discussed. Conclusions The execution time of the nurse call algorithm is on average 50. 333 ms. Moreover, the oNCS system significantly improves the assignment of nurses to calls. Calls generally have a nurse present faster and the workload-distribution amongst the nurses improves. </p...|$|E
