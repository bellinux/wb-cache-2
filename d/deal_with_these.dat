5|$|The 1707 Acts of Union had merged the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland {{into one}} {{national}} entity, but they retained separate legal systems. However, the House of Lords became {{the highest court}} of appeal in both English and Scottish law, and as a result, from 1707 Scottish cases on appeal from the Court of Session were sent there. To <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> cases, a barrister had {{to be familiar with}} both Scottish and English law, and Murray found his niche, acting in Scottish cases in the House of Lords as early as 1733. His work in Moncrieff v Moncrieff in 1734 established Murray as a brilliant young barrister praised for his performance by Lords Cowper and Parker. After Moncrieff, Murray was involved in almost every case in the House of Lords, whether it had been appealed from a Scottish court or not.|$|E

25|$|Catalytic {{purification}} and hydrocracking {{are together}} known as hydroprocessing. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is {{to deal with}} the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time.

Catalyst materials and pore size distributions need to be optimized to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> challenges.|$|E

25|$|He was {{the first}} Stoic to depart from the {{orthodox}} doctrine that passions were faulty judgments and posit that Plato's view of the soul had been correct, namely that passions were inherent in human nature. In addition to the rational faculties, Posidonius taught that the human soul had faculties that were spirited (anger, desires for power, possessions, etc.) and desiderative (desires for sex and food). Ethics was {{the problem of how}} to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> passions and restore reason as the dominant faculty.|$|E
25|$|As {{with nearly}} all {{anesthetic}} drugs, thiopental causes cardiovascular and respiratory depression resulting in hypotension, apnea and airway obstruction. For these reasons, only suitably trained medical personnel should give thiopental {{in an environment}} suitably equipped to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> effects. Side effects include headache, agitated emergence, prolonged somnolence, and nausea. Intravenous administration of sodium thiopental is followed instantly by an odor and/or taste sensation, sometimes described as being similar to rotting onions, or to garlic. The hangover from the side effects may last up to 36 hours.|$|E

25|$|Most Japanese {{people and}} {{agencies}} have adopted customs to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> issues.

The recent use of katakana in Japanese media when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young socialites who attempt to invoke a cosmopolitan flair using katakana names as a badge of honor. All of these complications are also found in Japanese place names.|$|E

The 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly influential and marked a key {{turning point in}} the Christological debates that broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th century. In Chalcedon the hypostatic union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of Orthodox Christianity.|$|E
