2500|$|The rood screen, that {{wonderful}} {{feature of the}} medieval church, was now universal. It consisted of a tall screen of usually about thirty ft. high, {{on the top of}} which rested a loft, i.e. a platform rood about [...] in width guarded on either side by a gallery screen, and either on the top or in front of that, facing the nave, was placed the rood, i.e. a large crucifix with figures of St Mary and St John on either side. This rood screen sometimes spanned the church in one continuous length (Leeds, Kent), but often filled in the aisle and chancel arches in three separate divisions (Church Handborough, Oxon.). The loft was as a rule approached by a winding stair built in the thickness of the aisle wall. The lower part of the screen itself was solid paneled to a height of about [...] and the upper part of this paneling was filled in with tracery (Carbrook, Norfolk), while the remaining flat surfaces of the panels were often pictured with saints on a background of delicate gesso diaper (Southwold, Suffolk). Towards the end of this period the employment of figures became less common as a means of decoration, and the panels were sometimes filled- entirely with carved foliage (Swimbridge, Devon). The upper part of the rood screen consisted of open arches with the heads filled in with pierced tracery, often enriched with crockets (Seaming, Norfolk), embattled transoms (Hedingham Castle, Essex), or floriated cusps (Eye, Suffolk). The mullions were constantly carved with foliage (Cheddar, Somerset), pinnacles (Causton, Norfolk), angels (Pilton, Devon), or decorated with canopy work in gesso (Southwold). But the feature of these beautiful screens was the loft with its gallery and vaulting. The loft floor rested {{on the top of the}} rood screen and was usually balanced and kept in position by means of a <b>groined</b> <b>vaulting</b> (Harberton, Devon) or a cove (Eddington, Somerset). The finest examples of vaulting are to be seen in Devon. The bosses at the intersections of the ribs and the carved tracery of the screen at Honiton stand unrivaled. Many screens still possess the beam which formed the edge of the loft floor and on which the gallery rested. It was here that the medieval roodscreen carver gave most play to his fancy, and carved the finest designs in foliage to be seen throughout the whole Gothic period. Although these massed moulds, crests and bands have the appearance of being carved out of one log, they were in practice invariably built up in parts, much of the foliage, etc., being pierced and placed in hollow moulds in order to increase the shadow. As a rule the arrangement consisted of a crest running along the top, with a smaller one depending from the lower edge, and three bands of foliage and vine between them (Feniton, Devon). The designs of vine leaves at Kenton, Bow and Dartmouth, all in Devon, illustrate three very beautiful treatments of this plant. At Swimbridge, Devon, there is a very elaborate combination; the usual plain beads which separate the bands are carved with twisted foliage also. At Abbots Kerswell and other places in the district round Totnes the carvers introduced birds in the foliage with the best effect. The variety of cresting used is very great. That at Winchcomb, Gloucester, consists of dragons combined with vine leaves and foliage. It illustrates how Gothic carvers sometimes repeated their patterns in as mechanical a way as the worst workmen of the present time. Little can be said of the galleries, so few remain to us. They were nearly all pulled down when the order to destroy the roods was issued in 1548. That they were decorated with carved saints under niches (Llananno, Wales), or painted figures (Strencham, Worcester), is certain from the examples that have survived the Reformation. At Atherington. Devon, the gallery front is decorated with the royal coat of arms, other heraldic devices, and with prayers. The Breton screen at St Fiacre-le-Faouet is a wonderful example of French work of this time, btit does not compare with the best English examples. Its flamboyant lines and its small tracery never obtained any foothold in England, though screens carved in this way (Colebrook, Devon) are sometimes to be found.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is aisled, with an ambulatory round the choir. The nave is barrel-vaulted, with small vaults over the windows. The aisles have <b>groined</b> <b>vaulting.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of a groin vault can be understood most simply by visualising two barrel vault sections at right angles merging to form a squarish unit. The resulting four ribs convey the stress loading to the four corners, or piers. The more complex groin vault is intrinsically a stronger design compared to the barrel vault, since the barrel vault structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin vault design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the piers. A common association of vaulting in cathedrals of the Middle Ages involves a nave of barrel vault design with transepts of <b>groined</b> <b>vaulting.</b> Rib vaults resemble groin vaults but introduce structural ribs running along the angles which carry much of the weight, making possible much greater variations of proportion.|$|E
50|$|Built in 1245, {{the church}} has the typical Franciscan pattern: a large nave ending in an apse with a <b>groin</b> <b>vault,</b> flanked by two smaller side-chapels also with <b>groin</b> <b>vaults.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> or <b>groined</b> <b>vault</b> (also {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a double barrel vault or cross vault) is produced by the intersection at right angles of two barrel vaults. The word [...] "groin" [...] refers to the edge between the intersecting vaults. Sometimes the arches of <b>groin</b> <b>vaults</b> are pointed instead of round. In comparison with a barrel <b>vault,</b> a <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> provides good economies of material and labour. The thrust is concentrated along the groins or arrises (the four diagonal edges formed along the points where the barrel vaults intersect), so the vault need only be abutted at its four corners.|$|R
50|$|While {{the barrel}} vault was {{more common than}} the <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> in very early architecture, {{including}} Roman and even earlier civilizations, the Romans developed the <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> widely for applications {{in a variety of}} structures, some with significant span widths. The first <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> in Europe was, however, constructed in Delphi by King Attalos I of Pergamon some time between 241 and 197 BC, quite possibly in 223 BC. Their application of <b>groin</b> <b>vaults</b> to vast halls like the frigidaria in the Baths of Caracalla and Diocletian became highly influential in church architecture in the Middle Ages. The aspirations of church building reached its zenith then, and the <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> was pursued aggressively for its ability to create strength, without massive buttress formations; in addition, it provided the church architects a remedy for the dim illumination inherent in the barrel vault design, since the barrel vault had to minimise fenestration to retain adequate strength.|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral, {{begun in}} 1131, {{in a style}} of Norman {{architecture}} which would be more accurately called Sicilian Romanesque. The exterior is well preserved, and is largely decorated with interlacing pointed arches; the windows also are pointed. On {{each side of the}} façade is a massive tower of four stories. The round-headed Norman portal is worthy of note. A semi-circular apse is set into the east end wall. Its strengthening counterforts that work like buttresses, are shaped as paired columns to lighten their aspect. The <b>groined</b> <b>vaulting</b> of the roof is visible in the choir and the right transept, {{while the rest of the}} church has a wooden roof. Fine cloisters, coeval with the cathedral, adjoin it. The interior of the cathedral was restored in 1559, though the pointed arches of the nave, borne by ancient granite columns, are still visible; and the only mosaics preserved are those of the apse and the last bay of the choir; they are remarkably fine specimens of the Byzantine art of the period (1148) and, though restored in 1859-62, have suffered much less than those at Palermo and Monreale from the process. The figure of the Pantocrator gracing the apse is especially noteworthy.|$|E
5000|$|This {{interesting}} {{house is}} {{in the southern part}} of the parish of Turriff, and not far from the Auchterless railway station.The family of Tollie de Berkley, to whom it belonged, is very ancient, and the following inscription on a stone built into the wall has given the impression that the castle is also of very old date, viz., “Sir Alexander Barclay of Tolly, foundator, deceisit anno domini 1186.” On the same stone is carved the following inscription: “In tim of Valth al men semis friendly and frindis not knauin but in adversity, 1593.”There can be no doubt that the first part of the above inscription is a mere record of what had happened long before, and was inserted at the date last quoted, “1593.” In 1792 the turrets and embrasures were removed and two stories taken off the height of the keep, and the fosse filled up.The family suffered from espousing Queen Mary’s cause. From 1558 to 1624 the estate was held by Patrick Barclay, who was the author of the moral reflection above quoted,--the result of his unfortunate experience.The plan of this castle is a slight modification of the plain quadrangular keep, a small break being made in the wall adjoining the entrance door. This gives room for the passage to the staircase, and also admits of a loophole commanding the entrance. The ingoing of this loophole is defended internally with a stone pillar, so placed as to permit those inside to see out, and at the same time os designed as to intercept missiles from without.The basement is all vaulted, and the vault over the small entrance lobby is ornamented with ribbed and <b>groined</b> <b>vaulting.</b> The latter peculiarity seems to be local. A similar loop next the doorway, and groined vault in the entrance lobby, exists at Gight, and a corresponding ribbed vault at the original entrance still remains at Delgaty.The basement contains the usually cellars, with small loopholes, one cellar having a private stair to the hall.The principal staircase leading to the first floor is partly straight, with a wheel round the corner of the tower and a good landing at the door to the hall. The hall is of the usual form, but is much more ornate than in most castles. It is 30 feet by 20 feet, and is vaulted in two compartments, with a groined and ribbed vault, springing from corbels carved with foliage. There is also a small and carefully finished and vaulted gallery in the thickness of the wall over the door to the hall, with a wide opening towards the hall. The gallery has ribbed vaulting, and the bosses are carved with the monogram I.H.S., and with a heart and the pierced hands and feet of our Savior. The corvels from the which the ribs spring have shields containing the emblems of the four Evangelists. On each side of the opening towards the hall are canopied niches for statues. Everything seems to point to this gallery having been an oratory or chapel. It is entered by a small stair from the floor above, so that the baron and his family might use it privately, or by drawing a curtain it might be opened to the hall, when all assembled there might witness the service.Billings’ view of the interior gives a good idea of these features, which all seem to point to the work having been designed by some one accustomed to ecclesiastical architecture. <b>Groined</b> <b>vaulting</b> of the kind here adopted is rare in the castles of Scotland, but one other example occurs at Balbegno in Kincardineshire, which is of the same period. The hall of Auchendoun was also vaulted in a similar manner, but it belongs to an earlier period. From the ecclesiastical features of the building Mr. Billings infers that it is at least a century earlier than the date upon it (1593). But from the similarity of the vaulting at Balbegno, the date of which is 1569, and from the correspondence of the plan, and the little ribbed vault at the entrance, with such castles as Gight and Delgaty, we have no hesitation in assigning it to the middle of the sixteenth century. At Edzell too we find ribbed and <b>groined</b> <b>vaulting</b> in the summer-house, along with features which are undoubtedly of the latter half of the sixteenth century.There is a small private room over the entrance lobby. As already mentioned, the upper floors have been altered or removed. (pages 51-52) ...|$|E

25|$|<b>Groin</b> <b>vaults</b> {{occur in}} early Romanesque buildings, notably at Speyer Cathedral where the high vault of about 1060 {{is the first}} {{employment}} in Romanesque architecture {{of this type of}} vault for a wide nave. In later buildings employing ribbed vaultings, <b>groin</b> <b>vaults</b> are most frequently used for the less visible and smaller vaults, particularly in crypts and aisles. A <b>groin</b> <b>vault</b> is almost always square in plan and is constructed of two barrel vaults intersecting at right angles. Unlike a ribbed vault, the entire arch is a structural member. <b>Groin</b> <b>vaults</b> are frequently separated by transverse arched ribs of low profile as at Speyer and Santiago de Compostela. At Sainte Marie Madeleine, Vézelay, the ribs are square in section, strongly projecting and polychrome.|$|R
