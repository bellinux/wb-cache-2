5|$|In October 2005, the WA Planning Commission {{presented}} Metropolitan Region Scheme Amendment 1089/33 to the Western Australian parliament, {{which was}} approved and took effect from 2 April 2006. The amendment rezoned an {{area known as}} East Landsdale Precinct 64, west of Alexander Drive, from rural to urban. In August 2006, Wanneroo City Council, the local government area responsible for Landsdale, submitted corresponding changes to the District Plan for approval. It is unknown at this time whether PITC will <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> relocate as a medium-to-long-term result of the rezoning.|$|E
5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> explain such experiences. This follows from an {{assumption}} {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E

5|$|Cooke {{resolved}} to kill Sharp herself. The next time Sharp was in Bowling Green on business, she {{sent a letter}} to him that denounced Beauchamp's actions and claimed she had broken off all contact with him. She asked Sharp to visit her at her plantation before he left town. Sharp questioned the messenger who delivered the letter, as he suspected a trap. He replied to her, saying he would visit at the time appointed. Beauchamp and Cooke awaited the visit, but Sharp never arrived. When Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green to investigate, he learned that Sharp had left for Frankfort two days earlier, leaving substantial unfinished business. Beauchamp concluded that Sharp would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return to Bowling Green to finish his business there. Determined to await Sharp's return, Beauchamp opened a legal practice in the city. Throughout 1822 and 1823, Beauchamp practiced law and waited for Sharp to return. He never did.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring flew to Sicily {{himself on}} 12 July {{to survey the}} {{situation}} and decided that {{no more than a}} delaying action was possible and that the island would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on and he reinforced Sicily with the 29th Panzergrenadier Division on 15 July. Kesselring returned to Sicily by flying boat on 16 July to give the senior German commander, General der Panzertruppe Hans-Valentin Hube, his instructions. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy flak units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in Sicily for another month and the Allied conquest of the Sicily was not complete until 17 August.|$|E
5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E

5|$|The tip of {{the upper}} jaw is beak-like and {{separated}} from {{the remainder of the}} jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the bottom row fitting perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by ligament, chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for shearing chitin and bone. Fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago. The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp projections of the jaw bone. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> chew their food between smooth jaw bones. The brain of Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.|$|E
25|$|Rezoning of the {{neighbouring}} area, known as East Landsdale Precinct 64, from rural to urban {{took place on}} 2 April 2006. It is unknown at this time whether PITC will <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> relocate as a medium-to-long-term result of the rezoning.|$|E

25|$|Mansa Mahmud IV {{retired to}} Niani and died by 1610. His three sons tore the {{remnants}} of the country apart, and Mali became a scattering of loosely allied chiefdoms. These were swallowed up by the Bamana Empire, which even the pashalik of Timbuktu would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay tribute to. Still, none of the emergent powers would come close to the hegemony of Mali or Songhai. West Africa transitioned to a region ruled by smaller and less centralized states until the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|By 1599, Abbas had conquered {{not only}} Herat and Mashhad, but had moved as far east as Balkh. This {{would be a}} {{short-lived}} victory and he would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> settle on controlling only some of this conquest after the new ruler of the Khanate of Khiva, Baqi Muhammad Khan attempted to retake Balkh and Abbas found his troops were still {{no match for the}} Uzbeks. By 1603, the battle lines had stabilized, albeit with the loss {{of the majority of the}} Persian artillery. Abbas was able to hold onto most of Khorassan, including Herat, Sabzavar, Farah, and Nisa.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{the only}} clinical/pharmacological {{treatment}} available for ADPKD consists {{in reducing the}} speed in gain of total kidney volume (TKV) with aquaretics (i.e. tolvaptan), which can alleviate pain while giving the patients {{a better quality of}} life for over a mean of 3 years. After this period, patients can restart gaining TKV at pre-treatment rates and may <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through dialysis and kidney transplant. Paliative treatment modalities involve symptomatic medications (non-opioid and opioid analgesics) for abdominal/retroperitoneal pain. Before the advent of aquaretic medication, the only option for analgesic-resistant pain were simple or complex surgical procedures (i.e. renal cyst aspiration, cyst decortication, renal denervation and nephrectomy), which can result in complications inherent to surgery.|$|E

25|$|Edmond Pope – A retired {{intelligence}} officer-turned-"businessman", sentenced by a Russian {{court in}} 2000 to 20 years for buying-up and smuggling classified military equipment {{out of the}} country as scrap metal. He was soon pardoned by newly elected Vladimir Putin but continues to assert that the Russian authorities used him as a scapegoat for their broken system. In the same interview with Larry King, however, he spoke of a plot by unspecified people in the U.S., as part of which Pope was being slowly poisoned in the Lefortovo Prison, with the hopes that he would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be transferred to a hospital, abducted on his way and smuggled {{out of the country}}; he claims that his representatives stopped the plot.|$|E
25|$|The KAI-KF-X {{project had}} a long history of delays and postponements since it was first {{announced}} in March 2001 by South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung After several failed attempts to get the Philippines, Sweden, Turkey, the UAE and the United States to join the project, it was only in June 2010 that South Korea suceeded to get Indonesia joined the project, the only country to be a JV partner. However three years later, on March 1, 2013, South Korea postponed the project on hold for 18 months, due to financial and the election of the new South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Indonesia had since paid $165 million of the then DAPA’s estimated 6 billion won (US5.5 billion). Reuters however reported that some analysts said the project could cost up to $8 billion, which meant Indonesia may <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay $$1.6bn to South Korea.|$|E
500|$|In 1818 Dennis Pennington, then a state senator, {{had three}} Kentuckians indicted {{for violating the}} Man Stealing Act when they {{forcibly}} took a black woman from a home in Harrison County and removed her to Kentucky.

Ned turns for a second, seemingly having heard Bran's voice, but eventually continues inside, before the Three-Eyed Raven pulls Bran out of the vision.

500|$|By October 2008, the late-2000s {{recession}} {{was beginning}} to affect the project. [...] Construction was suspended and the tower's architect, Santiago Calatrava, placed an $11.34million lien on the construction site, stating that Kelleher had not yet paid him for his work. [...] Within a few months Anglo Irish Bank, the primary lender for the project, {{was on the brink}} of financial collapse. [...] The bank's stocks had lost nearly all of their value and Anglo Irish Bank was facing nationalization. [...] Due to the bank's dire financial situation, Shelbourne Development was forced to suspend construction, and would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay back the $69.5 million (USD) it had already borrowed.|$|E
500|$|At that time, no {{one else}} in the world of physics had noticed what Curie {{recorded}} in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: [...] "The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium." [...] She later would recall how she felt [...] "a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible." [...] On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would <b>eventually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> process tons of the ore.|$|E
