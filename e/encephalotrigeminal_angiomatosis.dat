50|$|Sturge-Weber syndrome, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis,</b> is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is one of the phakomatoses and is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, mental retardation, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). Sturge Weber Syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected. This type is the most common. Type 2 involvement includes a facial angioma (port wine stain) with a possibility of glaucoma developing. There is not any evidence of brain involvement. Symptoms can show at any time beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial angioma. The symptoms can include glaucoma, cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches. More research is needed on this type of Sturge Weber Syndrome. Type 3 has leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively. The facial angioma is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs. This type is only diagnosed via brain scan.|$|E

A case of portwine stain with intraoral gingival hemangioma is presented. There were no other systemic manifestations. Patient reported with a complaint of localized tumor-like swelling in gums. Based {{on the presence of}} sharply demarcated vascular lesion unilaterally on the face and with ipsilateral intraoral vascular hyperplasia in the lip and gingiva, a variant of <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis</b> was diagnosed. Ultrasound Doppler flowmetry was used to determine the blood flow. Dental management included plaque control instructions, scaling, root planning, and excision of the lesion done under general anesthesia.

40|$|Sturge-Weber syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis</b> or meningofacial angiomatosis, is characterised in its {{classical}} form by a congenital, usually unilateral, ‘portwine stain’ (capillary naevus) on the face, convulsions, typical intracranial calcification and some degree of mental retardation and hemiparesis. The clinical correlation of intractable seizures {{with the presence of}} bilateral intracranial disease has management and prognostic implications, thus making the presence of bilateral disease an important factor to all those involved in the management of the child with Sturge-Weber syndrome.

40|$|Sturge-Weber {{syndrome}} (SWS), {{also known}} as <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis,</b> a sporadic, non-familial, congenital disorder consists of congenital hamartomatous malformations that may affect the eye, skin and central nervous system at different times. Sturge-Weber syndrome is classified as 1) Complete trisymptomatic: - when all three organ systems i. e. eye, skin and CNS are involved 2) Incomplete bisymptomatic:- when the involvement is either oculocutaneous or neurocutaneous, and 3) Incomplete monosymptomatic: when there is only neural or cutaneous involvement. Failure of proper vascular development {{is believed to be}} the most likely cause of this condition. The malformed blood vessels or hemangiomas may lead to port-wine stain, epilepsy and glaucoma depending on its location. Three classic variants with typical findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Sturge-Weber Syndrome, {{also known}} as <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis,</b> is a rare {{vascular}} neurocutaneous alteration. The main clinical features of this syndrome are facial vascular cutaneous naevus, usually unilateral, which often follows the outline distribution of trigeminal nerve. Objective: To report a clinical case of Sturge-Weber Syndrome in a 29 -yeral-old male patient who presented oral manifestations related to the syndrome. Case report and conclusion: The patient {{reported that he had}} presented a cutaneous vascular nevus on the face during childhood as well as epileptic crisis episodes. However, he had no ophthalmic alterations. Sturge-Weber syndrome is a systemic condition commonly affecting oral cavity through vascular lesions, therefore, dentists’ knowledge is extremely important to provide an adequate dental treatment without complications...|$|E
40|$|Sturge-Weber {{syndrome}} (SWS) {{also called}} as <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis,</b> is a sporadically occurring rare neuro-cutaneous syndrome, characterized by vascular malformation with capillary venous angiomas involving face, choroidal layer of eye globe and leptomeninges responsible for ophthamological {{as well as}} neurological signs and symptoms. Authors report an interesting case, a six year old girl, who presented with seizures, facial port wine stain and normal psychomotor development. CT scan showed left cerebral hemiatrophy, left frontal and parieto occipital calcification with cortical calcification in left high frontal convexity. Cranial MRI scan also confirmed finding of left cerebral hemiatrophy and also revealed presence of gyriform cortical calcification, prominent flow voids seen in left basal ganglia. Her seizure is well controlled with antiepileptic medication. The pertinent literature is reviewed and management of such cases is discussed briefly...|$|E
40|$|<b>Encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis</b> or Sturge-Weber's {{disease is}} an {{uncommon}} congenital dis-order which can vary greatly {{in the extent}} of its manifestations, but which in severe cases can lead to infantile hemiplegia associated with fits, be-havioural disorders and mental backwardness. Until comparatively recently specific therapy was largely limited to anticonvulsant drugs. Only a few isolated reports of surgical intervention have been recorded. The {{purpose of this paper}} there-fore is to describe the findings and results of surgery in five consecutive patients with infantile hemiplegia treated by hemispherectomy and since followed up for from three to eight years who improved as regards epilepsy and personality disorders, although not as regards hemiplegia. A preliminary report on the first two of these cases has already been presented (Polani, 1952). Excellent reviews of the clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of the condition have recently been given by several authors (Medoc, Sotelo, Aran...|$|E
40|$|Sturge-Weber {{syndrome}} (SWS), {{sometimes referred}} to as <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis,</b> is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is one of the phakomatoses which is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, mental retardation, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma. It is characterized by proliferation of arteries of the brain, resulting in multiple angiomas that occur on the same side due to arteriovenous malformations. Normally, only one side of the head is affected and mainly results from the errors in both the mesodermal and ectodermal development. Here, we report a rare case of SWS having oral and facial manifestations, where an 8 -year-old boy had actually come for treatment of swollen gums, and on examination, we found that he had typical signs and symptoms of this rare developmental anomaly. The main purpose of this publication is to make the clinician aware of the oral manifestations that are seen in the patients with SWS and also to lay stress on the importance of radiographs in the diagnosis of this syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Sturge–Weber syndrome, defined also as encephalotrigeminal or leptomeningeal angiomatosis, is a nonhereditary {{congenital}} neurocutaneous disorder, {{characterized by}} a facial vascular nevus (port-wine stain) that follows {{the distribution of the}} trigeminal nerve, associated with an ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma. Neurological manifestations include seizures (in 80 % to 90 % of cases), mental retardation (in 40 % to 50 % of cases) and focal signs, such as hemiplegia, aphasia or hemianopia, that are often fluctuating (1, 2). In previous isolated studies the association of the syndrome with headache, in particular migraine with aura, was reported, but poorly documented (3). In a series of 23 epileptic patients with Sturge–Weber syndrome it was noted that 7 cases had episodes of throbbing unilateral headache with autonomic symptoms and transient hemiparesis. None of these episodes was preceded or accompanied by loss of consciousness or ictal phenomena such as clonic jerks. It was suggested that these attacks were most likely episodes of hemiplegic migraine rather than epileptic seizures (2). The prevalence of migraine in Sturge– Weber syndrome was seen to be higher than in normal population (4). A patient with this syndrome, free of epileptic seizures for 10 years, started suffering from hemiplegic migraine attacks, without a family history for this disorder (5). Conversely, no case of headache was reported in a long-term outcome study regarding 52 adults with Sturge–Weber syndrome (1). The headache secondary to <b>encephalotrigeminal</b> <b>angiomatosis</b> {{was not included in the}} first edition of the International Headache Society (IHS) classification. In the second edition this headache was finally classified in group 6 (section 6. 3. 5), which includes the secondary headaches attributed to cranial or cervical vascular disorders (6) ...|$|E
