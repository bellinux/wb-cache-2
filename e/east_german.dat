5|$|After the war {{he played}} an {{important}} role in the political scene of East Germany. Before the establishment of an <b>East</b> <b>German</b> state he was the chairman of the German Economic Commission, the precursor to the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> government. Subsequently, he became chairman of the National Planning Commission of East Germany and a deputy chairman of the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> Council of Ministers. He was a leading economic politician and diplomat of East Germany and led various ministries at different times. Within East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) he was a member of the party's CC Politburo.|$|E
5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former <b>East</b> <b>German</b> regime. As its logo, the foundation used an <b>East</b> <b>German</b> flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> {{initially}} {{regarded the}} dissolution of the GDR positively. But this reaction soon turned sour. West Germans often acted as if they had [...] "won" [...] and <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> had [...] "lost" [...] in unification, leading many <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> (Ossis) to resent West Germans (Wessis). In 2004, Ascher Barnstone wrote, [...] "East Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West <b>Germans</b> see the <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> find 'Wessis' arrogant and pushy, West Germans think the 'Ossis' are lazy good-for-nothings." [...] On a more fundamental level, unification and subsequent federal policies led to serious economic hardships for many <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> that had not existed before the Wende. Unemployment and homelessness, which had been minimal during the communist era, grew and quickly became widespread; this, as well as the closures of countless factories and other workplaces in the east, fostered a growing sense that <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> were being ignored or neglected by the federal government.|$|R

5|$|The Soviet Union {{dominated}} the ice hockey competition, winning every match {{to take their}} sixth Olympic gold in eight Winter Games. <b>East</b> <b>German</b> sledders fully demonstrated their prowess at the Trebević track. Wolfgang Hoppe and Dietmar Schauerhammer clinched gold in both bobsleigh events, while Bernhard Lehmann and Bogdan Musiol secured both silvers. Led by Steffi Martin, who won the first of her two back-to-back Olympic titles, <b>East</b> <b>German</b> lugers swept the women's singles medals. This show of strength was also observed in the women's speed skating, where <b>East</b> <b>German</b> athletes grabbed nine of the twelve medals in dispute. Four of these were won by Karin Enke (matching the total tallies of Hämäläinen and Svan), and three by Andrea Schöne – in direct competition with Enke. Speed skater Gaétan Boucher won three of Canada's four medals in Sarajevo, including two golds.|$|E
5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into {{crowds of}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people in cities across East Germany. The <b>East</b> <b>German</b> leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E

5|$|After the German reunification, the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> {{football}} association {{joined the}} DFB. The <b>East</b> <b>German</b> women's national football team had played only one official international match, losing 0–3 to Czechoslovakia {{in a friendly}} match on 9 May 1990. The unified German team defended their title successfully at the 1991 European Championship. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3–0. On 14 July 1991, the German team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra time, during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|East Germany was {{particularly}} {{successful in the}} 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping. Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with Kristin Otto winning three times, before the Berlin Wall and communism fell. With {{the end of the}} state-sponsored doping program, the (<b>East)</b> <b>German</b> stranglehold on women's swimming was broken. In the two decades since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by Franziska van Almsick. During the 1980s, Michael Gross of West Germany, nicknamed The Albatross in reference to his vast wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986. Swimming World has vacated all awards previously awarded to <b>East</b> <b>German</b> swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping.|$|E

25|$|On 2 May 1989, Hungary started {{dismantling}} its {{barbed wire}} border with Austria, opening a large {{hole through the}} Iron Curtain to the West that was used by {{a growing number of}} <b>East</b> <b>Germans.</b> By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR (Czechoslovakia) as the only neighboring state where <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> could escape to. Thousands of <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the Prague Embassy and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> participated in the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We use {{recently}} developed procedures to decompose German Lorenz curves for post-government incomes among <b>East</b> <b>Germans,</b> West Germans, and foreign guest workers after German unification. The decomposed Lorenz ordinates {{permit us to}} construct interdistributional Lorenz curves, which in turn allow dominance comparisons of changes in economic advantage in different years. Using interdistributional Gini indices to capture the magnitude of these changes, {{we find that the}} economic advantage of West <b>Germans</b> over <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> diminished by more than one-third between 1992 and 1996. Over the same period the advantage of West Germans over guest workers increased by about one-fourth, while the advantage of guest workers over <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> virtually vanished.

5|$|The {{principal}} {{cause of}} death was shooting. Of the 140 fatalities, 99 (70.7%) were shot dead, not only escapees but also individuals on either side who were not attempting to escape, and <b>East</b> <b>German</b> border guards killed on duty. 101 of the fatalities were attempted border-crossers, of which all but three were East Germans (the exceptions were Franciszek Piesik and Czesław Kukuczka, Polish citizens, and Vladimir Ivanovich Odinzov, a Soviet Soldier). 68 of them were killed in shootings. Another 30 people {{died as a result of}} shootings or fatal accidents sustained while in the vicinity of the Wall but not trying to cross it. Eight <b>East</b> <b>German</b> border soldiers were killed on duty by escapees, escape helpers, fellow soldiers, or the West Berlin police. Three people committed suicide after escape attempts failed.|$|E
5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than {{in other}} branches of the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> armed forces. Many potential recruits were screened out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with close relatives in West Germany. They were all subjected to close scrutiny to assure their political reliability and were given intensive ideological indoctrination.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 the Canadian city of Calgary {{hosted the}} first Winter Olympics to span 16days. New events were added in ski-jumping and speed skating; while future Olympic sports curling, short track speed skating and {{freestyle}} skiing made their appearance as demonstration sports. For {{the first time}} the speed skating events were held indoors, on the Olympic Oval. Dutch skater Yvonne van Gennip won three gold medals and set two world records, beating skaters from the favoured <b>East</b> <b>German</b> team in every race. Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen, who won all three events in his sport. Alberto Tomba, an Italian skier, made his Olympic debut by winning both the giant slalom and slalom. <b>East</b> <b>German</b> Christa Rothenburger won the women's 1,000metre speed skating event. Seven months later she would earn a silver in track cycling at the Summer Games in Seoul, to become the only athlete to win medals in both a Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from <b>East</b> <b>German</b> records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E

40|$|German reunification was a large, {{unexpected}} {{shock for}} <b>East</b> <b>Germans.</b> Exploiting German reunification {{as a natural}} experiment, I analyze {{the validity of the}} life-cycle consumption model.

Secondly, we show that native <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> are more invested {{in this type of}} social networks than West Germans. Thirdly, after controlling for the social network effect the mobility gap between East and West substantially reduces. Thus, low regional labour mobility of <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> is for a significant part attributable to local ties binding people to their home region. Social networks, labour mobility...|$|R
