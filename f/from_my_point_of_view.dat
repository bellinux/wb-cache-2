25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> personal." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 on British television, Mona Best, {{with her}} son present, said of his dismissal: [...] "From the point of clash of personalities, well, {{probably}} that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others. [...] I'll leave that for other people to say but <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> we haven't come here to sort of throw sticks and stones at the boys {{because there is no}} really hard feeling. There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark." [...] Hunter Davies, in his authorised Beatles biography published in 1968, agreed: [...] "There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best {{is one of the few}} murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am brimful {{of common}} sense at the present moment," [...] he {{declared}} earnestly. [...] "You and I could do great things together, if only I could get {{you to look at}} one certain matter <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view; to see it as I see it." ...|$|R
500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so {{a lot of the stuff}} was just <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Now, I tend to look at some of the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|... "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" [...] was Clarke's first {{published}} story. While working on Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, she {{enrolled in a}} writing course co-taught by Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman, which required each student to submit a completed short story before the course began. [...] Clarke culled [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu" [...] from her incipient novel. [...] Greenland {{was so impressed with}} the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, [...] "It was terrifying <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> to read this first short story that had so much assurance...It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano {{for the first time and}} she plays a sonata." [...] Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden. Clarke learned of these events when Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 (1996), which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers. She accepted and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997.|$|E
500|$|After she {{returned}} from Spain in 1993, Clarke {{began to think}} seriously about writing her novel. She {{signed up for a}} five-day fantasy and science-fiction writing workshop, co-taught by science fiction and fantasy writers Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman. The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending, but Clarke only had [...] "bundles" [...] of material for her novel. From this she extracted [...] "The Ladies of Grace Adieu", a fairy tale about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange. Greenland was so impressed with the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Gaiman later said, [...] "It was terrifying <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> to read this first short story that had so much assurance...It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano {{for the first time and}} she plays a sonata."

[...] "Let me see, {{we were going to}} the club to-night." [...] He looked down at his boots. [...] "Yes, they are shined; that puts a dress suit on me." [...] As he walked along, he {{referred}} to Miss Wilbur. [...] "She is a great woman, but she is abnormal <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{himself said}} of his {{partnership}} with Bryson in May 2014: [...] "I think people must hate playing against him, because I certainly would. I wouldn't want to mark him. People can't stay with him, he's got that much energy. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> he helps my game, because he takes people away and runs in behind. It {{makes it easier for}} me to play, because he's always there next to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tendency}} to read thematic or narrative content into Hopper's paintings, that Hopper had not intended, extended even to his wife. When Jo Hopper {{commented on the}} figure in Cape Cod Morning [...] "It's a woman looking out {{to see if the}} weather's good enough to hang out her wash," [...] Hopper retorted, [...] "Did I say that? You're making it Norman Rockwell. <b>From</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> she's just looking out the window."

5000|$|Heinzerling {{said of the}} couple: [...] "When I {{first met}} Shinoharas, I was just struck by the raw spirit and beauty that emanates from their faces, their lifestyle, their art, {{everything}} about them has so much purpose and character. Even if you don’t speak Japanese, {{even if you have}} no previous knowledge of their artwork or who they are, you’re immediately captivated by their presence. They live in a world that’s kind of a time warp that hearkens back to the ‘70s New York SoHo art scene that is sort of canonized in history, certainly <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I feel <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> {{view that}} I don't like it. Whenever I play and {{feel as though}} I have done well, I don't know if I will play the next game." ...|$|R
6000|$|Morris Townsend {{received}} this statement {{with a smile}} that was not wholly devoid of deference. [...] "I don't know what I might think of her if I were her father. I can't put myself in that place. I speak <b>from</b> <b>my</b> own <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view." ...|$|R
2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Paulini uses life {{experiences}} {{her and her}} friends and family have gone through as inspiration for writing songs, and tries to keep the lyrics as honest as possible. She began writing songs before entering Australian Idol, but stated that she had [...] "stopped and just did the projects I was told to do," [...] referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they'd {{have a list of}} songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just kind of go, 'Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.' It just didn't seem real. I mean, it wasn't real for me. They were all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren't my words and my experiences; I didn't feel like it belonged to me." [...] Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album Come Alive (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to Come Alive as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with [...] "this one, this is me. Every experience in there is me, it's what I've gone through, or what I’ve interpreted <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> with other situations with my friends and family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> {{the more}} the better," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have come to believe}} that but for him my father would be alive to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} that, <b>from</b> <b>my</b> aunts' <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, {{it was a}} very good match for me. But I can {{honestly}} say it was not this fact which weighed with me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life." ...|$|R

Lady Delahaye was a very foolish woman. She had seen nothing of my well-ordered household, of the ease, the luxury--simple, yet almost Sybaritic--with which I had surrounded myself. She did not understand life <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--life as Feurgéres had lived it.
