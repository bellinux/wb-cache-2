Based on the displacement model containing the above enrichment displacement function, the increment iterative form of elastoplastic extended finite element method is deduced by virtual work principle. For nonuniform hardening material such as concrete, {{in order to avoid the}} nonsymmetry characteristic of stiffness matrix induced by the non-associate flowing of plastic strain, the plastic flowing rule containing cross item based on the least energy dissipation principle is adopted.

40|$|However, the {{chattering}} problem, {{caused by}} the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>characteristic</b> of switching function used in traditional SMC, greatly deteriorates the performance of SMC and has become the main limitation for its applications. Also, implementing the SMC in digital systems could make it even worse due to the limited sampling time. Moreover, as a state tracking control scheme, traditional SMC cannot be employed in the applications where the system states are not available. To alleviate these problems, the paper presents {{the development of a}} novel control method, so called “the output tracking integrated discrete PID (proportional-integral-derivative) -based SMC ” for the SISO (single-input-single-output) system, along with the controller design approaches (i. e., the traditional SMC design approach and the model reference approach). Without the need of system states, this novel method allows for eliminating chattering problem and the steady state error that may exists in such control methods as the continuous PID-based SMC. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method, experiments were carried out on a commercially available piezoelectric actuator with varying sampling times, as compared to the continuous PID-based SMC. The results illustrate that the tracking performance with the proposed method is much better than the continuous PID-based SMC...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} singuarity {{functions}} is introduced {{to present an}} analytical approach for the natural properties of a unidirectional vibrating steel strip with two opposite edges simply supported and other two free, partially submerged in fluid and under tension. The velocity potential and Bernoulli's equation are {{used to describe the}} fluid pressure acting on the steel strip. The effect of fluid on vibrations of the strip may be equivalent to added mass of the strip. The math formula of added mass can be obtained from kinematic boundary conditions of the strip-fluid interfaces.

The algorithm {{is based on}} modifications of the Katzenelson algorithm that traces the solution curve through regions where boundary conditions are satisfied.

To resolve these state changes, the network solution point is dragged over the line segment that connects the solution points at the discontinuity, and the network state is changed whenever boundary conditions are violated. Since the algorithm traces cause and effect sequence of state changes, it is well suited for application in time-domain simulations.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the shrinkage processes and characteristics of three typical swelling soils in Shaanxi, China, with different height treatment using a modified core method and to analyze their agronomic properties. Three swelling soils, Calcarit Regosol, Eutric Cambisol, and Cumulic Anthrosol, collected in Ansai, Ankang, and Yangling, respectively, were investigated. The experimental procedure consisted of the simultaneous measurements of the height (H), diameter (D), and mass (m) of initially saturated soil core samples during dehydration by evaporation. The results showed that soil texture (clay content) and structure [bulk density (rho (b)) ] affected the shape of soil shrinkage characteristic curve (SSCC), but the sigmoid shape of the shrinkage curve could be regarded as a general characteristic for well-structured soils. The influence of core sample height on the shrinkage characteristics was due to the pressure increase resulting from the overlaying soil mass. The computer code (CARHYS) proposed for soil hydrostructural characterization was applied to analyze the discontinuous SSCC data. The computer calculations revealed that it could fit the data very well with a correlation coefficient > 0. 9755 for the three soils and determine characteristic transition points of all of the different phases of SSCC accurately. Analysis of the geometry factor exhibited that soil shrinkage was anisotropic and only subsidence of soil surface happened at the beginning of shrinkage. According to the relation between the transition points in the SSCC and the particular soil moisture states available water (AW), readily available water (RAW), air capacity (AC), and swell-shrink potential (coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE)) were calculated from the parameters obtained by CARHYS. AC of the soils was consistent with rho (b). AW and RAW were affected by both clay content and rho (b). The investigated soils were all ranked in the low-swelling class according to the classification of the US Department of Agriculture. Next to clay content, rho (b) should be considered as an important physical factor affecting the agronomic properties and the swell-shrink behavior of the soils.
