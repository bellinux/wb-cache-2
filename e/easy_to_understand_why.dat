Thanks to the discovery and partial excavation of amphora workshops, it has been established that the name on a Thasian ceramic stamp of the later variety (post- 340 B.

Thus the stylistic analysis of the amphorae can be conducted on a more solid basis.

In close collaboration with quantum chemist Larry Curtiss and neutron scatterers David Lee Price and Marie-Louise Saboungi at Argonne, we used molecular dynamics to study the local structure and dynamics and ion transport in the polymer. The studies elucidated the mechanism of Li transport in PEO, revealing that the rate limiting step is extremely sensitive to {{the magnitude of the}} torsion forces in the backbone of the polymer. Because the torsion forces are difficult to manipulate chemically, this makes it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> improving the conductivity of PEO based electrolytes has proven to be very difficult.

40|$|Music {{has always}} played an {{important}} role in human history. It mirrors opinions, desires, emotional and social states, and reflects the place and the age one lives in. As a result, music changes as people change. The aim of this thesis is to explore how the British popular music of the 1970 s reflects the historical and social context. In the first chapter I will examine how songs functioned as socio-political commentary. In the second part I will elaborate on how generational differences in the 1970 s can be traced in music, which in the first half of the decade was an escape from reality. In the third chapter I will inquire into how the class divisions of British society became manifest in the most influential branches of the early seventies’ rock music.

Yet {{we live in}} a society that does not treasure clarity about itself. Power prefers obscurity. So not only do few high school students understand these concepts, but few PhDs in economics do either. If you learn anything from this article, at least I hope you will understand these three. If you already know, or think you do, what money, credit and capital are (readers of this journal should know these), perhaps nonetheless you will be somewhat surprised by the simplicity, clarity and power of my treatment of these basic concepts. Most importantly, understanding these better makes it much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> economic crises occur.

If there had been more research we would find it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> pupils sometimes behave the way they do. The purpose of this essay is to analyze how pupils` social relations create groupings. Furthermore I intend to investigate how and why pupils show their belonging to a certain group. The two questions of the essay are: 1. How pupils’ social relations appear in a classroom? 2. What strategies do the pupils use to indicate their belonging to a grouping? My final conclusion is that the pupils’ social relations appear in groupings, in which a certain standard dominates how the pupil should behave during a lesson. The members of a group use the same strategies to show their group belonging. For example, it can be different attitudes to the teacher’s lesson that mark a grouping...|$|R
6000|$|It is now <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> the Christianity of Jesus failed {{completely}} to establish itself politically and socially, and was easily suppressed {{by the police}} and the Church, whilst Paulinism overran the whole western civilized world, which was at that time the Roman Empire, and was adopted by it as its official faith, the old avenging gods falling helplessly before the new Redeemer. It still retains, as we may see in Africa, its power of bringing to simple people a message of hope and consolation that no other religion offers. But this enchantment is produced by its spurious association with the personal charm of Jesus, and exists only for untrained minds.

40|$|This {{comparative}} study analyses the {{domestic and international}} contexts which lay behind unprecedented decisions by international governing bodies. The decision to award the Olympic Games to Mexico City in 1968 and the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup to South Africa in 2010 represented a step into the unknown for their respective governing bodies. Prior to these decisions, hosting the events had followed practices established over time. The mainly white, aristocratic individuals who comprised the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had never awarded the Games to a „developing ‟ country. A mixture of altruism and paternalism surrounded its determination to foster popular participation in sport within the Third World but this did not extend to entrusting the Games to a host from within such regions. The foundation and early development of football established a different, but equally rigid, model. The popularity of football in Western Europe and its early adoption by Latin American nations meant that the FIFA World Cup quickly established a pattern of alternating hosts between the two continents. Set within this context, it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why,</b> when Mexico City was awarded the 196...|$|R

60|$|A few {{incidents}} {{stand out}} among the daily bulletins of snipings, skirmishes, and endless marchings which make the dull chronicle of these, {{the last months of}} the year 1900. These must be enumerated without any attempt at connecting them. The first is the long-drawn-out siege or investment of Schweizer-Renecke. This small village stands upon the Harts River, on the western border of the Transvaal. It is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> the one party should desire to hold, or the other to attack, a position so insignificant. From August 19th onwards it was defended by a garrison of 250 men, under the very capable command of Colonel Chamier, who handled a small business in a way which marks him as a leader. The Boer force, which varied in numbers from five hundred to a thousand, never ventured to push home an attack, for Chamier, fresh from the experience of Kimberley, had taken such precautions that his defences were formidable, if not impregnable. Late in September a relieving force under Colonel Settle threw fresh supplies into the town, but when he passed on upon his endless march the enemy closed in once more, and the siege was renewed. It lasted for several months, until a column withdrew the garrison and abandoned the position.|$|E
60|$|In {{the last}} month of 1884 Becket was published. The theme of Fair Rosamund had appealed to the poet in youth, and he had written part of a lyric which he judiciously left unpublished. It is given in his Biography. In 1877 he had visited Canterbury, and had traced the steps of Becket to his place of {{slaughter}} in the Cathedral. The poem was printed in 1879, but not published till seven years later. In 1879 Sir Henry Irving had thought the play too costly to be produced {{with more than a}} succes d'estime; but in 1891 he put it on the stage, where it proved the most successful of modern poetic dramas. As published it is, obviously, far too long for public performance. It is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> dramatic poets always make their works so much too long. The drama seems, by its very nature, to have a limit almost as distinct as the limit of the sonnet. It is easy to calculate how long a play for the stage ought to be, and we might think that a poet would find the natural limit serviceable to his art, for it inculcates selection, conciseness, and concentration. But despite these advantages of the natural form of the drama, modern poets, at least, constantly overflow their banks. The author ruit profusus, and the manager has to reduce the piece to feasible proportions, such as it ought to have assumed from the first.|$|E
6000|$|Interesting, {{and easy}} to understand--except in one detail, which I will mention presently. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> the Queensland sugar planter should want the Kanaka recruit: he is cheap. Very cheap, in fact. These are the figures paid by the planter: L20 to the {{recruiter}} for getting the Kanaka or [...] "catching" [...] him, as the missionary phrase goes; L3 to the Queensland government for [...] "superintending" [...] the importation; L5 deposited with the Government for the Kanaka's passage home when his three years are up, in case he shall live that long; about L25 to the Kanaka himself for three years' wages and clothing; total payment {{for the use of}} a man three years, L53; or, including diet, L60. Altogether, a hundred dollars a year. One can understand why the recruiter is fond of the business; the recruit costs him a few cheap presents (given to the recruit's relatives, not to the recruit himself), and the recruit is worth L20 to the recruiter when delivered in Queensland. All this is clear enough; but the thing that is not clear is, what there is about it all to persuade the recruit. He is young and brisk; life at home in his beautiful island is one lazy, long holiday to him; or if he wants to work he can turn out a couple of bags of copra per week and sell it for four or five shillings a bag. In Queensland he must get up at dawn and work from eight to twelve hours a day in the canefields--in a much hotter climate than he is used to--and get less than four shillings a week for it.|$|E
