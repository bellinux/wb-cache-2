5|$|Because {{it was not}} {{possible}} to upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, was built to replace it. Gardner became an assessment centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses both on and off campus which <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students can choose to be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E

When the trainee or examinee articulates the need for an examination or a laboratory test, the SP hands him/her a small card with the results of that exam/test, and the encounter can continue.|$|E

25|$|A Remembrall is a small, clear orb, {{about the}} size of a large marble, {{containing}} smoke that turns red when it detects that the person holding it has forgotten something. Unfortunately, it does not tell the holder what has been forgotten, which makes it somewhat worthless. The forgetful Neville Longbottom is sent a Remembrall by his grandmother in Philosopher's Stone. Remembralls are forbidden from being used during the O.W.L. exams, as they would <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> know if they had written a wrong answer.|$|E

Rutgers' current partners include Atlantic Cape, Brookdale, Mercer, Morris, and Raritan Valley community colleges.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which {{students}} acquire a range of social and cognitive thinking skills related to the proper usage {{of science and technology}} determines whether they are scientifically literate. Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of science and technology, a fast-changing culture, and a knowledge-driven era. A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare. Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the changing world. Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.|$|E

25|$|In early November 1993, Reveille V {{underwent}} {{emergency surgery}} for gastric volvulus, which causes an animal's stomach to twist out of place. The surgery was successful, {{and she made}} a full recovery. Later that month she relinquished her spot as mascot to Reveille VI. For {{the next six years}} she lived with a local veterinarian and graduate of Texas A, Dr. Joe West. Reveille V was euthanized in June 1999 because she suffered from arthritis and a neurological disorder. Her funeral was delayed until September to <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> attend. Over 3,000 students and alumni attended the funeral, which included Taps, a prayer from a campus chaplain, and eulogies from her former handlers. Reveille V was initially buried at Cain Park on the Texas A campus, but her grave was relocated to the north end of Kyle Field once stadium renovations were finished.|$|E

The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service careers, arranging assignments with organizations working with New York City's poorest children, families, and communities. The NYS College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> reach out to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell Cooperative Extension. Students with the NYS School of Industrial and Labor Relations' Extension & Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to organizations, union members, policymakers, and working adults. The College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's financial district, brings together business optimization research and decision support services addressed to both financial applications and public health logistics planning. The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning has a 11,000 square foot Gensler-designed facility in 26 Broadway (The Standard Oil Building) in the Financial District that opened in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Fudan has reconstructed {{its course}} system to suit {{education}} goals. A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in {{arts and sciences}} has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to {{a wider range of}} knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Struthers {{held the}} {{professorship}} at Aberdeen for 26 years. In that time, he radically transformed anatomy {{teaching at the}} university, improved the Aberdeen medical school; set up the museum of anatomy; and helped to lead {{the reconstruction of the}} Aberdeen Infirmary. He vigorously collected specimens for his museum, [...] "prepared or otherwise provided, mainly by the work of my own hands, and at my own expense". The specimens were arranged to <b>enable</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> compare the anatomy of different animals. He intended the comparative anatomy exhibits to demonstrate evolution through the presence of homologous structures. For example, in mammals, the arm and hand of a human, the wing of a bird, the foreleg of a horse, and the flipper of a whale are all homologous forelimbs. He continually made demands of the University of Aberdeen's Senate for additional room space and money for the museum, against the wishes of his colleagues in the faculty. Struthers could {{go to great lengths to}} obtain specimens he particularly wanted, and on at least one occasion this led to court action. He had long admired a crocodile skeleton at Aberdeen's Medico-Chirurgical Society. In 1866 he borrowed it, ostensibly to clean and remount it, but despite the society's urgent requests to have it returned, it stayed in Struthers' museum at Marischal College for ten years. Struthers still hoped to obtain the specimen, and when in 1885 he was made president of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, he again tried to take the crocodile to his museum. The society then obtained an interdict (a court order) restraining him from removing the skeleton.|$|E
