5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan Ponce de León is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de León met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de León found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de León was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de León was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} put the settlement in trust until the court cases could be decided.

In 1990 the settlement was awarded: three-quarters to the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma and one-quarter to the Seminole of Florida, including the Miccosukee. By that time the total settlement was worth $40 million. The tribes have set up judgment trusts, which fund programs to benefit their people, such as education and health.|$|E
25|$|Beit She'arim is {{an archaeological}} {{site of a}} Jewish town and necropolis, {{near the town of}} Kiryat Tiv'on, 20km east of Haifa in the {{southern}} foothills of the Lower Galilee. Beth She'arim was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and Nahman Avigad in the 1930s and 1950s.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the investigation, ten members of the IOC were {{expelled}} and another ten were sanctioned.

Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and caps were put into place as to how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.|$|E

25|$|Both {{films were}} box office failures, and Dreyer {{did not make}} another movie until 1943. Denmark was by now under Nazi occupation, and his Day of Wrath had as its theme the {{paranoia}} surrounding witch hunts {{in the seventeenth century}} in a strongly theocratic culture. With this work, Dreyer established the style that would mark his sound films: careful compositions, stark monochrome cinematography, and very long takes. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade before his next full-length feature film, Dreyer made two documentaries. In 1955, he made Ordet (The Word) based on the play of the same name by Kaj Munk. The film combines a love story with a conflict of faith. Dreyer's last film was 1964's Gertrud. Although seen by some as a lesser film than its predecessors, it is a fitting close to Dreyer's career, as it deals with a woman who, through the tribulations of her life, never expresses regret for her choices.|$|E

500|$|The {{questions}} of what defines film noir, {{and what sort}} of category it is, provoke continuing debate. [...] "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel"—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953 (A Panorama of American Film Noir), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject. They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an [...] "elusive phenomenon always just out of reach".|$|E

2500|$|The city grew explosively in the 1950s; the {{population}} expanded {{by a factor}} of three, and industry {{by a factor of}} fifteen. [...] The growth brought serious problems of minority housing, traffic congestion, smog, and a fading of the traditional laid-back Phoenix lifestyle. By 1950, over 105,000 people lived within the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. There were 148miles (238km) of paved streets and 163miles (262km) of unpaved streets. [...] The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in mechanical air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat known to Phoenix during its long summers. Affordable cooling in the decade contributed to a wild building boom.
