5|$|One {{of these}} was Brigadier General Frederick Lance of the 19th Lancers, and his wife, Gladys, {{returned}} to Britain with two Salukis from Sarona, where he was stationed during the post-war occupation. The Lances were both keen hunters, and rode with their pack of dogs, including both Salukis and terriers, to course jackal and <b>Dorcas</b> <b>Gazelle</b> whilst stationed in the desert. They imported a male, called Sarona Kelb, who became an influence on the breed in the West.|$|E

50|$|Currently, large {{populations of}} <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> {{are found in}} the Negev and the Arava, with other large populations in Sudan, Iraq, and the {{southern}} part of the eastern desert of Egypt. In Israel, only 1000-1500 gazelles remain.|$|R
25|$|Several {{species of}} fox {{live in the}} Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and Rüppell's fox. The addax, a large white antelope, can go nearly {{a year in the}} desert without drinking. The <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle</b> is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle.|$|E
25|$|Mammals of the Western Desert {{have been}} {{depleted}} {{over the years}} and the addax and scimitar oryx are no longer found there, and the Atlas lion has probably gone as well. The remaining mammals include the rhim gazelle, <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle,</b> Barbary sheep, Rüppell's fox, lesser Egyptian jerboa and Giza gerbil. Notable birds from this desert include the spotted sandgrouse, greater hoopoe-lark and white-crowned wheatear.|$|E

50|$|In {{the park}} there are houbara bustards, North African ostriches, barbary sheep, <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles,</b> oryxes and striped hyenas. There {{is also a}} large number of {{reptiles}} such as lizard, wyches, monitor lizards, chameleons, geckos and different varieties of snakes.|$|R
40|$|The {{necropsy}} {{records of}} 279 <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> (Gazella <b>dorcas)</b> and 27 Grant’s gazelles (Nanger granti) kept at Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation in Qatar {{over a period}} of 8 years were reviewed in order to determine common pathological findings with view to population development and neonatal survival. The most common finding in both species was trauma (41 % in dorcas, 60 % in Grant’s gazelles), followed by pneumonia (20 % in dorcas, 35 % in Grant’s gazelles). Other common diagnoses included gastrointestinal disorders (15 % in dorcas, 25 % in Grant’s gazelles) and nephropathies (11 % in dorcas, 25 % in Grant’s <b>gazelles).</b> In <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> neonatal mortality can be reduced, and individual animal welfare can be increased (MELLOR and STAFFORD, 2004), if group size is strictly controlled...|$|R
40|$|Once common {{throughout}} the entire Sahelo-Saharan region, population sizes of <b>Dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> (Gazella <b>dorcas)</b> are nowadays decreasing dramatically. The uncertain taxonomy of this species—with a variety of described subspecies without validated status—hampers conservation efforts. In this situation, phylogenetic and phylogeographic investigations using molecular techniques are highly warranted conservation tools. Here, we investigate sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and control region of 73 dorcas (G. <b>dorcas)</b> and Saudi <b>gazelles</b> (G. saudiya) {{throughout the}} entire distribution range...|$|R
25|$|The Eritrean Coastal Desert Ecoregion {{stretches}} {{along the}} southern coast of the Red Sea from Balfair Assoli in Eritrea to Ras Bir; it forms the shores of Yemen and Djibouti funnel. During every autumn, large bird migrations have been recorded in the Obock area of Djibouti. The most common species recorded are the <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle,</b> Soemmerring's gazelle, and Salt's dik-dik. This ecoregion in Djibouti's Ras Siyyan consists of rocky terrain, old coral reefs seen during low tide, and sandy beaches. Among the several offshore islands in this region are the Sept Frères islands, an archipelago of Djibouti.|$|E
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (Vulpes zerda) and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dorcas), {{also known}} as the ariel gazelle, is a small and common gazelle. The <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle</b> stands about 55-65 cm (1.8-2.1 ft) at the shoulder, with a head and body length of 90-110 cm (3-3.6 ft) and a weight of 15-20 kg (33-44 lb). The {{numerous}} subspecies survive on vegetation in grassland, steppe, wadis, mountain desert and in semidesert climates of Africa and Arabia. About 35,000 - 40,000 exist in the wild. The extinct Saudi gazelle from the Arabian Peninsula has been previously considered as a subspecies of the <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelle.</b>|$|E
50|$|African Oasis {{is on the}} South side of {{the path}} {{opposite}} Alligator Bay. This area houses many African animals including crested porcupines, <b>Dorcas</b> <b>gazelles,</b> greater kudus, miniature zebu, impala, African gray parrots, and leopard tortoises. The Giraffe Preview Exhibit showcases a herd of reticulated giraffes, where guests can hand-feed them for a fee.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> {{are highly}} {{adapted to the}} desert; they can go their entire lives without drinking, as they can {{get all of the}} {{moisture}} they need from the plants in their diets, though they do drink when water is available. They are able to withstand high temperatures, but when it is very hot, they are active mainly from dusk to dawn. In areas where they face human predation, they tend to be active only at night to minimise the risk of falling prey to hunters. These gazelles feed on leaves, flowers, and pods of many species of acacia trees, as well as the leaves, twigs and fruits of various bushes. They occasionally stand on their hind legs to browse from trees, and after rain, they have been observed digging out bulbs from the ground. <b>Dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> are able to run at speeds up to 80 km/hr (50 mph) to 96 km per hour (60 mph) when threatened, they tail-twitch and make bouncing leaps with their heads held high (stotting), possibly to announce they have seen a predator.|$|R
50|$|When {{conditions}} are harsh, <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> live in pairs, but when {{conditions are}} more favorable, they join together in family herds with one adult male, several females, and young. During the breeding season, adult males {{tend to be}} territorial, and mark their range with dung middens. In most parts of their range, mating takes place from September to November. Gestation takes six months; a single fawn is typical, although twins {{have been reported in}} Algeria. The newborn is well developed at birth, with fur and open eyes. Within the first hour, the fawn attempts to stand, and it will suckle on this first day of life. In the first two weeks, the young gazelle lies curled up in a scrape on the ground or beneath bushes while the mother grazes close by. The young then starts to follow its mother around and begins to take solid food. After around three months, the fawn stops suckling and is fully weaned. Some <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> are also known for their dangerous behaviors when surrounded. There have been many reports of deaths involving them.|$|R

In its vicinity live houbara bustards, ostriches, Barbary sheep, <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles,</b> oryxes and hyenas.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of this gazelle has declined throughout its range. Their natural predators include humans, cheetahs, leopards, Arabian wolves, and lions. Due to human hunting, few large cats remain to prey on <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles.</b> Mostly unhealthy gazelles are caught successfully by predators, since the healthy gazelles tend to escape them. To escape the cheetah, the fastest of carnivores, they run extremely fast and make zigs-zags, {{as does the}} Thomson's gazelle.The serval and caracal also prey on this species. The biggest modern threat to this gazelle is ever-expanding human civilization, which shrinks the gazelle's habitat by converting it to farmland, and by introducing new flocks of domestic sheep and goats which compete with gazelles for grassland.|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis: The {{optimum height}} of an {{inflorescence}} {{is expected to}} be the result of costs and benefits for the plant, where the benefit is pollination and the costs are herbivory and allometric growth. Thus, plants with more resources will have taller flower stalks, will provide a greater reward to pollinators, and will be preferred by pollinators. However, in populations subject to stronger herbivory, mean stalk height will be shorter. Organism: We studied populations of a hysteranthous and tall-stalked geophyte, the Negev desert lily (Pancratium sickenbergeri), subject to varying levels of herbivory by <b>dorcas</b> <b>gazelles</b> (Gazella <b>dorcas).</b> Field site: Sandy habitats in Makhtesh Katan and Makhtesh Ramon, in the Negev Desert, Israel. Methods: We measured the survival and frequency distribution of floral stalk height, bulb size and condition (by artificially simulating bulb herbivory), pollinator preference, rewards for the pollinators (pollen grains per plant and the energetic value of the nectar per flower), and fruit and seed production. We then compared stalk height between populations and correlated stalk height, pollen and nectar, and seed production. Results: Lilies in populations with high herbivory produced shorter inflorescences than in populations with low herbivory. The condition of the bulb affected stalk production, but not its height or seed production. The pollinator preference results were inconclusive. Taller inflorescences produced more rewards for pollinators. We observed variability in fruit and seed production due to the size of the flower stalk and this variability differed among the populations with different levels of herbivory...|$|R
