5|$|In July 2008, Angel {{escaped from}} a beachside hotel before its {{demolition}} {{in front of}} a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was duralumin throughout and {{was flat}} sided and bottomed, though its top was slightly rounded and the nose was rounded in both plan and elevation. [...] The pilots' cabin had two seats side-by-side, fitted with dual control and radio equipment by the righthand seat. Behind them {{there was a}} separate cabin with a [...] floor, which could be fitted as a navigator's post or a bar and gave access to an underfloor baggage hold; a port-side external door accessed this space and allowed the pilots to reach their positions via an <b>internal</b> <b>door.</b> A second <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> opened into the passenger cabin, [...] in plan and [...] high, which had nine rows of seats, {{one on each side}} under its own window. There was a toilet at the rear and behind it a final space containing a library and the main passenger door port-side.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{generator}} shed (...) is a single-storeyed, orange {{brick building}} located close to both lighthouses (south {{of the concrete}} signal station and east of the old lighthouse). Entrance to the building is through a roller door on the northern facade. The flat concrete roof overhangs on {{the north and south}} sides to form a narrow awning, and a projecting brick sill runs around the building beneath high windows. The interior contains two rooms: a larger room housing a generator, remnant equipment and a workbench; and a smaller room in the north–west corner, accessed by an <b>internal</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

2500|$|While the {{official}} government commission blamed the explosion on a faulty weld {{in the practice}} torpedo, Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev cited inadequate training, poor maintenance, and incomplete inspections that caused the crew to mishandle the weapon. The internal tube door {{was designed to be}} three times as strong as the external torpedo door, so that any explosion inside the tube would be directed out into the sea. Salvage crews eventually found the internal tube cover embedded in a bulkhead [...] from the tube. This led investigators to conclude that it was likely that the <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> was not fully closed when the explosion occurred.|$|E
2500|$|The flat sided and {{bottomed}} fuselage had curved upper decking, dropping {{towards the}} tail. Behind the engine cowling {{back to the}} rear of the passenger compartment the fuselage was plywood covered, with fabric covering aft. Pilot and engineer/navigator/radio operator sat side-by-side in an open cockpit ahead of the upper wing, with an <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> to the passenger cabin. Each passenger had a window and there was a central passageway between the seats leading to a toilet and luggage compartment at the rear. The empennage was conventional, with the tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage longerons. [...] The fin and rudder together were of broad chord, the rudder balanced. [...] The Potez XVIII had a conventional undercarriage with two pairs of underwing mainwheels and a tail skid. Each pair was mounted on two V-form struts with aerofoil section, duralumin forward legs and rear telescopic, shock absorbing legs.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{fire rated}} doors {{are used as}} <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> (around 90% of the European market in terms of quantity). Given that EN 16034 can only be used in {{conjunction}} with other standards (internal, external, power operated pedestrian doors, industrial doors) and given that the standard for <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> {{is a work in progress}} (prEN 14351-2) [...] the applicability date of 1 November will not change anything for the sector. Most fire rated doors currently still cannot be CE marked.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and bumper bar changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to negative earth wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> latch handles, and quarter light window handles. Plastic window winder and <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> pull handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|E
50|$|Series 1A and B (around 350 built) had {{removable}} side windows, wooden dashboard, and <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> panel covers {{which could}} accommodate the windows once taken off. Series 1B had a redesigned rear panel, with new, rectangular light clusters.|$|E
50|$|The cathedral has carved glass {{works by}} New Zealand-born artist John Hutton. One set adorns the panel {{at the west}} entrance; the other is above the <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> to the south porch.|$|R
50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>doors</b> feature fanlights above, and rooms open {{onto the}} verandahs via French doors. Rooms {{to the rear}} of the {{building}} have double-hung sash windows with window hoods of timber and Durabestos shingles.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has ornate pressed metal ceilings, single skin tongue and groove timber walls, timber batten arches, sash windows and fanlights above <b>internal</b> <b>doors.</b> The building houses original furniture, fittings and artefacts which belonged to the Cook family.|$|R
50|$|For each {{system to}} be effective, air {{must be able to}} flow through the dwelling. The {{regulations}} make provision for this via <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> undercuts to maintain a minimum gap of 10mm above the finished floor surface. This provides a 7600mm² permanent opening when a door is closed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{redesign}} of the Bronco for 1992 {{would include the}} addition of a number of safety features, including front crumple zones, three-point seatbelts for the rear seat, and a center-mounted rear brake light. In 1994, as with the F-150, the Bronco received a standard driver-side airbag and reinforced <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> beams.|$|E
50|$|Four KiHa 11-200 cars (KiHa 11-201 - 204) {{were built}} by Niigata Tekkō (now Niigata Transys) in 1993 {{for use on}} the Tōkai Transport Service Jōhoku Line. These cars {{are based on the}} KiHa 11-100 design, but without <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> steps. KiHa 11-203 - 204 were {{subsequently}} reallocated to JR Central's Mino-Ōta Depot and are used interchangeably with other JR Central KiHa 11s.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has beech timber framing with beaded pine vertically jointed boarding, pine <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> and boarded ceilings. The building has timber skirtings, architraves, cornices and ceiling roses, and the corridor wall to the northwest room has been removed.|$|R
50|$|Interior joinery {{throughout}} {{the first and}} second floor remains intact and of high quality, although now heavily painted. Most <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> are four panelled, with operable transom windows above, occasionally arched. Half glazed French doors open onto the verandahs from internal rooms.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} comprises several office spaces. Walls and ceilings {{are lined with}} fibrous cement sheeting joined with cover strips and floors are lined with carpet. <b>Internal</b> <b>doors</b> are panelled timber. Cornices and picture rails are simply detailed and formed from timber.|$|R
50|$|The {{defining}} {{event of}} the episode, the locking of the <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> between the Cabinet Office and 10 Downing Street, was partly based on reality. The internal connecting door was created in 1963 during renovations to Downing Street, and the new access and proximity to the Prime Minister improved the power of some senior civil servants in the Cabinet Office.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} was duralumin throughout and {{was flat}} sided and bottomed, though its top was slightly rounded and the nose was rounded in both plan and elevation. [...] The pilots' cabin had two seats side-by-side, fitted with dual control and radio equipment by the righthand seat. Behind them {{there was a}} separate cabin with a 0.75 × 1.8 m floor, which could be fitted as a navigator's post or a bar and gave access to an underfloor baggage hold; a port-side external door accessed this space and allowed the pilots to reach their positions via an <b>internal</b> <b>door.</b> A second <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> opened into the passenger cabin, 9.1 × 1.8 m in plan and 5 ft high, which had nine rows of seats, {{one on each side}} under its own window. There was a toilet at the rear and behind it a final space containing a library and the main passenger door port-side.|$|E
5000|$|Guancerossehenge in Fiano Romano, {{due to the}} {{position}} of the window located in {{the east side of the}} house and an <b>internal</b> <b>door,</b> starting from 28 of May, the sun beam at sunrise reach the fireplace located in the kitchen [...] This phenomenon is rarely observed by the people living in the house, it happens early in the morning while most of them is still sleeping.|$|E
50|$|The {{internal}} walls and ceilings of the observatory building {{are lined with}} fibre-cement sheeting with timber cover strips. <b>Internal</b> <b>doors</b> are timber joinery and the floor has been lined with linoleum. Some half-height walls and counters open on to the enclosed verandahs.|$|R
50|$|A 3 {{lever lock}} {{is a common}} type of lever lock, but is {{generally}} used for low security applications such as <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> as their tolerances are much lower (there are fewer combinations of key available, so {{they are likely to}} unlock doors they shouldn't).|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has several}} large fireplaces and an ornate chimney-breast decorated with carved egg-and-dart motifs and flanked by pilasters. A pilastered archway leads {{from the hall}} to the staircase, which has an elaborate stair-rail. Many of the <b>internal</b> <b>doors</b> and windows are topped with architraves.|$|R
50|$|It is {{probable}} that cars pre chassis number 120 (approx), about April 1958, had similar bodies to the early Berkeley “Sports” cars. Cars from about April 1958 {{to the end of}} production had vertical front door edges and <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> hinges, as well as body moulding and a few mechanical changes. Early cars were fitted with the four speed TR gearbox whilst later cars had the larger and stronger VR gearbox.|$|E
50|$|Another related {{structure}} is an orange brick generator shed {{just south of}} the lighthouse. It was built in 1967-1968 together with the lighthouse. Windows are set high on the wall, with a projecting brick window sill below. An overhanging concrete roof forms a narrow awning. Entrance to the {{structure is}} on the northern side. The inside is composed of two rooms, a larger generator room and smaller room in the northwest with an <b>internal</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
50|$|Only 296 {{examples}} of the S1 were manufactured (chassis numbers from 460001 to 460296). These are the rarest on the market. These cars had extremely light and minimalist construction, with fixed side windows, fixed seats (adjustable pedals needing the use of tools), no door handles, no <b>internal</b> <b>door</b> covers, and an aluminum dashboard. The steel chassis central beam was sandwiched (incorporated) within the fibreglass bodywork, thus reinforcing stiffness, but making repair rather complicated.|$|E
50|$|Grand Hall Built in 1998, Grand Hall is a co-ed {{community}} with three floors. The building houses 100 students, including three resident advisors. The floors are separated into {{males and females}} and are connected by <b>internal</b> <b>doors.</b> Grand Hall was the first residence hall on campus to have an elevator.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{walls are}} single skin, with some rooms being wallpapered. Most rooms have boarded ceilings, {{with the living}} room and hall having {{plastered}} ceilings with decorative cornices. <b>Internal</b> <b>doors</b> have fretwork panels above, with the living room doors from the front and rear halls having leadlight panels. A steep internal stair leads from the front hall to the belvedere.|$|R
5000|$|The {{extensive}} basement {{rooms of}} the Usher Hall made the building ideal for use as an air-raid shelter and the venue was equipped for use during the Second World War. However, there are no records of it being used as such, but painted signs on <b>internal</b> <b>doors,</b> such as [...] "No Dogs" [...] indicate that preparations were made.|$|R
