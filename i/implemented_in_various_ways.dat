The second part focuses on the empirical issues that have redrawn the map in the past two decades. It turns out that scope is not a primitive.

At least three classes of expressions emerge: indefinites, distributive universals, and counters. Likewise, the bound variable interpretation of pronouns competes with co-variation with situations. As a result, the classical notions are likely to end up as building blocks in the varied mechanisms at work in “scope phenomenona” and “binding phenomena”, and not as self-contained analyses of those phenomena...|$|R

Since complex divisions can be <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> different <b>ways,</b> we did not decompose them into complex multiplication. Note that it is not trivial to elaborate explicit complexity expressions for different OFDM systems in terms of the system's parameters. Specifically, system's complexity depends on the parameters such as N, M, D, and L, each of which are decisive in finding the number of the complex multiplications involved. Finding a closed-form expression in terms of the aforementioned system parameters is rather difficult; therefore, in this work, we have derived expressions for the approximate multiplicative complexity counts and have used Matlab simulations to find the exact number of complex multiplications implemented. To do so, we have used the minimal multiplicative bounds [26] to find the arithmetic complexity of FFT of different block lengths. Besides, to implement the FFT of length W decomposable to the product of two prime numbers a and b, we have implemented a FFTs of size b or b FFTs of size a instead, without inquiring any additional operations such as multiplications by twiddle factors [27].|$|R

While easy to implement, null terminated strings have been criticized for causing buffer overflows. Most high-level scripting languages, such as Python, Ruby, and many dialects of BASIC, have no separate character type; strings with a length of one are normally used to represent single characters.

30|$|Social {{scientists}} have since identified numerous understandings {{of culture in}} cultural competence trainings.

Many trainings treat culture as a negative set of group traits that prevents minority patients from adhering to treatments recommended by clinicians rather than as a dynamic process through which all people make meanings of health and illness (Carpenter-Song et al. 2007; Kleinman and Benson 2006). Clinicians may view these trainings as required forms of political correctness that can be practically removed from patient care (Bullon 2013; Willen 2013), reinforced by the use of exotic cases that may stereotype patients (Jenks 2011). Based on these findings, a Lancet Commission (Napier et al. 2014) and the National Institute of Health (Kagawa-Singer et al. 2014) have recommended research on improving cultural competence trainings based on stakeholder participation.|$|R

40|$|In 2002, a new Local Government Act (LGA) was {{introduced}} in Dutch legislation. An important objective of the LGA was to improve the councillors’ representative role and to revive local governance for citizens. Ten {{years have passed since}} the introduction of the law, but not all of its objectives have been reached, in particular with regard to the strengthening of the representative role of councillors. Citizens still judge councillors the same as before the introduction of the LGA. Although the position of the council towards the Board of Mayor and Aldermen did improve, councillors did not enhance their external orientation in their relation to the citizenry. It seems that in the realization of the LGA, the political-philosophical foundation of the term ‘representative’ has barely been discussed.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{summarizes the}} research on classroom assessments; including why {{and how they are}} performed, their impact on teacher and student relations, the interactions in the classroom that result, their use with students with special needs and nontraditional learners and how preservice teachers are instructed to use them. This review of research found that teachers rely on classroom assessments while teaching, <b>implement</b> them <b>in</b> <b>various</b> <b>ways,</b> and that they affect teacher and student relations and interactions in the classroom. However, little research was found on how teachers use classroom assessments with students with special needs and nontraditional learners, and limited assessment instruction is provided for teachers at either the preservice nor inservice levels of teacher education. ^ To address this dearth of research, a qualitative study was conducted to examine how teachers use classroom assessments with students who have special needs or are nontraditional learners. Twelve teachers, recognized as “good” teachers by their peers from four elementary schools in a diverse urban school district, participated in this study. Ten of the teachers described common classroom communities in which all students are an integral part, expected to perform {{to the best of their}} ability, and assessed primarily through continuous informal assessments. The two other teachers described a different kind of classroom community in which students who were nontraditional learners or had special needs were not regarded as completely part of their classrooms and not expected to perform well. In addition, these two teachers assessed primarily through formal assessments and teacher intuitions. ^ This dissertation explains how the larger group of ten elementary classroom teachers conducted classroom assessments and created inclusive classrooms while teaching. These teachers reported that they used various classroom assessment methods including: observations of students 2 ̆ 7 work and behavior while circulating the room and teaching; high expectations for all students; discussions with students about their work; and not being the sole problem solver in the room. The implications of these findings for inservice and preservice teacher instruction on classroom assessments are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|On the UCLA Statistics WWW server {{there are}} {{a large number of}} demos and calculators {{that can be used in}} {{statistics}} teaching and research. Some of these demos require substantial amounts of computation, others mainly use graphics. These calculators and demos are <b>implemented</b> <b>in</b> <b>various</b> different <b>ways,</b> reflecting developments in WWW based computing. As usual, one of the main choices is between doing the work on the client-side (i. e. in the browser) or on the server-side (i. e. on our WWW server). Obviously, client-side computation puts fewer demands on the server. On the other hand, it requires that the client downloads Java applets, or installs plugins and/or helpers. If JavaScript is used, client-side computations will generally be slow. We also have to assume that the client is installed properly, and has the required capabilities. Requiring too much on the client-side has caused browsing machines such as Netscape Communicator to grow beyond all reasonable bounds, both in size and RAM requirements. Moreover requiring Java and JavaScript rules out such excellent browsers as Lynx or Emacs W 3. For server-side computing, we can configure the server and its resources ourselves, and we need not worry about browser capabilities and configuration. Nothing needs to be downloaded, except the usual HTML pages and graphics. In the same way as on the client side, there is a scripting solution, where code is interpreted, or a ob ject-code solution using compiled code. For the server-side scripting, we use embedded languages, such as PHP/FI. The scripts in the HTML pages are interpreted by a CGI program, and the output of the CGI program is send to the clients. Of course the CGI program is compiled, but the statistics procedures will usually be interpreted, because PHP/FI does not have the appropriate functions in its scripting language. This will tend to be slow, because embedded languages do not deal efficiently with loops and similar constructs. Thus a first step towards greater efficiency is to compile the necessary primitives into the PHP/FI executable. This is easy to do, because the API is quite simple. In the extensions below, we have added the complete ranlib and dcdflib to PHP, plus some additional useful functions. The source code for these extensions, plus Solaris binaries for libranlib. a and libdcdf. a can be obtained from our server. Interpreting a PHP script, even with our new primitives, still requires starting up a CGI process for each page that is read. Again, this can be improved upon. We could use FastCGI to keep the CGI process around on a permanent basis. Instead, we have chosen a more direct method. PHP can be compiled as an Apache module, i. e. it can be compiled into the Apache HTTPD server binary. This means that PHP scripts are interpreted by the WWW server, which is always around, and which will fork additional children if necessary. No CGI processes need to be started. The PHP install process creates a libphp. a and mod_php. c in the Apache source directories, which can be used to build an enhanced server. This has the additional advantage of security, because all security features of the server can be used, and none of the pitfalls of using CGI or Java apply. Using PHP, in combination with the WWW server, also has some disadvantages. Although we can make simple static plots, using the gd library, we cannot use any dynamics, and interaction between the user and the page is somewhat limited. Java, or scripts using a client-side Xlisp-Stat as a helper, are more flexible in this respect. As a consequence, the UCLA Statistics pages still use a combined approach, with server-side PHP and CGI and client-side Xlisp-Stat and Java/JavaScript. Sometime this year, server-side Java scripting will become available, and then it seems advisable to switch as much of the code as possible to the server-side. ...|$|R
