30|$|In this study, primary {{stability}} {{was evaluated}} with insertion torque value measured by manual <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> immediately after implant insertion. Manual <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is the medical instrument used for implant treatment frequently. A recent study about insertion torque that compared electronically controlled <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> with manual <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{states that the}} measurement results of both instruments were similar [30]. Manual <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is classified into three styles (coil, toggle, and beam style). In this study, beam style manual <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> was used. It was reported that beam style <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> present most precise result compared with other two kinds of <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> [31]. As described above, the measurement procedure of insertion torque value {{in this study is}} thought to be acceptable.|$|R

50|$|The {{electric}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is sometimes}} confused {{with a standard}} impact wrench, because it looks similar, but it actually a totally different tool. An electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. This is why an electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and an extreme amount of repeatability and accuracy.The electric <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> was first patented in Germany in 1984 by Alkitronic.|$|R

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> is a {{power tool}} designed to exert torque on a fastener to achieve proper tightening or loosening of a connection {{through the use of}} hydraulics.

40|$|Purpose. Friction-style and spring-style <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{are used}} to tighten implant {{abutments}} and prosthetic screws. The mechanical stability of these <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> is crucial for the implant–abutment connection. The {{purposes of this study}} were to assess the performance of five brands (Straumann, Zimmer, Implant KA, Bredent, and Biohorizons) of wrench and to evaluate possible changes in applied torque values of aged wrenches. Materials and Methods. Five new and aged wrenches that had been used approximately 250 times in a 1 -year period were tested. The torque applied by friction- and spring-style wrenches was measured with a specially designed strain gauge indicator. Descriptive statistics, the one-sample t-test, and the independent-samples t-test were used to analyze values obtained from all <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Results. The accuracy of new and aged torque devices of all brands except Bredent differed significantly from the target values, but the mean values for aged and new wrenches did not differ significantly from each other (p> 0. 05). Values for the spring- and friction-type <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> deviated from the target values by 11. 6 % and 10. 2 %, respectively. Conclusion. The accuracy of aged <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> is adequate for prosthetic screw tightening, but that of new <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> is unsatisfactory and must be examined carefully before delivery...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the way intensive use and multiple cleanings of <b>torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> may interfere with accurary over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different brands (one spring-style and two friction-style types) were tested at baseline and after enduring mechanical testing (1, 000 cycles) and cleaning in a thermal disinfector (150 cycles). <b>Torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> were tested at a predetermined value of 30 Ncm at given intervals, and true values were registered by means of a digital torque gauge. RESULTS: All measured values varied between 28. 3 Ncm and 31. 1 Ncm. Only the spring-style <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> revealed values that differed significantly from baseline after both mechanical testing (P <. 001) and cleaning (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: The spring-style <b>torque</b> <b>wrench</b> produced values that changed significantly after multiple mechanical and multiple cleaning cycles.

50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. <b>Torque</b> <b>wrenches</b> were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore.
