6000|$|You {{will surely}} {{agree with me}} that the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind {{required}} for such a study as this, is the very same as is required for successful military study. In fact, I should say that the same intellect which would develop into a great military man, would develop also into a great naturalist. I say, intellect. The military man would require--what the naturalist would not--over and above his intellect, a special force of will, in order to translate his theories into fact, and make his campaigns {{in the field and}} not merely on paper. But I am speaking only <b>of</b> the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind required for study; <b>of</b> that inductive <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind which works, steadily and by rule, from the known to the unknown; that <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> mind of which it has been said:--"The <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> seeing; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> knowing what we see; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> discerning differences and likenesses; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> classifying accordingly; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> searching for hypotheses which shall connect and explain those classified facts; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> verifying these hypotheses by applying them to fresh facts; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> throwing them away bravely if they will not fit; the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> general patience, diligence, accuracy, reverence for facts for their own sake, and love of truth for its own sake; in one word, the <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> reverent and implicit obedience to the laws of Nature, whatever they may be--these are not merely intellectual, but also moral habits, which will stand men in practical good stead in every affair of life, and in every question, even the most awful, which may come before them as rational and social beings." [...] And specially valuable are they, surely, to the military man, the very essence of whose study, to be successful, lies first in continuous and accurate observation, and then in calm and judicious arrangement.|$|R

5|$|In a {{study of}} the dietary <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> the wildebeest, the animals were found to be feeding on the three {{dominant}} grasses of the area, namely : Themeda triandra, Digitaria macroblephara and Pennisetum mezianum.

5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including those by Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible they were an arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E

These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species use this as a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
5|$|As India's {{national}} capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> its residents and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, {{a variety of}} international cuisines are popular among the residents. The dearth of food habits among the city's residents created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as Kebab, biryani, tandoori. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe, samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun, jalebi and lassi.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E
