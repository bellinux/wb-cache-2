40|$|Abstract: On {{a global}} level, type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 <b>DM)</b> <b>is</b> the most common endocrine disorder. T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as an elevated blood glucose level associated with the absence of or inadequacy in pancreatic insulin secretion. The liver {{plays a key role}} in maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting by synthesizing glucose, mainly from lactate and amino acids through a process called gluconeogenesis. Because hepatic glucose production is increased at least twofold in patients with T 2 DM, targeting this pathway may lead to a blood glucose reduction in these patients. Botanical agents show promise for the development of new compounds to treat T 2 DM. Important mechanisms of action function via the inhibition of gluconeogenesis can occur in one of five ways: direct enzyme inhibition; through the downregulation of mRNA levels of fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G- 6 -P); through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which leads to decreased levels of cAMP response element-binding protein, a key transcription factor for gluconeogenic enzyme phosphorylation; through the expression of the glucokinase gene, which stimulates glucokinase activity and inhibits G- 6 -P; and through the inhibition of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which decreases gluconeogenesis and enzymatically inhibits G- 6 -P and fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphatase...|$|R

However, the normal reference value in Chinese has not <b>been</b> <b>defined.</b> This study aimed to establish HOMA-IR cut-offs for identifying dysglycaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) in Southern Chinese, based on the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study (CRISPS), a population-based cohort study with long-term follow-up. METHODS: Data were analysed from 2779 Hong Kong Chinese subjects aged 25 to 74 years from CRISPS 1 (1995 - 1996) as baseline and followed up in CRISPS 4 (2010 - 2012). Normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>were</b> <b>defined</b> according to the 1998 World Health Organization criteria. In our study, dysglycaemia referred to IFG, IGT, or T 2 <b>DM.</b> Super-control <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> as subjects who were NGT both at baseline and at CRISPS 4 (n= 872). The optimal HOMA-IR cut-offs for dysglycaemia and T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>were</b> determined by the Youden index on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Their sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also calculated. RESULTS: The optimal HOMA-IR cut-offs to identify dysglycaemia and T 2 <b>DM</b> at baseline <b>were</b> 1. 37 (area under the ROC [AUC]= 0. 735; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 713 - 0. 758; Se, 65. 6 %; Sp, 71. 3 %; PPV, 44. 9 %; NPV, 85. 4 %) and 1. 97 (AUC= 0. 807; 95 % CI, 0. 777 - 0. 886; Se, 65. 5 %; Sp, 82. 9 %; PPV, 29. 8 %; NPV, 95. 6 %), respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (<b>DM)</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} metabolic disease, representing a serious {{risk factor for}} the development of cardiovascular complications, such as coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and hypertension. Oxidative stress (OS), a feature of <b>DM,</b> <b>is</b> <b>defined</b> as an increase in the steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and may occur as a result of increased free radical generation and/or decreased anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. Increasing evidence indicates that hyperglycemia is the initiating cause of the tissue damage in DM, either through repeated acute changes in cellular glucose metabolism, or through long-term accumulation of glycated biomolecules and advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs are formed by the Maillard process, a non-enzymatic reaction between ketone group of the glucose molecule or aldehydes and the amino groups of proteins that contributes to the aging of proteins and to the pathological complications of DM. In the presence of uncontrolled hyperglycemia, the increased formation of AGEs and lipid peroxidation products exacerbate intracellular OS and results in a loss of molecular integrity, disruption in cellular signaling and homeostasis, followed by inflammation and tissue injury such as endothelium dysfunction, arterial stiffening and microvascular complications.

40|$|To {{determine}} the prevalence, treatment {{and control of}} diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as well as associated factors in the adult population of four cities of the Southern Cone of Latin America (SCLA). This is a cross-sectional population-based study that included 7407 adults between 35 and 74 years old in four cities of the SCLA: Temuco (Chile), Marcos Paz and Bariloche (Argentina), and Pando-Barros Blancos (Uruguay). <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> as fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL or self-reported history of diabetes. Awareness, treatment, and control of DM were defined as subjects self-reporting a DM previous diagnosis, {{the use of a}} prescription medication or nonpharmacological intervention for DM, and fasting plasma glucose < 126 mg/dl, respectively. Prevalence of DM varied among cities, between 8. 4 % in Bariloche and 14. 3 % in Temuco. Prevalence of IFG varied at different sites, from 3. 5 % in Barros Blancos to 6. 8 % in Marcos Paz. Of the total number of people with diabetes, 20 % were newly diagnosed {{at the time of the}} study. Overall, 79. 8 % of patients with diabetes were aware of their condition. The treatment and control rate were 58. 8 % and 46. 2 %, respectively. Older age, family history of diabetes, lower educational attainment, overweight, obesity, central obesity, low physical activity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia were all significantly associated with an increased risk of diabetes. The prevalence of DM and IFG in the adult population of the SCLA is high and varies among cities. These conditions represent a public health challenge since the rates of awareness, treatment, and control are still low...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the risk factors for diabetes mellitus (DM) {{in the eastern part}} of the Democratic Republic of Congo. METHODOLOGY: Multilevel sampling identified 200 households (444 adults aged ≥ 20 years) from 20 neighbourhoods in the city of Bukavu, and 90 households (255 adults aged ≥ 20 years) from 10 villages in the Kaziba (South Kivu) chiefdom (the South Kivu VITARAA study). <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> as a personal history of the disorder or a casual glycaemia greater or equal to 200 mg/dL. Standardization according to age and sample readjustment based on the urban-rural distribution of the population was applied accordance with the typical Congolese population. The probability of DM was assessed by multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS: Total prevalence of DM was 3. 5 %. DM was significantly more prevalent in urban areas (age-standardized prevalence: 4. 0 %) than in rural areas (1. 7 %). City-dwelling DM patients were characterized by higher rates of indices of abdominal obesity (P < 0. 05) whereas, in rural areas, no patients were obese. In the study group as a whole, only 25. 0 % of diabetic patients were obese. On multivariate analyses, only age [adjusted OR (95 % CI) : 4. 79 (1. 60 - 14. 25); P = 0. 004] was independently associated with the prevalence of DM, while the effect of obesity was not significant [2. 64 (0. 99 - 7. 02); P = 0. 051]. CONCLUSION: Age and living in an urban environment appeared to be major determinants of DM in South Kivu. Also, obesity prevalence was relatively low in these diabetic patients, confirming the peculiar, relatively lean, phenotype of type 2 DM in indigenous sub-Saharan African...|$|E

Previous studies {{using data from the}} National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed an inconsistent association between prevalence of self-reported T 2 DM and urinary BPA. We used a different diagnosis method of T 2 DM (hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c)) with a larger subset of NHANES. Methods and Findings: We analyzed data from 4, 389 adult participants who were part of a sub-study of environmental phenol measurements in urine from three NHANES cycles from 2003 to 2008. T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> as having a HbA 1 c $ 6. 5 % or use of diabetes medication. The weighted prevalence of T 2 DM was 9. 2 %. Analysis of the total sample revealed that a twofold increase in urinary BPA was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1. 08 of T 2 DM (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 02 to 1. 16), after controlling for potential confounders. However, when we examined each NHANES cycle individually, we only found a statistically significant association in the 2003 / 04 cycle (n = 1, 364, OR = 1. 23 (95 % CI, 1. 07 to 1. 42) for each doubling in urinary BPA). We found no association in either the NHANES cycle from 2005 / 06 (n = 1, 363, OR = 1. 05 (95 % CI, 0. 94 to 1. 18)); or 2007 / 08 (n = 1, 662, OR = 1. 06 (95 % CI, 0. 91 to 1. 23)).

MATERIAL & METHODS: In this study, normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 <b>DM)</b> <b>were</b> <b>defined</b> according to the 1998 World Health Organization criteria. Dysglycemia referred to IFG, IGT or T 2 DM. This study comprised two parts.

40|$|Objective: Despite {{previous}} investigation, uncertainty remains {{about the}} nature of the associations of major depression (MD) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), particularly in adult Chinese, and the relevance of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) for T 2 DM. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the China Kadoorie Biobank Study, a sample of approximately 500, 000 adults from 10 geographically defined regions of China, were analyzed. Past year MD and GAD were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Inventory. T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> as either having self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes at age 30 or later ("clinically-identified" cases) or having a non-fasting blood glucose. ≥. 11. 1. mmol/L or fasting blood glucose. ≥. 7. 0. mmol/L but no prior diagnosis of diabetes ("screen-detected" cases). Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between MD and GAD with clinically-identified and screen-detected T 2 DM, adjusting for demographic characteristics and health behaviors. Results: The prevalence of T 2 DM was 5. 3 % (3. 2 % clinically-identified and 2. 1 % screen-detected). MD was significantly associated with clinically-identified T 2 DM (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 75, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 47 - 2. 08), but not with screen-detected T 2 DM (OR: 1. 18, 95 % CI: 0. 92 - 1. 51). GAD was associated with clinically-identified (OR: 2. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 60 - 2. 88) and modestly associated with screen-detected (OR: 1. 44, 95 % CI: 0. 99 - 2. 08) T 2 DM. The relationship between MD and GAD with T 2 DM was moderated by obesity. Conclusion: MD is associated with clinically-identified, but not screen-detected T 2 DM. GAD is associated with both clinically-identified and screen-detected T 2 DM. The relationship between MD and T 2 DM is strongest among those who are not obese. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

We investigated how {{diabetes mellitus}} (DM) was associated with subsite-specific CRC risk in men and women. Methods: The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer is a prospective study among 120 [*] 852 men and women aged 55 - 69 years old at baseline in 1986. Information on DM, anthropometric, dietary and lifestyle factors was self-reported at baseline. T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> as the diagnosis of DM after 30 years of age. Incident CRC cases were identified by record linkage with the Netherlands cancer registry and the Dutch pathology registry. After 17. 3 years of follow-up, 1735 incident male CRC cases and 1321 female CRC cases were available for analyses. Subsite-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for CRC were estimated in case-cohort analyses using Cox regression. Results: At baseline, 3. 1 % of subcohort members reported T 2 DM, of whom 80 % were diagnosed after 50 years of age. Multivariable-adjusted models showed that the risk of proximal colon cancer was significantly increased in women with T 2 DM versus women without T 2 DM (HR= 1. 80, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 10 - 2. 94). There was no association between T 2 DM and the risk of overall CRC, distal colon cancer and rectal cancer in women. In men, T 2 DM was not associated with overall CRC (HR= 0. 98, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 64 - 1. 50), or with risk at any subsite. Conclusions: This prospective study showed an increased risk of proximal colon cancer in women with T 2 DM compared with non-T 2 DM women...|$|E

To obtain nationwide data on the incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in Taiwan, we performed {{an analysis of the}} 2000 – 2009 claim data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database. MethodsOne-third of the claims in the NHI database from 2000 to 2009 were randomly sampled. <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> <b>defined</b> by three or more outpatient visits with diagnostic codes (ICD- 9 -CM: 250 or A code: A 181) within 1 year or by one inpatient discharge diagnosis of DM. Confirmation of type 1 diabetes mellitus was based on the issue of a catastrophic illness certificate with the same diagnostic codes. Age and/or gender distribution for DM were determined. ResultsIn accordance with the global trend for DM, with a near constant standardized incidence rate, there was a more than 70 % increase in the total diabetic population, or a 35 % increase in the standardized prevalence rate, in Taiwan from 2000 to 2009. The incidence of diabetes was higher in men, especially in the 20 – 59 -year-old age group, and the total number of men with diabetes exceeded the number of women with diabetes in 2005. However, the prevalence and incidence rates in women over the age of 60 years were higher than those in men. Type 1 DM was present in less than 1 % of the diabetic population in Taiwan. ConclusionThe incidence of diabetes, including type 1, remained stable over this 10 -year period in Taiwan. However, the incidence rate in men aged 20 – 59 years was higher than that in age-matched women. With our nationwide database, subgroup analysis of DM incidence can be performed to refine our health policies for the prevention, screening, and treatment of diabetes mellitus...|$|E

We reviewed published cardiovascular (CVD) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM) studies between 1995 and 2010 and conducted a meta-analysis of disease prevalence. Methods A systematic search of CVD and T 2 DM studies yielded 29 eligible studies (outcome: CVD only[*]=[*] 12, T 2 DM only[*]=[*] 9, both[*]=[*] 8). Hypertension (HTN) {{was the primary}} outcome of CVD studies. HTN and T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>were</b> <b>defined</b> with objective measures and standard cut-off values. We assessed the study quality based on sampling frame, sample size, and disease evaluation. Random effects models calculated pooled disease prevalence (95 % confidence interval) in studies with general population samples (n[*]=[*] 22). Results The pooled HTN and T 2 <b>DM</b> prevalence <b>were</b> 13. 7 % (12. 1 %– 15. 3 %) and 6. 7 % (4. 9 %– 8. 6 %), respectively. Both diseases exhibited a secular trend by 5 -year intervals between 1995 and 2010 (HTN[*]=[*] 11. 0 %, 12. 8 %, 15. 3 %, T 2 DM[*]=[*] 3. 8 %, 5. 3 %, 9. 0 %). HTN was higher in females (M vs. F: 12. 8 % vs. 16. 1 %) but T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>was</b> higher in males (M vs. F: 7. 0 % vs. 6. 2 %) (non-significant). Both HTN and T 2 <b>DM</b> <b>were</b> higher in urban areas (urban vs. rural: 22. 2 % vs. 14. 3 % and 10. 2 % vs. 5. 1 % respectively) (non-significant).

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a large scale ’adiabatic’, namely non-radiative and non-dissipative, cosmological smooth {{particle}} hydrodynamic simulation we compare the entropy profiles of the gas and the dark matter (DM) in galaxy clusters. The quantity Kg = Tgρ − 2 / 3 g provides a measure for the entropy of the intra-cluster gas. By analogy with the thermodynamic variables of the gas the velocity dispersion of the <b>DM</b> <b>is</b> associated with a formal temperature and thereby KDM = σ 2 DMρ− 2 / 3 <b>DM</b> <b>is</b> <b>defined.</b> This <b>DM</b> entropy <b>is</b> related to the DM phase space density by KDM ∝ Q − 2 / 3 DM. In accord with other studies the DM phase space density follows a power law behaviour, QDM ∝ r− 1. 82, which corresponds to KDM ∝ r 1. 21. The simulated intra-cluster gas has a flat entropy core within (0. 8 ± 0. 4) Rs, where Rs is the NFW scale radius. The outer profile follows the DM behaviour, Kg ∝ r 1. 21, in close agreement with X-ray observations. Upon scaling the DM and gas densities by their mean cosmological values we find that outside the entropy core a constant ratio of Kg/KDM = 0. 71 ± 0. 18 prevails. By extending the definition of the gas temperature to include also the bulk kinetic energy the ratio of the DM and gas extended entropy is found to be unity for r � 0. 8 Rs. The constant ratio of the gas thermal entropy to that of the DM implies that observations of the intra-cluster gas can provide an almost direct probe of the DM.
