There are several hurdles to their uptake, however, including (i) ontology de-velopers face great difficulty understanding the FOs philosophical notions and entities, (ii) there are various views among ontology developers about how these <b>general</b> <b>entities</b> are defined and their philosophical assumptions, hence there are many FOs, yet one needs to be chosen for ontology development, (iii) though chosen to use one foundational ontology, one still may want to link to another to foster ontology interoperability, and (iv) some FOs are highly axiomatised such that it negatively impacts any possible scalable ontology-driven applica-tion.

5000|$|This is {{possible}} because the replacement text {{specified in the}} internal entity definitions permits a distinction between parameter entity references (that are introduced by the [...] "%" [...] character and whose replacement applies to the parsed DTD contents) and <b>general</b> <b>entity</b> references (that are introduced by the [...] "&" [...] character and whose replacement is delayed until they are effectively parsed and validated).

50|$|The table itself {{consists}} of characters that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied. Any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group {{acting on the}} molecule itself will leave it unchanged. But, for acting on a <b>general</b> <b>entity,</b> such as a vector or an orbital, this need not be the case. The vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type. For simple point groups, the values are either 1 or &minus;1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (symmetric) and &minus;1 denotes a sign change (asymmetric).|$|E
50|$|Research into {{implicit}} {{theories of}} intelligence {{has led to}} additional discoveries expanding the idea of entity vs incremental mindset to other areas outside of just intelligence. Views about intelligence are just a single manifestation of a more <b>general</b> <b>entity</b> or incremental mindset which reveals {{a great deal about}} a person's view of the world and self. Generally those with entity views will see all characteristics, in addition to intelligence, as innate and static while those with incremental views see characteristics as malleable. Entity beliefs lead to more stereotyping, greater rigidity in prejudiced beliefs, and difficulties during conflict resolution. Incremental views are connected to more open beliefs and amenability during conflict resolutions. In intimate relationships, those who possess an incremental mindset tend to believe that people can change and exhibit more forgiveness than those with entity mindsets. Similarly, those with entity beliefs are likely to endorse the fundamental attribution error more than those with incremental views, who tend to focus much more on the situation than internal characteristics of an individual.|$|E

On the other hand, our expert annotator outperforms the automation system on protein annotation types. This is because protein annotations are more specific and unambiguous to annotate.|$|E

30|$|Named entity {{mentions}} annotations {{are used}} to indicate where entities of certain types of interest are referred to in a document. For recognizing named entities such as proper names, dates, times, and locations, we use two approaches: a statistical approach to provide coverage for <b>general</b> <b>entity</b> types (e.g., Person, Location, and Organization) and a dictionary-based approach to provide precision for domain-specific types. KEF’s statistical named entity recognizer (NER) annotator can also use the Stanford NER tagger to tag people, organizations, and locations based on a linear chain Conditional Random Field sequence classifier. The dictionary-based NER annotator uses lists of terms provided by the SME to tag entities relevant to the particular domain, such as specific types of people, organizations, or technologies.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the issues of copyright enforcement and management. Especially, the research looks into how the digital technology reshapes the general perceptions and landscape of the copyright system in terms of online enforcement and management. Stepping into the digital age, the interaction between copyright holders and other parties, including online users and the ISPs, establishes two coexisting models—the right-holder-centric model and the cooperative model. Therefore, the dissertation analyzes which model is more appropriate and efficient with respect to online copyright enforcement and management. As a matter of fact, the coexistences of two models provides copyright holders and other parties with multiple options in terms of copyright enforcement and management. Each model has distinctive features and mechanism, and builds upon different perceptions and foundations. The idea that one model can replace the other does not support the analysis in this dissertation because each model covers strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, each model should be the supplementary option to the other according to specific circumstances. To sum up, the two models should works as a <b>general</b> <b>entity</b> to promote the copyright enforcement and management...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) as a rare but important cause of stroke is challenging. We aimed {{to investigate the}} diagnostic value of multidetector-row CT angiography (MDCTA) as a fast and cost-effective imaging tool in diagnosing CVST. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients who presented with clinical symptoms of a possible CVST were included. All patients had received both MDCTA and MR imaging with venous MR-angiography. Three blinded readers {{were asked to identify}} the cerebral sinuses and veins in MDCTA and to evaluate the presence of CVST in MDCTA. Consensus reading with interpretation of the MR imaging served to establish the definite diagnosis. RESULTS: The consensus reading revealed CVST in 10 of the 19 patients. With MDCTA, the venous sinuses could be identified in 99. 2 % and the cerebral veins in 87. 6 % of cases. The sensitivity and specificity of MDCTA for the {{diagnosis of}} CVST were 100 %. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that MDCTA provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CVST. Further studies are needed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of MDCTA in specific subsets of the <b>general</b> <b>entity</b> of CVST such as cortical venous thrombosis, thrombosis of the cavernous sinus, and thrombosis of the internal cerebral veins...|$|E
40|$|Entity {{retrieval}} is {{the problem}} of finding information about a given real-world entity (e. g., director Peter Jackson) from one or a set of data sources. This problem is fundamental in numerous data management settings, but has received little attention. We define the <b>general</b> <b>entity</b> retrieval problem, then discuss the limitations of current information systems (e. g. relational databases, search engines) in solving it. Next, we focus on the specific problem of entity retrieval over structured data (as opposed to text or Web pages). We show that it is inherently more general and difficult than the actively-studied problem of entity matching (i. e. record linkage). We then develop the ENRICH system, which significantly extends entity matching solutions to perform entity retrieval. In particular, ENRICH employs clustering techniques to obtain a global picture on how many entities are "out there" and which data fragment should best be assigned to which entity. It also constructs profiles that capture important characteristics of the target entity, then uses the profiles to help the assignment process. Finally, it leverages "query expansion", an idea commonly used in the information retrieval community, to further improve retrieval accuracy. We apply ENRICH to several real-world domain, and show that it can perform entity retrieval with high accuracy...|$|E

This operation known as automatic indexing normally consists in assigning to the documents either single terms, or more specific entities such as phrases, or more <b>general</b> <b>entities</b> such as term classes. A model, known as discrimination value analysis is introduced which assigns an appropriate role in the indexing operation to the terms, term phrases, and thesaurus classes. The model is used to determine effectiveness criteria for the content identifiers and to generate useful indexing policies. Experimental evidence is given to validate the theory...|$|R
