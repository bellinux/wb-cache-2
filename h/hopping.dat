5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive. <b>Hopping</b> with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of <b>hopping</b> with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of <b>hopping</b> with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hopping</b> or jumping is conceptually {{the most}} basic {{mechanism}} for diffusion of adatoms. In this model, the adatoms reside on adsorption sites on the surface lattice.

Studies have shown the presence of metastable transition states between adsorption sites wherein it may be possible for adatoms to temporarily reside.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the Nicobar pigeon and the Kanaka pigeon (which {{does not appear to}} have had diminished flight abilities) suggests dispersal through island <b>hopping</b> and an origin for the spotted green pigeon in Oceania or southeast Asia. The fact that the closest relatives of Caloenas were the extinct subfamily Raphinae (first demonstrated in a 2002 study), which consists of the dodo from Mauritius and the Rodrigues solitaire from Rodrigues, indicates that the spotted green pigeon could also have originated somewhere in the Indian Ocean. In any case, it seems most likely that the bird inhabited an island location, like its relatives. That the Caloenas pigeons were grouped in a clade at the base of the lineage leading to Raphinae indicates that the ancestors of the flightless dodo and Rodrigues solitaire were able to fly, and reached the Mascarene Islands by island <b>hopping</b> from south Asia.|$|E

5|$|Most social foragers must {{search for}} food while also {{avoiding}} predators. It {{has been suggested}} that individuals that play scrounger could also, by virtue of their head position, be alert for predators and hence contribute to antipredatory vigilance. If the scrounger tactic is compatible with antipredatory vigilance, then an increase in antipredatory vigilance should lead to the detection of more joining opportunities, and hence more joining. When stationary, the head-up tactic {{has been shown to be}} associated with antipredatory vigilance. However scanning while <b>hopping</b> does not aid in vigilance and it is thought that the scrounger tactic is incompatible with antipredatory vigilance in the scaly-breasted munia.|$|E
