40|$|Neurochemical, {{electrophysiological}} and behavioural {{evidence indicates}} that certain forms of goal-directed behaviours are mediated by complex and reciprocal interactions between limbic and dopamine (<b>DA)</b> <b>inputs</b> in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Mesoaccumbens DA transmission appears to be compartmentalized; synaptic DA transmission is mediated by phasic burst firing of DA neurons, whereas extrasynaptic tonic DA levels are regulated by DA neuron population activity and limbic glutamatergic inputs to the NAc. DA release facilitated by limbic inputs and acting on D 1 receptors can either potentiate or suppress neural activity driven by separate limbic inputs converging on the same postsynaptic NAc neurons. In turn, D 1 receptors in the NAc mediate accuracy of search behaviour regulated by hippocampalâ€“ventral striatal circuitries; D 2 receptors appear to mediate motivational aspects of task performance. These findings suggest that dopaminergic modulation of limbic afferents to the NAc may be a cellular mechanism for input selection that governs the smooth coordination of behaviour by permitting information processed by one limbic region to temporarily exert control over the type and intensity of adaptive behavioural responses...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{substantia nigra}} (SN) was transplanted to the neostriatum in adult rats {{subjected}} to a unilateral or serial bilateral destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) pathway. The survival of the graft {{and the growth of}} DA-containing fibers from the graft into the host brain was studied by fluorescence histochemistry and micro-fluorometry. The motor asymmetry, and the contralateral 'sensory neglect' induced by a unilateral destruction of the nigrostriatal DA pathway, were monitored in the transplanted rats and in non-transplanted controls through repeated measurements of the amphetamine-and apomorphine-induced rotational behaviour, and through analysis of the rats performance in a number of sensorimotor tests. Finally, the development of aphagia and adipsia after a serial bilateral destruction of both nigrostriatal DA pathways were followed in rats bearing bilateral SN transplants and in lesioned non-transplanted controls. The results show that large parts of the dorsal neostriatum can be reinnervated by DA-containing axons from the intracortical transplant and that this new <b>DA</b> <b>input</b> can fully compensate for the amphetamine-induced motor assymmetry that resulted from the initial destruction of the innate nigrostriatal DA pathway. The fluorescence microscopical observations provide strong evidence that the compensation of the amphetamine-induced rotational response was specifically related to the re-establishment of a new <b>DA</b> <b>input</b> to the denervated neostriatum, and that the degree of rotational compensation was well correlated to the magnitude of ingrowth into the neostriatum. Subsequent surgical removal of the SN transplant reinstated the initial rotational behaviour. In sharp contrast to the marked compensation in motor asymmetry, the transplanted rats showed no tendency to recover in their sensorimotor performance. Thus, while the sensorimotor deficit had recovered in the control group a marked contralateral 'sensory neglect' remained in the transplanted animals. Furthermore, removal of the transplant produced a significant improvement in their sensorimotor performance within 3 days. In the bilaterally transplanted animals the presence of the transplants did not prevent the development of severe adipsia, aphagia and akinesia following the destruction of the remaining contralateral nigrostriatal pathway. In fact, the recovery from the consummatory deficits tended to be better in the lesioned control rats than in the transplanted ones. It is concluded that SN transplants reinnervation the dorsal part of the neostriatum are able to replace the innate SN in normalizing some aspects of the rats motor behaviour, while their sensorimotor deficits and deficits in consummatory behaviour were unaffected. It is suggested that this dissociation of transplant-induced recovery is due to the failure of the SN transplants to reinnervate those parts of the neostriatum which are most directly implicated in sensorimotor and consummatory behaviour...|$|R
40|$|How do organisms {{select and}} {{organize}} relevant sensory input in working memory (WM) {{in order to}} deal with constantly changing environmental cues? Once information has been stored in WM, how is it protected from and altered by the continuous stream of sensory input and internally generated planning? The present study proposes a novel role for dopamine (DA) in the maintenance of WM in the prefrontal cortex (Pfc) neurons that begins to address these issues. In particular, DA mediates the alternation of the Pfc network between input-driven and internally-driven states, which in turn drives WM updates and storage. A biologically inspired neural network model of Pfc is formulated to provide a link between the mechanisms of state switching and the biophysical properties of Pfc neurons. This model belongs to the recurrent competitive fields 33 class of dynamical systems which have been extensively mathematically characterized and exhibit the two functional states of interest: input-driven and internally-driven. This hypothesis was tested with two working memory tasks of increasing difficulty: a simple working memory task and a delayed alternation task. The results suggest that optimal WM storage in spite of noise is achieved with a phasic <b>DA</b> <b>input</b> followed by a lower DA sustained activity.

Here, we show that activation of D 2 -like dopamine receptors on DR 5 -HT neurons elicits a membrane depolarization and an inward current associated with an increase in membrane conductance. The DAinduced inward current (I DA) exhibits a linear I-V relationship and reverses polarity at around ï¿½ 15 mV, suggesting the involvement of a mixed cationic conductance.

In turn the jcBNST sends GABAergic projections to the medial division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEAm) {{as well as other}} brain regions. We recently described a form of long-term potentiation of the intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) of neurons of the juxtacapsular nucleus of BNST (jcBNST) in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the stria terminalis that was impaired during protracted withdrawal from alcohol, cocaine, and heroin and in rats chronically treated with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) intracerebroventricularly. Here we show that DAergic neurotransmission is required for the induction of LTP-IE of jcBNST neurons through dopamine (DA) D 1 receptors. Thus, activation of the central CRF stress system and altered DAergic neurotransmission during protracted withdrawal from alcohol and drugs of abuse may contribute to the disruption of LTP-IE in the jcBNST. Impairment of this form of intrinsic neuronal plasticity in the jcBNST could result in inadequate neuronal integration and reduced inhibition of the CEA, contributing to the negative affective state that characterizes protracted abstinence in post-dependent individuals.

DA loss is associated with movement disorders in humans. In songbirds, DA is important for motivational behavior underlying reproductive drive. Within the zebra finch species, DA modulates social-context dependent behavior when the bird is vocally practicing alone versus performing to a potential female mate. During these singing behaviors, there are differences in DA levels within Area X, the specialized sub-region of the zebra finch basal ganglia dedicated to song learning and ongoing adult song maintenance. These natural differences in DA levels are associated with quantifiable changes in features of song, suggesting that the songbird may be a suitable model for investigating DA-driven changes in voice associated with early stages of Parkinson's Disease. In the present study, I used Western blotting to characterize natural changes in protein biomarkers of DA, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, across non-singing and singing behaviors. In a separate group of birds, I injected the neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) into Area X and assessed the effects of DA depletion on these biomarkers and on features of song in different behavioral contexts. With 6 -OHDA administration, measurable decreases in DA biomarkers were detected, and select acoustic features of song became more stereotyped.

This effect shows single-trial habituation in NAc shell but not in core or in mPFC. Morphine sensitization abolishes habituation of DA responsiveness in NAc shell but induces it in mPFC. These observations support the hypothesis of an inhibitory influence of mPFC DA on NAc DA. To test this hypothesis, we used in vivo microdialysis to investigate the effect of mPFC 6 -hydroxy-dopamine (6 -OHDA) lesions on the NAc DA responsiveness to taste stimuli. 6 -OHDA was infused bilaterally in the mPFC of rats implanted with guide cannulae. After 1 week, rats were implanted with an intraoral catheter, microdialysis probes were inserted into the guide cannulae, and dialysate DA was monitored in NAc shell/core after intraoral chocolate. 6 -OHDA infusion reduced tissue DA in the mPFC by 75 %. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry showed that lesions were confined to the mPFC. mPFC 6 -OHDA lesion {{did not affect the}} NAc shell DA responsiveness to chocolate in naive rats but abolished habituation in rats pre-exposed to the taste.

40|$|Dopamine (DA) {{is a key}} {{transmitter}} in the basal ganglia, yet DA transmission does not conform to several aspects of the classic synaptic doctrine. Axonal DA release occurs through vesicular exocytosis and is action potential- and Ca 2 + -dependent. However, in addition to axonal release, DA neurons in midbrain exhibit somatodendritic release by an incompletely understood, but apparently exocytotic, mechanism. Even in striatum, axonal release sites are controversial, with evidence for DA varicosities that lack postsynaptic specialization, and largely extrasynaptic DA receptors and transporters. Moreover, DA release is often assumed to reflect a global response to a population of activities in midbrain DA neurons, whether tonic or phasic, with precise timing and specificity of action governed by other basal ganglia circuits. This view has been reinforced by anatomical evidence showing dense axonal DA arbors throughout striatum, and a lattice network formed by DA axons and glutamatergic input from cortex and thalamus. Nonetheless, localized DA transients are seen in vivo using voltammetric methods with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mechanistic studies using similar methods in vitro have revealed local regulation of DA release by other transmitters and modulators, {{as well as by}} proteins known to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. Notably, the actions of most other striatal transmitters on DA release also do not conform to the synaptic doctrine, with the absence of direct synaptic contacts for glutamate, GABA, and acetylcholine (ACh) on striatal DA axons. Overall, the findings reviewed here indicate that DA signaling in the basal ganglia is sculpted by cooperation between the timing and pattern of <b>DA</b> <b>input</b> and those of local regulatory factors.

Another {{is that they have}} overlapping brain regions and/or neural pathways that are implicated in their etiologies. Consequently, these neuropsychiatric disorders are often exhibited concurrently or sequentially with one another. For these reasons, it is of clinical importance to better understand the mechanisms driving these disorders and how they interact with each other. The following studies aim to shed light onto these topics. We first investigated the Trpc 4 gene as potential target for drug addiction and anxiety. The Trpc 4 gene was selected based on it expression pattern in the brain and its function. The gene is abundantly expressed in regions that receive extensive dopamine (<b>DA)</b> <b>input</b> from the brainâ€™s reward circuitry. These regions are highly involved in mood regulation and reward-seeking. The TRPC 4 ion channel is the product of the Trpc 4 gene, and is known for increasing neuronal excitability. These unique properties make Trpc 4 an intriguing candidate for addiction and anxiety. Indeed, we found that rats lacking the Trpc 4 gene showed an increase in anxiety-like phenotypes and a decrease in cocaine-seeking compared to wild-type rats. Next, we examined how repeated cocaine exposure and stressor controllability effect anxiety. Stress is a leading risk factor in developing such disorders as drug addiction and anxiety. However, it is known that the degree of control one has over a stressful situation is predictive of the outcome. Controllable stress has been shown to mitigate the negative effects induced by uncontrollable stress. We found that repeated cocaine exposure does not interfere with this phenomenon, even after a drug withdrawal period. These studies and previously published studies on the effects of stressor controllability all used rat models. To further our understanding of these concepts, we next wanted to determine if a mouse could be used in order {{to take advantage of the}} multitude of transgenic strains available. However, based on our results, it appears that mice are not an ideal organism to study the effects of stressor controllability on neuropsychiatric disorders...|$|R

40|$|Corticostriatal {{regulation}} of striatal dopamine (DA) transmission {{has long been}} postulated, but ionotropic glutamate receptors have not been localized directly to DA axons. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) are emerging as major players in striatal function, and can govern DA transmission by activating nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on <b>DA</b> axons. Cortical <b>inputs</b> to ChIs have historically been perceived as sparse, but recent evidence indicates that they strongly activate ChIs. We explored whether activation of M 1 /M 2 corticostriatal inputs can consequently gate DA transmission, via ChIs. We reveal that optogenetic activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing corticostriatal axons can drive striatal DA release detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and requires activation of nAChRs on DA axons and AMPA receptors on ChIs that promote short-latency action potentials. By contrast, DA release driven by optogenetic activation of intralaminar thalamostriatal inputs involves additional activation of NMDA receptors on ChIs and action potential generation over longer timescales. Therefore, cortical and thalamic glutamate <b>inputs</b> can modulate <b>DA</b> transmission by regulating ChIs as gatekeepers, through ionotropic glutamate receptors. The different use of AMPA and NMDA receptors by cortical versus thalamic inputs might lead to distinct input integration strategies by ChIs and distinct modulation of the function of DA and striatum. </p...|$|R
40|$|The B-meson {{distribution}} amplitude (DA) {{is defined}} as the matrix element of a quark-antiquark bilocal light-cone operator in the heavy-quark effective theory, corresponding to a long-distance component in the factorization formula for exclusive B-meson decays. The evolution equation for the B-meson DA is governed by the cusp anomalous dimension as well as the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-type anomalous dimension, and these anomalous dimensions give the "quasilocal" kernel in the coordinate-space representation. We show that this evolution equation can be solved analytically in the coordinate-space, accomplishing the relevant Sudakov resummation at the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The quasilocal nature leads to a quite simple form of our solution which determines the B-meson DA with a quark-antiquark light-cone separation t in terms of the DA at a lower renormalization scale Î¼ with smaller interquark separations zt (z â‰¤ 1). This formula allows us to present rigorous calculation of the B-meson DA at the factorization scale âˆ¼âˆš(m_b Î›_ QCD) for t less than âˆ¼ 1 GeV^- 1, using the recently obtained operator product expansion of the <b>DA</b> as the <b>input</b> at Î¼âˆ¼ 1 GeV. We also derive the master formula, which reexpresses the integrals of the DA at Î¼âˆ¼âˆš(m_b Î›_ QCD) for the factorization formula by the compact integrals of the DA at Î¼âˆ¼ 1 GeV.

40|$|The local {{circuitry}} of the tegmental area (VTA) consists {{primarily of}} dopamine (DA) and GABA neurons. Interac-tions between DA and GABA neurons {{are critical for}} regulating DA neuron activity, and thus DA efflux throughout the brain. One striking example that demon-strates the significance of local interactions between DA and GABA neurons is related to nicotine reinforcement. Experimentally, it was shown that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine (nAch) receptors on GABA neurons by Ach leads {{to an increase in}} both firing and bursting of the DA neuron, while nicotine produces an opposite effect [1]. In order to investigate the mechanism of this GABA-mediated effect, we created a biologically plausible model of local VTA microcircuitry. The model network consists of a population of GABA neurons innervating one DA neuron. DA neuron dynamics are described by a conduc-tance based model; which includes intrinsic and synaptic currents conducted by NMDA, AMPA, GABA, and nAch receptors. GABA neurons that are described by Wang-Buszaki equations provide inhibitory drive to the <b>DA</b> neu-ron. Excitatory <b>inputs</b> (Glu and Ach) to DA and GABA neurons are modeled as Poisson-distributed spike trains. Ach pulses act as synchronizing inputs to a population of GABA neurons, due to a transient activation of GABA nAch receptors, while nicotine persistently activates nAch receptor, causing an increase in firing frequency of GAB...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cocaine {{increases}} {{the level of}} endogenous dopamine (DA) in the striatum by blocking the DA transporter. Endogenous <b>DA</b> modulates glutamatergic <b>inputs</b> to striatal neurons and this modulation influences motor activity. Since D 2 DA and A 2 A-adenosine receptors (A 2 A-Rs) have antagonistic effects on striatal neurons, drugs targeting adenosine receptors such as caffeine-like compounds, could enhance psychomotor stimulant effects of cocaine. In this study, we analyzed the electrophysiological effects of cocaine and A 2 A-Rs antagonists in striatal slices and the motor effects produced by this pharmacological modulation in rodents. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Concomitant administration of cocaine and A 2 A-Rs antagonists reduced glutamatergic synaptic transmission in striatal spiny neurons while these drugs failed to produce this effect when given in isolation. This inhibitory effect was dependent on the activation of D 2 -like receptors {{and the release of}} endocannabinoids since it was prevented by L-sulpiride and reduced by a CB 1 receptor antagonist. Combined application of cocaine and A 2 A-R antagonists also reduced the firing frequency of striatal cholinergic interneurons suggesting that changes in cholinergic tone might contribute to this synaptic modulation. Finally, A 2 A-Rs antagonists, {{in the presence of a}} sub-threshold dose of cocaine, enhanced locomotion and, in line with the electrophysiological experiments, this enhanced activity required activation of D 2 -like and CB 1 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides a possible synaptic mechanism explaining how caffeine-like compounds could enhance psychomotor stimulant effects of cocaine...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo {{neuronal}} {{populations of}} the lateral hypothalamus that, respectively, produce melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin peptides are crucially involved in control of metabolism, feeding and related goal-oriented behaviors. In contrast to orexin neurons, mainly involved in short-term regulation of feeding, MCH neurons participate in long-term control of energy storage and body weight. Beyond its effect on feeding, MCH {{has also been shown}} to be involved in regulation of seeking behavior and addiction through modulation of dopamine (DA) metabolism. This regulation is essential for reinforcement-associated behaviors. Moreover, drugs of abuse, which increase extracellular DA levels, are known to decrease food intake. Consistent with this observation, DA has been shown to modulate orexin neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. However, no study is available concerning the effects of DA on MCH neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were done in hypothalamic mouse brain slices. MCH neurons were identified by Tau-Cyan-GFP labeling using a transgenic mouse model (MCH-GFP). First, we show that DA (10 - 200 Î¼M) induces an outward current in MCH neurons. However, this current is not due to activation of DA receptors, but mediated through activation of Î± 2 -noradrenergic receptors and subsequent opening of G-protein activated inward rectifier K+ (GIRK) channels. Current-clamp experiments revealed that this GIRK-activation leads to hyperpolarization, thus decreasing excitability of MCH neurons. Furthermore, we confirm that MCH neurons receive mainly GABAergic inputs rather than glutamatergic ones. We show that <b>DA</b> modulates these <b>inputs</b> in a complex manner: at low concentrations, DA activates D 1 -like receptors, promoting presynaptic activity, whereas, at higher concentrations (100 Î¼M), D 2 -like receptor activation inhibits presynaptic activity. Overall, DA should lead to a decrease in MCH neuron excitability, likely resulting in down-regulation of MCH release and feeding behavior...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the midbrain dopamine (<b>DA)</b> neurons, receiving <b>inputs</b> from the cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits and the brainstem, compute reward prediction error (RPE), the difference between reward obtained or expected to be obtained and reward that had been expected to be obtained. These reward expectations are suggested to be stored in the CBG synapses and updated according to RPE through synaptic plasticity, which is induced by released DA. These together constitute the 'DA=RPE' hypothesis, which describes the mutual interaction between DA and the CBG circuits and serves as the primary working hypothesis in studying reward learning and value-based decision making. However, recent work has revealed a new type of DA signal that appears not to represent RPE. Specifically, it has been found in a reward-associated maze task that striatal DA concentration primarily shows a gradual increase towards the goal. We explored whether such ramping DA could be explained by extending the 'DA=RPE' hypothesis by taking into account biological properties of the CBG circuits. In particular, we examined effects of possible time-dependent decay of DA-dependent plastic changes of synaptic strengths by incorporating decay of learned values into the RPE-based reinforcement learning model and simulating reward learning tasks. We then found that incorporation of such a decay dramatically changes the model's behavior, causing gradual ramping of RPE. Moreover, we further incorporated magnitude-dependence of the rate of decay, which could potentially be in accord with some past observations, and found that near-sigmoidal ramping of RPE, resembling the observed DA ramping, could then occur. Given that synaptic decay can be useful for flexibly reversing and updating the learned reward associations, especially in case the baseline DA is low and encoding of negative RPE by DA is limited, the observed DA ramping would be indicative of the operation of such flexible reward learning...|$|R
40|$|Multipotent haematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) {{originate}} in the dorsal aorta (DA) during vertebrate embryogenesis, and after migrating to a permanent niche, {{give rise to a}} continuous supply of mature blood cells of all lineages throughout adult life. Previous cell tracing experiments have shown that the cells of the DA migrate here from an early collection of haemangioblasts (bipotential precursors of blood and endothelial cells) which reside in the dorsolateral plate (DLP) mesoderm. Development of HSCs is tightly regulated by a number of key signalling pathways in both the DLP and the DA. In particular, notch signalling is considered an important factor in vascular, arterial and HSC development. Here, the relatively slow development and the spatial separation of definitive haematopoiesis from primitive haematopoiesis in Xenopus laevis has been exploited to reveal the first defect of reduced notch signalling in the Xenopus <b>DA.</b> Two notch <b>inputs</b> to HSC programming have been identified in Xenopus: notch 4 and its target genes, esr 7 and esr 10, are expressed from stage 31, immediately after migrating haemangioblast cells reach the midline of the embryo to form the DA, whilst notch 1 is expressed slightly later, from stage 34, and controls expression of two further notch target genes, esr 1 and hesr 1. Using both morpholino knockdown of these six genes, and chemical inhibition of notch signalling using a specific Î³-secretase inhibitor, notch signalling has been demonstrated to be essential for HSC programming but dispensable for earlier haemangioblast and arterial programming. Furthermore, esr 1, downstream of both notch 1 and notch 4, is shown to be responsible for repression of endothelial genes in the DA. Taken together, this demonstrates that a cascade of notch and notch effector genes are essential for the programming of Xenopus HSCs. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to {{analytically}} investigate a range of design issues for PAs used in SDR applications, particularly the trade-offs in view of broadband limitations. This thesis explores basic bandwidth limitation analysis and introduces various broadband PAs design, before applying this to the realization {{of a number of}} DAs. This gives an understanding on the bandwidth limitation and the conceptual target to achieve broadband amplifiers while other RF parameters are fulfilled. It {{is important to note that}} to achieve high DA efficiency performance, the multi current sources must be combined to a single load by presenting an optimum virtual impedance to each current source in two directions (Zu(k) and Zr(k)). Measurement results showed PAE > 30 % is achieved across the operating frequency range with a broadband impedance transformer employing parallel coupled line approach. As an important point, one should note that the design concept presented in this work provides appropriate guidelines to maximize DA efficiency. A novel topology of dual fed <b>DA</b> including <b>input</b> and output splitter realized by lumped elements, and with the termination adjusted for the optimum power performance with low DC supply voltage is presented. The termination adjustment is accomplished by relevant improvement obtained in comparison to the conventional DA topology demonstrates the effectiveness of the topology. For a first time, pole zero identification technique is applied to the DA, to understand the origin of the oscillation nature due to the multi loops nature. The analysis considers the DA as a basic feedback oscillator circuit i. e. Hartley Oscillator and using a simplified transistor model. The origin of the oscillation can be pointed to the trans-conductance nature or multi-loops nature associated due to the feedback network. Large-signal stability analysis based on pole-zero identification is applied to analyze parametric oscillations in high-efficiency DPA. Large-signal stability analysis is then used to stabilize a high-efficiency 3 -section LDMOS DPA with a minimum impact on circuit performance. Two DPA development for SDR PA applications are demonstrated good results, where the first one has achieved 10 W output power, 32 dB gain and PAE > 15 % across the operating bandwidth with cascaded DPA. To the researcherâ€™s knowledge, the best performance in output power gain response within an operating bandwidth up to 2 GHz are demonstrated with low cost implementation technology, and consumes reasonable small size area. Second DPA development using device load pull impedance termination values to determine vector combining input and output network design demonstrated highest output power-efficiency in the state-of-art of the DPA results. Measurement results of output power more than 35 W is demonstrated, and with reasonable selection of impedance values will lead to optimum output power efficiency performance across bandwidth. To fulfill the impedance matching to 50 -ohm load, with reasonable minimum loss, small area and cost, an impedance transformer/filter from 12 -ohm to 50 -ohm is designed. It has been exhibited that measured and simulated results are in excellent agreement, and the insertion loss of 1. 1 +/- 0. 9 dB is recorded experimentally...|$|R
40|$| politische Interessen etc, irrtÃ¼mlicherweise an Nicht-Arme. Fast alle MaÃŸnahmen im Land leiden unter einer unzureichenden Zielgenauigkeit. Daher untersucht diese Arbeit potenzielle Methoden und Modelle, die die Zielgenauigkeit von Agrar- und EntwicklungsmaÃŸnahmen des Landes verbessern kÃ¶nnen. DarÃ¼ber hinaus schÃ¤tzen wir die KosteneffektivitÃ¤t und Auswirkungen einer Fokussierung auf Arme und Kleinbauern. Es wird hÃ¤ufig argumentiert, dass zielgruppengenaue Programme nicht kosteneffektiv sind und dass, wenn sÃ¤mtliche Kosten der Zielgruppenfindung berÃ¼cksichtigt werden, ein gut abgestimmtes zielgruppenorientiertes Programm nicht kosteneffizienter wÃ¤re und keine grÃ¶ÃŸeren Effekte auf die Armutsreduzierung hÃ¤tte als ein generelles Programm. Wir untersuchen diese These anhand von Haushaltsdaten aus Malawi. DarÃ¼ber hinaus bewerten wir, ob die Administration und DurchfÃ¼hrung von Entwicklungsprogrammen mit Hilfe der neu entwickelten Modelle zielgruppengenauer und kosteneffizienter ist als bisherige Programme zur Subventionierung von landwirtschaftlichen Betriebsmitteln, insbesondere das Starter Pack von 2000 / 2001 und <b>das</b> Agricultural <b>Input</b> Support Program (AISP) von 2006 / 2007. Unter Verwendung von Daten des Malawi Second Integrated Household Survey (IHS 2) und einer Reihe von SchÃ¤tzmethoden mit schrittweiser Auswahl von Variablen entwickeln wir empirische Modelle zur Verbesserung der Armutsminderung durch Agrar- und Entwicklungsprogramme im lÃ¤ndlichen und stÃ¤dtischen Malawi. ZusÃ¤tzlich analysiert die Arbeit die Ã¼ber die Stichprobe hinausgehende GÃ¼te der verschiedenen Modelle bei der Identifizierung der Armen und Kleinbauern. Die Robustheit der Modelle wurde darÃ¼ber hinaus mit Hilfe von Bootstrapping-Simulationen fÃ¼r die Vorhersageintervalle auÃŸerhalb der Stichprobe geschÃ¤tzt. Die SchÃ¤tzergebnisse legen nahe, dass mit dem neuentwickelten System eine fehlgerichtete Ausrichtung erheblich reduziert werden kann und dass die Zielgruppenausrichtung von EntwicklungsmaÃŸnahmen im Vergleich zu bisher im Land genutzten Mechanismen verbessert werden kann. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass die angewendeten SchÃ¤tzmethoden alle die gleiche Zielgenauigkeit erreichen. Das lÃ¤ndliche Modell erreicht bei Kalibrierung auf die {{nationale}} Armutslinie eine Genauigkeit bei der Erreichung von Armen von 72 % und ein Durchsickern an Nichtzielgruppen von 27 %. Auf der anderen Seite erreicht das stÃ¤dtische Modell im Durchschnitt eine Zielgruppengenauigkeit von 62 % und ein Durchsickern von 39 % (ebenfalls bei Kalibrierung auf die nationale Armutslinie). Diese Ergebnisse werden ebenfalls durch die Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Kurven der Modelle bestÃ¤tigt, die keine betrÃ¤chtlichen Unterschiede zwischen der aggregierten Vorhersagegenauigkeit der SchÃ¤tzmodelle zeigen. Die ROC-Kurve ist ein mÃ¤chtiges Werkzeug das von Programmverantwortlichen und Projektmanagern zur Entscheidungsfindung darÃ¼ber genutzt werden kann, wieviele Arme ein Programm oder eine EntwicklungsmaÃŸnahme erreichen soll und wieviele fÃ¤lschlicherweise begÃ¼nstigte Nicht-Arme gefÃ¶rdert werden. Die Kalibrierung der Modelle auf eine hÃ¶here Armutslinie verbessert ihre Zielgenauigkeit, wÃ¤hrend eine Kalibrierung auf eine niedrigere Linie zum Gegenteil fÃ¼hrt. Zum Beispiel erreicht das lÃ¤ndliche Modell bei Verwendung der internationalen Armutslinie von 1, 25 USD (d. h. MK 59, 18 PPP) etwa 82 % der Armen und fÃ¶rdert fÃ¤lschlicherweise nur 16 % der Nicht-Armen. Auf der anderen Seite verschlechtert die Verwendung einer extremen Armutslinie von MK 29, 81 die Genauigkeit und das Durchsickern der Modelle: Das lÃ¤ndliche Modell erzielt eine Armutsgenauigkeit von 51 % und ein Durchsickern von 39 % wÃ¤hrend das stÃ¤dtische Modell eine Genauigkeit von 28 % und ein Durchsickern von 68 % erreicht. DarÃ¼ber hinaus deutet ein Herunterbrechen der Fehlausrichtungen nach Armutsdezilen an, dass die Modelle in Bezug auf die fÃ¤lschlicherweise BegÃ¼nstigten gut funktionieren: Sie decken die meisten der Ã¤rmsten Dezile ab, wÃ¤hrend die meisten der reichsten Dezile nicht berÃ¼cksichtigt werden. Diese Ergebnisse haben naheliegende wÃ¼nschenswerte Wohlfahrtseffekte fÃ¼r Arme und Kleinbauern. Es ist wichtig zu erwÃ¤hnen, dass die ausgewÃ¤hlten Modelle Armut nicht erklÃ¤ren sondern lediglich voraussagen kÃ¶nnen. Ein kausaler Zusammenhang kann auf Grundlage der Ergebnisse nicht hergestellt werden. Es bestehen zwingende Anhaltspunkte zu Gunsten von Zielgruppenorientierung da auch die BerÃ¼cksichtigung sÃ¤mtlicher Kosten die Zielgruppenorientierung nicht kosten- und ergebnisineffizient werden lÃ¤sst. Die Ergebnisse legen nahe, dass das neue System erheblich genauer und zieleffizienter ist als der bisher verwendete Mechanismus zur zielgruppengenauen Programmgestaltung fÃ¼r landwirtschaftliche Betriebsmittel. Ebenso deuten die Simulationsergebnisse an, dass die Fokussierung auf Arme und Kleinbauern kosten- und ergebniseffektiver ist als eine globale Erfassung der gesamten BevÃ¶lkerung. Bessere Zielgruppenausrichtung verringert nicht nur die direkten Kosten der Regierung Malawis fÃ¼r unterstÃ¼tzende MaÃŸnahmen sondern reduziert auch die Gesamtkosten eines Programms. Obwohl die administrativen Kosten mit genauerer Zielgruppenausrichtung ansteigen, zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass die Vorteile insgesamt die Kosten Ã¼berwiegen. Ebenso verringert eine genauere Ausrichtung die Kosten fÃ¼r das Durchsickern in groÃŸem MaÃŸstab und sorgt fÃ¼r die grÃ¶ÃŸten Auswirkungen auf die Armut verglichen mit generellen Verfahren. Mit steigender Genauigkeit der Ausrichtung erhÃ¶ht sich jedoch weder in jedem Fall die Verteilungseffizienz, noch verringert sich in jedem Fall die Folgearmut. Weiterhin scheint das neu entwickelte System kosteneffizienter zu sein als das Starter Pack von 2000 / 2001 und <b>das</b> Agricultural <b>Input</b> Support Program (AISP) von 2006 / 2007. WÃ¤hrend das Starter Pack und das AISP etwa 50 % sÃ¤mtlicher Mittel an Arme und Kleinbauern verteilen, erreichen unter dem neuen System etwa 73 % der Mittel Arme und Kleinbauern. Ebenso werden unter dem neuen System die Kosten des Durchsickerns um 55 % gegenÃ¼ber dem Starter Pack und um 57 % gegenÃ¼ber dem AISP gesenkt. Unter dem neuen System ist es daher mÃ¶glich, Durchsickern und Fehlallokation zu verringern und die Kosten- und Verteilungseffizienz von Entwicklungsprogrammen des Landes zu verbessern. Die ausgewÃ¤hlten Indikatoren spiegeln das ArmutsverstÃ¤ndnis lokaler Gemeinden wider und beinhalten demografische Variablen ebenso wie Bildung, LebensverhÃ¤ltnisse und Eigentum. Diese Indikatoren sind objektiv und die meisten kÃ¶nnen leicht verifiziert werden. Die Sammlung von Informationen bezÃ¼glich dieser Indikatoren kÃ¶nnte jedoch effektiv einen ÃœberprÃ¼fungsprozess darstellen. Es sollte erwÃ¤hnt werden, dass der Schwerpunkt in dieser Arbeit zwar auf Proxy Means Tests gelegt wurde, was aber nicht impliziert, dass andere mÃ¶gliche Methoden zur Zielgruppenfokussierung abgelehnt werden sollten. Proxy Means Tests sind tatsÃ¤chlich nicht einwandfrei bei Armutsidentifizierung und das entwickelte System kann in einem Mehrstufenprozess mit anderen Methoden kombiniert werden. Zielgruppenfokussierung kann darÃ¼ber hinaus eine politisch sensible Angelegenheit sein; das entwickelte System berÃ¼cksichtigt nicht die Tatsache, dass Programmverantwortliche und Projektmanager oder Entwicklungshelfer die Kriterien zur Anspruchsberechtigung aufgrund von politischen, verwaltungs- und haushaltsbezogenen oder anderen GrÃ¼nden anpassen. Die entwickelten Modelle kÃ¶nnen in einem weiten Spektrum von FÃ¤llen verwendet werden, z. B. bei der Identifizierung von Armen und Kleinbauern, bei der Verbesserung bestehender Vergabemechanismen fÃ¼r subventionierte landwirtschaftliche Betriebsmittel, bei der Beurteilung der Anspruchsberechtigung von Haushalten, zur SchÃ¤tzung von ArmutshÃ¶he und beim Monitoring von ArmutsverÃ¤nderungen im Zeitverlauf. Da sich das Land und Geldgeber die Kosten hÃ¤ufiger Untersuchungen zu den Lebenshaltungskosten der Haushalte oft nicht leisten kÃ¶nnen, sind die Modelle auch hilfreich bei der kostengÃ¼nstigen SchÃ¤tzung der Auswirkungen von Entwicklungsprogrammen die auf BedÃ¼rftige unterhalb der Armutslinie abzielen und bei der Beurteilung der ArmutsbekÃ¤mpfung von im Land tÃ¤tigen Mikrofinanzinstitutionen. Diese groÃŸe Bandbreite von Anwendungen lÃ¤sst die Modelle zu potenziell interessanten Politikinstrumenten fÃ¼r das Land werden. Die entwickelten Modelle sind jedoch nicht ausreichend. Sie mÃ¼ssen einhergehen mit Investitionen in Bildung, lÃ¤ndliche Infrastruktur, Wirtschaftswachstum in verwandten Wirtschaftssektoren und mit einem starken politischen Willen, die Wohlfahrt der BevÃ¶lkerung Malawis zu steigern. Diese Arbeit stellt ein GrundgerÃ¼st fÃ¼r die Entwicklung und Bewertung eines einfachen und recht genauen Systems zur Identifizierung von Armen und Kleinbauern in Malawi bereit, doch die Methodik kann auch in anderen Bereichen angewandter Forschung nÃ¼tzlich sein und kann in anderen EntwicklungslÃ¤ndern mit Ã¤hnlichen Problemen bei der Zielgruppenfokussierung repliziert werden...|$|R
