50|$|Environmentally {{friendly}} {{alternatives to}} using tampons are the menstrual cup, reusable sanitary pads, menstrual sponges and reusable tampons. Menstrual cups are silicone cups that are worn inside the vagina {{to collect the}} fluid. Reusable sanitary pads are similar to disposable sanitary pads, but differ {{in the sense that}} they can be washed and used as many times as needed by the owner. For women who cannot or don't want to use a menstrual cup, but like internal products, sea sponges inserted like tampons may be a good option. These can also be washed out and reused and when they lose their absorbency can be composted. Some women have also made reusable tampons, often pieces of <b>knit</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> <b>fabric</b> that are rolled up and inserted into the vagina, and later washed, dried and reused. These alternatives are environmentally friendly because they are reusable, and in some cases compostable, so they contribute less waste to landfills.|$|R

50|$|Labels on yarn for {{handicrafts}} {{often include}} information on gauge, {{known in the}} UK as tension, which is a measurement of how many stitches and rows are produced per inch or per cm on a specified size of <b>knitting</b> needle <b>or</b> <b>crochet</b> hook. The proposed standardization uses a four-by-four inch/ten-by-ten cm <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> square, with the resultant number of stitches across and rows high made by the suggested tools on the label to determine the gauge.|$|R
50|$|Metallic fibers {{are often}} {{classified}} as fancy yarns and {{are created by}} adding a metallic fiber or yarn to the blend. These {{are not to be}} confused with actual wire used in jewellery that is sometimes <b>knit</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Homasote is {{also used}} for {{blocking}} <b>knit</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet</b> pieces. [...] "Homosote is sturdy, and incredibly absorbent. It will wick water away from your garment so it dries more quickly. And it's like a bulletin board -- you can stick pins in it easily." ...|$|R
50|$|Clothing {{can also}} include <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> {{clothing}} and accessories. Some knitters may use knitting machines {{with varying degrees}} of automatic patterning.

25|$|Any yarn can {{be either}} <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted,</b> {{provided}} needles <b>or</b> hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties {{should be taken into}} account. For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for Amigurumi crochet.|$|R
5000|$|Adherents of the Rastafari {{movement}} often wear a {{very large}} <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> black beret with red, gold and green circles atop their dreadlocks.

50|$|When {{spinning}} fleece into yarn, the fleece must be scoured {{and vegetable}} matter removed. The fleece is carded or combed and then spun into singles.

The purpose of plying singles is to strengthen them so that they do not break while <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheting</b> them.|$|R
50|$|Alternative ponchos are now {{designed}} as fashion items. They {{are the same}} shape but of different material.

50|$|Ribbon or tape yarn {{is a kind}} of novelty yarn. It is made of ribbon, but {{generally}} not the kind of ribbon used in sewing and millinery. Rather, they are ribbons made especially for <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheting,</b> with some in a tubular form, some woven flat, and some similar in appearance to Bias tape. Ribbon yarns can be composed of many materials, from synthetics to silk to plant fibers.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier pieces {{having a}} <b>knitted</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheted</b> {{appearance}} {{have been shown}} to be made with other techniques, such as Nålebinding, a technique of making fabric by creating multiple loops with a single needle and thread, much like sewing.

50|$|The dye {{lot number}} is {{important}} information for hobbyist knitters and crocheters, because {{the use of}} yarn from different dye lots can spoil the appearance of handmade textiles. These shade variations may be subtle enough to be undetectable on a store shelf, but actual differences in shade becomes apparent during <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crocheting</b> <b>or</b> after washing. Unmatched dye lots are a significant problem to knitters and crocheters because the problem manifests after days or weeks of labor, by which time the supplier's stock of the original dye lot may have been depleted.|$|R
40|$|In this submission, I discuss my design {{research}} and fieldwork investigating the digital practices of handcraft practitioners and their surrounding communities. Specifically, I study how creating and sharing digital information around <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet</b> activity affects {{the social and}} material relationships enacted through craft. Here I review my qualitative research {{on the role of}} digital resources in creative handwork and the iterative design of Spyn, mobile phone software that associates digital records of the creative process— captured through audio/visual media, text, and geographic data—with physical locations on handmade fabric...|$|R

50|$|In yarns for {{handcrafts}} such as <b>knitting</b> <b>or</b> <b>crochet,</b> hanks {{are not a}} {{fixed length}} but are sold in units by weight, most commonly 50 grams. Depending on {{the thickness of the}} strand as well as the inherent density of the material, hanks can range widely in yardage per 50 gram unit; for example, 440 yards for a lace weight mohair, to 60 yards for a chunky weight cotton. Special treatments to the materials that add cost, such as mercerisation or labor-intensive hand-painting of colors, can influence a manufacturer's desired length per unit as well. Knitters and crocheters rewind the hanks into balls or centre-pull skeins prior to use, in order to prevent the yarn from becoming tangled.|$|R

[...] Yarn bombers sometimes target existing pieces of graffiti for beautification. For instance, Dave Cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in Melbourne, Australia for the Big West Arts Festival in 2009.
