500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As far as I am concerned personally, it's probably preferable that we lost. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E
2500|$|However, whilst {{the cast}} and crew have ruled out the {{possibility}} of another series, many have hinted at the possibility of another future Christmas [...] "special". After the third series, James Corden stated: 'As far as [...] "specials" [...] are concerned, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had an idea for a story with these characters then maybe, but I don't think that'll happen any time soon.' In January 2010, Larry Lamb predicted a future Christmas [...] "special", stating 'Clearly the audience loves it and I would be very surprised if it did not come back for a Christmas episode.' In September 2010, writer Ruth Jones also discussed the possibility of a future one-off [...] "special". She stated 'A lot of it is to do with logistics, because we haven't ruled out doing a [...] "special" [...] {{at some point in the}} future, but we're not doing one this Christmas.' Alison Steadman welcomed the suggestion, stating, 'A [...] "special" [...] would be great. I think another series... perhaps, the story's been told. But a [...] "special" [...] would be... I'd love that, I'd absolutely love it if that happened.' ...|$|E

6000|$|The American {{forms of}} republicanism are most uncongenial to this artistic people; but democratical {{institutions}} will deepen and broaden, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should soon all be talking of the 'Empire.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They will muster strong, no doubt, and be {{prepared}} to attack us <b>if</b> <b>we</b> sally out; but <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> remain quiet they would wait till next day, so as to gather as many men and guns as possible." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the now {{strained}} relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [...] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it's picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There {{is a lot of}} interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson's return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between {{the two sides of the}} law. Jackson explained to The Huffington Post in 2009: [...] "I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke's son, and given Luke's ties to the mob, Lucky's seen the world from both sides. I don't think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray." [...] In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: [...] "Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he's doing stuff like that. They've had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it'd be nice to pair them up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, they do {{keep the}} line uncommonly well, {{considering}} that the tides run in streaks in the channel. <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to drop a hammock overboard, that the Carnatic would pick it up, although she must be quite four leagues astern of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would suggest}} {{carrying}} this poor fellow to my house, {{but it would}} give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> put something over his face he will be safe until morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{can only}} trace L. L. it should {{clear up the}} whole business. We have gained that much. We {{know that there is}} someone who has the facts <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can only find her. What {{do you think we should}} do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{see if we}} can't {{raise the}} oar between the doors. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can, we can tie some ropes fast to steady it and put the sail on it." ...|$|E
60|$|And more, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> look {{carefully}} at these words, we shall find that they tell us the very reason why we are to work, and to look forward, and to believe that God will bless our labour.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are fifty of them," [...] he said, [...] "if {{there is}} one. They are Utes in their war-paint. They {{are a bit}} up the valley. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> make a rush {{we can get to}} the trees before they can cut us off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a shock," [...] he said, [...] "and I shall never recover. It is a {{question}} of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. <b>I</b> sometimes <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> knew all we should be more glad to get away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> {{it could}} be managed. I know the least thing will notch a razor. Now <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> took the large knife, and with my pocket-knife or {{with the edge of}} a hard stone notch the edge {{carefully}} all the way down, it would make a very good saw." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} got any fuse," [...] Stanley said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> take a {{narrow strip of}} cloth, moisten it, and rub {{gunpowder}} into it; let it dry, and then roll it up, {{it would be all}} right. Then we could lay a train of damp powder to it, set the end alight, and bolt." ...|$|R
6000|$|EDGAR. [Facing him angrily.] No, sir. I {{tell you}} exactly what <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> <b>we</b> pretend the men are not {{suffering}}, it's humbug; and if they're suffering, we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering more, and as to the children--well--it's damnable! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{answered}} the youth, [...] "I {{am not sure}} I can say with certainty that I truly believe that it is; but, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to go on shore, the people there {{would be able to}} tell us how to go to Apple Island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is why," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "it {{was left}} empty. We {{ought to have}} known better than to expect to have a whole boat just for three of us. It {{would have been much}} more sensible, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had tried to squeeze into one of the others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{write this}} all out now. We {{must be ready}} for Dr. Van Helsing when he comes. I have sent a {{telegram}} to Jonathan to come on here when he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> get all of our material ready, and have every item put in chronological order, we shall have done much.|$|R
500|$|... "It's {{called the}} Tour of the Mongoose, and the {{mongoose}} is basically {{one of the}} few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite. And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose they'll {{take it to}} Mr. Wickerby. He says he doesn't want it,--that {{it would}} do no good. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could show that the man might very easily {{have been out of}} the house,--that he had {{certainly}} provided himself with means of getting out of the house secretly,--the coat would be of service. I am going at any rate; and shall be in Paris to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{need for}} more. During our long journey into these far-off wilds each man had fallen into his allotted place and work, and the force of habit had made us so like {{machines}} that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had suddenly become a party of somnambulists we would have gone through the same actions each evening on landing.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{we might}} {{at this stage}} have given it up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> could have seen ahead and around us we might have done so. But the glow of our cell blinded us.... I wonder what might have {{happened}} if at that time we had given it up.... We propounded it, we met again in secret to discuss it, and our overpowering passion for one another reduced that meeting to absurdity....|$|E
6000|$|... "There, Beorn, {{do you see}} {{the hill}} juts out into the plain on the right, half a mile from the castle, and is wooded to its foot. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to make our way down there {{we should be able to}} obtain a view of the face of the rock below the castle without leaving the shelter of the trees." [...] Beorn agreed that it was worth trying, and they {{returned}} to the men, rearmed themselves, and spoke to Osgod.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{reached this}} one," [...] said my friend, [...] "by sitting upon five pillows and {{consuming}} {{an ounce of}} shag. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Watson, that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{series has}} been criticised by the UK former Secretary of State for Culture, Tessa Jowell. In an {{interview}} with the Financial Times during the second UK series, she said, [...] "If they weren't mostly - save their blushes - has-been celebrities, there might be more interest ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> saw many more programming hours taken over by reality TV, [...] "I hope you'd begin to see a viewers' revolt." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{will take}} the story simply as it stands we shall see easily enough. For it is all simple and natural enough. Jacob and Esau, we shall see, were men of like passions with ourselves; men as we are, mixed up of good and evil, {{sometimes}} right and sometimes wrong: and God rewarded them when they did right, and punished them when they did wrong, just as he does with us now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} men, who, treated with dry, {{in matters of}} trade, were as obstinate as mules, become {{reasonable}} and pliable, sir, over a bottle," [...] he said, after explaining where the liquor was to be found; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> offer the Arabs this, {{after they have been}} in possession a short time, we shall find them better disposed towards us. If it should not prove so, I confess, for one, I should feel less reluctance in shooting them than before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there is}} {{something}} in that," [...] John agreed. [...] "Of course, in our case it is all right, because we do like each other--we couldn't have liked each other more, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had been brother and sister--but it seems to me that, sometimes, it must be horrid when a boy is told by his parents that he is to be betrothed to a girl he has never seen. You see it isn't as if it were for a short time, but for all one's life. It must be awful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know that," [...] said Martin, who {{was seated}} on a large stone beside the fire sipping a can of coffee, which he shared equally with Marmoset. The monkey sat on his {{shoulder}} gazing anxiously into his face, with an expression that {{seemed as if the}} creature were mentally exclaiming, [...] "Now me, now you; now me, now you," [...] during the whole process. [...] "It would be better, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were in a more sheltered position before it begins. Ha! there it comes though, in earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As long as {{they don't}} knock away a spar we will hold on," [...] Captain Reuben said. [...] "If they do, we will turn and fight them. But the wind is {{dropping}} a little, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that, <b>if</b> anything, <b>we</b> are gaining upon them now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not, Merytra, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{continue}} to get on {{as well as we}} do at present. But now you are rested, so let us come to business, for otherwise you will have to stop here all night and Pharaoh would be angry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow or next day," [...] {{her father}} said. [...] "Mynheer Van Voorden says, 'I {{am about to}} start,' which may mean three days or six. It will need a whole day for your mother and the maids to see to Albert's clothes, and that all is decent and in order. To-day is Monday, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> say that Albert will arrive there on Thursday by noon it will do very well. Will you be ready by that time, Edgar?" ...|$|R
