5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court. Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.|$|E
5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a tie, to illustrate the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He speculated that the few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked {{the sound of her}} name.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> {{chastity}} {{for women}} and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E

5|$|Several women poets made {{important}} contributions including: Basavanna's sister Nagalambike {{and his two}} wives, Gangambike and Neelambike, though Neelambike {{seems to have been}} the more prolific. Some female poets were wives of male poets in the Veerashaiva congregation. Notable among them are Satyakka, whose poems compare in quality to those of Akka Mahadevi, Kelavve (a dalit poet), whose poems scorn at the upper caste people, Mahadevi and Lingamma, who wrote poems in a mystic language, Amuge Rayamma and Akkamma, who penned poems on the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> religious pretences, Kadire Remavva (a spinner), who employed a cryptic language called bedagu in her poems, and Muktayakka, who is known for her debates with the patron saint Allama himself. Other names worthy of mention are Lakkamma, Ketaladevi, Guddavve and a princess called Bontadevi.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E
5|$|After the war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dissolved, and Phleps {{returned}} to his homeland, which had become part of Romania under the Treaty of Trianon. He joined the Romanian Army and was appointed as commander of the Saxon National Guard, a militia formed from the German-speaking people of Siebenbürgen. In this role he opposed the Hungarian communist revolutionary government of Béla Kun, which fought Romania in 1919. During a battle at the Tisza river against Kun's forces he disobeyed direct orders and was subsequently court-martialled. The trial concluded that Phleps had saved the Romanian forces through his actions, and {{he was promoted to}} Oberst (colonel). He commanded the 84th Infantry Regiment, then joined the general staff and taught logistics at the War Academy in Bucharest. He attended the V Army Corps staff college in Brașov, and published a book, Logistics: Basics of Organisation and Execution, in 1926 which became the standard work on logistics for the Romanian Army. Ironically, after the book was published, Phleps failed his first general's examination on the topic of logistics. He commanded various Romanian units, including the 1st Brigade of the vânători de munte (mountain troops) and also acted as a military advisor to King Carol II in the 1930s. Phleps reached the rank of General-locotenent (major general) despite his reported disdain for the corruption, intrigue and <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> the royal court. After criticising government policy and publicly calling King Carol a liar when another general tried to twist his words, he was transferred to the reserves in 1940 and dismissed from the service at his own request in 1941.|$|E

5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
25|$|Children of God (1987) further {{expanded}} Jarboe's role, {{acting as}} a foil to Michael Gira's tales of suffering, torture and humiliation. The stories portrayed here, however, are ever the more unusual, given their juxtaposition—and admixture—with religious imagery. The intention was neither to mock nor embrace religion, but experiment with the power inherent in its messages and the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> many of its leaders.|$|E

The paper was controversial for its defence of slavery by highlighting the (supposed) <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> the abolitionists in the debate.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{the events}} of her life, {{literary}} allusions to Wu Zetian may carry several connotations: {{a woman who has}} inappropriately overstepped her bounds, the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> preaching compassion while simultaneously engaging in a pattern of political corruption and vicious behavior and ruling by pulling strings in the background. For many centuries, Wu was used by the establishment as an example of what can go wrong when a woman is placed in charge.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, Brandes fought {{against what he}} saw as the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> prudish sexuality, which caused a rift with Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.

Benedictsson committed suicide in a Copenhagen hotel room, and the relationship with Brandes has later been blamed as the cause for her death.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the image}} he builds of Tiberius {{throughout}} {{the first six}} books of the Annals is neither exclusively bleak nor approving: most scholars view the image of Tiberius as predominantly positive in the first books, and predominantly negative after the intrigues of Sejanus.

In the later books, some respect is evident for the cleverness of the old emperor in securing his position.|$|E
25|$|Woodhull {{railed against}} the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> society's tolerating married {{men who had}} mistresses and engaged in other sexual dalliances. In 1872, Woodhull {{publicly}} criticized well-known clergyman Henry Ward Beecher for adultery. Beecher was known to have {{had an affair with}} his parishioner, Elizabeth Tilton, who had confessed to it, and the scandal was covered nationally. Woodhull was prosecuted on obscenity charges for sending accounts of the affair through the federal mails, and was briefly jailed. This added to sensational coverage during her campaign that autumn for the United States presidency.|$|E
25|$|Many North American {{hardcore}} punk fans {{adopted a}} dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was {{a reflection of}} hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the <b>hypocrisy</b> <b>of</b> American culture. It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots. The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).|$|E
