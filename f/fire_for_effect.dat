50|$|A {{technique}} called Time on Target {{was developed by}} the British Army in North Africa at the end of 1941 and early 1942 particularly <b>for</b> counter-battery <b>fire</b> and other concentrations, it proved very popular. It relied on BBC time signals to enable officers to synchronize their watches to the second because this avoided the need to use military radio networks and the possibility of losing surprise, and the need for field telephone networks in the desert. With this technique the time of flight from each fire unit (battery or troop) to the target is taken from the range or firing tables, or the computer and each engaging fire unit subtracts its time of flight from the TOT to determine the time to fire. An executive order to fire is given to all guns in the fire unit at the correct moment to fire. When each fire unit fires their rounds at their individual firing time all the opening rounds will reach the target area almost simultaneously. This is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow <b>fires</b> <b>for</b> <b>effect</b> to be made without preliminary adjusting fires.|$|R
