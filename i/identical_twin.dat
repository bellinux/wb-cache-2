5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. <b>Identical</b> <b>twin</b> studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis if the other twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E

30|$|Distinguishing <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> under {{standard}} conditions is possible {{as shown in}} the experimental results. However, when conditions of the captured images are not ideal, distinguishing <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> is a hard challenge. <b>Identical</b> <b>twins</b> represent a very difficult recognition problem, and the results achieved for the recognition of <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> are worse than the results obtained to recognize non-twins.|$|R
30|$|<b>Identical</b> <b>twins</b> {{were used}} in some studies in the {{literature}} especially by analyzing their faces, fingerprints, irises, palm prints, and speech. Jain et al. in 2002 [9] used the minutia-based automatic fingerprint matching and successfully distinguished the fingerprint images of <b>identical</b> <b>twins.</b> However, for non-twins matching, the accuracy was higher than the case of <b>identical</b> <b>twins.</b> In other words, the similarity between the fingerprints of <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> was {{much higher than the}} case of non-twins. As a result, the false accept rate (FAR) of <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> was about four times higher than that of non-twins [9].|$|R

5|$|Presley {{was born}} on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (née Smith; 1912–1958) and Vernon Elvis Presley (1916–1979), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in {{preparation}} for the child's birth. Jesse Garon Presley, his <b>identical</b> <b>twin</b> brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before his own birth. Jesse was buried in an unmarked grave at Priceville Cemetery in Tupelo. After Presley became famous, he asked people on several occasions to try and find the whereabouts of Jesse. The efforts were to no avail, because no papers marked the spot. Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Although he was in conflict with the Pentecostal church in his later years, he never officially left it. Rev. Rex Humbard officiated at Presley's funeral, because Presley had been an admirer of Humbard's ministry.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{recognition}} of a person {{by the use of}} distinctive physical and behavioral characteristics is called biometrics. Two of the important challenges in biometrics are {{recognition of}} <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> and matching of latent fingerprints to their exemplar prints (rolled or slap prints). The contributions of this dissertation are focused on these two topics. <b>Identical</b> (monozygotic) <b>twins</b> are a result of a single fertilized egg that splits into two cells, each one giving birth to one individual. <b>Identical</b> <b>twins</b> have the same deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), thus their genotypic features (features influenced by the genetic material) are the same. However, some of their phenotypic features (features influenced by the fetal environment) may be different. Thus, it is essential to determine which biometric traits (either by themselves or in combination with other traits) have the ability to distinguish <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> and the extent of their ability for this discrimination. The first contribution of this dissertation is an evaluation of the performance of biometric systems in the presence of <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> for the three most commonly used biometric modalities, namely fingerprint, face and iris. <b>Identical</b> <b>twins</b> are shown to be a challenge to current face recognition systems. On the other hand, fingerprint and iris matching of <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> show performanc...|$|R
30|$|Absence of the factors, such as universality, uniqueness, permanence, and acceptability, {{leads to}} a weak {{recognition}} system with high error rates. Therefore, all the factors must be available {{at the same time}} in order to get a good distinguishing system. In all the cases, the face trait meets the aforementioned factors perfectly which makes it a good choice as a biometric trait. However, there is a case of face recognition that represents the main challenges with one of those factors which is <b>identical</b> (monozygotic) <b>twins</b> case [5]. In <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> case, universality, permanence, and acceptability are satisfied, but the factor that represents a serious problem is the uniqueness. It is axiomatic that the <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> have the same face shape, size, and features, so new methods and algorithms should be studied and considered in order to deal with the high similarities in case of <b>identical</b> <b>twins.</b> It is obvious that face recognition for a population without <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> will be more efficient and easier when constructing a system of <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> recognition. In other words, algorithms that are able to distinguish the critical challenges such as <b>identical</b> <b>twins</b> should be more powerful in the case of non-twins recognition which is the main goal in this study.|$|R
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among <b>identical</b> <b>twin</b> pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers {{to pay for their}} drinks. He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he did not mean to hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon. He begs Audrey for forgiveness but she throws him out. Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey visits his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), introduces herself to Lewis and he defends her against Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) accusations that she is giving her son the wrong food.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, LaBonge finds a {{man named}} Cissy Alvarez whom Maleeni owed money. LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an <b>identical</b> <b>twin</b> brother, Albert. Albert, {{interestingly}} enough is even wearing a neckbrace, which he says he got {{in a car accident}} in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man shows that he has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. Back at work, Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely get arrested. In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.|$|E

5|$|Todd's <b>identical</b> <b>twin</b> brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), whom he {{had never}} known, is {{physically}} altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E

50|$|Placentas {{vary with}} respect to the {{transport}} of nutrients and hormones, a variance that may influence epigenesis.
