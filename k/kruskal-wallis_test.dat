50|$|The {{most common}} {{non-parametric}} {{test for the}} one-factor model is the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> {{is based on the}} ranks of the data. The advantage of the Van Der Waerden test is that it provides the high efficiency of the standard ANOVA analysis when the normality assumptions are in fact satisfied, but it also provides the robustness of the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> when the normality assumptions are not satisfied.|$|E
50|$|In statistics, the Jonckheere {{trend test}} (sometimes called the Jonckheere-Terpstra test) {{is a test}} for an ordered {{alternative}} hypothesis within an independent samples (between-participants) design. It {{is similar to the}} <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> in that the null hypothesis is that several independent samples are from the same population. However, with the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> there is no a priori ordering of the populations from which the samples are drawn. When there is an a priori ordering, the Jonckheere test has more statistical power than the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> The test was developed by A. R. Jonckheere, who was a psychologist and statistician at University College London.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> by ranks, Kruskal-Wallis H test (named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis), or One-way ANOVA on ranks is a {{non-parametric}} {{method for}} testing whether samples originate {{from the same}} distribution. It is used for comparing two or more independent samples of equal or different sample sizes. It extends the Mann-Whitney U test when {{there are more than}} two groups. The parametric equivalent of the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> is the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A significant <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> indicates that at least one sample stochastically dominates one other sample. The test does not identify where this stochastic dominance occurs or for how many pairs of groups stochastic dominance obtains. Dunn's test, or the more powerful but less well known Conover-Iman test would help analyze the specific sample pairs for stochastic dominance in post hoc tests.|$|E
30|$|<b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>testing</b> {{resulted}} in no mPFCP {{differences between the}} native and anatomical reconstruction states.|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{computed}} {{mean ratings}} of confidence (on a 1 – 5 scale) {{in the four}} survival estimates and compared them across levels of survival using <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
30|$|Patient {{characteristics}} are compared between these four CK groups {{by means of}} <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> with subsequent post hoc analysis and Dunnett’s correction for multiple testing. For categorical variables, chi-square testing was used.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{statistic}} is not significant, {{then there}} is no evidence of stochastic dominance between the samples. However, if the test is significant then at least one sample stochastically dominates another sample. Therefore, a researcher might use sample contrasts between individual sample pairs, or post hoc tests using Dunn's test, which (1) properly employs the same rankings as the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test,</b> and (2) properly employs the pooled variance implied by the null hypothesis of the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> in order to determine which of the sample pairs are significantly different. When performing multiple sample contrasts or tests, the Type I error rate tends to become inflated, raising concerns about multiple comparisons.|$|E
50|$|To model binary Likert {{responses}} directly, {{they may}} be represented in a binomial form by summing agree and disagree responses separately. The chi-squared, Cochran's Q test, or McNemar test are common statistical procedures used after this transformation. Non-parametric tests such as chi-squared test, Mann-Whitney test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, or <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> are often used {{in the analysis of}} Likert scale data.|$|E
5000|$|The {{test has}} low power (efficiency) for {{moderate}} to large sample sizes. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U two-sample test or its generalisation for more samples, the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test,</b> {{can often be}} considered instead. The relevant aspect of the median test is that it only considers the position of each observation relative to the overall median, whereas the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test takes the ranks of each observation into account. Thus the other mentioned tests are usually {{more powerful than the}} median test. Moreover, the median test can only be used for quantitative data.However, although the alternative <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> does not assume normal distributions, it does assume that the variance is approximately equal across samples. Hence, in situations where that assumption does not hold, the median test is an appropriate test. Moreover, KrusSiegel & Castellan (1988, p. 124) suggest that there is no alternative to the median test when one or more observations are [...] "off the scale." ...|$|E
30|$|In both settings, we used <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> {{to check}} for {{significant}} group differences. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U tests were used for pairwise post hoc <b>tests</b> where <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> revealed significant differences. In {{the case of the}} longitudinal setting, we avoided to use a repeated measures procedure as the overlapping data otherwise would have forced us to exclude all patients of whom {{at least one of the}} three measurements was not usable/available (which could be attributed to technical, (patho-)physiological, and administrative reasons). An increased probability of a type II error thus should be kept in mind when reading the results [22].|$|R
30|$|<b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>testing</b> {{produced}} no mPFCP {{differences between the}} native (Pnat) and anatomical reconstruction (Pa) states for all graft pre-tensioning states and under 0 ° (p[*]>[*] 0.987) and 90 ° (p[*]>[*] 0.577) knee flexion.|$|R
30|$|Association between {{predictor}} variables and response variables were examined using the non-parametric <b>test</b> <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> in Minitab® as data subject to this test were not normally distributed. <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> {{the equality of}} medians {{of two or more}} populations (null hypothesis or H 0 : the population medians are all equal versus alternative hypothesis or H 1 : the medians are not all equal).|$|R
50|$|A {{large amount}} of {{computing}} resources is required to compute exact probabilities for the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> Existing software only provides exact probabilities for sample sizes less than about 30 participants. These software programs rely on asymptotic approximation for larger sample sizes. Exact probability values for larger sample sizes are available. Spurrier (2003) published exact probability tables for samples as large as 45 participants. Meyer and Seaman (2006) produced exact probability distributions for samples as large as 105 participants.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of decoy cells (< 10 and > 10 decoy cells) and {{red blood cells}} (< 20 E, 20-100 E and > 100 E) per cytospin smear was semiquantitatively determined, along with analysis of inflammatory cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and fungi. In patients with decoy cells detected, their sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive value for BK virus nephropathy were calculated. Correlation of the study parameters was estimated by use of <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> (STATISTICA 7.1, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, USA).|$|E
50|$|Since it is a {{non-parametric}} method, the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> {{does not}} assume a normal {{distribution of the}} residuals, unlike the analogous one-way analysis of variance. If the researcher can make the less stringent assumptions of an identically shaped and scaled distribution for all groups, except for any difference in medians, then the null hypothesis is that the medians of all groups are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is {{that at least one}} population median of one group is different from the population median of at least one other group.|$|E
30|$|We used nonparametric <b>tests</b> (chi-square <b>test,</b> <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> H <b>test,</b> Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman's rho) with Bonferroni {{correction}} {{for multiple}} comparisons {{for determining the}} statistical significance of the results.|$|R
3000|$|... 2 test, Mann–Whitney U <b>test,</b> and <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests.</b> The {{strength}} of the association between two variables was determined using the Spearman’s rank correlation. Probability values < 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver. 15.0. 1  J software (IBM, Tokyo, Japan).|$|R
30|$|When ANOVA and <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> {{were applied}} to {{secondary}} data, ANOVA did not give interpretable results for majority of the ions as total degrees of freedom for the variables were too large. The data from Medawachchiya (endemic area) and Wellawaya (non-endemic area) could not be analysed due to inadequate sample sizes. However, ANOVA and <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> for secondary data showed F− values were significantly different among all the groups at p[*]<[*] 0.05. Dunnett’s T 3 and Mann–Whitney’s post hoc tests showed significantly different F− levels between CKDu endemic areas samples of Girandurukotte and Nikawewa and Nikawewa and Padaviya. Fluoride was not significantly different between Girandurukotte and Padaviya, Girandurukotte and Huruluwewa as well as Padaviya and Huruluwewa. Mann–Whitney’s post hoc test results showed that Na+ was significantly different in all sampling locations.|$|R
50|$|Martin David Kruskal {{was born}} to a Jewish family in New York City {{and grew up in}} New Rochelle. He was {{generally}} known as Martin to the world and David to his family. His father, Joseph B. Kruskal, Sr., was a successful fur wholesaler. His mother, Lillian Rose Vorhaus Kruskal Oppenheimer, became a noted promoter of the art of origami during the early era of television and founded the Origami Center of America in New York City, which later became OrigamiUSA. He was one of five children. His two brothers, both eminent mathematicians, were Joseph Kruskal (1928-2010; discoverer of multidimensional scaling, the Kruskal tree theorem, and Kruskal's algorithm) and William Kruskal (1919-2005; discoverer of the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test).</b>|$|E
5000|$|If the {{assumption}} of equality of variances is not met, the Tamhane’s test is preferred. When this assumption is satisfied we can choose amongst several tests. Although the LSD (Fisher’s Least Significance Difference) {{is a very strong}} test in detecting pairs of means differences, it is applied only when the F test is significant, and it is mostly less preferable since its method fails in protecting low error rate. Bonferroni test is a good choice due to its correction suggested by his method. This correction states that if n independent tests are to be applied then the α in each test should be equal to α /n. Tukey’s method is also preferable by many statisticians because it control the overall error rate. (More information on this issue can be found in any ANOVA book, such as Douglas C. Montgomery’s Design and Analysis of Experiments).On small sample sizes, when {{the assumption}} of normality isn't met, a Nonparametric Analysis of Variance can be made by <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test,</b> that is another omnibus test example ( [...] see following example [...] ). Alternative option is to use bootstrap methods to assess whether the group means are different. Bootstrap methods do not have any specific distributional assumptions and may be an appropriate tool to use like using re-sampling, {{which is one of the}} simplest bootstrap methods. You can extend the idea to the case of multiple groups and estimate p-values.|$|E
30|$|For {{statistical}} analysis the program SAS (Version 9.2, Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used. Median, minimum, maximum, mean value, <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test,</b> Wilcoxon test, Spearman’s correlation coefficient and weighted kappa were performed. The <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> {{was used to}} compare group 1, 2, 3 and 4. In case of a significant p calculated with the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> pair comparisons were performed {{with the help of the}} Wilcoxon test. All tests were performed two-sided. The evaluation was done exploratory: this means all p values < 0.05 were considered as significant.|$|E
30|$|<b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the among-site differences in psyllid abundance. χ 2 -tests {{were used to}} compare the number of males and females in each species. χ 2 -tests were also used to compare between-year differences in psyllid abundance. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (IBM SPSS statistics version 19.0. 0).|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} groups of “Deed Area” {{variables}} to compare. The tests that compare the three or more data sets were conducted since more than two sets were involved. The variables of the data sets are independent and include continuous numerical data. As a result of normality <b>test,</b> the non-parametric <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> for several independent samples were performed.|$|R
30|$|For {{statistical}} analysis, {{descriptive statistics}} were presented as mean and range for numerical variables and for frequencies with corresponding percentages for categorical variables. To compare the differences, Student t tests, Mann–Whitney U <b>tests,</b> and <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> were performed depending on scale level {{and distribution of}} the data. Statistical significance was assumed at a p value[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Power of the {{analysis}} of variance (ANOVA) and the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> for comparing the several Weibull population means is investigated. Since Weibull data sets are nonnormal distributed, they must be transformed to normal distribution with constant variance before ANOVA is applied whereas the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> does not need the normality assumption. The power of them was compared {{in a number of}} different situations and different sample sizes. The results depended on the coefficient of variation of population means. It seems that the power of ANOVA is higher than the power of the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> a little in every case...|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the One-way ANOVA and its nonparametric counterpart the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> The aim of this bachelor thesis is to analyse the ANOVA's test validity and power in case of assumptions (e. g. normal distribution, homoscedasticity and sample size) violations. The conclusions of the One-way ANOVA are compared with the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> The analysis is performed using Monte Carlo simulations implemented in the statistical software R. Based on the simulations, it is {{found out that the}} One-Way ANOVA is not significantly sensitive to the violation of normality, if the homoscedasticity assumption is met within each of four samples. On the other hand it is found out that the One-Way ANOVA is significantly sensitive to the violation of homoscedasticity at the particular specification. The <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> yields in better results if the homoscedasticity assumption is violated. In case that the One-Way ANOVA and the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> are valid, the ANOVA provides higher power of the test...|$|E
30|$|Criteria {{for normal}} {{distribution}} was evaluated using Kolgomogorov–Sminorv test. Whenever normal distribution criteria were met, one-way ANOVA tests were performed, whereas when results were not normally distributed, <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> (nonparametric ANOVA tests) were performed. Adjusted Dunn’s test, Dunnett’s T 3, and Tukey {{analyses were performed}} when differences were statistically significant between the three groups (p[*]<[*] 0.05), according to the normality criteria.|$|R
30|$|The sociodemographic {{data and}} {{profiles}} of social vulnerability and chronic adversity {{were analyzed using}} descriptive statistics, while the groups were compared using chi-square and <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests.</b> After the univariate analysis, the predictive effect of cumulative adverse conditions on school children’s behavioral problems was assessed using ordinal regression analysis (Maroco, 2014), adopting criteria proposed by Field (2013) {{for the inclusion of}} predictive variables.|$|R
30|$|We sent diet quality {{samples for}} cattle to the Grazing Animal Nutrition Lab (Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA) for {{analysis}} using fecal {{near infrared reflectance}} spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine dietary digestibility (DD) and crude protein (CP) of cattle diets (Lyons and Stuth 1992). We analyzed diet quality by calculating monthly means for each year. We tested for differences among years using <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>tests</b> (Zar 1996).|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{data from}} two {{replicates}} for each family were combined, and analyzed by {{one-way analysis of}} variance or non-parametric test (<b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>test)</b> and multiple comparisons (Tukey HSD test and Bonferroni test or Games Howell test) (statistical analysis software, SPSS ver. 16 with Regression and Advanced Models). When equality of variances between data of families was not recognized, <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>test</b> and Games Howell test were used.|$|E
30|$|Statistical {{significance}} of the ordinal data was determined initially using the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test.</b> This test was chosen for its applicability to non-parametric data with three or more independent participant categories. In cases where the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> indicated statistical significance, the inter-category significance was tested in a pairwise manner using the Mann-Whitney test, which is suitable for use on non-parametric data where there are two independent groups.|$|E
30|$|All {{data are}} shown as median and {{interquartile}} range (IQR). The hemodynamics; plasma concentrations of creatinine, lactate, potassium, and cytokines; and blood gas variables were all analyzed by the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> {{at a fixed}} time point (3 h after declamping), as notable time-dependent changes in these parameters were found in repeated measures ANOVA for all three groups. The <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> {{was used to compare}} the wet/dry ratio, cytokine mRNA expression, and TNF-α, IL- 6, and NF-κB scoring among the four groups. If the result from the <b>Kruskal-Wallis</b> <b>test</b> was significant, then the Mann-Whitney U test was similarly applied to analyze each pairing of groups. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|E
30|$|The {{validity}} of identified groups’ was evaluated {{by comparing the}} EQ- 5 D- 3 L index scores and EQ VAS for subgroup with different KBD degree, the general health and number of painful joints using <b>Kruskal–Wallis</b> <b>tests.</b> We expected individuals with more severe disease, poorer general health, and {{a greater number of}} painful joints would have lower EQ- 5 D- 3 L index scores and EQ VAS scores.|$|R
30|$|IBM® SPSS® version 21 (IBM corp., Armonk, NY) was used. Variables with Gaussian {{distribution}} {{are reported}} as mean ± standard deviation and {{were compared with}} the Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance.
