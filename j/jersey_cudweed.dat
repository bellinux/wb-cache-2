40|$|A {{potentially}} native {{population of}} the Critically Endangered <b>Jersey</b> <b>Cudweed</b> Gnaphalium luteoalbum L. was discovered at Dungeness in East Kent (v. c. 15) in 1996. From an original population {{of a few hundred}} on an area of pumped silt, the plant has spread rapidly and it now grows on the damp margins of many of the old gravel pits within a 1 km radius of where it was first found. The number of plants and their flowering time are both influenced by the water levels, and the population varies between tens {{and hundreds of thousands of}} plants. Even in poor years, the population at Dungeness is much larger than that at the only other native British site on the West Norfolk coast. The cudweed is almost certainly a recent colonist at Dungeness, and its mode of arrival could have been natural or artificial. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which manages the Dungeness reserve, is treating the plant as a native. Areas of suitable habitat are being maintained and the population is monitored annually...|$|E
