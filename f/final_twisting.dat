5000|$|The video {{focuses on}} a pervert who follows a young, innocent-seeming girl as she skips down the street. As she descends into an {{underground}} area, {{he pulls out a}} cloth with chloroform. Just as he is about to attack, she screams [...] "Call 911 now!" [...] and begins utilizing telekinetic powers to manipulate the man's body. She raises him into the air and contorts his body into a variety of positions, slamming him against walls and shooting black smoke into and through his body. It is revealed that a dark figure, reminiscent of the slender figure in the Come to Daddy music video, is directly behind her making identical gestures to the child. The child's eyes turn the same color black as the figure. The suggestion is that the child is in fact some kind of avatar/golem being used by the creature to lure and punish child predators. Ultimately the child makes a <b>final</b> <b>twisting</b> motion with her hands, indicating she has killed the man. She is then shown using her finger to add a pitch black mark to a tally on the wall, adding another victim of her justice to the count.|$|E

5000|$|Yarn is {{composed}} of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These strands of yarn are twisted together (plied) {{in the opposite direction}} to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this <b>final</b> <b>twist,</b> the yarn will have either s&#8209;twist (the threads appear to go [...] "up" [...] to the left) or z&#8209;twist (to the right). For a single ply yarn, the direction of the <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.|$|R

5000|$|Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} great review: [...] ""The Jolly Roger" [...] was an {{appropriately}} exciting hour of television—complete {{with the}} sort of confounding, frustrating <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> that Once should consider having trademarked. All that, plus the return of JoAnna Garcia Swisher's delightfully daffy Ariel? ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film [...] "a heaping bowl of Scottish blarney," [...] a [...] "manipulative tearjerker," [...] and [...] "a {{fraudulent}} yarn riddled with plot holes and improbabilities and topped by a cynical <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> that pulls the rug {{out from under the}} story." ...|$|R
50|$|In an interview, Brooker {{revealed}} that the story went through many different iterations, and some {{did not include the}} <b>final</b> <b>twist.</b> He {{revealed that}} in one version of the story, there was no reason why the events were happening, and in another the roles were reversed, with Jerome Flynn's character having the extremely dark secret.|$|R
50|$|Max Nicholson of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.8, stating {{that while he}} enjoyed the {{majority}} of the episode (in particular, the <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> regarding the clown's identity), it suffered from the Robin/Loretta dinner scenes (stating that they felt hammy and were unnecessary, especially considering they never really happened) and the flirting between Lily and Ralph.|$|R
50|$|The <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> {{is saved}} {{for the final}} paragraph, when it is {{revealed}} that Amos has been raping and otherwise sexually abusing his daughter, Gillian, since she was young, and as the novel ends, seems to continue doing so.

5000|$|Daily Grindhouse {{called it}} a [...] ""...a frighteningly {{original}} semi-supernatural tale of guilt and ripped-from-the-headlines redemption" [...] in their review of the film, and Film Threat has said that [...] "this isn’t a film that believes in some <b>final</b> <b>twist,</b> but instead, if you’re paying attention, the clues and direction for the narrative are all right there." ...|$|R
50|$|In The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. (1993), {{an episode}} ("Brisco for the Defense") is {{loosely based on}} the novel.

50|$|The book's <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> {{reveals the}} old woman as a witch. Guess What? is on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990-2000 at number 66.

[...] His attorneys unsuccessfully appealed to have his citizenship restored posthumously. His relatives successfully arranged for his burial in Ohio, near where he used to live.|$|R
5000|$|The Sydney Morning Herald critic {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{traditional}} formula {{of the short}} thriller was cleverly used, with never a letup in insidious suspense, and a sharply effective <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> to the story" [...] based on [...] "the alliance between the author's compact, ingenious plot and Henri' Safran's subtle production, which built up a taut, oppressive atmosphere within a single room." ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{one minute}} left Cook awarded a penalty to the Dragons within kicking range. In a <b>final</b> <b>twist,</b> Chapman's attempt went {{the same way}} as Cronin's earlier kick and after 100 minutes of Grand Final play, the scores were still locked at 9-all. The players {{initially}} appeared confused, then began shaking hands. The ground announcer advised that a replay would be required.|$|R
50|$|Hooker {{pretends to}} be a boxer {{who is about to}} throw a big fight.

5000|$|... "Last Forever" [...] {{received}} a polarized response from fans and TV critics, primarily {{in regard to}} the <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> ending, the relationship between Ted and Robin, and the fate of the series' titular mother. Many viewers expressed considerable disdain for the apparent disregard for character development, while some praised it for tying up loose ends. However, additional praise was directed to the acting, especially Neil Patrick Harris's performance.|$|R
5000|$|This is a satire by Twain on {{the mystery}} novel genre. In the second arc, Sherlock Holmes is {{depicted}} in employing [...] "scientific methods" [...] to a ridiculous degree, yet arriving at a completely wrong assessment. On the other hand, the crime is solved with a supernatural ability that no normal human possesses. Yet even fails to reveal the whole truth as the <b>final</b> <b>twist</b> of the story indicates.|$|R
