5|$|I am not {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully {{understood what he}} was saying. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song. But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about? I don't know if he fully understood it.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, since taken over from Sparrow. Barbossa and his crew suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead. Verbinski {{approached}} Rush {{for the role of}} Barbossa, as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could hint at the subtle complexities of the character while still portraying a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.|$|E
5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to}} become a {{professional}} wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was already an athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|In Tondon Tiku began {{preparations}} for his mother's funeral, preparations which, in Torajan culture, took several months. While {{taking care of}} the preparations, he had an advisor collect weapons secretly while another went to his fortresses in Alla' and Ambeso. Tiku then made preparations to escape Dutch custody; he also returned all property that he had taken as a lord, as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would no longer use it. While in Tondon, Dutch forces may have harassed the Torajan leader. The night before his mother's funeral, in January 1907, Tiku and 300 of his followers escaped Tondon, heading south.|$|E

6000|$|... 2. The broken-hearted is poor, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> cannot {{help himself}} to what <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> wants. The man {{that has a}} broken arm, as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it, so <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> of himself <b>he</b> cannot set it. This {{therefore}} is a second thing that declares a man is poor, otherwise he is not so. For suppose a man wants never so much, yet if he can but help himself, if he can furnish himself, if he can supply his own wants out of what he has, he cannot be a poor man. Yea, the more he wants, the greater are his riches, if he can supply his own wants {{out of his own}} purse.|$|R
2500|$|To {{comply with}} the {{provisions}} of MLB's drug policy, Hamilton provides urine samples for drug testing {{at least three times}} per week. [...] Rangers' coach Johnny Narron says of the frequent testing: [...] "I think he looks forward to the tests. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he's</b> an addict. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> has to be accountable. He looks at those tests as a way to reassure people around him who had faith." ...|$|R
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going to get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|When Larry Schmittou {{decided to}} bring {{professional}} baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would {{have to build a}} new ballpark for his team. He negotiated a lease with the city for a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (three km) south of downtown. At the time, this was the site of a city-owned softball complex that the city planned to relocate. The city was prepared to lease him the land, but Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, and paying the city a portion of the team's total revenue.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E

5|$|Headley states {{he gained}} {{approval}} to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup {{money for the}} organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for doing this. In 2005, when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would be faced with {{being sent to the}} organization's prison-like program the Rehabilitation Project Force, Headley decided to leave. Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire, to whom he had been married for 13 years, and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of disconnection. Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards, which resulted in Headley falling off his bike {{by the side of the}} road. Riverside County, California Sheriff's arrived, and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound. From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City. He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base. Prior to his wife's departure from Gold Base, she was monitored closely day and night by the organization.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E

25|$|Archduke Charles {{disagreed}} with Mack's aggressive strategy. When Emperor Francis I asked his opinion, Charles wrote him that Mack {{was making a}} serious blunder by invading Bavaria. Nevertheless, the emperor allowed Mack to pursue his course of action. Fearing the worst in Bavaria, Charles took up a defensive posture, even though <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> outnumbered Masséna.|$|E
25|$|Weston {{was born}} in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{wanted to be a}} {{photographer}} from an early age, and initially his work was typical of the soft focus pictorialism that was popular at the time. Within a few years, however, he abandoned that style and went on {{to be one of the}} foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images.|$|E

There he won a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where his classmates included Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall and Richard Boone.|$|E
25|$|In {{much of his}} career, Saionji {{tried to}} {{diminish}} {{the influence of the}} Imperial Japanese Army in political issues. He {{was one of the most}} liberal of Emperor Hirohito's advisors, and favored friendly relations with Great Britain and the United States. However, he was careful to pick his battles, and would concede defeat when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> could not win (e.g. his inability to prevent the Tripartite Pact).|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{when the}} Umayyad forces did not renew the battle, the Franks feared an ambush. Charles at first {{believed}} that the Umayyad forces were trying to lure him {{down the hill and}} into the open. This tactic <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> had to resist at all costs; he had in fact disciplined his troops for years to under no circumstances break formation and come out in the open.|$|E
