40|$|Natural <b>kinds</b> {{are often}} contrasted with other <b>kinds</b> of {{scientific}} <b>kinds,</b> especially functional <b>kinds,</b> {{because of a}} presumed categorical difference in explanatory value: natural <b>kinds</b> can ground explanations, while other <b>kinds</b> of <b>kinds</b> cannot. I argue against this view of natural <b>kinds</b> by examining {{a particular type of}} explanation – mechanistic explanations – and showing that functional <b>kinds</b> do the same work there as natural <b>kinds</b> are supposed to do in more standard scientific explanations. Breaking down the categorical distinction between natural <b>kinds</b> and other <b>kinds</b> of <b>kinds,</b> I argue, delivers two goods: It provides us with a view of natural kindhood that does justice to the epistemic roles of <b>kinds</b> in scientific explanations. And it allows us to solve a problem that HPC-theory, currently {{one of the most popular}} accounts of natural kindhood, confronts...|$|R

40|$|Many {{philosophers}} take mind-independence to be criterial for realism about <b>kinds.</b> This {{is problematic}} {{when it comes}} to psychological and social <b>kinds,</b> which are unavoidably mind-dependent. But reflection on the case of artificial or synthetic <b>kinds</b> (e. g. synthetic chemicals, genetically modified organisms) shows that the criterion of mind-independence needs to be qualified in certain ways. However, I argue that none of the usual variants on the criterion of mind-dependence is capable of distinguishing real or natural <b>kinds</b> from non-real <b>kinds.</b> Although there is a way of modifying the criterion of mind-independence {{in such a way as}} to rule in artificial <b>kinds</b> but rule out psychological and social <b>kinds,</b> this does not make the latter non-real. I conclude by proposing a different way of distinguishing real from non-real <b>kinds,</b> which does not involve mind-independence and does not necessarily exclude psychological and social <b>kinds...</b>|$|R
40|$|This essay {{examines}} the proposal that psychological essentialism {{results from a}} history of natural selection acting on human representation and inference systems. It {{has been argued that}} the features that distinguish essentialist representational systems are especially well suited for representing natural <b>kinds.</b> If the evolved function of essentialism is to exploit the rich inductive potential of such <b>kinds,</b> then it must be subserved by cognitive mechanisms that carry out at least three distinct functions: identifying these <b>kinds</b> in the envi - ronment, constructing essentialized representations of them, and constraining inductive infer - ences about <b>kinds.</b> Moreover, there are different <b>kinds</b> of <b>kinds,</b> ranging from nonliving sub - stances to biological taxa to within-species <b>kinds</b> such as sex, and the causal processes that render these categories coherent for the purposes of inductive generalization vary. If the evolved function of essentialism is to support inductive generalization under ignorance of true causes, and if <b>kinds</b> of <b>kinds</b> vary in the implicit assumptions that support valid inductive inferences about them, then we expect different, functionally incompatible modes of essen - tialist thinking for different <b>kinds.</b> In particular, there should be differences in how biological and nonbiological substances, biological taxa, and biological and social role <b>kinds</b> are essen - tialized. The functional differences between these <b>kinds</b> of essentialism are discussed...|$|R
