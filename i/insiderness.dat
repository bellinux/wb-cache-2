The museum's decision to show works from the collection of one of its trustees raised some ethical red flags by several bloggers, and gained momentum with a front page article on The New York Times followed by considerable coverage elsewhere, including an editorial in The Art Newspaper by Modern Art Notes' Tyler Green, who had previously blogged about the situation, and responses by Jerry Saltz in New York Magazine. The cover of the November issue of the Brooklyn Rail featured a satirical cartoon by artist William Powhida with the title, [...] "How the New Museum Committed Suicide with Banality", taken from a post by James Wagner, skewering the incestuousness and <b>insiderness</b> of the New Museum, and Artinfo called the controversy the [...] "New Museum scandal". The New Museum responded in defense, {{and a number of other}} museum directors also defended the museum's decision.|$|E
40|$|As insider threats pose very {{significant}} security risks to IT systems, we ask what policy-based approaches to access control {{can do for}} the detection, mitigation or countering of insider threats and insider attacks. Answering this question is difficult since little public data about insider-threat cases is available, since there is not much consensus about what the insider problem actually is, and since research in access control has by-and-large not dealt with this issue in the past. We explore existing notions of <b>insiderness</b> in order to identify the relevant research issues. We then formulate a set of requirements for next-generation accesscontrol systems whose realization might form part of an overall strategy at addressing the insider problem.

40|$|This article {{reflects}} on fieldwork experiences with coethnic migrants in London to challenge understandings of <b>insiderness</b> centred in shared ethnicity, {{as well as}} the usefulness of the insider-outsider divide in migration research more generally. Drawing on examples from a study of migrants' social relations, it shows how gender, migrant status, and occupational position sometimes shape research encounters in more important ways than shared ethnicity. Furthermore, whilst shared ethnicity is undoubtedly useful in certain respects, participants' ethnicised discourses and practices may also generate feelings of distance in the coethnic researcher. Whilst supporting the "ethnic bias" critique to migration studies (GLICK SCHILLER, ÇAĞLAR & GULDBRANDSEN, 2006), the analysis thus highlights how both ethnic and non-ethnic factors alternate or interact to create perceptions of <b>insiderness</b> or outsiderness in specific research contexts URL: [URL]...|$|E

Research {{has shown that}} TMTs and their composition are also crucial in decision-making processes, so extending this research method to focus on these effects {{in the context of}} CSQ could be interesting. Our research study also provided hints that analyzing the <b>insiderness</b> of TMT members should be scrutinized further in this context.|$|E

Building on work by Rueda (2005, 2006, 2007), the paper considers labor change in terms of reduced 2 ̆ 2 <b>insiderness</b> 2 ̆ 2 and examines how this might impact on the orientation of corporate governance vis-à-vis blockholders and minority shareholders.

40|$|This article explores some of {{the methodological}} issues {{relating}} to outsider and insider identities in ethnic and migrant qualitative research. It draws upon two qualitative research studies that set out to examine older (55 - 75 years) migrant African Caribbean women’s experiences of health and ageing in the UK. An aim is to problematise the conceptualisation of <b>insiderness</b> and outsiderness as polarised and discrete, and provide some examples of how these identities might overlap and intersect. The article takes issue with the argument that it is both possible and desirable to ‘match’ the ethnic background of researcher and participant. Insider, outsider, ethnicity, reflexivity...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} {{issues relating to}} <b>insiderness</b> and outsiderness within the qualitative research process. It draws on the researchers' experience of researching older minority ethnic women's accounts of ageing in the UK. Considerable {{attention has been paid}} to this topic as researchers have sought to reflect upon the impact of their biographical background on the practicalities of doing and producing research. In the presentation it will be argued that commonalities of experience are always mediated through difference and therefore cannot be conceptualised as fixed and knowable. Additionally, that the researcher is neither an insider nor an outsider but instead often occupies both positions simultaneously to varying degrees, throughout the research. A central contention of the presentation is that the development of empathetic understanding between researcher and participant is not solely based on similarity of background and experience, or being an 'insider'. Instead it is suggested that this may be less important than the identification, scrutinisation, and destabilisation of those power relations that inadvertently reconstruct <b>insiderness</b> and outsiderness as binary oppositions and lead to essentialist notions of difference. For researchers, this means defining and examining the processes that re-inscribe prevailing representations of otherness as they emerge within the research setting. This is important because it contributes towards the development of a culturally sensitive approach to research methodologies that are able to move beyond the binaries of outsider/insider and the false ethnocentric categories these inevitably (re) affirm and (re) create...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} a {{particular}} site of the transnational: mobility. Reading a contemporary travel narrative, Jamaica Kincaid's Among Flowers, it maps the articulation of a certain 'anxious cosmopolitanism'. Two intertwined discourses produce this anxious cosmopolitanism. Kincaid, I propose, presents a discourse of the uncertain traveller, nervous and hesitant in the Himalaya, even as she is alert to her privileged First World role. A second discourse, that of the cultural insider, with her expertise in plants and gardening situates her within a larger and longer tradition, which also includes, problematically, colonial plant collection. Finally, Kincaid, through acts of memory citizenship, refuses to be identified exclusively within the colonial tradition, foregrounds her horticultural <b>insiderness</b> and multiple allegiances that are local and global...|$|E

The article is divided into four parts. Part one defines the essential elements of a life history research study. Part two describes how to design a life history research study. Part three examines ethical, methodological, and interpretive issues related to issues of organizational <b>insiderness</b> and internal validity and textual authority. The author concludes by outlining the potential benefits and pitfalls of using life histories and discusses how life history research, and qualitative research in general, can enrich and broaden our understanding of library science theory and practice. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the reflexive nature of research I conducted investigating {{the experiences of}} Japanese women who are married to Australian men and currently reside in Australia. It highlights how my positionality: my male gender and Japanese cultural identity, unmarried status and the perspective about the discourse on international marriage influenced {{the nature of the}} interview conversations and had an unexpected impact on my fieldwork generally. Considering positionality is not static or fixed, both insider and outsider status between researchers and the researched are not always clearly detached. Presumed advantage and disadvantaged attached to these statuses, therefore, needs to be scrutinized carefully. This article maintains that the <b>insiderness</b> and outsiderness of researchers and researched relationships were not always antithetical, but could work simultaneously making research both highly nuanced and ambiguous at times...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} based on a small study of 13 {{professional}} doctorate students in two universities, comprising nine current students and four who had completed. The sample consisted of lecturer/practitioners, ie those who had made the transition from practice into higher education, and other professionals including headteachers and teachers in secondary schools and colleges of further education. Data was generated through interviews that adopted active listening/rapid interpretation techniques. In the article we question the practice orientation of insider research and argue that the <b>insiderness</b> of the experience of these students raises questions about relationships and boundaries: being critical and workplace mission and managing the research and writing. In order to acquire research skills at doctoral level, we suggest that the complexities of being an insider in these circumstances warrant particular attention...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between organised interests {{and policy makers}} is an important ingredient of contemporary political systems. In earlier work, interest group scholars have distinguished groups that enjoy access to consultation arrangements from those that are bound {{to stand on the}} sideline. Frequently, these insiders are considered to be equally connected to public authorities. Yet their degree of ‘insiderness’ differs significantly. By unpacking the set of organised interests that have gained access, this article distinguishes core insiders from groups that occupy a more peripheral position in an interest intermediation system. Empirically, we demonstrate and explain varying degrees of <b>insiderness</b> in the community of insider groups in Belgium, using the extensiveness of representation in advisory bodies as a proxy for access. Our findings show that, although nowadays a diverse set of organised interests gets involved in policy-making processes, the inner circle is dominated by traditional economic interests...|$|E
40|$|Insider threats pose a {{difficult}} problem for many organisations. While organisations in principle {{would like to}} judge the risk posed by a specific insider threat, this is in general not possible. This limitation is caused partly {{by the lack of}} models for human behaviour, partly by restrictions on how much and what may be monitored, and by our inability to identify relevant features in large amounts of logged data. To overcome this, the notion of <b>insiderness</b> has been proposed, which measures the degree of access an actor has to a certain resource. We extend this notion with the concept of impact of an insider, and present different realisations of impact. The suggested approach results in readily usable techniques that allow to get a quick overview of potential insider threats based on locations and assets reachable by employees. We present several variations ranging from pure reachability to potential damage to assets causable by an insider...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the “insider” {{perspective}} {{has been}} a pivotal strength of qualitative research. Further than this, within the more applied fields in which the human activity of “caring” takes place, such understanding of “what it is like” for people from within their lifeworlds has also been acknowledged as the foundational starting point in order for “care” to be caring. But we believe that more attention needs {{to be paid to}} this foundational generic phenomenon: what it means to understand the “insiderness” of another, but more importantly, how to act on this in caring ways. We call this human phenomenon “caring for <b>insiderness.</b> ” Drawing on existing phenomenological studies of marginal caring situations at the limits of caring capability, and through a process of phenomenologically oriented reflection, we interrogated some existential themes implicit in these publications that could lead to deeper insights for both theoretical and applied purposes.

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to explain micro-political aspects of women’s {{participation}} within the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) by explicating how Non-Governmental Organization’s (NGO) representatives negotiate and perceive their work. Data from ethnographic participant observation of CSW meetings between 2009 and 2012 demonstrate the simultaneity of both clear insider/outsider distinctions as well as blurred and permeable boundaries between the intergovernmental body of the CSW and civil society in the form of women’s rights activists who attempt to shape CSW outcomes. Concepts of fluid <b>insiderness</b> and outsiderness (Naples 1996) help explain that women activists perceive themselves simultaneously as insiders and outsiders in relation to the UN system, but also in relation to other, more privileged, activists. The concept of "situated accessibility " – the varying accessibility to the UN according to NGO background and NGO notoriety, geopolitical location, funding, experience as well as language skills, personal relationships and notoriety within the UN system – bring...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} who speaks {{on behalf of}} the traumatized other is {{sometimes}} too easily glossed in postcolonial literature by a specious claim to <b>insiderness,</b> which consistently mediates the kind of story we receive as readers. This gloss represents itself as imagination at its most expansive and inclusive, even as it conceals areas where neither text nor author want to go, based on very particular subject positions informed by race, class, ethnic affiliation, and language. By contrast, Mark Behr’s The Smell of Apples sets the fantasy of harmonious white South African family life during apartheid against the text’s silences, omissions, contradictions, and falsifications. I suggest that the transparency of the subject looking back at apartheid constitutes a seduction of the reader, a liminal seduction that situates voyeurism and empathy on the same axis. My analysis engages with tracing the structural, modal, and schematic contours of this novel: how it discloses trauma and distributes references to traumatic events. I also examine the novel’s use of the child narrator Marnus, who dramatizes the text’s preoccupation with bodies of all types escaping narrative, physical, and ethical containment. Though we are always at risk of succumbing to the seduction of the text as fantasy enclosure, that risk is counterbalanced by Behr’s persistence in demonstrating how innocuous, everyday language can generate a passivity that eclipses and denies the trauma of the other...|$|E
30|$|Chief {{executive}} officer (CEO) {{commitment to the}} status quo (CSQ) is expected {{to play an important role}} in any firm’s strategic adaptation. CSQ is used often as an explanation for strategic change occurring after CEO succession: new CEOs are expected to reveal a lower CSQ than established CEOs. Although widely accepted in the literature, this relationship remains imputed but unobserved. We address this research gap and analyze whether new CEOs reveal lower CSQ than established CEOs. By analyzing the letters to the shareholders of German HDAX firms, we find empirical support for our hypothesis of a lower CSQ of newly appointed CEOs compared to established CEOs. However, our detailed analyses provide a differentiated picture. We find support for a lower CSQ of successors after a forced CEO turnover compared to successors after a voluntary turnover, which indicates an influence of the mandate for change on the CEO’s CSQ. However, against the widespread assumption, we do not find support for a lower CSQ of outside successors compared to inside successors, which calls for deeper analyses of the <b>insiderness</b> of new CEOs. Further, our supplementary analyses propose a revised tenure effect: the widely assumed relationship of an increase in CSQ when CEO tenure increases might be driven mainly by the event of CEO succession and may not universally and continuously increase over time, pointing to a “window of opportunity” to initiate strategic change shortly after the succession event. By analyzing the relationship between CEO succession and CEO CSQ, our results contribute to the CSQ literature and provide fruitful impulses for the CEO succession literature.|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, I first {{suggest an}} {{extension}} of the managerial rents model and more specifically the managerial skills typology that it offers. Building on research in international business, I propose adding country-specific skills (CSS) to this typology in addition to firm-specific, industry-specific, and generic skills. I define CSS as managers 2 ̆ 7 abilities that are applicable and specific to a particular national institutional context. Such skills are distinct from the other three types identified and are likely to influence managers 2 ̆ 7 performance and the performance of their firms. ^ So if CSS are distinct skills, what are the implications for strategy and international business research? In an attempt to respond to this question, I conduct two empirical essays in which I examine the implications of this refinement of the typology of managerial skills for CEO selection and firms 2 ̆ 7 mergers and acquisitions (M 2 ̆ 6 A;) strategy. ^ In the first empirical essay, I puzzle at the fact that although CSS constitute a barrier to high-level executive mobility across countries, there have been a growing number of foreign-born CEOs being appointed across the globe. Why are these individuals being selected for the post of CEO? Using information on the appointment of foreign-born and national CEOs from 2005 to 2010 among global 500 companies, I show that internationalization pressures help explain their selection and that two types of firms are likely to appoint foreign leaders: highly internationalized firms and firms that are likely to internationalize. ^ In the second empirical essay, I examine the strategic implications of country-specific skills. Employing the same sample as the one used in the first empirical essay, I demonstrate that given that their mindset is likely to be less focused on firms 2 ̆ 7 home market, foreign-born CEOs may be prone to institute more changes in firms 2 ̆ 7 cross-border M 2 ̆ 6 A; strategy than their domestic counterparts. I also theorize on the moderating influence of CEOs 2 ̆ 7 <b>insiderness.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|In my study, I {{explore a}} {{specific}} kind of Electronic Dance Music (EDM) event - the psytrance party {{to highlight the}} importance of social connectivity and the generation of a modern form of communitas (Turner, 1969, 1982). Since the early 90 s psytrance, and a related earlier style, Goa trance, have been understood as hedonist music cultures where participants seek to get into a trance-like state through all night dancing and psychedelic drugs consumption. Authors (Cole and Hannan, 1997; D’Andrea, 2007; Partridge, 2004; St John 2010 a and 2010 b; Saldanha, 2007) conflate this electronic dance music with spirituality and indigene rituals. In addition, they locate psytrance in a neo-psychedelic countercultural continuum with roots stretching back to the 1960 s. Others locate the trance party events, driven by fast, hypnotic, beat-driven, largely instrumental music, as post sub cultural and neo-tribal, representing symbolic resistance to capitalism and neo liberalism. My study is in partial agreement with these readings when applied to genre history, but questions their validity for contemporary practice. The data I collected at and around the 2008 Offworld festival demonstrates that participants found the psytrance experience enjoyable and enriching, despite an apparent lack of overt euphoria, spectacular transgression, or sustained hedonism. I suggest that my work adds to an existing body of literature on psytrance in its exploration of a dance music event as a liminal space, redolent with communitas, but one too which foregrounds mundane features, such as socialising and pleasure. In addition my work contributes to popular music studies and youth cultures research notably when related to field work methods and ethnographic approaches. My inquiry harnesses a variety of fieldwork methods to argue for re-evaluation of the psytrance party. Attention in particular is paid to the event’s many material elements and how they interact. They include site spaces, infrastructure, dancing, or ’chilling’, bodies, DJs, sound systems, organisers and drugs. The study applies concepts developed in cultural anthropology such as communitas, in the new ethnography (Goodall, 1999; Marcus 1998) - reflexive researching and partial <b>insiderness</b> – and, lastly, the ‘vibe’ and the DJ-dancer relationship, which remain fundamental to electronic dance music cultures...|$|E
