To {{cope with}} {{biochemical}} terrorism attack {{and public health}} emergency, it is urgently necessary to develop a kind of renewable toxic <b>gas</b> <b>filtering</b> apparatus in order to solve problems of regular replacement and short protective time of existing toxic <b>gas</b> <b>filtering</b> apparatus.

The development of 'smart' processing and cryogenics/cooling systems {{for all types}} of broadband spectrometers is advised. The use of large fixed gratings and the development of 1000 -element arrays is recommended. Improvements suggested for interferometers are: the mitigation of background fluctuations; the development of multiaperature, multiband interferometers; and provision of in-flight alignment verification. Specifically recommended for <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> radiometers are the development of <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> cell technology, of liner and high dynamic range detectors, and of high uniform optical elements...|$|R

40|$|It was {{recommended}} that <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> correlation radiometry and high-resolution interferometry be exploited and expanded for {{measurements of the}} distribution of tropospheric trace gases. Instruments and missions were identified and discussed. Several instrument/measurement/mission feasibility studies were recommended, including: a three-layer measurement of carbon monoxide, using a nadir-viewing <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> correlation radiometer; a lower or middle tropospheric measurement of methane, using a nadir-viewing <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> correlation radiometer; and a survey of lower, middle, and upper tropospheric trace gases using a nadir-viewing high-resolution interferometer operating in the thermal emission mode. It was also concluded that lidar systems appear to have the potential of obtaining measurments of tropospheric trace gases and aerosols from space. In addition to the specific instrument/mission recommendations, the panels made several general recommendations that may lead to future spaceborne instruments, techniques, and missions for tropospheric research...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} CHRISGAS {{project was}} the {{development}} of a gasification technique to produce clean hydrogen-rich synthesis gas from biomass. In order to improve the process efficiency, this work presents a gas cleaning concept, which combines chemical hot gas cleaning with hot (1 MPa, 900 degrees C) and warm (1 MPa, 300 degrees C) filtration. As the focus is set on the removal of H 2 S, HCI and KCl, calculations on chemical gas cleaning for the hot and warm <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> were done using a thermodynamic process model using SimuSage (TM) (GTT-Technologies). The calculations show that Ca-based and Fe-based sorbents are not suitable H 2 S sorbents under the conditions of the hot <b>gas</b> <b>filter.</b> For Cu-based sorbents, H 2 S concentration below 100 cm(3) M- 3 is achievable, if the temperature is reduced below 810 degrees C. Additional calculations of KCl sorption on alumosilicates under the conditions of the hot <b>gas</b> <b>filter</b> show that the alkali concentration in gasifier-derived gases can be limited to 100 mm(3) m(- 3). Thus, the condensation temperature of KCl can be decreased down to 580 degrees C. The results of HCl sorption calculations show that Na- and K-based sorbents are only suitable for temperatures below 600 degrees C. Therefore, the HCl sorption is transferred to the warm <b>gas</b> <b>filter.</b> The KCl sorption results were confirmed by experiments using bauxite, bentonite, kaolinite and naturally occurring zeolite as sorbents.

40|$|The Monolithic Geometric Anti-Spring (<b>GAS)</b> <b>Filter</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{efficient}} vertical seismic isolation devices for Gravitational Waves (GW) interferometers. However, the attenuation of this filter was previously limited to around 60 dB due to the high frequency saturation associated with the filter’s distributed mass- a problem typical of passive mechanical filters. We show that it is possible to circumvent this limit using a compensation wand based on the Center Of Percussion (COP) effect. When this device is mounted in parallel with the blade springs of a <b>GAS</b> <b>filter,</b> attenuation improves to 80 dB in the region above 10 Hz. Using this device it is therefore possible to design simpler attenuation chains consisting of fewer stages...|$|R

Performance requirements range from relatively modest for hot <b>gas</b> <b>filters</b> to severe for turbine combustor liners and infrared burners. The McDermott Technology Inc. (MTI) CFCC program focused on oxide/oxide composite systems because they {{are known to be}} stable in the application environments of interest. The work is broadly focused on dense and porous composite systems depending on the specific application. Dense composites were targeted at corrosion resistant components, molten aluminum handling components and gas turbine combustor liners. The development work on dense composites led to significant advances in fiber coatings for oxide fibers and matrix densification. Additionally, a one-step fabrication process was developed to produce low cost composite components. The program also supported key developments in advanced oxide fibers that resulted in an improved version of Nextel 610 fiber (commercially available as Nextel 650) and significant progress {{in the development of a}} YAG/alumina fiber.
