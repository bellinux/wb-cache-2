5000|$|Seasonal effect: This is {{easiest to}} {{understand}} for the idealised {{case of a}} non-rotating body orbiting the Sun, for which each [...] "year" [...] consists of exactly one [...] "day". As it travels around its orbit, the [...] "dusk" [...] hemisphere which has been heated over a long preceding time period is invariably {{in the direction of}} orbital motion. The excess of thermal radiation in this direction causes a braking force which always causes spiraling inward toward the Sun. In practice, for rotating bodies, this seasonal effect increases along with the axial tilt. It dominates only if the <b>diurnal</b> <b>effect</b> is small enough. This may occur because of very rapid rotation (no time to cool off on the night side, hence an almost uniform longitudinal temperature distribution), small size (the whole body is heated throughout) or an axial tilt close to 90°. The seasonal effect is more important for smaller asteroid fragments (from a few metres up to about 100 m), provided their surfaces are not covered by an insulating regolith layer and they do not have exceedingly slow rotations. Additionally, on very long timescales over which the spin axis of the body may be repeatedly changed due to collisions (and hence also the direction of the <b>diurnal</b> <b>effect</b> changes), the seasonal effect will also tend to dominate.|$|E
5000|$|Diurnal effect: On a {{rotating}} body {{illuminated by the}} Sun (e.g. an asteroid or the Earth), the surface is warmed by solar radiation during the day, and cools at night. Due to the thermal properties of the surface, there is a lag between the absorption of radiation from the Sun, and the emission of that same radiation as heat, so the warmest point on {{a rotating}} body occurs around the [...] "2 PM" [...] site on the surface, or slightly after noon. This results in {{a difference between the}} directions of absorption and re-emission of radiation, which yields a net force along the direction of motion of the orbit. If the object is a prograde rotator, the force is in the direction of motion of the orbit, and causes the semi-major axis of the orbit to increase steadily; the object spirals away from the Sun. A retrograde rotator spirals inward. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>effect</b> is the dominant component for bodies with diameter greater than about 100 m.|$|E

40|$|Urinary purine {{derivatives}} (PD) are the excretion {{products of}} purines, {{and may be}} used as an alternative to duodenal purines to estimate microbial crude protein (MCP) flow. When urine volume is quantified using urinary creatinine excretion, spot samples of urine can be used to estimate relative differences in MCP flow. Four experiments were conducted to further advance the use of urinary spot samples to estimate MCP flow. In the first experiment, six steers were fed diets with three levels of roughage with and without calcium magnesium carbonate. Increasing roughage level resulted in a linear increase in ruminal pH and a linear decrease in total tract organic matter digestibility, but did not affect urinary PD:creatinine (PD:C) ratio. ^ To determine the relationship between ruminal MCP flow and urinary PD excretion, 116 heifers were individually-fed diets formulated to produce differences in ruminal MCP flow. When urea was added to a steam-flaked corn diet, feed intake and urinary PD:C increased. Further increases were observed when a corn milling byproduct was added to the ration. In a metabolism experiment utilizing the same dietary treatments, feed intake and urinary PD:C ratio again increased when a corn milling byproduct was added to the ration. Microbial CP flow estimated from duodenal purines was related to urinary PD:C ratio, suggesting that spot samples of urine can be used to predict relative differences in MCP flow. In both experiments urinary PD:C increased with time after feeding, suggesting that a <b>diurnal</b> <b>effect</b> may occur. ^ A final experiment concluded that level of feed intake did not affect microbial purine:N ratio, and determined that urinary PD are related to duodenal purine flow. It was also concluded that the <b>diurnal</b> <b>effect</b> on urinary PD:C ratio previously observed was likely due to feeding time, as no diurnal impact was observed when steers were fed diets in six equal portions throughout the day. ...|$|E

40|$|Aspects of {{the anatomy}} and {{physiology}} of the cone pathway are known to {{vary according to the}} phase of the natural light cycle. Using a prolonged flash stimulus (approximately 200 ms), we have examined the human electroretinogram (ERG) over a 24 h period. We report that whilst the a-wave of the photopic ERG does not alter, there are profound effects upon the implicit times of both the b-wave and d-wave components. Both components are significantly slower in the night-time period and systematically become faster (15 - 22 % reduction in implicit time), reaching a peak at around midday. The daily variation in the temporal properties of the ERG is abolished by constant light, but is retained during constant darkness. The data suggest that the changes in the temporal properties of the cone pathway affect both cone-ON and cone-OFF pathways.

40|$|The {{original}} orbital {{elements of}} the members of a dynamical family are subject to changes, some connected to the overall dynamical evolution, and others due to the Yarkovsky effect (mainly the <b>diurnal</b> <b>effect).</b> While the former term may be analyzed in terms of proper elements, the latter one introduces a sort of ageing of proper elements. However, the Yarkovsky-driven mobility depends on the spin vector of a fragment- after the collisional and, possibly, the reaccumulation processes; the spin vector is not -in general -randomly oriented, but connected to the impact geometry and to the physical properties of the collision. Thus the spin vector and the initial ejection velocity may be strongly correlated. In this paper we try, on the basis of simplified assumptions, to discuss how the original distribution of family members in the space of orbital elements evolves in time, due to the Yarkovsky effect, and how far this evolution may differ according to different impact geometries and physical assumptions...|$|E

In both SP and LP conditions, TSHβ expression was between 3 and 14 -fold higher at night than in the day, suggesting that TSHβ expression cycles in a diurnal pattern irrespective of photoperiod.

This approach allows a comparison of the consequences of the fixed-step interpolate strategy (GEAR) for changing step size against the truly variable step size strategy (EPISODE). It is concluded that EPISODE is generally faster than GEAR for problems involving wave fronts or transients on the interior of the interval of integration.

Unlike previous studies, the model is structured such that all wet day data available are considered in the analysis, without the need to discard any good quality daily data embedded in a month having some missing data.

The analysis, applied to isolated auroral substorm onsets (inferred from rapid variations in the AE-index) and to {{the bulk of the}} AE data, indicates that the maximum in auroral activity is largely confined to 09 ? 18 UT, with a distinct minimum at 03 ? 06 UT.

On the whole the diurnal trend was strong in winter, intermediate at equinox and weak in summer. The implication {{of this study is that}} Eastern Siberia, Japan and Australia are mostly at night, during the period of maximum auroral activity whereas Europe and Eastern America are then mostly at daytime. The minimum of auroral activity coincides with near-midnight conditions in Eastern America.
