40|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in ECG {{variables}} and susceptibility to arrhythmia exist. The {{basis of these}} sex-related distinctions in cardiac electrophysiology has been extensively studied in various species, but is virtually unexplored in humans. The {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the cellular basis of electrophysiological <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in human cardiac myocytes. Human midmyocardial left ventricular myocytes were isolated from explanted hearts of male and female patients in end-stage heart failure at the time of cardiac transplantation. The action potentials, sarcolemmal ion currents, and susceptibility to the generation of early afterdepolarizations were studied using whole-cell patch-clamp methodology. The functional effects of <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in sarcolemmal ion currents were assessed by computer simulations using the Priebe-Beuckelmann or the ten Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Panfilov human ventricular cell models. Female myocytes had significantly longer action potentials and greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male myocytes. All other action potential parameters (resting membrane potential, amplitude, plateau level, upstroke velocity, maximal velocity of phase- 1 and phase- 3 repolarization) had similar values for both genders. In female myocytes, the transient outward potassium current (I(to 1)) tended to be smaller, while the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)) and quasi-steady state current (I(QSS)) tended to be larger. Computer simulations showed that these subtle differences in sarcolemmal ion currents may conspire to cause the observed <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in action potential properties. Female failing myocytes have longer action potentials and a greater susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations than male failing myocytes. These <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> may be due to slightly larger depolarizing I(Ca,L) in conjunction with slightly smaller repolarizing I(QSS) and I(to 1) in female myocyte...|$|R

25|$|These {{statistics}} {{shed some}} interesting facts about education in Pakistan; the <b>gender</b> <b>disparity</b> in education {{is much lower}} in urban places vis-à-vis rural areas. One of the possible explanations of this pattern is relatively stronger dominance of tribal, feudal and patriarchal traditions in rural areas. Moreover, {{there are very few}} employment opportunities for women in rural areas, and thus, there is very little financial incentive for families to send their girls to schools. However, {{it is interesting to note}} that, despite the meagre representation of females in the education sector, the level of achievement of female students is consistently far higher than that of their counterpart male students. Girls generally outclass boys in examination, and they are also higher achievers in universities. Unfortunately, the majority of the girls never get an opportunity to develop their educational capabilities.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the primary}} ways {{in which there are}} <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in {{education}} in West Africa are in the ratios of male to female participation: 43.6% of men have completed primary education as opposed to 35.4% of women, 6.0% of men have completed secondary education as opposed to 3.3% of women, and 0.7% of men have completed tertiary education as opposed to 0.2% of women. Some of the reasons for poor enrollment and participation is the [...] "male breadwinner" [...] ideal that prioritizes educating boys over girls and limited funds available to families for education. In addition, in West Africa women are seen as the primary providers of unpaid care work. This offers competing demands on the time of girls and oftentimes their families will prioritize girls' spending time taking care of siblings or doing domestic labor. In addition, a leading cause of <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in education are <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in the labor market, which lead to gendered ideas of women's role in a society.|$|R

25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to <b>gender</b> <b>disparity</b> in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view {{is that it is}} better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
25|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), {{adopted in}} 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from {{discrimination}} and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized {{the rights and}} equality of woman is also {{the key to the}} survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from <b>gender</b> <b>disparity.</b> It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure {{the health and well-being of}} families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1980s, it was {{uncommon}} for Japanese women {{to perform on}} traditional instruments, including taiko, as their participation had been systematically restricted. In Ondekoza {{and in the early}} performances of Kodo, women performed only dance routines either during or between taiko performances. Thereafter, female participation in kumi-daiko started to rise dramatically, and by the 1990s, women equaled and possibly exceeded representation by men. While the proportion of women in taiko has become substantial, some have expressed concern that women still do not perform in the same roles as their male counterparts and that taiko performance continues to be a male-dominated profession. For instance, a member of Kodo was informed by the director of the group's apprentice program that women were permitted to play, but could only play [...] "as women". Other women in the apprentice program recognized a <b>gender</b> <b>disparity</b> in performance roles, such as what pieces they were allowed to perform, or in physical terms based on a male standard.|$|E
500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the <b>gender</b> <b>disparity</b> is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need what we needed when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, look forward to a night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas, like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly having the time of their lives.|$|E

40|$|Females {{are still}} vastly {{underrepresented}} {{in math and}} science careers. This may be partly due to continued <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> {{in math and science}} motivation (i. e., the cognitions and emotions that drive math and science related choices and behaviors). Yet the effect of school contexts on these disparities is still unclear. School effects research has mostly focused on schools' role in achievement outcomes, while research on student motivation, including gender differences in math motivation, has primarily studied the contribution of individual-level factors to motivation. There are numerous policy and practice implications that can emerge from the finding that schools impact motivation even after controlling for student and family characteristics. Determining what school features are related to <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> could inform classroom and school-wide reforms to improve girls' math and science motivation. Therefore, this study not only adds to the school effects and motivation literatures, but it could also shape education policy and practice by examining the school context of <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in math motivation. To study school contributions to student motivational outcomes, data from the National High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 were analyzed. The survey tapped into students' and teachers' perceptions of their schools, significant school features (e. g., school sector and teaching quality) as well as students' 1) beliefs about their math ability, 2) interest in math 3) perceived usefulness of math, and 4) intentions to take math in the future. Multi-level modeling was used to assess school-level features that contribute to <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in math motivation. Results suggest student perceptions of teachers are strongly associated with between-school differences in math motivation, as well as <b>gender</b> <b>disparities</b> in motivation. For schools in which females were strongly motivated for math compared to males, students reported highly positive relationships with their math teachers. The results from this study will help professionals involved in education recognize the role of math teaching climate and quality in enhancing the math motivation of underrepresented female students...|$|R
