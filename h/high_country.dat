5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau <b>high</b> <b>country</b> grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIschaemic {{heart disease}} (IHD) {{is the leading}} cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{collects}} mortality data coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) code. MethodsWe analysed IHD deaths world-wide between 1995 and 2009 and used the UN population database to calculate age-specific and directly and indirectly age-standardised IHD mortality rates by country and region. ResultsIHD is the single largest cause of death worldwide, causing 7, 249, 000 deaths in 2008, 12. 7 % of total global mortality. There is more than 20 -fold variation in IHD mortality rates between <b>countries.</b> <b>Highest</b> IHD mortality rates are in Eastern Europe and Central Asian countries; lowest rates in <b>high</b> income <b>countries.</b> For the working-age population, IHD mortality rates are markedly higher in low-and-middle income <b>countries</b> than in <b>high</b> income <b>countries.</b> Over the last 25 years, age-standardised IHD mortality has fallen by more than half in <b>high</b> income <b>countries,</b> but the trend is flat or increasing in some low-and-middle income countries. Low-and-middle income countries now account for more than 80 % of global IHD deaths. ConclusionsThe global burden of IHD deaths has shifted to low-and-middle income countries as lifestyles approach those of <b>high</b> income <b>countries.</b> In <b>high</b> income <b>countries,</b> population ageing maintains IHD as the leading cause of death. Nevertheless, the progressive decline in age-standardised IHD mortality in <b>high</b> income <b>countries</b> shows that increasing IHD mortality is not inevitable. The 20 -fold mortality difference between countries, and the temporal trends, may hold vital clues for handling IHD epidemic which is migratory, and still burgeoning...|$|R
