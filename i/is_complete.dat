5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation <b>is</b> <b>complete,</b> the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them when given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis <b>is</b> <b>complete</b> (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E

5|$|An {{unpublished}} {{study conducted}} by Vernon Meidlinger-Chin in 2013 suggested that previous studies lacked focus on endocranial details. The {{study found that the}} Cryolophosaurus fossil has a nearly complete, undistorted cranial cavity which <b>is</b> <b>complete</b> enough to give an approximate shape and size of the living brain. The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the orphanage}} has been heavily vandalised, with {{surrounding}} residents regularly {{calling the police}} because the sounds of windows smashing and people entering without permission can be heard and seen frequently. Small grass fires around the building have also been reported. Restorations have been considered by the Goulburn City Council. The council is holding Ferrara accountable for allowing damage at the orphanage, while he {{has come up with}} many development projects for the lot. As a result, city council has not issued Ferrara any development permits until restoration work to the orphanage <b>is</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth <b>is</b> <b>complete.</b> Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E

Terminal 1 <b>was</b> <b>completed</b> in 1963, Terminal 2 <b>was</b> <b>completed</b> in 1986, and Terminal 3 <b>was</b> <b>completed</b> in 2012.

50|$|Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi {{announced}} in 2012 that Phase I <b>was</b> <b>completed.</b> In reality, some works had not <b>been</b> <b>completed</b> such as conversion of all Harbour Line services to 12 coach, and conversion from DC to AC had only <b>been</b> <b>completed</b> on Western Line.

5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis <b>is</b> <b>complete,</b> the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the animals {{have been trained to}} swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission <b>is</b> <b>complete.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall <b>is</b> <b>complete.</b> With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before she lays eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle <b>is</b> <b>complete.</b> A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E
5|$|Following the restoration, {{the station}} evokes the 1940s; the {{interior}} <b>is</b> <b>complete</b> with a potbelly stove, tiny Coca-Cola bottle and antique Dwight Lumber/Route 66 advertising yardsticks.
