25|$|Basic {{research}} on Corinthian pottery {{was accomplished by}} Humfry Payne, who in the 1930s made a first stylistic classification which is, in essence, being used {{up to the present}} time. He classified the vases according to shape, type of decoration and image subjects, and only afterward did he make distinctions as to painters and workshops. He followed Beazley’s method except for attributing less importance to allocating painters and groups since a chronological framework was more <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Jack L. Benson took on this allocation task in 1953 and distinguished 109 painters and groups. Last of all, Darrell A. Amyx summarized the research up to that point in his 1988 book Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. It is however a matter of scholarly dispute whether it is at all possible in the case of Corinthian pottery to attribute specific painters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} seventies and early eighties Tadao Ando's {{architecture}} and theoretical writings explored the idea of Critical regionalism – the idea of promoting local or national culture within architecture. Ando's interpretation of this was demonstrated by his idea of reacquainting the Japanese house with nature, a relationship he thought had been lost with Modernist architecture. His first projects were for small urban houses with enclosed courtyards (such as the Azuma House in Ōsaka in 1976). His architecture is characterised {{by the use of}} concrete, but it has been <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to use the interplay of light, through time, with this and other materials in his work. His ideas about the integration of nature converted well into larger projects such as the Rokkō Housing 1 (1983) (on a steep site on Mount Rokkō) and the Church on the Water (1988) in Tomamu, Hokkaidō.|$|E
500|$|The first {{character}} Nomura {{designed for}} Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{was inspired by}} actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said that [...] "obody understood it." [...] Squall is [...] tall, initially with longer hair and a more feminine appearance. After objections by game director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine. He added the scar across Squall's brow and {{the bridge of his}} nose impulsively (to make the character more recognizable), leaving the description of its origin up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall's first illustration was used as a set up to create the world around him. The logo of the game which had Squall embracing Rinoa was left as an open interpretation for fans who still had not played the game. The scar in Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Irving {{was heavily}} {{involved}} {{in the creation of}} his character, writing Meyer's biography before assuming the role. He felt that it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to understand Meyer's motivation and the reason he is so driven, as the character is presented as a [...] "peacock ogre" [...] who throws scalpels at one of his colleagues in an early episode, and unless Irving could fathom why, his portrayal would be [...] "one step removed". Meyer was loosely based on the cardiothoracic surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub. He was originally intended to be of Iranian descent and had the surname Hussein, before the series producers changed their minds and made him central European instead. Irving had developed a Hungarian accent for a film role prior to his involvement with Holby City, and decided that [...] "Meyer was temperamentally Hungarian–gloomy with a bit of Mediterranean liveliness." [...] It was decided that Meyer had left Hungary following the 1956 uprising, with his parents, who were intellectuals.|$|E
500|$|Early in the character's {{publication}} history, Anole's {{sexual identity}} was alluded to by his {{close relationship with}} his squad mentor Northstar, one of Marvel's most recognized openly gay superheroes. [...] After Northstar's [...] "death," [...] Anole's conversations with his former mentor Karma, an openly lesbian character, discussed how {{he felt it was}} <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have someone like Northstar, who [...] "understood him," [...] to talk to in particular. [...] His sexual orientation was later confirmed by DeFilippis on an online forum, who stated that the dialogue intentionally alluded to this, and was reaffirmed in The X-Men: 198 Files. His sexual orientation continued to be mentioned indirectly, and other allusions included him pointing out that Young Avengers characters Wiccan and Hulkling are gay before being cut off and Anole attacking Rockslide for calling him a [...] "sissy," [...] Rockslide shouting that he [...] "didn't know" [...] and that he [...] "shouldn't be so sensitive." [...] In the following issue, Anole's sexuality was officially stated outright for the first time when Rockslide announces, [...] "Anole's gay!" [...] in an attempt to quickly get the remaining students to bond with each other by opening up about their secrets. Despite Rockslide's vocal acceptance of his sexuality, Anole was outraged, though Loa stated that his classmates already knew.|$|E
500|$|Welling was {{generally}} {{unfamiliar with the}} Superman mythology, {{so much so that}} when an episode of [...] aired on television, which featured Clark learning about his Kryptonian heritage, Welling immediately turned the show off. According to Welling, he wanted to learn about Clark's heritage simultaneously to Clark learning about it on Smallville. Welling believed that it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to learn with the character, to help him be the Clark Kent envisioned by Al Gough and Miles Millar. The actor believed his lack of knowledge of the Superman mythology helped his performance, because Gough and Millar set up the series so that the previous mythology was not as important. Welling also enjoyed {{that he was in the}} same predicament as Clark with neither knowing the future of the character, beyond the fact that he will be Superman. When Welling landed the role of Clark Kent he was sent various Superman-related gifts, including books and toys, which Welling planned to leave unopened until the show was over. Welling was adamant from the beginning that he did not sign on to play Superman, and had no intention of wearing the costume. While filming, Welling was allowed input into how his character responded in certain situations, including moving the scene between rooms, or requesting the director film particular mannerisms to emphasize a specific emotion.|$|E

2500|$|A year later, the war {{had taken}} a {{different}} turn and Brooke no longer believed it necessary to stay at Churchill's side. He therefore looked forward to taking command of the Allied invasion of Western Europe, a post Brooke believed he had been promised by Churchill on three occasions. During the first Quebec Conference in August 1943, {{it was decided that}} the command would go to General George Marshall. (Although in the event Marshall's work as U.S. Army Chief of Staff was too <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to leave Washington DC and Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed instead.) Brooke was bitterly disappointed, both at being passed over and of the way the decision was conveyed to him by Churchill, who according to Brooke [...] "dealt with the matter as if it were one of minor importance".|$|E

2500|$|It's notable that Einstein's paper {{contains}} no direct references to other papers. However, many historians of science like Holton, Miller, Stachel, {{have tried to}} find out possible influences on Einstein. He stated that his thinking was influenced by the empiricist philosophers David Hume and Ernst Mach. Regarding the Relativity Principle, the moving magnet and conductor problem (possibly after reading a book of August Föppl) and the various negative aether drift experiments were <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to accept that principle— but he denied any significant influence of the most important experiment: the Michelson–Morley experiment. Other likely influences include Poincaré's Science and Hypothesis, where Poincaré presented the Principle of Relativity (which, as has been reported by Einstein's friend Maurice Solovine, was closely studied and discussed by Einstein and his friends {{over a period of years}} before the publication of Einstein's 1905 paper), and the writings of Max Abraham, from whom he borrowed the terms [...] "Maxwell-Hertz equations" [...] and [...] "longitudinal and transverse mass".|$|E
2500|$|Laure Olga Gondjout, the Minister of Communication, {{defended the}} {{inclusion}} of two presidential candidates in the government, saying {{that there was no}} law against it. She said that Maganga Moussavou had been retained in the government as Minister of Technical Education because it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to continue his work in the education sector while student exams took place. Mba Abessole criticized the two candidates' inclusion and called for them to leave the government. The UGDD expressed a similar sentiment, stating on 24 July that {{the inclusion of}} Bongo and Maganga Moussavou [...] "calls into question the equal treatment of candidates and impartiality expected of the State during the election campaign". RNB President Kombila said that Biyoghé Mba was in office merely [...] "to organize the victory of a candidate" [...] and that he should resign along with his government; he also said that Rogombé should meet with the political class to discuss setting up a different structure to organize the elections.|$|E

Hamilton said despite his turn four spin, it had been [...] "an amazing race" [...] and praised his team for the work they put in and enjoyed his battle with Rosberg. Massa stated that he was [...] "grateful" [...] for the pace {{of his car and}} declared how he happy he was for his home event. In the later press conference, Rosberg said it was <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to improve after the American race, and was confident that he could control the gap to Hamilton and ensure he did not come into contention to battle for the win. When asked if his spin prevented him from winning the race, Hamilton replied that he felt it did and stated that he was at fault. He felt the team's record-breaking race was [...] "absolutely incredible" [...] and that it had been an [...] "unbelievable job" [...] by Mercedes. Massa revealed he thought his chances of finishing on the podium were diminished with his five-second time penalty but was not worried about his parking in the incorrect pit stall, He felt confident about continuing his strong form into the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, hoping his car would contend for a podium position.|$|E

2500|$|During {{this time}} abroad, his {{disconnection}} from Cuba {{and the interaction}} with different groups of intellectuals and artists in Paris helped with his ‘critical vision’. Carpentier {{felt that it was}} <b>important</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to remain outside the influences of movements because he believed in maintaining a “balance against the insularity of his homeland”. Upon arriving in Paris he immediately began working on poems and editorials in Parisian and Cuban magazines. Contributions to the Parisian Journal such as the short story [...] "Cahiers du Sud" [...] (1933), in French, were an effort to acquire European readers as a way to improve his recognition. He also contributed to the magazines Documents and L’Intransigeant. Carpentier was familiar with the activities of the Comité de Jeunes Revolutionnaires Cubains, a group of exiled Cuban leftists who had published La Terreur á Cuba, a brochure against the Machado government. He documented the latest news about this group and their activities in his book Homenaje a nuestros amigos de Paris. It was also during this time that, with the help of Robert Desnos, Carpentier became part of the surrealist movement which became a positive influence in his work. While in France, Carpentier also founded a literary magazine called Imán in 1931, for which he became editor-in-chief. Most of the authors who worked with him in La Revolution Surrealiste also contributed works in Imán under the title “Conocimiento de America”. Carpentier contributed the short story Histoire de Lunes (1933); it was experimental for its time as it contained elements of fantasy and folklore characterized as magical reality.|$|E
