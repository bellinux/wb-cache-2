5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing <b>it</b> <b>through</b> the gills, and expelling <b>it</b> <b>through</b> the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20‚Å∞C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
