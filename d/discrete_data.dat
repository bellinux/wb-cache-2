25|$|In {{the area}} of {{communications}} research and informetrics, the concept of self-organizing systems appears in mid-1990s research related to scientific communications. Scientometrics and bibliometrics are areas of research in which <b>discrete</b> <b>data</b> are available, as are several other areas of social communications research such as sociolinguistics. Social complexity is also a concept used in semiotics.|$|E
25|$|As a middle-range {{theoretical}} platform, social complexity can {{be applied}} to any research in which social interaction or the outcomes of such interactions can be observed, but particularly where they can be measured and expressed as continuous or <b>discrete</b> <b>data</b> points. One common criticism often cited regarding the usefulness of complexity science in sociology is the difficulty of obtaining adequate data. Nonetheless, application of the concept of social complexity and the analysis of such complexity has begun and continues to be an ongoing field of inquiry in sociology. From childhood friendships and teen pregnancy to criminology and counter-terrorism, theories of social complexity are being applied in almost all areas of sociological research.|$|E

As a further application, the stable numerical computation of gradient fields from <b>discrete</b> noisy <b>data</b> is also investigated. The main {{features of the}} algorithm are: 1. 1. information about the noise is needed; 2. 2. the mollification parameters are chosen automatically {{by means of the}} Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) procedure. A complete error analysis of the method is provided together with several numerical examples of interest...|$|R

2500|$|The {{negative}} binomial distribution, {{especially in}} its alternative parameterization described above, {{can be used}} {{as an alternative to the}} Poisson distribution. [...] It is especially useful for <b>discrete</b> <b>data</b> over an unbounded positive range whose sample variance exceeds the sample mean. In such cases, the observations are overdispersed with respect to a Poisson distribution, for which the mean is equal to the variance. Hence a Poisson distribution is not an appropriate model. [...] Since the negative binomial distribution has one more parameter than the Poisson, the second parameter can be used to adjust the variance independently of the mean. See Cumulants of some discrete probability distributions.|$|E
2500|$|Like any Fourier-related transform, {{discrete}} cosine transforms (DCTs) {{express a}} function or a signal {{in terms of}} a sum of sinusoids with different frequencies and amplitudes. [...] Like the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), a DCT operates on a function at a finite number of <b>discrete</b> <b>data</b> points. [...] The obvious distinction between a DCT and a DFT is that the former uses only cosine functions, while the latter uses both cosines and sines (in the form of complex exponentials). [...] However, this visible difference is merely a consequence of a deeper distinction: a DCT implies different boundary conditions from the DFT or other related transforms.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{fundamental}} upper limit on the extent that any classifier [...] - neural network or otherwise [...] - can discriminate between two classes of <b>discrete</b> valued <b>data.</b> When classes overlap in feature space, discrimination will be less than perfect. In a two alternative forced-choice decision problem, a classifier's discrimination ability is often {{measured in terms of}} the area under its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In this paper, we show how to calculate the maximum possible area under the ROC curve obtained with a particular representation of a given set of <b>discrete</b> valued <b>data.</b> This result corresponds to the fundamental upper limit of discrimination. We extend this result to show how to estimate both the maximum and the average discrimination we can expect to achieve on unseen test data, again, for a particular representation of a <b>discrete</b> valued <b>data</b> set.

40|$|Heaping {{is often}} found in <b>discrete</b> {{quantitative}} <b>data</b> based on subject responses to open-ended interview questions or observer assessments.

We present simple measures and tests of heaping in <b>discrete</b> quantitative <b>data,</b> illustrate them with data from an epidemiologic study, and evaluate the bias of these statistics. These techniques permit formal measurement of heaping and facilitate comparisons of the degree of heaping in data from different samples, substantive domains, and data collection methods. ...|$|R
