40|$|Stethoscopes {{are used}} to listen to {{acoustic}} signals from the internal organs of the human body. Although stethoscopes play {{a very important role}} in the diagnosis process, the chest piece and the <b>connecting</b> <b>cable</b> are known to facilitate transmission of pathogens from patient to patient and from patient to the user. Replacing the <b>connecting</b> <b>cable</b> with a wireless system may help reduce the potential risk and further allow broadcasting of the signals to multi-users for examination. This work reports on the design of a two-piece Bluetooth-based wireless system that eliminates the <b>connecting</b> <b>cables</b> in electronic stethoscopes. The design consists of a Bluetooth basedintegrated chest-piece module for captured acoustic sound transmission and a microcontroller-based (MSP 430) head-piece receiver module for decoding the data for the three operational modes of the stethoscope. The design was first tested using a chirp signal source with frequency of 10 Hz – 5 kHz. Results obtained for the threeoperational frequency bands of the stethoscope were consistent with the expected behaviour of the stethoscope...|$|R

40|$|Using a long, {{flexible}} test <b>cable</b> <b>connected</b> with a one-wire {{voltage feedback}} circuit, a resistive tactile sensor in a shared row-column fashion exhibited flexibility in robotic operations but suffered from crosstalk {{caused by the}} <b>connected</b> <b>cable</b> due to its wire resistances and its contacted resistances. Firstly, we designed a new non-scanned driving-electrode (VF-NSDE) circuit using two wires for every row line and every column line to reduce the crosstalk caused by the <b>connected</b> <b>cables</b> in the circuit. Then, an equivalent resistance expression of the element being tested (EBT) for the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit was analytically derived. Following this, the one-wire VF-NSDE circuit and the two-wire VF-NSDE circuit were evaluated by simulation experiments. Finally, positive features of the proposed method were verified with the experiments of a two-wire VF-NSDE prototype circuit. The experiment {{results show that the}} two-wire VF-NSDE circuit can greatly reduce the crosstalk error caused by the cables in the 2 -D networked resistive sensor array...|$|R
