John was eventually rescued by John Bellesmains, a fellow Englishman and former Archbishop of Lyon.|$|E

Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government <b>inform</b> <b>the</b> Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
