5|$|Diamonds occur {{most often}} as {{euhedral}} or rounded octahedra and twinned octahedra known as macles. As diamond's crystal structure has a cubic {{arrangement of the}} atoms, they have many facets that belong to a cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis hexahedron or disdyakis dodecahedron. The crystals can have rounded off and unexpressive edges and can be elongated. Diamonds (especially those with rounded crystal <b>faces)</b> <b>are</b> commonly found coated in nyf, an opaque gum-like skin.|$|E

5|$|The spores are oval to {{ellipsoid}} in shape, smooth, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 7–11 by 3.5–5μm. The basidia are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 15–24 by 6–7.5μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} tube <b>faces)</b> <b>are</b> irregularly club-shaped, with dimensions of 20–36 by 7–10μm, while cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are club-shaped, rare, occur singly, and measure 18–32 by 7–9μm. Although rare, there are also caulocystidia (occurring on the stem) that are arranged in groups, and which measure individually 24–30 by 6–9μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of T.alboater.|$|E
5|$|The spot-billed pelican has an {{estimated}} population between 13,000 and 18,000 {{and is considered}} to be Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being the eradication of the important Sittaung valley breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites. The chief threats it <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.|$|E

Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site, with several of them found concentrated in the Palangana monument plaza.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to the camera in a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are {{icosahedral}} or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is {{the optimum}} way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The {{minimum number of}} identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers {{or they may be}} composed of different proteins.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate situations to which no ordinary-sized person could make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill <b>faces)</b> <b>are</b> 70–110 by 25–45µm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae {{embedded in a}} gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} duality applies {{as well to}} {{infinite}} graphs embedded in the plane {{as it does to}} finite graphs. However, care is needed to avoid topological complications such as points of the plane that are neither part of an open region disjoint from the graph nor part of an edge or vertex of the graph. When all <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> bounded regions surrounded by a cycle of the graph, an infinite planar graph embedding can also be viewed as a tessellation of the plane, a covering of the plane by closed disks (the tiles of the tessellation) whose interiors (the faces of the embedding) are disjoint open disks. Planar duality gives rise to the notion of a dual tessellation, a tessellation formed by placing a vertex at the center of each tile and connecting the centers of adjacent tiles.|$|E
50|$|In solid geometry, a <b>face</b> <b>is</b> a flat (planar) {{surface that}} forms {{part of the}} {{boundary}} of a solid object; a three-dimensional solid bounded exclusively by flat <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> a polyhedron.|$|R
40|$|Memory for in-group <b>faces</b> {{tends to}} <b>be</b> better than memory for out-group faces. Ackerman et al. (Psychological Science 17 : 836 – 840, 2006) {{found that this}} effect reverses when male faces display anger, {{supposedly}} due to their functional value in signaling intergroup threat. We explored the generalizability of this reverse effect. White participants viewed Black and White male or female faces displaying angry, fearful, or neutral expressions. Recognition accuracy for White male <b>faces</b> <b>was</b> better than for Black male <b>faces</b> when <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> neutral, but this reversed when the faces displayed anger or fear. For female targets, Black <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> generally better recognized than White faces, and female <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better remembered when they displayed anger rather than fear, whereas male <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better remembered when they displayed fear rather than anger. These findings are difficult to reconcile with a functional account and suggest (a) that the processing of male out-group <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> influenced by negative emotional expressions in general; and (b) that gender role expectations lead to differential remembering {{of male and female}} faces as a function of emotional expressio...|$|R

5|$|The {{library is}} a modern looking {{rectangular}} structure with orange brick and clear glass which is adjacent to Glenn Jackson Plaza and Hudson's Bay, with the Mill Race flowing by on the north side. The north and south <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> clear glass, while the other two sides are brick. The exterior walls taper slightly outward on the brick sides of the building. Bricks on these sides were laid horizontally, while the overhanging roof line contains bricks that were laid vertically. A glass-enclosed stairwell and the main entrance near the northwest corner are the only parts that jut out from the primarily rectangular building.|$|E
5|$|The {{north and}} south sides of the {{quadrangle}} have large arched carriage openings beneath shaped gables; the keystones are carved with horse's heads. The walls within the carriageway opening are decorated with bands of blue brick. The east, {{north and south}} <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> all finished with an openwork brick parapet with a stone coping. The west building has twelve arched openings accessed from the courtyard. The main storeys of the quadrangle mainly have three-light, stone-dressed mullion windows, with two-light windows at the attic level. All the roofs have tall octagonal chimneys and feature decorative ridge tiles. The interior of the stables block was rebuilt during the building's conversion to its present use of laboratories and offices.|$|E
5|$|The player {{initially}} must {{enter their}} name into the device, which then displays {{a series of}} past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its numerological equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called Kether and Malchut respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> murky, although it becomes clear they are acting in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{influenced}} by the bone-structure of the skull, and each <b>face</b> <b>is</b> unique through the anatomical variation present in {{the bones of the}} viscerocranium (and neurocranium). The bones involved in shaping the <b>face</b> <b>are</b> mainly the maxilla, mandible, nasal bone and zygomatic bone. Also important are various soft tissues, such as fat, hair and skin (of which color may vary).|$|R
50|$|The west <b>face</b> <b>was</b> first {{climbed in}} 1879 by G. A. Passingham with guides F. Imseng and L. Zurbrücken. Other routes on the <b>face</b> <b>were</b> opened in 1883 and 1889. The easiest passage {{on the east}} <b>face</b> <b>was</b> found in 1890 by G. W. Young, who climbed the spur under the Grand Gendarme with L. and B. Theytaz by a route known as the Younggrat.|$|R
50|$|The top <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{known as}} Ishana or Sadashiva, who is rarely {{depicted}} and governs zenith {{and the sky}} (Akasha). The east <b>face</b> <b>is</b> Sadyojata or Mahadeva, the regent of the earth (Prithvi). The west <b>face</b> <b>is</b> Tatpurusha or Nandi (Shiva's bull mount) or Nandivaktra (the face of Nandi), denoting the wind, Vayu. While Vamadeva or Uma (Parvati, Shiva's consort) or Umavaktra (the face of Parvati) or Tamreshvara (water, Ap) faces north, Aghora or Bhairava looks south (fire, Agni). In some texts, the east <b>face</b> <b>is</b> called Tatpurusha and the western one Sadyojata. The icon of the five aspects represents the entire universe.|$|R
5|$|The spores {{are roughly}} elliptical, or, less commonly, {{somewhat}} spherical, and have dimensions of 7.5–9.5 by 5–7μm. They are thin-walled, inamyloid, {{and have a}} smooth surface. Each features a prominent hilar appendage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells), measuring 32–42 by 6–9μm, are club-shaped and four-spored, with sterigmata up to 7μm long. Cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the gill edges) are abundant, and measure 15–40 by 3–6μm; no pleurocystida (cystidia on the gill <b>faces)</b> <b>are</b> present. The cap cuticle comprises {{a thin layer of}} 3–6μm-wide hyphae that are interwoven either loosely or tightly. All hyphae of O.nidiformis have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (talas) ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon <b>faces)</b> <b>are</b> {{used at the}} top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 {{are the most important}} monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (lintel) with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.|$|E
