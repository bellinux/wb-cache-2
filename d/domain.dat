5|$|The Apple-Cohen dispute was a {{cybersquatting}} {{case where}} a top-level <b>domain</b> registrar's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a <b>domain</b> name to a subsequent registrant (Apple), {{rather than to the}} prior registrant (Cohen). As the decision recounts, in November 2000, Benjamin Cohen of CyberBritain registered the <b>domain</b> name itunes.co.uk. The <b>domain</b> initially pointed to skipmusic.com, and then to cyberbritain.com, and was then inoperative for some time. Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001, and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004. Afterward, Cohen reactivated his registered <b>domain</b> name, redirecting it to iTunes' then-rival, Napster; later Cohen forwarded the <b>domain</b> name to his CyberBritain's cash back/rewards website.|$|E
