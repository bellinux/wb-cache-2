40|$|The use of optimal {{orthogonal}} array latin hypercube <b>designs</b> is proposed. Orthogonal arrays were {{proposed for}} constructing latin hypercube <b>designs</b> by Tang (1993). Such <b>designs</b> generally have better space filling properties than random latin hypercube <b>designs.</b> Even so, these <b>designs</b> {{do not necessarily}} fill the space particularly well. As a result, we consider orthogonal-array-based latin hypercube <b>designs</b> that try to achieve optimality in some sense. Optimization is performed by adapting strategies found in Morris & Mitchell (1995) and Ye et al. (2000). The strategies here search only orthogonal-array-based latin hypercube <b>designs</b> and, as a result, optimal <b>designs</b> are found in a more efficient fashion. The <b>designs</b> found are in general agreement with existing optimal <b>designs</b> reported elsewhere. ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Design</b> {{management}} {{has taken a}} more strategic role within business since 2000, and more academic programs for <b>design</b> management have been established. <b>Design</b> {{management has}} been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the European Union as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations. The main issues and debates included the topics of <b>design</b> thinking, strategic <b>design</b> management, <b>design</b> leadership, and product service systems. <b>Design</b> management {{was influenced by the}} following <b>design</b> trends: sustainable <b>design,</b> inclusive <b>design,</b> interactive <b>design,</b> <b>design</b> probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and <b>design</b> thinking.|$|E
5|$|<b>Design</b> {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of <b>design</b> leadership; however, <b>design</b> management and <b>design</b> leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. <b>Design</b> leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, <b>design</b> management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. <b>Design</b> management requires <b>design</b> leadership to know where to go and <b>design</b> leadership requires <b>design</b> management to know how to get there.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties {{arise in}} tracing {{the history of}} <b>design</b> {{management}}. Even though <b>design</b> management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created {{the context in which}} the expression could arise.
