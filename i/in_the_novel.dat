5|$|In Apur Panchali (the Bengali {{translation}} of , 1994), Ray {{wrote that he}} had omitted many of the novel's characters {{and that he had}} rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema.

Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not the end of the novel.|$|E

5|$|A certain {{detail that}} comes up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> is whether we are limited to certain realities, such as 2+2=4, a theme that also comes up in Yevgeny Zamyatin's We and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.

5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny {{in a number}} of characters.

While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Boyd spent 30 months {{writing the}} novel. The journal style, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, {{reinforces}} {{the theme of}} the changing self <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> Many plot points simply fade away.

5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{fascination with the}} novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), and a new edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977. The last few decades have however seen a resurgence of critical interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E

5|$|Fleming {{subsequently}} {{requested that}} there should be no reprints or paperback version of the book, and for the British market no paperback version appeared until after Fleming's death.

In the US the story was also published in Stag magazine, with the title changed to Motel Nymph.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 {{to cover}} an Interpol conference for The Sunday Times {{was a source}} of much of the {{background}} information in the story.
