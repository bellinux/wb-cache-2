40|$|Abstract. Since positive-displacement dry {{vacuum pumps}} were first {{launched}} into {{the semiconductor industry}} in 1984, issues concerning about characteristics evaluation on consistent bases have been continuously arisen from the mass production lines. The non-destructive, in-situ purposed characteristics evaluation system for dry vacuum pumps has been established collaborating with a semi-conductor manufacturer and branch <b>dry</b> <b>pump</b> manufacturers in Korea. The evaluation method exploits the constant volume flow meter to measure the mass flow rate in standards level, and facilitates the evaluation of spatially averaged sound power levels using a semi-anechoic chamber. New and overhauled roots and claw type pumps have been evaluated in terms of ultimate pressure, pumping speed, vibration, and sound power. The correlation analyzed among those results shows clear signs of pump degradation related each other. Recent results are applicable to the semi-conductor process line to warn early symptoms of pump degradation and malfunction...|$|E
40|$|Laser optics {{being used}} in space laser systems are usually exposed to high vacuum {{conditions}} under the absence of air or oxygen. In the past, several space-based laser missions have suffered from anomalous performance loss or even failure after short operation times. To mitigate the risks involved in these long-term operational conditions, a laser damage test bench has been developed and is operated at the German Aerospace Establishment to test laser optics in the IR, VIS, and in the UV spectral range. The testing is performed under application oriented conditions, i. e. under high-vacuum using <b>dry</b> <b>pump</b> systems. The main goal of the test campaign is to identify the critical components {{in terms of their}} laser damage threshold for very high pulse numbers applied per site. Characteristic damage curves according to ISO 11 254 are evaluated for each component under investigation for up to 10 000 shots per site. The characteristic damage curves are used for the estimation of the performance at very high pulse numbers. The typical behavior found was a sharp drop in LIDT for small pulse numbers followed by a smooth decrease for larger pulse numbers (laser fatigue effect). ...|$|E

Back-gated multi-layered MoTe 2 transistors are fabricated as follows. First, source, drain, and gate electrodes are patterned on 300 -nm SiO 2 /p+-Si substrate using standard UV photolithography techniques, followed by selective etching of 300 -nm SiO 2 beneath the gate electrode and E-beam evaporation of a 5 -nm/ 100 -nm Cr/Au film. Second, multi-layered MoTe 2 samples are prepared on other 300 -nm SiO 2 /p+-Si by mechanical exfoliation of millimeter-size semiconducting 2 H-MoTe 2 single crystals, which are grown by chemical vapor transport using TeCl 4 as the transport agent in a temperature gradient of 750 to 700 °C for 3  days. Finally, the prepared multi-layered MoTe 2 samples are transferred onto patterned source-drain electrode using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as medium [50]. PVA is dissolved in H 2 O and rinsed with isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Device annealing is carried out in a chemical vapor deposition setup with <b>dry</b> <b>pump.</b> Multi-layered MoTe 2 samples are identified by an optical microscope, and the corresponding thickness is characterized using SPA- 300 HV atomic force microscopy (AFM).

The steam ejector system has a capacity to generate a medium vacuum 101 kPa (1 atm) a 0, 1 Pa (0, 01 mbar), the liquid ring pumps only reach 3 kPa (30 mbar) and dried pump cover the range of 101 kPa (1 atm) até 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar), band required for use in secondary metallurgy and is the limit of this technology. In this work was realized {{a case study in}} the industrial sector that uses the vacuum generation through steam ejectors superheated at 250 ° C and 1, 2 MPa (12 kgf/cm 2). The vacuum is needed for removal of undesirable gases in the composition of the steel as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur which causes weakness in the crystalline structure. Currently there have been technological innovations for vacuum generation in applications in VD (vacuum degassing), vacuums until to 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar) and VOD (decarburization) for vacuums of 8 - 20 kPa (80 - 200 mbar). One of these innovations is mechanical pumps dried formed by three-stage vacuum, joining various technologies, the first and second rotor roots and the third screw rotor.

40|$|The PETRA {{storage ring}} at DESY will be {{upgraded}} {{to a third}} generation synchrotron radiation source with 15 beamlines in the PETRA III project [1]. Mobile pumping stations will be needed for the initial pump down of the beamlines and beamline components to a hydrocarbon-free and particle-free ultra-high vacuum [2]. They will be placed at the disposal for users to pump down and bake their experimental chambers and for leak detection.

40|$|Quasi {{steady state}} {{rotating}} machines are machines usually designed {{to run at}} fixed load and speed. A good {{example of such a}} system is a <b>dry</b> vacuum <b>pump.</b> <b>Dry</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> appeared in the mid- 1980 s in order to address problems caused by conventional fluid-sealed pumps and revolutionised many industries such as the semiconductor manufacturing industry. They dominate the market today providing enhancements to reliability, cleanliness and running costs. However, their working environment is often harsh, sometimes resulting in catastrophic faults. Continuously monitoring the state of the system and scheduling maintenance as appropriate is thus desirable. Sliding mode techniques have been widely used in condition monitoring and fault detection schemes in recent years. Their main advantage is a fundamental robustness against certain kinds of parameter variations. They also enable faults and/or values of unmeasurable system parameters to be reconstructed. The principal aim of this thesis is to apply sliding mode techniques {{in order to reduce the}} occurrence of unplanned pump stoppages, by monitoring appropriate subsystems and parameters, for the onset of cooling system failure, bearing failure and exhaust blockage. This is achieved using the concept of the equivalent injection signal that is necessary to maintain a sliding motion. Experimental test results acquired from the <b>dry</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> test-bed illustrate the usefulness of the approach for condition monitoring. Further, the method is cost effective since it requires only low cost temperature transducers and an exhaust pressure sensor that is already part of the typical sensor package for some pump processes. The thesis concludes with ideas and recommendations regarding possible future work, including the application of fault classification techniques and the development of processes for generating an efficient and implementable code, suitable for the vacuum pumps' embedded control systems.

40|$|Drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{necessary}} process and technology in today?s world and it is used, among other things, for food processing. The basic goal is to process the food for consumption by increasing its shelf life, and in order to achieve this moisture must be removed from raw material as moisture, which is the main promoter of biological activity and spoilage of the fresh products. Conventional drying is known for its high energy consumption and therefore it is costly. The conventional drying has also a negative impact on the environment and climate, providing the basis for heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> development to ensure sustainable practice within the food industry. Heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> is a relatively new technology developed at NTNU. It unifies the <b>drying</b> and heat <b>pump</b> cycles in which the heat pump is used to recycle energy, for reheat the air during drying the raw material. By recycling the heat from the dryer exhaust, energy is saved and the total energy input to the system is drastically reduced. In this master thesis a laboratory heat pump dryer is applied for drying green peas. The drying air was set on temperature regimes of 45 &# 176;C, 35 &# 176;C and 15 &# 176;C with three levels of relative humidity: 60 %, 40 % and 20 %, from which temperature regime of 45 &# 176;C was set on 40 % and 20 %. Therefore, eight drying tests were performed and each test was done in period of three hours. The drying of green peas was conducted in fluidized bed mode. The results have shown that higher temperatures increase the rate of moisture removal from the green peas. Difference in relative humidity of the drying air also plays an important role in the process although the effect is much less compared to the temperature. The tests performed on heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> of green peas provided the experimental data used for modeling and analysis of mass effective diffusivity, moisture content and ratio. The kinetics for all experiments on heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> of green peas were successfully modeled based on the solution of the transient and three-dimensional general equation. Analysis and discussion were also done on the influence that these factors have on color, water activity, bulk and particle density, as well as particle size. Overall the project has shown that heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> has many advantages in producing a satisfactory quality dried green peas, economy and sustainability. Therefore is justifiable to continue further studies and development of heat <b>pump</b> <b>drying</b> technology. </p...|$|R
