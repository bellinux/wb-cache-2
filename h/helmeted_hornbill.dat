60|$|In Ornithology {{there is}} a little {{uncertainty}} owing to the birds of Java and Sumatra being much better known than those of Borneo; but the ancient separation of Java as an island is well exhibited by the large number of its species which are not found in any of the other islands. It possesses no less than seven pigeons peculiar to itself, while Sumatra has only one. Of its two parrots one extends into Borneo, but neither into Sumatra. Of the fifteen species of woodpeckers inhabiting Sumatra only four reach Java, while eight of them are found in Borneo and twelve in the Malay peninsula. The two Trogons found in Java are peculiar to it, while of those inhabiting Sumatra at least two extend to Malacca and one to Borneo. There are {{a very large number of}} birds, such as the great Argus pheasant, the fire-backed and ocellated pheasants, the crested partridge (Rollulus coronatus), the small Malacca parrot (Psittinus incertus), the great <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Buceroturus galeatus), the pheasant ground-cuckoo (Carpococcyx radiatus), the rose-crested bee-eater (Nyctiornis amicta), the great gaper (Corydon sumatranus), and the green-crested gaper (Calyptomena viridis), and many others, which are common to Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo, but are entirely absent from Java. On the other hand we have the peacock, the green jungle cock, two blue ground thrushes (Arrenga cyanea and Myophonus flavirostris), the fine pink-headed dove (Ptilonopus porphyreus), three broad-tailed ground pigeons (Macropygia), and many other interesting birds, which are found nowhere in the Archipelago out of Java.|$|E

50|$|This {{species has}} a bare, {{wrinkled}} throat patch, pale blue to greenish in females and red in males. The casque goes {{from the base}} of the bill halfway to the tip, where it ends abruptly. It and the bill are yellow; the red secretion of the preen gland covers the sides and top of the casque and the base of the bill, but often leaves the front end of the casque and the distal half of the bill yellow. Unlike other <b>hornbills,</b> the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill's</b> casque is solid, and the skull including the casque and bill may constitute 10 percent of the bird's weight.|$|R
5000|$|Native {{peoples in}} the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill's</b> range, such as the Kenyah and Kelabit, have long carved the casques. In Malaysia, hornbill-ivory rings were said to change colour when near {{poisonous}} food. [...] The Chinese encountered the material in the 14th century and it soon became an important trade item at Brunei. According to Tom Harrisson, writing in the first (1960) edition of The Birds of Borneo:It {{is likely that the}} casques were mainly exported raw, and worked with a heat treatment and pressing - of which no detailed description survives - in China, to preserve and heighten the lovely deep golden and surface red patina of the fresh ivory. The Chinese probably got the idea of using ho-ting from the Dayaks, then improved the technique at their end. The uses of hornbill casques in Borneo are various and frequently effective; we will discuss those presently. While the Borneo usages persist to this day, all trace of the art of the Chinese carver seems to have vanished. Very little has survived of a remarkable craft which undoubtedly paid for many of the old jars, plates, and beads still decorating the longhouses or wives of better-off Bornean pagans many generations later.|$|R
40|$|December {{is always}} a time of rains in Belum-Temengor which makes {{fieldwork}} rather unpredictable (and very short mostly) but it also provides the MNS team with a brief respite before we enter an important period in a hornbill’s life come January – their breeding season. Despite generally being a wet month, some hornbills have already started to scout around for new nest holes or revisit previous ones. An early hornbill gets the hole perhaps? The success of 2013 breeding season provided us with much encouragement and hope but results {{in the first three}} months of 2014 proved slow. Thankfully, from April onwards, the situation improved and we successfully located more in Royal Belum and Temengor. The 2014 breeding season was also exciting as we field tested the HD improvised recording device – now named HB-IRD – which gave us some amazing insights into the secretive world of the nesting Bushy-crested and Black Hornbills. There was another reason to rejoice in January. While surveying hornbills in Temengor, we encounter a little known and rarely seen social behaviour of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Hornbills</b> – casque-butting – on two occasions. True to its description by other witnesses in Thailand and/or Indonesia, the collision between the casques (or helmet...|$|R

50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Rhinoplax vigil) is a {{very large}} bird in the hornbill family. It is found on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. The casque (helmetlike structure on the head) accounts for some 11% of its 3 kg weight. Unlike any other hornbill, the casque is almost solid, and is used in head-to-head combat among males. It is a belief among the Punan Bah that a large <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> guards the river between life and death.|$|E

50|$|After ongoing hunting {{pressure}} and habitat loss, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> was uplisted from near threatened to critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2015. It {{is listed in}} Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
50|$|Khao Phanom Bencha {{is home to}} over 200 {{bird species}} and is a {{significant}} bird-spotting area. Species include white-crowned and <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill,</b> white-rumped shama and argus pheasant. An extremely rare bird here is the endangered Gurney's pitta.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> became rare {{because it was}} {{slaughtered}} for its casque. Now legal trade in hornbill ivory is limited to certified antiques, and hornbill-ivory carvings are more valuable than those of any true ivory.|$|E
50|$|Eight {{species of}} {{hornbill}} have been spotted in Mulu including the rhinoceros hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros) which is featured on Sarawak's state emblem, the white-crowned hornbill (Berenicornis/Aceros comatus) and the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Buceros vigil) with its large solid casque (an enlargement on the bill).|$|E
50|$|Most species' casques {{are very}} light, {{containing}} much airspace. However, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> {{has a solid}} casque made of a material called hornbill ivory, which is greatly valued as a carving material in China and Japan.

50|$|A 1998 {{expedition}} {{by members}} of the Miri branch of the Malaysian Nature Society recorded 67 species of bird, including <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill,</b> and 20 species of mammal, including Bornean gibbon and sun bear, in the forest that surrounds Batu Lawi, but the only birds recorded from the summit of Batu Lawi itself were ochraceous bulbul and mountain blackeye. In 1946, Tom Harrisson saw a peregrine falcon on the male peak.|$|E
50|$|Belum Temenggor {{is home to}} over 300 avian species. It is {{the only}} {{existing}} forest where all 10 species of hornbill that inhabit Malaysia are found, namely the white-crowned hornbill, bushy-crested hornbill, wrinkled hornbill, wreathed hornbill, plain-pouched hornbill, black hornbill, Oriental pied hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, great hornbill and <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill.</b> In the forest {{you can also find}} 3,000 species of flowering plants, including 3 species of Rafflesia, the world's largest flower.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{hornbill}} {{species have}} [...] "casques", decorative growths {{on the upper}} mandible of the bill. In most, the casque has a spongy structure, but in the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> it is solid keratin. This material, hornbill ivory, has a texture suggesting ivory but is softer. As it grows it is golden yellow, but the bird rubs its casque on its preen gland, whose oily secretion tints {{the surface of the}} casque bright red.|$|E
5000|$|... {{hornbill}} ivory: of {{the many}} species of hornbill, only the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> (Buceros vigil or Rhinoplax vigil) furnishes an ivory-like substance. This is a dense, carvable substance that makes up the solid casque growing above the upper mandible (from the bird's forehead). It is not ivory, horn, or bone, yet it has been called ivory for many centuries. It is softer than real ivory and is a creamy yellow in color, becoming red {{at the top and}} sides.|$|E
5000|$|Peat swamp forests {{occupy the}} entire {{coastline}} of Borneo. The {{soil of the}} peat swamp are comparatively infertile, while it {{is known to be}} the home of various bird species such as the hook-billed bulbul, <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> and rhinoceros hornbill. There are about 15,000 species of flowering plants with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are dipterocarps), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo. There are about 440 freshwater fish species in Borneo (about the same as Sumatra and Java combined). In 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) stated that 123 species have been discovered in Borneo since the [...] "Heart of Borneo" [...] agreement was signed in 2007.|$|E

Over 300 species of orchids can be seen within the park. Khao Luang is the only place in the world where some of these can be found. There are no fewer than 327 species of animals living in Khao Luang, some of these include; Malayan tapir (only seen if you are very lucky), Sumatran serow, pig-tailed macaque, Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine, clouded leopard, barking deer, sambar deer, binturong, panther, tiger, wild pig, banded langur and spectacled langur. Bird species include black eagle, red junglefowl, great argus pheasant, crested fireback pheasant, white-crowned hornbill, bushy-crested hornbill, great pied hornbill, <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill,</b> red-crowned barbet and sunbirds.|$|E
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} hornbills is the heavy bill, supported by powerful neck muscles {{as well as by}} the fused vertebrae. The large bill assists in fighting, preening, constructing the nest, and catching prey. A feature unique to the hornbills is the casque, a hollow structure that runs along the upper mandible. In some species it is barely perceptible and appears to serve no function beyond reinforcing the bill. In other species it is quite large, is reinforced with bone, and has openings between the hollow centre, allowing it to serve as a resonator for calls. In the <b>helmeted</b> <b>hornbill</b> the casque is not hollow but is filled with hornbill ivory and is used as a battering ram in dramatic aerial jousts. Aerial casque-butting has also been reported in the great hornbill.The plumage of hornbills is typically black, grey, white, or brown, and is frequently offset by bright colours on the bill, or by patches of bare coloured skin on the face or wattles. Some species exhibit sexual dichromatism; in the Abyssinian ground hornbill, for example, pure blue skin on the face and throat denotes an adult female, and red and blue skin denotes an adult male. The calls of hornbills are loud and vary distinctly between different species.Hornbills possess binocular vision, although unlike most birds with this type of vision, the bill intrudes on their visual field. This allows them to see their own bill tip and aids in precision handling of food objects with their bill. The eyes are also protected by large eyelashes which act as a sunshade.|$|E
40|$|Hornbills {{provide a}} seed {{dispersal}} service for rainforest trees, but {{the persistence of}} hornbill populations depends {{on the availability of}} old trees that provide cavities for their nests. The <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Hornbill</b> Rhinoplax vigil is Critically Endangered, due to both forest destruction and an inhumane illegal trade in their bill casques, yet little is known about its nests and breeding biology. Here we describe the nest tree and external nest characteristics of a pair of Helmeted Hornbills in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Lampung, Sumatra, and compare them with observations of two nests of the Wreathed Hornbill Rhyticeros undulatus less than 1 km away. As in a previous study, the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Hornbill</b> (HH) nest was in a large dipterocarp, and possessed a stump next to the entrance that the male used as a perch when feeding the female or chick. The nest entrance dimensions and bole diameter of the nest tree were much larger than those of the two Wreathed Hornbill (W 1 and W 2) nests. Egg laying in HH took place in February, while in W 1 and W 2, eggs were laid much later, between late May and July. The maximum nesting cycle of the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Hornbill</b> was an astonishing 137 days (4. 5 months), close to the minimum period (range, 138 - 151) for a nest of the species in Peninsular Malaysia. This may be longer than the nesting cycle of the Wreathed Hornbill, but additional data are needed...|$|E
