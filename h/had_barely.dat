5|$|In 1908 Prus serialized, in the Warsaw Tygodnik Ilustrowany (Illustrated Weekly), {{his novel}} Dzieci (Children), {{depicting}} the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists {{of the day}} — an uncharacteristically humorless work. Three years later a final novel, Przemiany (Changes), was to have been, like The Doll, a panorama of society and its vital concerns. However, in 1911-12 the novel <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> begun serialization in the Illustrated Weekly when its composition was cut short by Prus' death.|$|E
5|$|Travers was {{replaced}} by former Yeovil Town manager Dave Halliday, {{one of more than}} a hundred applicants for the role, and the club moved from their black and gold strip to red and white. Halliday <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> begun his work when World War II halted competitive football in the United Kingdom. For these six years, the club was temporarily taken over by then-directors Charles B Forbes and George Anderson while Halliday served in the war.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E

5|$|Promoted {{to flight}} lieutenant, Hannah was posted to Britain in July 1939 to {{undertake}} a Royal Air Force armaments training course, which he <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> begun when war was declared on 3September. He completed the course, and returned to Australia in March 1940. After brief postings to No.1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Station Headquarters Laverton, {{he was assigned to}} Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne, in May. He was made an acting squadron leader in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the next year. In April 1942, Hannah was promoted to temporary wing commander. He undertook a general reconnaissance course the following May.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{creation}} following the 1930 census, the 12th district had been represented by Democrats. The 12th stretched from {{just south of}} Pasadena to the Orange and San Bernardino county lines, encompassing such small towns as Whittier, Pomona and Covina. The area has since been entirely absorbed into the Los Angeles megalopolis, {{but at the time}} it was principally agricultural. The freeway system <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> touched the 12th district; only a small segment of the Pasadena Freeway cut across its northwest corner.|$|E
5|$|When the October journées took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> begun. The revolution's {{capacity}} for violence was as yet not fully realized. The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned with the issue of food: most workers spent nearly half their income on bread. In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.|$|E

5|$|Colbeck {{was born}} in Bradford and {{attended}} Pudsey Tyersal School. Bradford City youth team coach Jon Pepper {{brought him to the}} club in 2002, and having rising through the junior ranks at City, Colbeck <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> featured for the reserves when he made his senior debut in a League Cup defeat to Notts County on 25 August 2004 at Valley Parade. It was his only first-team game during the season. It was another 17months before his next appearance for City when he was a late substitute on 7 January 2006 in a 1–0 defeat to Chesterfield. Colbeck broke into the team on a more regular basis and made 11appearances, including five starts, during {{the latter half of the}} 2005–06 season, and was one of six junior players to earn a one-year contract at the League One club.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November, {{the ship}} sailed for the UK {{to begin a}} lengthy refit at Devonport that lasted until 31 March 1945. She was {{assigned}} to the 8th Destroyer Flotilla in the Western Approaches Command, but <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> finished working up when the war ended in May. The ship transported emergency supplies to Belgium and the Netherlands immediately afterwards. At the end of 1945, Garland took part in Operation Deadlight, the scuttling of captured German U-boats. In early 1946, the ship patrolled Norwegian waters and then {{was assigned to the}} Polish Squadron at Rosyth through June. In late July she was ordered to be paid off and the loan terminated. The ship was disarmed in late August before entering Category C reserve.|$|E
5|$|On May 5, the SPC {{issued a}} high risk of severe weather for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for severe weather extended for areas far beyond. The low pressure system in place moved northward, but the extending front <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> moved. The storms were quick to develop. Severe weather reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, Japanese {{air forces}} {{attempted}} a reprisal against Task Force 38, but poor weather conditions complicated {{their search for}} the U.S. fleet. Only approximately 25 bombers {{made it to the}} vicinity of Task Group 38.2. VF-18's Combat Air Patrol (CAP), which had been flying above the task group continuously for almost two hours, was vectored to intercept these bombers just outside the task group's picket. They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships. Harris exploded one midair then raked a second, sending it crashing into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Sagan {{revealed}} {{that he had been}} told on the radio that he had to ride hard {{to stay away from the}} chasing group, but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway. Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E
5|$|The 192nd Regiment's {{movement}} {{to occupy the}} Akritas–Tavoulari area was much delayed, so on 03:00, the 19th Reconnaissance Group was ordered to move forward and occupy it instead, as the Greek front was threatened by the advance of the 2nd Panzer Division. In addition, 193rd Regiment was ordered to dispatch two of its infantry companies to the area. These units <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> arrived at Akritas and occupied the Oveliskos height, when the German forces appeared at 06:00 {{in the form of}} two armoured columns with aerial support. The German attack forced the elements of 193rd Regiment to abandon the height and withdraw south towards Akritas, where the 19th Reconnaissance Group had begun arriving. The 19th Reconnaissance Group commander sent a company to reinforce 193rd Regiment and deployed his troops covering Akritas village from the north, aiming to counterattack as soon as 192nd Regiment arrived to take over the position.|$|E

5|$|The Aéronautique Militaire Belge (Belgian Air Force - AéMI) <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> {{begun to}} modernise their {{aircraft}} technology. The AéMI had ordered Brewster Buffalo, Fiat CR.42, and Hawker Hurricane fighters, Koolhoven F.K.56 trainers, Fairey Battle and Caproni Ca.312 light bombers, and Caproni Ca.335 fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, {{but only the}} Fiats, Hurricanes, and Battles had been delivered. The shortage of modern types meant single-seat versions of the Fairey Fox light bomber were being used as fighters. The AéMI possessed 250 combat aircraft. At least 90 were fighters, 12 were bombers and 12 were reconnaissance aircraft. Only 50 were of reasonably modern standard. When liaison and transport aircraft from all services are included, the total strength was 377; however only 118 of these were serviceable on 10 May 1940. Of this number around 78 were fighters and 40 were bombers.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch, {{concerned}} about Amir's nationalistic tendencies, convinced the Sultan {{to send him}} back to Langkat, an order which the fledgling poet was unable to refuse. In 1937, Amir, together {{with two of the}} Sultan's vassals tasked with escorting him, boarded the Opten Noort from Tanjung Priok and returned to Sumatra. Upon arriving in Langkat, he was informed that he was to be married to the Sultan's eldest daughter, Tengku Puteri Kamiliah, a woman he <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> met. Before the wedding Amir returned to Batavia to face his final exam– and have one last meeting with Sundari. Several weeks later he returned to Langkat, where he and Kamiliah were married in an extravagant ceremony. His cousin, Tengku Burhan, later stated that Amir's indifference throughout the seven-day event was due to his thinking of Sundari.|$|E
5|$|The army {{left for}} Tacuarí, being closely watched by the {{combined}} armies of Yegros and Cabañas. Those two armies had nearly three thousand soldiers, while Belgrano <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> four hundred. They were attacked from many sides during the Battle of Tacuarí, on 9 March. Greatly outnumbered and losing an unequal fight, Belgrano refused to surrender. He reorganised the remaining 235 men and ordered his secretary to burn all his documents and personal papers {{to prevent them}} from falling into enemy hands. Belgrano arranged for the troops and artillery to fire for many minutes, which made the Paraguayan soldiers disperse. When the barrage stopped, Belgrano requested an armistice, telling Cabañas that he had arrived to Paraguay to aid and not to conquer; considering the open hostility with which he was met, he would leave the province. Cabañas accepted, {{on the grounds that the}} remaining group must leave the province within a day.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} laid down on 5 May 1862 at the Royal Dockyard in Deptford, England, as the 17-gun sloop Circassian. She was renamed Enterprise in July 1862 and {{reclassified}} as an armoured corvette. Construction <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> begun {{before she was}} redesigned with an iron upper hull as well as armoured sides and battery. The ship was launched on 9 February 1864, commissioned on 5 May 1864 and completed on 3 June 1864. She cost £62,474 to build. Enterprise initially served with the Channel Fleet, but {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean Fleet where she remained until 1871 when she returned to England. She was refitted and rearmed at Malta in 1868. Upon her return the ship was paid off into 4th Class Reserve in August 1871 at Sheerness. Enterprise was sold for scrap in 1885 for £2,072.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Rommel {{received}} a promotion from Hitler {{to the rank}} of Generalmajor ahead of more senior officers. Showalter notes that even at this early stage, Hitler already regarded Rommel {{as a model for the}} fusion of Germany's new and old orders. With an intervention by Hitler, Rommel was subsequently able to obtain command of an armoured (Panzer) division despite having been turned down by the army's personnel office, which had offered him command of a mountain division. Rommel's unprofessional conduct was noted by his fellow officers and added to his growing reputation as one of Hitler's favoured commanders. After the Fall of France, Rommel sent to him a specially prepared diary on the 7th Division, Rommel {{received a}} letter of thanks. Unknown to Rommel though, Hitler <b>had</b> <b>barely</b> looked at his diary and the letter was written by an adjutant. Remy remarks that by this time, Hitler still did not treat Rommel as a significantly important person.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{chose the}} {{relatively}} well-rested commands of D. H.

Meanwhile, James Longstreet's First Corps and A. P. Hill's Light Division, who had fought {{the majority of the}} previous day's hostilities, would be held in reserve. According to Lee's plan, the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi-circle enveloping Malvern Hill. D. H. Hill's five brigades would be placed along the northern face of the hill, forming the center of the Confederate line, and the commands of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, respectively. Whiting's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell nearby. The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary. Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank.|$|E
