25|$|The Thai Lisu {{traditional}} costume {{shown here}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{from the main}} Lisu traditional costume being widely used in Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China and Putao, Danai, Myitkyina, Northern Myanmar.|$|E
25|$|Successful {{training}} of owls <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the {{training of}} hawks and falcons, as they are hearing- rather than sight-oriented (owls can only see black and white, and are long-sighted). This often leads falconers {{to believe that they}} are less intelligent, as they are distracted easily by new or unnatural noises and they do not respond as readily to food cues. However, if trained successfully, owls show intelligence on the same level as that of hawks and falcons.|$|E

25|$|The third bridge <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{from its}} two predecessors. It is a {{pre-stressed}} concrete structure {{with a central}} span of 160 metres and two side spans of 100 metres (including the approaches, it is a total of 897 metres long and 15.8 metres wide). It can carry abnormal loads of up to 400 tonnes, and has a life expectancy of 120 years. It was constructed by Edmund Nuttall Ltd to a design by Mott, Hay and Anderson's young engineer, Alan Yiu Lun Wan.|$|E
25|$|As a {{primitive}} of the theory, {{the status of}} these functions <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than in some constituency grammars. Traditionally, constituency grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject {{the existence of a}} finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas constituency grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.|$|E
500|$|The core of {{the site}} covers about [...] and {{includes}} remains of some 70 monumental structures positioned around a dozen plazas. Takalik Abaj has 2 ballcourts and over 239 known stone monuments, including impressive stelae and altars. The granite used to make monuments in Olmec and early Maya styles <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the soft limestone used in the Petén cities. The site is also noted for its hydraulic systems, including a temazcal or sauna bath with a subterranean drainage, and Preclassic tombs found in excavations from the late 1990s onwards by Drs. Marion Popenoe de Hatch, Christa Schieber de Lavarreda and Miguel Orrego, from the Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes.|$|E

50|$|Phrase {{structure}} grammars view both finite and nonfinite verb phrases as constituent phrases and, consequently, do {{not draw}} any key distinction between them. Dependency grammars (described below) <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> in this regard.|$|R
500|$|Like BuddyTVs Don Williams, {{fans were}} very wary at first of {{bringing}} in female characters to the male-dominated show. To make matters worse, Kripke wrote a lackluster scene intended {{solely for the}} audition process. Fans quickly came across it on casting sites, and developed {{the feeling that the}} character [...] "really [...] ". However, Kripke believed that fans would change their minds about Ruby after learning that she was a demon. By the middle of the third season, Kripke felt enough fans were [...] "responding positively to vindicate the character", and that most were [...] "finally embracing her" [...] by the third season finale, with Cassidy's version of Ruby even being dubbed a [...] "fan favorite" [...] later on. When the character returns in the fourth season, she <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than her third season counterpart. Cortese felt that while the drastic change made fans angry, the flashbacks provided in [...] "I Know What You Did Last Summer" [...] shed some light on Ruby's new mindset and made fans more accepting of the character. However, the overall criticisms towards Cortese's performance made her reluctant to return for an episode in the sixth season, although she eventually accepted when she learned she would be portraying herself.|$|E
500|$|In a {{typically}} rowdy and disorderly public meeting, {{the citizens of}} Pawnee demand the fence be removed. Leslie meets with Lindsay, who condescendingly refuses to remove the fence and insults Pawnee in the process. Leslie, Tom and Ben (Adam Scott) attend an Eagleton town meeting to plead their case to its citizens. The Eagleton meeting <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than those of Pawnee: it is a catered affair at a country club, where the citizens are wealthy and civil, but also snobbish and condescending. [...] Citing the poor maintenance of Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park, the Eagleton citizens prefer the fence stay up. Leslie reveals to Tom and Ben that she was offered the job of Eagleton parks director five years ago but turned it down, as she and Lindsay both {{made a promise to}} remain in Pawnee. [...] However, Eagleton then offered Lindsay the job and she accepted, thus turning her back on Pawnee and Leslie. Meanwhile, Ron becomes increasingly paranoid of Leslie's birthday plans, especially after he overhears April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) discuss outrageous party plans. When Ron asks Ann (Rashida Jones) about Leslie's last birthday bash for Ann and learns what a huge party she threw, Ron eventually becomes so paranoid that he resorts to sleeping in his office to avoid any potential surprises at home.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of {{societal}} mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The SMS feature spawned the [...] "texting" [...] sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer Instant Messenger services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g. NTT DoCoMo's i-mode), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.|$|E
50|$|The efferent arterioles of the juxtamedullary glomeruli <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>different.</b> They do break up, {{but they}} form bundles of vessels (arteriolae recti) that cross the outer {{zone of the}} medulla to perfuse the inner zone.|$|R
50|$|The {{gameplay}} on BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle will <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{from previous}} BlazBlue entries. Cross Tag Battle will feature 2v2 battles and tag-ins similar to Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite and Tekken Tag Tournament 2.|$|R
50|$|The music <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than Bannon's band Converge, {{having more}} in common with {{influences}} Swans, Bauhaus, and others. The lyrical content is built around the rise of technology and the death of the individual.|$|R
2500|$|Grande has a four octave soprano vocal range, and {{the whistle}} register. With {{the release of}} Yours Truly, Grande was deemed the [...] "mini Mariah Carey" [...] and the [...] "new Mariah Carey" [...] by some critics because of her wide vocal range, sound and musical material. Speaking about the comparisons, Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Billboard wrote that both Carey and Grande have [...] "the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the {{similarities}} end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant." [...] Grande responded to the comparisons, [...] "t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than mine." [...] Steven J. Horowitz of Billboard wrote in 2014, [...] "With her sophomore album, the [...] "Problem" [...] singer no longer resembles [...] – and that's okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|After an {{increase}} in public opposition to the proposed artwork in September 2010, an additional meeting was organized on October 19 at the Madame Walker Theatre. It {{was at this point}} that the discussion became more controversial in nature and began to attract attention from arts critics on a national level. Wilson explained that promoting discourse in a large city like Indianapolis <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than in a museum, which is a more finite environment. In earlier community talks in 2009 and early 2010, Wilson and the CICF had had little success in creating an ongoing dialogue. It wasn't until the discussion around the artwork took a more controversial turn that a larger portion of the city began to take notice. Wilson explained, [...] "With a city, you realize—or I have come to realize—that as many groups as you speak to there are other groups. You can't ever reach everyone. So I’m just really thrilled that there’s engagement and talk about art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick {{is accused}} of having {{produced}} much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed , which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects. It has been claimed that when 2001 was in post-production in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as [...] "live from the Moon." [...] No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, 2001 was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick's depiction of the Moon's surface <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from its appearance in Apollo video, film, and photography. Kubrick did hire Frederick Ordway and Harry Lange, both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, {{to work with him}} on 2001. Kubrick also used some 50mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by Zeiss for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for Barry Lyndon (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.|$|E

50|$|Dural's origins <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{here than}} in the game versions; it had been created by {{robotics}} scientist Eva Durix through {{the backing of the}} Koenkan and later, the Rafale Corporation after Eva had a fallout with the Koenkan.|$|R
50|$|The Sebei of Sudan are an unreached people group. There <b>is</b> not <b>much</b> {{that there}} <b>is</b> {{to learn about}} them, as {{they have not been}} largely contacted.

50|$|Adult {{programs}} {{differ from}} child programs because adults typically have a later onset of significant hearing loss; they have acquired a worldly knowledge, and have experienced normal speech/language development. Consequently, treatment and therapy strategies <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{compared with a}} child.|$|R
30|$|When a {{polymer matrix}} {{is mixed with}} {{inorganic}} nanoparticles, the thermal (Garcia et al. 2009), mechanical (Uhl et al. 2002), optical, electrical, magnetic and flammability properties of such a nanocomposite <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the polymer matrix itself Manzi-Nshuti et al. (2009).|$|R
50|$|Though the Second Revolution was a {{step forward}} to a Socialist Bangladesh with {{formidable}} economic and administrative reforms, it <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> than the other socialist revolutions of the contemporary world. It was aimed at achieving some reformist goals than a social change.|$|R
50|$|The current ethnic {{composition}} of the region, however, <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>different.</b> As mentioned above, many Jews and ethnic Germans were removed or left during World War II.|$|E
