40|$|Context High-quality cancer {{care should}} be {{accessible}} for patients and healthcare professionals. Involvement of patients as partners in guideline formation and consensus processes is still rarely found. EURECCA, short for European Registration of Cancer Care, is the platform to improve outcomes of cancer care by reducing variation in the diagnostic and treatment process. EURECCA acknowledges {{the important role of}} patients in implementation of consensus information in clinical practice. Objective The aim {{of this article is to}} describe the process of involving patients in the consensus process and in developing the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> of the consensus for colon and rectal cancer care. Methods The Delphi method for achieving consensus was used. Three online voting rounds and one tele-voting round were offered to an expert panel of oncology professionals and patient representatives. At four different stages, patients and/or patient representatives were involved in the process: (1) during the consensus process, (2) lecturing about the role of the patient, (3) development of the <b>patient</b> <b>summary,</b> and (4) testing the <b>patient</b> <b>summary.</b> Results Representatives were invited to the voting and commenting rounds of this process and given an equal vote. Although patients were not consulted during the planning stages of this process, patient involvement increased following the panel's discussion of the implementation of the consensus among the patient population. After the consensus meeting, the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> was written by patient representatives, oncologists and nurses. A selection of proactive patients reviewed the draft patient summary; responses were positive and several patient-reported outcomes were added. Questionnaires to evaluate the use and implementation of the <b>patient</b> <b>summary</b> in daily practice are currently being developed and tested. Patient consultation will be needed in future planning for selection of topics. Discussion The present study may function as a model for future consensus processes to involve patients at different stages and to implement both patient and healthcare professional versions in daily practice...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND The <b>digital</b> <b>patient</b> is a {{powerful}} tool that permits an “offline” consultation of the patient and creates medical case studies for medical students [1]. The main objective {{is to create a}} digital representation of the scoliotic patient in order to show precise gait and posture. The digital representation can be later analyzed without the presence of the actual patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS A digital version of the real life patient is created using the Microsoft Kinect program that captures both the gait and the posture. RESULTS The created <b>digital</b> <b>patient</b> can be viewed and analyzed using MatLab software. The overall position of the patient along with patient movements such as adduction, rotation and flexion of the joints can be viewed. CONCLUSIONS The <b>digital</b> <b>patient</b> is {{a powerful}} tool that permits the medical doctor to consult the patient even when the patient is not present.

40|$|Abstract—Patient summary {{documents}} provide crucial infor-mation about a patient, like {{allergies and}} adverse reactions, which {{are necessary for}} an efficient and safe treatment and offer a quick overview of the patients health status. Automatically generating <b>patient</b> <b>summaries</b> from Electronic Health Records (EHR) reduces the workload of medical personnel. Nevertheless, existing approaches do not take several challenges that occur in live operation into account. Based on a health standard-compliant approach, a system for on-demand generation of <b>patient</b> <b>summaries</b> was implemented and evaluated using real data. This work shows several problems which could be identified. Those problems are not covered sufficiently by current research. Possible approaches to a solution are suggested, which have to be further investigated in future work. Keywords—patient summary, IHE, e-Health, ELGA, epSOS I...|$|R

40|$|Medical {{practice}} today still entails {{sorting through}} scattered {{information on a}} specific patient. Making things more difficult, the EU, in bringing its member states closer together, is encouraging peopleÂ¿s mobility, and raises thus the desire for treatment wherever and whenever necessary.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} use of <b>digital</b> <b>patient</b> {{records in}} hospital saves time and reduces risks of wrong treatments caused by lack of information. <b>Digital</b> <b>patient</b> records also enable efficient spread and transfer of experience gained from {{diagnosis and treatment of}} individual patient which is now-a-days mostly manual (speaking with colleagues) and rarely aided by computerized system. Most of the content in patient records is semi-structured textual information. In this paper, we propose a hybrid textual case-based reasoning system promoting experience reuse. This is derived from structured or unstructured patient records, case-based reasoning and similarity measurement based on cosine similarity metric improved by a domain specific ontology and the nearest neighbor method. As a result, hospital staffs can learn not only new cases but also add comments to existing cases and thus enables prototypical cases. ...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{combination}} of lightly trained doctors, under-resourced hospitals, and complex treatment protocols can sometimes result in sub-standard care for HIV patients in low-income regions.

40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has long}} aspired {{to support the}} freedom of {{movement}} of its citizens between member states by facilitating the transfer of their health records across borders. This is {{not as simple as}} might first seem, because few countries have a robust legal basis for such a transfer, records in different European countries are often in different languages, and the structure of health records varies greatly from country to country. At present most exchanges are informal and unstructured; hardly the best formula for safe and efficient healthcare. Cross-border exchange of personal health data was first piloted during the epSOS (European Patient – Smart Open Services) project. This was a large-scale pilot that ran from 2008 to 2014 and involved not only most EU countries but also Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. It focused on how to transfer <b>patient</b> <b>summaries</b> and ePrescriptions when citizens need unplanned health care while travelling outside their home country. Malta took part from 2011 onwards, and succeeded in exchanging <b>patient</b> <b>summaries</b> with various countries, including Italy, Portugal and Slovenia. The epSOS project drew up specifications for other use cases, such as transfer of a health care encounter report back to the patient’s home country, and direct patient access to the cross-border data. However, these use cases have not been widely tested yet. The European Commission is now encouraging countries to set up cross-border health data exchange as a routine service, and is supporting this by making funds available from its Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). A call for applications opened in November 2015, inviting proposals from EU member states interested in connecting to the EU’s new eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI). The call closed in March 2016 (CEF-TC- 2015 - 2); twenty countries submitted a proposal, and it is expected that the eHealth DSI will go live {{in the first quarter of}} 2018.
