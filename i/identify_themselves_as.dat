Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media.

As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to <b>identify</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E

Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} rank {{gave its}} holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, {{came with a}} state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to <b>identify</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> members of a larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values {{and a commitment to}} mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.|$|E

An additional 93,717 (0.05 percent) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China, who {{may not be able to}} pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen. Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to <b>identify</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that some did not identify themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998, as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.|$|E
