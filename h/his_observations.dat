5|$|During the Renaissance, Nicolaus Copernicus {{proposed}} a heliocentric {{model of the}} solar system. His work was defended, expanded upon, and corrected by Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler. Galileo used telescopes to enhance <b>his</b> <b>observations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Edme-Sébastien Jeaurat {{then drew}} in 1782 {{a map of}} 64 stars of the Pleiades from <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> in 1779, which he {{published}} in 1786.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>observations</b> {{were almost}} all accurate, {{according}} to the philosopher Anthony Preus, though Mario Vegetti argues that Aristotle sometimes let theory cloud observation.|$|E

5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades through a telescope. He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim {{to be seen with}} the naked eye. He published <b>his</b> <b>observations,</b> including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.|$|E
5|$|Grill wrote {{a number}} of essays for the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences about <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> and {{experiences}} in Canton, and in 1773, he {{became a member of}} the academy. In 1774, Grill became its preses or president. He was also an accomplished flute player, and on 16June 1772, he was elected as member no. 46 of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>observations</b> of the {{satellites}} of Jupiter caused {{a revolution in}} astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. <b>His</b> <b>observations</b> were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe {{the satellites}} over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E
5000|$|When did he {{report in}} {{relation}} to <b>his</b> <b>observation?</b> Soon? Much later? ...|$|R
60|$|Then Austerly looked around, and <b>his</b> <b>observation</b> {{was very}} matter-of-fact, as usual.|$|R
50|$|Vaccinations were {{developed}} by Edward Jenner from <b>his</b> <b>observation</b> of milkmaids to fight Smallpox.|$|R
5|$|Horrocks {{produced}} several {{drafts of}} a Latin treatise Venus in sole visa (Venus {{seen on the}} Sun) based on <b>his</b> <b>observations,</b> which he presumably intended to publish, but he died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641, aged 22.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{supernova}} {{to be seen}} in the Milky Way galaxy was SN 1604, which was observed October 9, 1604. Several people, including Johannes van Heeck, noted the sudden appearance of this star, but it was Johannes Kepler who became noted for his systematic study of the object. He published <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> in the work De Stella nova in pede Serpentarii.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel, {{along with}} another Uranian satellite, Ariel, was {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 24, 1851. Although William Herschel, the discoverer of Titania and Oberon, claimed {{at the end of}} the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus, <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious.|$|E
60|$|Comrade Prebble {{repeated}} <b>his</b> <b>observation.</b> Mike looked helplessly at Psmith, but Psmith's {{eyes were}} on his plate.|$|R

5|$|Zoologists {{working in}} the 19th century, {{including}} Georges Cuvier, Johannes Peter Müller, and Louis Agassiz admired Aristotle's biology and investigated some of <b>his</b> <b>observations.</b> D'Arcy Thompson translated History of Animals, making a classically-educated zoologist's informed attempt to identify the animals that Aristotle names, and to interpret and diagram his anatomical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, {{grounded}} in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> were made during his stay {{on the island of}} Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon there. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Salton, too, showed much {{interest}} in the job, and was constantly coming in and out, nothing escaping <b>his</b> <b>observation.</b>|$|R

5|$|Franklin {{distributed}} {{copies of}} the electrostatic machine to many of his close associates {{to encourage them to}} study electricity. Between 1747 and 1750, Franklin sent many letters to his friend Collinson in London about his experiments with the electrostatic machine and the Leyden jar, including <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> and theories on the principles of electricity. These letters were collected and published in 1751 in a book entitled Experiments and Observations on Electricity.|$|E
5|$|From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace {{travelled}} {{through the}} Malay Archipelago or East Indies (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens {{for sale and}} to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation {{can be found in}} the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology. <b>His</b> <b>observations</b> of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace line.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{were first}} {{studied in the}} wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971. <b>His</b> <b>observations</b> were {{secondary}} to his primary research interest, the fork-marked lemurs north of Morondava. Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina during the 1990s.|$|E
60|$|Then Dr. Hoyt {{took up the}} {{conversation}} and related the many instances of complete recovery that had come under <b>his</b> <b>observation.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>observations</b> on catfish, {{electric}} fish (Torpedo) and {{angler fish}} are detailed, {{as is his}} writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish and the paper nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{his arrival in}} California in March 1868, naturalist John Muir {{set out for the}} Yosemite area, where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher, Pat Delaney. Muir's employment provided him with the opportunity to study the area's plants, rocks, and animals; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it. Muir {{was one of the first}} to suggest that Yosemite Valley's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers, contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney, who regarded Muir as an amateur.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced <b>his</b> <b>observations</b> of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E
60|$|Hatteraick saw his blunder, {{and again}} screwed up his hard {{features}} for obstinate silence. 'Put down <b>his</b> <b>observation,</b> however,' said Pleydell to the clerk.|$|R
