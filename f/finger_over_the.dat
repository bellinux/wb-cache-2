6000|$|Tance smiled foolishly {{inside his}} helmet. [...] "I must have put my <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lens. I'll be more careful." [...] He {{made his way}} up onto the {{circular}} slab, stepping gingerly behind {{the body of the}} gun. He disappeared from view.|$|E
60|$|The {{panel of}} the days was deeply worn--the long tenth notches half effaced, as alphabets of the blind. Ten {{thousand}} times the longing widow had traced her <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bamboo--dull flute, which played, on, gave no sound--as if counting birds flown by in air would hasten tortoises creeping through the woods.|$|E

60|$|There {{could be}} no mistake. He passed his <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stain; he could still feel the slippery, infinitesimal powder of the pollen. It was not there when he had closed the box that morning; it was {{impossible}} {{that it should be}} there unless the box had been opened in his absence. He re-examined the contents of the box; the papers were all there. More than that, they were papers of no importance except to him personally; contained no plans nor key to any military secret; he had been far too wise to intrust any to the accidents of this alien house. The prying intruder, whoever it was, had gained nothing! But there was unmistakably the attempt! And the existence of a would-be spy within the purlieus of the house was equally clear.|$|E
6000|$|June laughed, held up {{her four}} fingers again, and then pointed to her two thumbs; passing a <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> first, she {{repeated}} the words [...] "red-coats;" [...] and touching the last, she added, [...] "Saltwater," [...] "Quartermaster." [...] All this was being very accurate, and Mabel began to entertain serious doubts as to the propriety of her permitting her visitor to depart without her becoming more explicit. Still it was so repugnant to her feelings to abuse the confidence this gentle and affectionate creature had evidently reposed in her, that Mabel had no sooner admitted the thought of summoning her uncle, than she rejected it as unworthy of herself and unjust to her friend. To aid this good resolution, too, there was the certainty that June would reveal nothing, but take refuge in a stubborn silence, if any attempt were made to coerce her.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not five}} yet. He {{put a few}} more coals on his fire and blew out the night-light, and lay down. But it was {{impossible}} to rest, to remain inactive. He would go down and search for that first volume of Quain. Hallucination, Influenza, Insanity--why, Sheila must have purposely mislaid it. A rather formidable figure he looked, descending the stairs in the grey dusk of daybreak. The breakfast-room was {{at the back of the}} house. He tilted the blind, and a faint light flowed in from the changing colours of the sky. He opened the glass door of the little bookcase to the right of the window, and ran eye and <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> few rows of books. But as he stood there with his back to the room, just as the shadow of a bird's wing floats across the moonlight of a pool, he became suddenly conscious that something, somebody had passed across the doorway, and in passing had looked in on him.|$|E
60|$|The free-trader smiled, {{partly in}} scorn and yet much in sadness, and passed his <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> strings of the guitar.|$|R

60|$|Then observe, each pier has, {{just below}} the head of it, in a {{vertical}} line, another important object, one a buoy, {{and the other a}} stooping figure. These carry on the double group in the calmest way, obeying the general law of vertical reflection, and throw down two long shadows on the near beach. The intenseness of the parallelism would catch the eye in a moment, but for the lighthouse, which breaks the group and prevents the artifice from being too open. Next come the two heads of boats, with their two bowsprits, and the two masts of the one farthest off, all monotonously double, but for the diagonal mast of the nearer one, which again hides the artifice. Next, put your <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> white central figure, and follow the minor incidents round the beach; first, under the lighthouse, a stick, with its echo below a little to the right; above, a black stone, and its echo to the right; under the white figure, another stick, with its echo to the left; then a starfish,[X] and a white spot its echo to the left; then a dog, and a basket to double its light; above, a fisherman, and his wife for an echo; above them, two lines of curved shingle; above them, two small black figures; above them, two unfinished ships, and two forked masts; above the forked masts, a house with two gables, and its echo exactly over it in two gables more; next to the right, two fishing-boats with sails down; farther on, two fishing-boats with sails up, each with its little white reflection below; then two larger ships, which, lest his trick should be found out, Turner puts a dim third between; then below, two fat colliers, leaning away from each other, and two thinner colliers, leaning towards each other; and now at last, having doubled everything all round the beach, he gives one strong single stroke to gather all together, places his solitary central white figure, and the Calm is complete.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other {{classical}} stringed instruments, classical guitar playing and notation use formal {{positions of the}} left hand. The 'nth position' means that the hand is positioned with the first <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nth fret.|$|E

60|$|The {{man was a}} musician. Involuntarily {{he rested}} himself on the {{mahogany}} stool, and ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> keys. They seemed to Virginia, standing motionless in the ball, to give out the very chords of agony.|$|R

50|$|Soft enamelThis {{process is}} like epola and cloisonné in that strips of metal {{separate}} areas of color.

50|$|Johann Sebastian Bach {{introduced}} an innovation in fingering for the organ and the clavier. (A similar, although according to Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach less radical, innovation {{was introduced by}} François Couperin, {{at roughly the same}} time in 1716, in his book L'art de toucher le clavecin.) Prior to Bach, playing rarely involved the thumb. Bach's new fingering retained many features of the conventional fingering up until that point, including the passing of one finger under or over another (playing many of Bach's works requires such fingering, especially passing the third <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fourth or the fourth <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fifth.), but introduced the far greater use of the thumb. Modern fingering also uses the thumb to a similar extent, and involves the passing of the thumb under the other fingers, but does not, as Bach's did, generally involve the passing of any other fingers over or under one another.|$|E
50|$|The Monument to Soviet tank crews was a {{memorial}} located in Prague, Czech Republic, {{made up of}} an IS-2m tank on a pedestal. In 1991, the artist David Cerny painted the tank pink and hoisted a large middle <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> turret in protest against the controversial monument. The monument was later removed and the tank is now stored at a military museum, painted pink.|$|E
50|$|Ewan McGregor had petrol sprayed {{into his}} (recently laser-corrected) eyes at filling {{stations}} on two occasions, {{one of which}} required a trip to an optometrist in Ukraine. In the first case, Boorman attempted to stop a petrol pump by putting his <b>finger</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> nozzle, only to send a jet of fuel directly into McGregor's face; in the second, petrol gushed out of McGregor's own bike's tank while filling.|$|E
50|$|Using {{the device}} pictured on the right, Ziat et al.

5000|$|A {{push dagger}} (alternately known as: push knife, gimlet knife, fist knife, Stoßdolch (German), push dirk, T-handled knife or punch dagger) is a short-bladed dagger with a [...] "T" [...] handle {{designed}} to be grasped in the hand so that the blade protrudes {{from the front of}} one's fist, typically between the index and middle <b>finger.</b> <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> centuries, the push dagger has gone up and down in popularity as a close-combat weapon for civilians and selected military forces.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{with his}} mother's assistance, {{he learned the}} letters of the string alphabet, which is used in some of the {{institutions}} for the blind in Europe.
