5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure of the water provides support against the internal <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. <b>Hydrostatic</b> pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming <b>hydrostatic</b> equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in <b>hydrostatic</b> equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, the {{smallest}} possible object that could possess an absolute magnitude of +1 (a perfectly reflective {{one with an}} albedo of 1) would be 838km in diameter. It {{is highly unlikely that}} any body of this size or larger, regardless of composition, would not also surpass whatever threshold is ultimately adopted as proof of <b>hydrostatic</b> equilibrium. However, if it turns out upon further investigation that an object named {{as if it were a}} plutoid has not achieved <b>hydrostatic</b> equilibrium, the IAU has stated it will be reclassified, but keep its name.|$|E

5|$|A <b>hydrostatic</b> test {{involves}} pressurising {{the cylinder}} to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 {{of the working}} pressure) and measuring its volume {{before and after the}} test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.|$|E

50|$|Fluid statics or <b>hydrostatics</b> is {{the branch}} of fluid {{mechanics}} that studies fluids at rest.

5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, such as when a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in <b>hydrostatic</b> pressure.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>hydrostatic</b> equilibrium, {{the interior of}} a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below.|$|E
5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea.
