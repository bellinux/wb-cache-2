40|$|Summary. This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} {{on the effects of}} impact <b>fees</b> <b>on</b> housing prices, using an inventory of single-family housing sale transactions in the 38 cities and towns within King County, Washington, for the period 1991 – 2000. Although the effect of impact <b>fees</b> <b>on</b> housing prices has been examined previously, earlier studies have been limited by methodological deficiencies. This paper examines the effect of impact <b>fees</b> <b>on</b> new housing and their differential effect on housing price based on the quality of housing, and finds that the effect of impact <b>fees</b> <b>on</b> the price of new housing is quite significant and elastic, raising new home prices by about 166 per cent of the amount of the fee. The increase is 358 per cent for the higher-quality homes and is statistically insignificant for the lower-quality homes...|$|R

5|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within {{the television and}} entertainment industry including Broadcasting Standards Commission director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television licence <b>fee</b> <b>on</b> the programme. The series employs {{a team of researchers}} to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. Holby City has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the British Medical Association denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an accident and emergency nurse at the 2008 Royal College of Nursing conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.|$|E

A bruised foot picked up in a reserve-team match meant he was unable to play for York against Grays Athletic in April.

Smith made his first appearance of 2009–10 after being introduced as an 86th-minute substitute against Rushden & Diamonds on 11 August, the second match of the season, which finished as a 0–0 draw.

5|$|Meredith {{made his}} debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892. The club played in The Combination, a league which {{contained}} {{a mixture of}} town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities. At {{the end of his}} first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2–1 to Wrexham. Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside-right William Owen, a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners' strike. In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk, but accepted an offer to play for Football League club Northwich Victoria as well, who gave him a small <b>fee</b> <b>on</b> top of his expenses. Northwich were a struggling side, who withdrew from the Football League {{at the end of the}} 1893–94 season after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win. Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup.|$|E
