40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{perinatal}} outcomes of gestational diabetic patients with normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> level < 5. 3 mmol/L, versus <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> level ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L on 100 g oral glucose tolerance results. All gestational diabetic patients enrolled in the study were diagnosed by standard 100 g oral glucose blood samples. Based on oral glucose tolerance results, patients were divided into two groups according to the fasting plasma glucose; Group 1 normal <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> < 5. 3 mmol/L, and Group 2 <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose</b> ≥ 5. 3 mmol/L. During the study period, a total of 292 patients were identified as having gestational diabetes mellitus.

40|$|IntroductionChildhood {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Early identification of adolescents at risk for <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> may lead to earlier and more comprehensive evaluation and intervention. Because widespread blood glucose testing of adolescents is not recommended, community-based tools are needed to identify those who could benefit from further testing. One such tool, developed for adults, was the Tool for Assessing Glucose ImpairmenT (TAG-IT). Our objective was to validate whether a similar tool could be useful for community-based screening of glucose impairment risk among adolescents. MethodsOur study sample consisted of 3, 050 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years who had participated in the 1999 - 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Half of participants were female and 40 % were nonwhite. NHANES measured <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> and height, weight, and resting heart rate. We used Pearson correlations and regression analysis to determine key variables for predicting glucose impairment. From these measurements, we created a composite TAG-IT score for adolescents called TAG-IT-A. We then applied the TAG-IT-A model to 1988 - 1994 NHANES data, using linear regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis to determine how well the TAG-IT-A score predicted a <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> at or above 100 mg/dL. ResultsWe determined that age, sex, body mass index, and resting heart rate were predictors of <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> and that TAG-IT-A was a better predictor of <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> than body mass index alone (area under the curve, 0. 61, P <. 001 vs 0. 55, P =. 10, respectively). A TAG-IT-A score of 3 or higher correctly identified 50 % of adolescents with <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose,</b> while a score of 5 or higher correctly identified 76 %. ConclusionThe TAG-IT-A score is a simple screening tool that clinicians and public health professionals could use to easily identify adolescents who may have <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> and need a more comprehensive evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to develop relatively simple and easy noninvasive measurements of atherosclerosis (NIMA), and each NIMA assesses different atherosclerotic properties. We, therefore, investigated the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) components and different NIMAs. Methods: This study included 1, 132 Korean subjects over 20 years of age who had visited a Health Promotion Center in Korea. Carotid injury (increased carotid intima-media thickness or plaques) was evaluated by ultrasonography and arterial stiffness by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity. The MetS components were assessed according to the Asian criteria of the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Results: Both arterial stiffness and carotid injury gradually deteriorated with {{increase in the number}} of MetS components. Arterial stiffness and carotid injury were associated with different MetS components, each of which had varying impact. After adjustment for all possible confounders such as age, sex, and lifestyle, elevated blood pressure (BP) was found to have the strongest association with arterial stiffness, whereas central obesity, <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose,</b> and elevated BP had comparable connection with carotid atherosclerosis. Conclusion: Individual MetS components were related with subclinical atherosclerosis in different ways. Elevated BP showed the strongest association with arterial stiffness, while central obesity, <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> plasma <b>glucose,</b> and elevated BP showed good correlation with carotid atherosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|Background : The {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} elderly persons is contributing {{to an increase}} in the prevalence of diabetes. The residents of urban slums are more vulnerable due to poverty and lack of access to health care. Objective: To estimate the prevalence of diabetes in elderly persons in an urban slum and to assess their awareness, treatment and control of this condition. Materials and Methods : All persons aged 60 years and above, residing in an urban slum of Delhi, were included in this cross-sectional community- based study. Data were collected on sociodemographic variables. The participants′ awareness and treatment of diabetes was recorded. Their fasting blood sugar was estimated using an automated glucometer. Diabetes was diagnosed if <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> was ≥ 126 mg/dL, or if the participant was taking treatment for diabetes. <b>Impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> was diagnosed if <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> was 110 - 125 mg/dL. Results: Among the 474 participants studied, the prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 18. 8 % (95 % CI 15. 3 - 21. 5). It decreased with increasing age, and was higher among women. The prevalence of <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> was 19. 8 % (95 % CI 16. 3 - 23. 7). It was higher among women.

40|$|Genetic {{variants}} mapping to chromosome 8 p 23. 1 {{have been}} associated with multiple metabolic traits in humans, including plasma constituents (glucose, lactate, insulin, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol), and hepatic steatosis with genome-wide significance. The closest gene of known function, PPP 1 R 3 B, (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 3 B), encodes a protein (GL) that is known to regulate glycogen metabolism. We sought to test the hypothesis that hepatic PPP 1 R 3 B is the causal gene underlying the human genetic association with these metabolic attributes and to understand the mechanisms. We generated two separate mice with liver-specific deletion (Ppp 1 r 3 bΔhep) or liver-specific overexpression of Ppp 1 r 3 b. Hepatic deletion of Ppp 1 r 3 b significantly reduced glycogen levels and glycogen synthase activity in the liver, <b>impairing</b> <b>fasting</b> <b>glucose</b> homeostasis, and prompting early onset of non-carbohydrate metabolite utilization to sustain energy under long term fasting. Conversely, mice with overexpression of hepatic Ppp 1 r 3 b maintained augmented glycogen storage capacity, with larger glycogen pool creating a buffer towards delayed onset of hypoglycemia. Mice harboring deletion of hepatic Ppp 1 r 3 b exhibited glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, with increased hepatic triglyceride content, leading to hepatic steatosis, under chronic high sucrose feeding. In contrast, mice overexpressing hepatic Ppp 1 r 3 b remained glucose responsive, and insulin sensitive, and were protected from hepatic steatosis under chronic sucrose diet feeding. These studies implicate a major role of Ppp 1 r 3 b in glycogen and lipid homeostasis in the liver, and provide concrete evidence for its pleiotropic effect on metabolic state in a mammalian system, consistent with the human GWAS association. ...|$|R

Using a rat model of low birth weight, we previously reported that placental insufficiency induces {{a significant increase in}} circulating testosterone in male intrauterine growth-restricted offspring (mIUGR) in early adulthood that is lost by 12 months of age. Numerous studies indicate testosterone has a positive effect on glucose metabolism in men. Female growth-restricted littermates exhibit glucose intolerance at 6 months of age. Thus, the aim of this paper was to determine whether mIUGR develop impaired glucose metabolism, and whether a decrease in elevated testosterone levels plays a role in its onset. Male growth-restricted offspring were studied at 6 and 12 months of age. No impairment in glucose tolerance was observed at 6 months of age when mIUGR exhibited a 2 -fold higher testosterone level compared to age-matched control. <b>Fasting</b> blood <b>glucose</b> was significantly higher and glucose tolerance was impaired with a significant decrease in circulating testosterone in mIUGR at 12 compared with 6 months of age.

We tested the hypothesis that increased <b>fasting</b> and postload <b>glucose</b> levels are associated with diastolic dysfunction as assessed by tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) in hypertensive patients. METHODS: In 104 untreated, nondiabetic, hypertensive patients free of cardiovascular complications, we measured glucose and insulin at fast and after an oral glucose load, calculated the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) index, and performed electrocardiogram (ECG), conventional echocardiography, and TDI. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients who had <b>impaired</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/impaired <b>glucose</b> tolerance had more frequent LV strain at ECG and worse TDI markers of diastolic function than patients with normal plasma glucose but no differences in variables LV mass, LV geometry, systolic function, and early-/late-wave transmitral diastolic velocity. TDI detected diastolic dysfunction in 46 patients who were older and had greater body mass index, blood pressure, <b>fasting</b> and postload <b>glucose,</b> insulin, HOMA index, LV mass, and left atrial diameter than patients with preserved diastolic function.

RESULTS: Compared with the lowest quartile, the ORs (95 %CI) for IFG/IGT corresponding to the highest quartile were 0. 89 (0. 61, 1. 28) in men and 0. 87 (0. 64, 1. 18) in women for CRP and 2. 12 (1. 40, 3. 38) and 1. 87 (1. 32, 2. 62) for GGT, when the two were fitted simultaneously in a model adjusting for age, school years, alcohol-drinking, smoking, family history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated GGT, but not CRP, was independently associated with the presence of the IFG/IGT in both genders in this Chinese population. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
