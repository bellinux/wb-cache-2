5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays weaker than 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> as X-ray radiocontrast agents.

Praseodymium is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not very toxic either. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of rare earths into animals {{has been known to}} impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, curium and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The biological half-life of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of 242Cm and 244Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after <b>intravenous</b> <b>injection</b> of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) pandemic was ignited in Léopoldville (now known as Kinshasa), in the former Belgian Congo. Factors that jump-started its early expansion remain unclear. Nonlethal hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV- 1) {{can be used to}} investigate past iatrogenic transmission. We undertook a cross-sectional study of elderly inhabitants of Kinshasa, with serological assays, amplification, and sequencing. Risk factors were assessed through logistic regression. Phylogenetic methods reconstructed the genetic history of HCV. A total of 217 of 839 participants (25. 9 %) were HCV seropositive; 26 (3. 1 %) were HTLV- 1 -seropositive. Amplification products were obtained from 118 HCV-seropositive participants; subtypes 4 k (in 47 participants) and 4 r (in 38) were most common. Independent risk factors for HCV subtype 4 r seropositivity were intramuscular tuberculosis therapy, <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> at hospital A, <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> before 1960, and injections at a colonial-era venereology clinic. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> at hospital B and antimalarials were associated with HCV subtype 4 k seropositivity. Risk factors for HTLV- 1 seropositivity included <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> at hospitals C or D and transfusions.

40|$|Mandibular osteoradionecrosis is {{a severe}} {{side effect of}} {{radiotherapy}} after the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. As an alternative to its treatment by micro-anastomosed free-flaps, preclinical tissular engineering studies have been developed. Total bone marrow (TBM) associated with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) significantly enhanced bone formation in irradiated bone. One mechanism, explaining how bone marrow cells can help regenerate tissues like this, is the paracrine effect. The bone marrow cell extract (BMCE) makes use of this paracrine mechanism by keeping only the soluble factors such as growth factors and cytokines. It has provided significant results in repairing various tissues, but {{has not yet been}} studied in irradiated bone reconstruction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of BMCE via an intraosseous or intravenous delivery, with a calcium phosphate scaffold, in irradiated bone reconstruction. Twenty rats were irradiated on their hind limbs with a single 80 -Gy dose. Three weeks later, surgery was performed to create osseous defects. The intraosseous group (n = 12) studied the effect of BMCE in situ, with six combinations (empty defect, BCP, TBM, BCP-TBM, lysate only, BCP-lysate). After four different combinations of implantation (empty defect, BCP, TBM, BCP-TBM), the intravenous group (n = 8) received four <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> of BMCE for 2 weeks. Five weeks after implantation, samples were explanted for histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis. Lysate immunogenicity was studied with various mixed lymphocyte reactions. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> of BMCE led to a significant new bone formation compared to the intraosseous group. The BCP-TBM mixture remained the most effective in the intraosseous group. However, <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections</b> were more effective, with TBM placed in the defect, with or without biomaterials. Histologically, highly cellularized bone marrow was observed in the defects after <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections,</b> and not after an in situ use of the lysate. The mixed lymphocyte reactions did not show any proliferation after 3, 5, or 7 days of lysate incubation with lymphocytes from another species. This study evaluated the role of BMCE in irradiated bone reconstruction. There were significant results arguing in favor of BMCE <b>intravenous</b> <b>injections.</b> This could open new perspectives to irradiated bone reconstruction...|$|R
