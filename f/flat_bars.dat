25|$|In recent years, bicycle designs have trended towards {{increased}} specialization, as {{the number}} of casual, recreational and commuter cyclists has grown. For these groups, the industry responded with the hybrid bicycle, sometimes marketed as a city bike, cross bike, or commuter bike. Hybrid bicycles combine elements of road racing and mountain bikes, though the term is applied {{to a wide variety of}} bicycle types. Hybrid bicycles and commuter bicycles can range from fast and light racing-type bicycles with <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> and other minimal concessions to casual use, to wider-tired bikes designed for primarily for comfort, load-carrying, and increased versatility over a range of different road surfaces. Enclosed hub gears have become popular again - now with up to 8, 11 or 14 gears - for such bicycles due to ease of maintenance and improved technology.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of coinage in Italy the two important forms of value in the economy were sheep (pecus), from which the Latin word for money (pecunia) is derived, and irregularly shaped pieces of bronze known as aes rude (rough bronze) which needed to be weighed for each transaction. It is unclear when money became commonly used, but Roman tradition recorded that pay of the army began during the siege of Veii in 406 BC {{and it appears that}} Aes rude was the currency well before this. [...] Toward the end of the 4th century BC bronze began to be cast in <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> which are known today, without any historical authority, as aes signatum (signed bronze). These bars were heavily leaded, of varying weights although generally on the order of five Roman pounds, and usually had a design on one and later both sides. The actual function of aes signatum has been variously interpreted; although a form of currency they were not coins since they did not adhere to a weight standard. Rome produced its own aes signatum around 300 BC which are distinguished by the inscription [...] "ROMANOM" [...] (of the Romans) and production continued to {{about the end of the}} first Punic war in 240 BC, overlapping some of the developments described below.|$|E
50|$|Relative to more upright hybrids, <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> road {{bikes are}} often lighter and more {{efficient}} to pedal, though less so than a drop bar bike by equal measure. Drop bar bikes will have considerable aerodynamic advantages above about 15 MPH. Conventional hybrids will have a measure of off-road capability lacking in entirety from <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> bikes. For efficient speed with the familiarity and stability of a <b>flat</b> <b>bar,</b> however, the <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> road bike is an optimal compromise.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{fracture}} {{behavior and}} strength of mechanically fastened joint in the <b>flat</b> braided <b>bar</b> were studied. Joint strength of the braided <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with the braided hole was {{higher than that of}} the braided <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with the machined hole. In the braided hole, although joint geometry decreased, the failure mode was safe bearing failure. The calculated results agreed well with the experimental results, and it was possible to estimate the fracture behavior and joint strength of the braided <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with a circular hole by this analysis method. It is better for joint design that the fibers form the braided hole, around the hole, and form a reinforcement configuration with high modulus and strength as a uni-directional composite...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Continuous semisolid {{extruding}} extending {{forming process}} was adopted to produce LY 11 alloy <b>flat</b> <b>bar.</b> The forming process, metal flow behavior in die cavity and microstructure and mechanical property of <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> were investigated. It is {{shown that the}} LY 11 alloy <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with transverse section of 10 × 50 mm and with good surface and fine equiaxed grains {{can be obtained by}} the continuous semisolid extruding extending forming process with melt pouring temperature of 770 ～ 780 ℃. The metal streamlines show that the semisolid slurry fills the die cavity in radiation manner and moves forward layer by layer and the velocity of slurry flow in the central area of die cavity is the maximum, and then decreases gradually from the center to side of die cavity. The tensile strength and elongation of <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with T 6 heat treatment are 420. 5 MPa and 14. 2 %, respectively...|$|R

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>bars</b> are the {{standard}} handlebars equipped on mountain bikes, hybrids, and recently on fixed-gear bicycles and flat bar road bikes. A flat bar is a nearly-straight tube, {{in most cases}} slightly bent toward the rider. Many penny-farthings and early safety bicycles had flat handlebars.

The same strength equal to the yield strength is expected in both tension and compression loading. This brace is composed of a <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> inserted into a square tube. The axial load is applied only on the <b>flat</b> <b>bar,</b> and the tube acts as a restraining member for the buckling of the <b>flat</b> <b>bar.</b> The pape first introduces the test results of hysteretic behavior of the brace under repeated axial loading and then discusses the required stiffness of the tube to guarantee the spindle-shaped hysteresis loops and design considerations...|$|R

50|$|A common {{signaling}} {{device is}} a chime unit {{consisting of two}} flat metal bar resonators, which are struck by plungers operated by two solenoids. The <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> are tuned to two pleasing notes. When the doorbell button is pressed, the first solenoid's plunger strikes one bar, and when the button is released, a spring on the plunger pushes the plunger up, causing it to strike the other bar, creating a two-tone sound ("ding-dong"). If a second doorbell button is used, it is wired to the other solenoid, which strikes {{only one of the}} bars, to create a single-tone ("ding") sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{slitting}} mill {{consisted of}} two pairs of rollers turned by water wheels. Mill bars were <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> of iron about three inches (75 mm) wide and half an inch (13 mm) thick. A piece was cut {{off the end of}} the bar with shears powered by one of the water wheels and heated in a furnace. This was then passed between flat rollers which made it into a thick plate. it was then passed through the second rollers (known as cutters), which slit it into rods. The cutters had intersecting grooves which sheared the iron lengthways.|$|E
5000|$|For {{very high}} {{currents}} in electrical apparatus, and for high currents distributed through a building, bus bars can be used. (The term [...] "bus" [...] is a contraction of the Latin omnibus - meaning [...] "for all".) Each live conductor {{of such a}} system is a rigid piece of copper or aluminium, usually in <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> (but sometimes as tubing or other shapes). Open bus bars are never used in publicly accessible areas, although they are used in manufacturing plants and power company switch yards to gain the benefit of air cooling.

50|$|These puddle {{balls are}} then {{transported to the}} hammer or {{squeezer}} by dragging them along iron slopes built between the furnace and the shingling equipment or, more commonly, the puddle balls are loaded into iron wheelbarrows and transported to their destination. Shingling expels slag and welds shut internal cracks, while breaking off chunks of impurities. The iron is then re-heated and rolled out into <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> or round rods. For this, grooved rollers were used, the grooves being of successively decreasing size so that the bar was progressively reduced to the desired dimensions. Some of the iron oxide is from the scales that form in the later steps of shingling and rolling. The quality of this may be improved by faggoting.|$|E
