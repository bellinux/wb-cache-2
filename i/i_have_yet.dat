[...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day Off, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> to see it.

500|$|Chaplin again vocalised his {{political}} views in Monsieur Verdoux, criticising capitalism and {{arguing that the}} world encourages mass killing through wars and weapons of mass destruction. Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947; Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott. Monsieur Verdoux was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States. It was more successful abroad, and Chaplin's screenplay was nominated at the Academy Awards. He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, [...] "Monsieur Verdoux is the cleverest and most brilliant film <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> made." ...|$|E

[...] Middleton arrived in Columbus, Georgia with strong praise from his superiors, and would soon get his efficiency report, in which Brigadier General Benjamin Poore of the 4th Division wrote of him, [...] "The best all-around officer <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> seen.

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} return, Marshall {{was asked by}} Earle Clapp, head of the Forest Service's Branch of Research, to help {{initiate}} badly needed reforms in the forest-products industry {{and to create a}} broader vision of national forest management. Marshall moved to Washington, D.C. in September 1932 to assume the appointed position, which entailed writing initiatives for forest recreation. He immediately began compiling a list of the remaining roadless areas in the United States. He sent this data to regional foresters, urging them to set aside areas for wilderness; all of them responded negatively. Marshall's contributions to {{what became known as the}} Copeland Report amounted to three extensive chapters of a two-volume, 1,677-page work. He considered it [...] "the best piece of forestry work <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> done." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing {{began in}} late 2009, when the American singer Holly Hafermann resided at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and {{composed}} songs. Later, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her Universal Music publisher, Jennifer Blakeman, {{to seek help}} presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships {{to her as she}} spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the Los Angeles Times that she was in an abusive relationship with the music industry: [...] "I love it so much, and I give it all that <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>yet</b> it beats me down." [...] This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an alternative pop song for herself. She wrote the chorus to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in fifteenminutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo.|$|E

500|$|James Van Hise in {{his book}} The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation, said that the episode [...] "fascinated" [...] him due to the [...] "experimental" [...] nature. He praised the {{direction}} of Frakes, who saved it from being a series of [...] "potentially boring repetition", adding that he [...] "clearly has a firm grasp on the series." [...] Juliette Harrisson listed [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] as the seventh most groundbreaking episode of the series in 2012 for Den of Geek. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com, giving it a rating of nine out of ten. He praised the means in which Frakes made each repetition different, and the writing by Braga which he described as a [...] "tour de force". He said that [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] had [...] "the best teaser {{in the history of}} Star Trek", and summed it up by saying [...] "This is an absolute triumph of craft from both Braga and Frakes, and just a fun episode, with the added bonus of Captain Frasier Crane at the end. I almost didn't need to rewatch this one, as it's one of my go-to episodes when I want to watch a Star Trek episode for the heck of it, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> to tire of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's pop and sing-along {{sound and}} {{production}} received praise by critics. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune described the song's production as [...] "predictable" [...] and opined {{that the audience}} sing-along chorus sounded like it was created specifically for being performed during an arena encore. Similarly, Nathan S. of the website DJ Booth wrote that the song was suitable for [...] "ecstatic" [...] fans to sing along without efforts during a stadium concert: [...] "This {{is the kind of}} chorus that's going to be sung at full force in traffic jams for months to come, and while XO may be relatively more subdued, that call and response is destined to be a monster when performed live, right down to the way her voice shows a little wear, just like it would {{at the end of a}} show." [...] Jody Rosen writing for Vulture found a [...] "cavernous widescreen" [...] anthemic pop sound in the song further saying that its chorus sounded like it was specifically made for an Olympics opening ceremony. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork described the song as a [...] "stadium-filling" [...] one and classified it as one of Beyoncés [...] "decorous moments". Joe Lynch from Fuse described [...] "XO" [...] as the [...] "most uplifting" [...] pop song since Florence and the Machine's [...] "Shake It Out" [...] (2011). He praised the electronic flourishes, saying that they managed to [...] "keep the music from veering into banal territory" [...] and concluded that the song has a [...] "quirky" [...] sound previously unheard on other material by Beyoncé. Philip Sherburne of Spin found [...] "zero-G bounce... which, purely in terms of sonics, makes the most compelling argument for space tourism <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> to come across".|$|E

2500|$|Looking back on {{this period}} (in 1926), Milne {{observed}} that when he told his agent {{that he was going}} to write a detective story, he was told that what the country wanted from a [...] "Punch humorist" [...] was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that [...] "the only excuse which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others." ...|$|E

2500|$|Men of the Lightship {{was highly}} praised {{by both the}} trade and general press. A {{reviewer}} in the Daily Express stated that it was [...] "the best British documentary film <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> seen". In the trade magazine, Cinema, a reviewer considered that it had cinematic merit outside of its propaganda value, commenting on the [...] "grim realism" [...] {{of the work and}} concluding that the film was an [...] "absolutely first-class job of work" [...] and a [...] "credit to everyone concerned in its production". The film's realism was also mentioned in a review in The Times, which stated that [...] "the employment, not of professional actors but of men who might well have had such an experience ...turns out to be inexplicably a better means of attaining reality than any skilled imitation." [...] This reviewer also considered the attack to be [...] "astonishingly vivid". Writing in anticipation of the film's distribution in Australia, Betty Wilson in The Sydney Morning Herald described it as [...] "the best propaganda film England has put out this war", [...] "worth half a dozen films of the calibre of The Lion Has Wings." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, Brandes turned to concentrating on [...] "great personalities" [...] {{as the source}} of culture. In this period, he {{discovered}} Friedrich Nietzsche, not only introducing him to Scandinavian culture but indirectly to the whole world. The series of lectures that he gave on Nietzsche's thought, which he described as [...] "aristocratic radicalism", were the first to present Nietzsche as a world cultural figure in need of full intellectual notice. Of Brandes' description of his philosophy, Nietzsche himself remarked: [...] "The expression 'aristocratic radicalism', which you employ, is very good. It is, permit me to say, the cleverest thing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> read about myself". In 1909 the lectures were edited and published as the monograph Friedrich Nietzsche, which included the complete Nietzche/Brandes correspondence as well as two essays in homage to the late Nietzsche's life and thought. Translated into English by A.G. Chater, the volume was published by Heinemann in 1911 and Nietzsche's thought was thus able to reach a significant English language audience before World War I. It was Brandes who, in an 1888 letter, wrote to Nietzsche advising him to read the works of Søren Kierkegaard, with whom his thought had much in common. There is no evidence, however, that Nietzsche ever did read any volume by Kierkegaard.|$|E
2500|$|Levinas {{pointed to}} the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first {{commanded}} Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, {{he would not have}} listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, [...] "transcending ethics" [...] seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in Fear and Trembling was that the religious sphere entails the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always {{in one way or another}} ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in Stages on Life's Way. I conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, “These things I said not unto you from the beginning … <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now” – so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth.
