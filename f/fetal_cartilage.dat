40|$|To {{begin to}} define the gene {{expression}} pattern in <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> and to identify uncharacterized candidate genes for the osteochondrodysplasias, we analyzed clones from a <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> cDNA library. Sequence analysis of 420 cDNA clones identified 210 clones derived from established genes but, for many of them, expression in cartilage had not been previously reported. Among the established genes were 14 genes known to produce skeletal abnormalities in either humans or mice when mutated. Thirty-two uncharacterized genes and their respective chromosomal positions were also identified. To further understand the expression profile of these genes in <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage,</b> we constructed a cDNA microarray utilizing the clones. The microarray {{was used to determine}} which genes had higher expression in cartilage as compared with dedifferentiated, cultured chondrocytes. Many of the established genes, as well as five of the uncharacterized genes, had increased expression in cartilage, suggesting an important role for these genes in the differentiated state of chondrocytes. These data provide new candidate genes for the osteochondrodysplasias and demonstrate the usefulness of cartilage cDNA microarrays in expanding our understanding of the complexity of <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> gene expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{analyze the}} gene {{expression}} profile of human <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> by expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Methods: A human <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> (8 – 12 weeks) cDNA library was constructed using the λ ZAP Express vector. ESTs {{were obtained by}} partial sequencing of cDNA clones. The basic local alignment search tool algorithm {{was used to compare}} all generated ESTs to known sequences. Results: A total of 13, 155 ESTs were analyzed, of which 8696 ESTs (66. 1 %) matched known genes, 53 ESTs (0. 4 %) were putatively novel (with no match) and the rest matched other ESTs, genomic DNA and repetitive sequences. Importantly, we identified 2448 unique known genes through non-redundancy analysis of the known gene matches, which were then functionally categorized. The tissue specificity of this library was reflected by its EST profile of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Collagens were the major transcripts, representing 68. 5 % of the ECM proteins. Proteoglycans were the second most abundant, constituting 9. 5 %. Collagen type II was the most abundant gene of all. Glypican 3, decorin and aggrecan were the major transcripts of proteoglycans. Many genes involved in cartilage development were identified, such as insulin-like growth factor-II, its receptor and binding proteins, connective tissue growth factor and fibroblast growth factors. Proteases and their regulatory factors were also identified, including matrix metalloprotease 2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. Conclusions: The EST approach is an effective way of characterizing the genes expressed in cartilage. These data represent the most extensive molecular information on human <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> to date. The availability of this information will serve as a basis for further research to identify genes that are essential in cartilage development...|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{work from}} this {{laboratory}} {{showed that the}} human proteoglycan aggrecan from <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilages</b> can induce a CD 4 + T cell-dependent inflammatory polyarthritis in BALB/c mice when injected after removal of chondroitin sulfate chains. Adult keratan sulfate (KS) -rich aggrecan does not possess this property. We found that two CD 4 + T cell hybridomas (TH 5 and TH 14) isolated from arthritic mice recognize bovine calf aggrecan and the purified G 1 domain of this molecule, which also contains {{a portion of the}} interglobular domain to which KS is bound. These hybridoma responses to G 1 are enhanced by partial removal of KS by the endoglycosidase keratanase or by cyanogen bromide cleavage of core protein. KS removal results in increased cellular uptake by antigen-present cells in vitro. After removal of KS by keratanase, G 1 alone can induce a severe erosive polyarthritis and spondylitis in BALB/c mice identifying it as an arthritogenic domain of aggrecan. The presence of KS prevents induction of arthritis presumably {{as a result of an}} impaired immune response as observed in vitro. These observations not only identify the arthritogenic properties of G 1 but they also point to the importance of glycosylation and proteolysis in determining the arthritogenicity of aggrecan and fragments thereof...|$|R

40|$|Chondromyxoid fibroma {{represents}} a rare benign cartilaginous tumor of young patients occurring in a subcortical metaphyseal location. The histogenesis of chondromyxoid fibroma {{has not yet}} been postulated, even though the conventional histology and recent immunohistochemical studies on phenotype of the mesenchymal cells and extracellular matrix components suggested its origin in immature cartilage. Therefore, we wished to compare the morphological pattern of immature cartilage tissue with chondromyxoid fibroma to investigate a possible developmental counterpart of chondromyxoid fibroma. Archival paraffin-embedded tissues from 4 fetal femora and 10 cases of chondromyxoid fibroma were analyzed simultaneously using histochemistry (safranin O) and established immunohistochemical antibodies (CD 34, CD 163, and smooth muscle actin). Vascularized cartilage canals growing into the <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> from the perichondrium displayed characteristic glomeruloid structures with central arterioles within the immature mesenchymal stroma and numerous superficial sinusoidal blood vessels accompanied by macrophage infiltration. Similarly, each case of chondromyxoid fibroma demonstrated admixture of two characteristic components: immature fibrous tissue of vascularized stroma with accumulation of macrophages in areas of superficial sinusoidal proliferation, and variable amounts of lobulated chondroid tissue. Based on the observed substantial morphological similarity between the cartilage canals and chondromyxoid fibroma, we suggest that the chondromyxoid fibroma {{represents a}} neoplasm originating from or mimicking the <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> canals within the immature cartilage...|$|E
40|$|Cartilage plays {{a central}} role in the {{patterning}} and growth of the skeletal elements, and mutations in genes expressed in cartilage are responsible for at least 250 distinct clinical conditions, the osteochondrodysplasias. While recent progress has been made in characterizing the genes that define cartilage biology, there are only limited data describing the gene expression profile of human cartilage. Here we describe the sequences and identities of 6266 clones from an 18 – 20 -week human <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> cDNA library. Among the sequences, BLAST analysis identified 2404 individual transcripts. Of these, 1775 were defined as derived from characterized genes and the remaining 629 were classified as representing the products of uncharacterized genes. Analysis of the relative representation of each individual transcript showed that the 186 most abundant cDNAs in the library accounted for almost half (47. 7 %) of the clones. The most highly expressed gene was COL 2 A 1, accounting for 4. 15 % of all cDNA clones. The cDNAs identified included clones derived from 27 genes which, when mutated, result in disorders of skeletal patterning, development and growth. There were cDNAs representing 22 genes encoding collagen subunits. The genes encoding the identified cDNAs represent candidates for the approximately 100 osteochondrodysplasias for which the causative gene has not yet been identified.

One {{of the five}} hybridomas that gave a positive reaction in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was selected (H 1 a) for structural analysis and immunolocalization of type IX collagen. The location of the epitope for H 1 a was deducted from immunoblots and electron microscopic observations after rotary shadowing.

Staining throughout the matrix was obtained in the superficial zone under all experimental conditions. Without hyaluronidase treatment, no immunofluorescent staining was seen with either H 1 a or polyclonal antibody to type II collagen, indicating that type IX collagen is present throughout the matrix in the different zones of <b>fetal</b> calf <b>cartilage.</b> This result is in good accordance with the recent demonstration of common cross-links between type II and type IX collagen in chicken and bovine cartilage. However, the preferential unmasking of type IX collagen antigenic sites in the pericellular regions of middle and deep zones of <b>fetal</b> calf <b>cartilage</b> does not preclude the presence in that region of a special pericellular organization of the collagenous network.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of aggrecan degradation in adult human articular, adult bovine nasal and <b>fetal</b> bovine epiphyseal <b>cartilage</b> {{in response to}} either interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) or retinoic acid were compared using an explant culture system. Bovine nasal cartilage cultured with either IL- 1 beta or retinoic acid exhibited significant release of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). For both factors, aggrecan proteolysis occurred predominantly at the 'aggrecanase' site, with no evidence for the action of matrix metalloproteinases, and resulted in {{the appearance of the}} corresponding G 1 fragment in tissue extracts and in culture media. In human cartilage, little effect of IL- 1 beta was seen, but abundant release of GAG occurred in the presence of retinoic acid, with evidence of aggrecanase action. Treatment of <b>fetal</b> epiphyseal <b>cartilage</b> with retinoic acid resulted in significant GAG release, whereas treatment with IL- 1 beta did not. In the retinoic acid-treated tissue, however, no evidence for the cleavage of aggrecan in the interglobular region was apparent. Thus, in the fetal system, agents in addition to aggrecanase and matrix metalloproteinases appear to be active. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the pathways utilized for aggrecan catabolism may vary between different cartilages for a given stimulatory agent, and that, for a given tissue, different factors may elicit aggrecan release via different pathways...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cartilage plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} development of the human skeleton. Early in embryogenesis, mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into chondrocytes to shape the early skeleton. Subsequently, the cartilage anlagen differentiate to form the growth plates, which are responsible for linear bone growth, and the articular chondrocytes, which facilitate joint function. However, despite the multiplicity of roles of cartilage during human fetal life, surprisingly little is known about its transcriptome. To address this, a whole genome microarray expression profile was generated using RNA isolated from 18 – 22 week human distal femur <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> and compared with a database of control normal human tissues aggregated at UCLA, termed Celsius. Results 161 cartilage-selective genes were identified, defined as genes significantly expressed in cartilage with low expression and little variation across a panel of 34 non-cartilage tissues. Among these 161 genes were cartilage-specific genes such as cartilage collagen genes and 25 genes which have been associated with skeletal phenotypes in humans and/or mice. Many of the other cartilage-selective genes do not have established roles in cartilage or are novel, unannotated genes. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the unique pattern of gene expression observed by microarray analysis. Conclusion Defining the gene expression pattern for cartilage has identified new genes that may contribute to human skeletogenesis as well as provided further candidate genes for skeletal dysplasias. The data suggest that <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> is a complex and transcriptionally active tissue and demonstrate that the set of genes selectively expressed in the tissue has been greatly underestimated. </p...|$|E

30|$|Type XI {{collagen}} {{accounts for}} 3 % to 10 % of total collagen in adult articular cartilage and <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage,</b> respectively (Eyre, 2002). It is preferentially retained at the chondrocyte surface {{and involved in}} the organization of the pericellular matrix via interaction with cartilage proteoglycans (Smith et al., 1989). In embryonic cartilage, type XI collagen has a uniform diameter of ~ 20 nm and diameter control is regulated by the proportion of collagen II and XI while collagen IX strongly increase the efficiency of fibril formation (Blaschke et al., 2000). The thin fibrils in embryonic cartilage are constructed from a 10 + 4 microfibrillar arrangement (central core of 2 microfibrils each of type II and type XI collagen) (Holmes and Kadler, 2006). This arrangement explains why the narrow fibrils are lacking in collagen XI knockout animals.|$|E

Chicken embryos expressed multiple transcripts (3. 3, 2. 0 and 1. 7 kb in size) due to the alternative utilization of polyadenylation signals, whereas only the 1. 7 kb transcripts were detected in mammals. Although confined to cartilage and eye at a later stage of development, whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed the expression of ChM-I mRNA in somites, heart, bronchial arches, roof plate, retina and limb buds.

Type IX collagen is extensively cross-linked with type II collagen through the lysyl oxidase mechanism (Wu et al., 1992). Eyre et al. discovered that the covalent cross-linking formed at the N-telopeptide of α 1 (II) chain and the COL 1 in all three chains of type IX collagen in both human and bovine cartilage (Eyre et al., 2004).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{hypothesis}} is widely held that, in growth plate during endochondral ossification, proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix {{of the lower}} hypertrophic zone are degraded by proteases and removed before mineralization, {{and that this is}} the mechanism by which a noncalcifiable matrix is transformed into a calcifiable matrix. We have evaluated this hypothesis by examining the immunofluorescent localization and concentrations of proteoglycan monomer core protein and link protein, and the concentrations of glycosaminoglycans demonstrated by safranin 0 staining, in the different zones of the bovine <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> growth plate.

Our previous studies showed that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) induced chondrogenesis retardation in IUGR offspring rats. The current study sought to investigate the effects of PCE on male IUGR offspring rats' articular cartilage, and the mechanisms associated with abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Based on the results from both male fetal and adult fed a high-fat diet (HFD) studies of rats that experienced PCE (120 mg/kg. d), the results showed a poor quality of articular cartilage and cholesterol accumulation in the adult PCE group. Meanwhile, the serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations were increased in adult PCE offspring. We also observed lower expression of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF 1) and impaired cholesterol efflux in adult articular cartilage. Furthermore, the expression of cartilage functional genes, components of the IGF 1 signaling pathway and cholesterol efflux pathway related genes were decreased in PCE <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage.</b> In conclusion, PCE induced a poor quality of articular cartilage in male adult offspring fed a HFD.

In previous studies, we determined that the calcium channel Orai 1 was required for the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro. To define the skeletal functions of calcium release-activated calcium currents, we compared mice with targeted deletion of the calcium channel Orai 1 to wild-type littermate controls, and examined differentiation and function of osteoblast and osteoclast precursors in vitro with and without Orai 1 inhibition. Consistent with in vitro findings, Orai 1 −/ − mice lacked multinucleated osteoclasts. Yet they did not develop osteopetrosis. Mononuclear cells expressing osteoclast products were found in Orai 1 −/ − mice, and in vitro studies showed significantly reduced, but not absent, mineral resorption by the mononuclear osteoclast-like cells that form in culture from peripheral blood monocytic cells when Orai 1 is inhibited.

Aggrecanase- 2 showed a similar ability to cleave within the IGD of adult and immature aggrecan, whereas aggrecanase- 1 was less efficient in cleavage in the IGD of immature aggrecan, for both the bovine and the human substrates. Both aggrecanases showed a similar ability to cleave within the CS 2 domain of bovine aggrecan irrespective of age, but showed a much lower ability to cleave within the CS 2 domain of human aggrecan. Equivalent results were obtained whether aggrecan was present in isolation {{or as part of}} proteoglycan aggregates. When proteoglycan aggregates were used, neither aggrecanase was able to cleave link protein.

Chondrocalcin was evenly distributed at relatively low concentration in resting <b>fetal</b> epiphyseal <b>cartilage.</b> In growth plate cartilage, it was absent from the extracellular matrix in the zone of proliferating chondrocytes but was present in intracellular vacuoles in proliferating, maturing and upper hypertrophic chondrocytes. The protein then disappeared from the lower hypertrophic chondrocytes and appeared in the adjoining extracellular matrix, where it was selectively concentrated in the longitudinal septa in precisely the same location where amorphous mineral was deposited in large amounts as demonstrated by von Kossa staining and electron microscopy. Mineral then spread out from these "nucleation sites " to occupy much of the surrounding matrix. Matrix vesicles were identified in this calcifying matrix but they bore no observable morphological relationship to these major sites of calcification where chondrocalcin was concentrated. Since chondrocalcin is a calcium-binding protein and has a strong affinity for hydroxyapatite, these observations suggest that chondrocalcin may play a fundamenta...|$|R
40|$|Tissue-specific {{stem cells}} found in adult tissues can {{participate}} in the repair process following injury. However, adult tissues, such as articular cartilage and intervertebral disc, have low regeneration capacity, whereas fetal tissues, such as articular cartilage, show high regeneration ability. The presence of fetal stem cells in fetal cartilaginous tissues and their involvement in the regeneration of <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> is unknown. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the chondrogenic differentiation and the plasticity of fetal cartilaginous cells. We compared the TGF-β 3 -induced chondrogenic differentiation of human fetal cells isolated from spine and cartilage tissues to that of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). Stem cell surface markers and adipogenic and osteogenic plasticity of the two fetal cell types were also assessed. TGF-β 3 stimulation of fetal cells cultured in high cell density led to the production of aggrecan, type I and II collagens, and variable levels of type X collagen. Although fetal cells showed the same pattern of surface stem cell markers as BMSCs, both type of fetal cells had lower adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity than BMSCs. Fetal cells from femoral head showed higher adipogenic differentiation than fetal cells from spine. These results show that fetal cells are already differentiated cells and may be a good compromise between stem cells and adult tissue cells for a cell-based therapy...|$|E
40|$|The initial {{calcification}} and {{the progression}} of the mineral phase depositing in cartilage and bone matrix was studied in human, <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> Anlagen at a developmental stage when the calcified cartilage resorption had not yet started. The model allowed a morphological, comparative analysis of the calcification process in both cartilage and osteoid which represented the basic steps of endochondral calcification. The study was carried out with light microscopy and SEM-Edax (combined with hest deproteination and morphometry) on a sequence of thin sections, cut on the same paraffin inclusions. This allowed to analyzed corresponding fields with the different microscopy techniques. In cartilage focal, globular mineral deposits (randomly distributed) represented the initial phase of calcification which progressed with an eccentrical growth of the single deposit. With the increase of calcified globules size and of their density, aggregation led to the extensive mineralization of the inter-territorial matrix. Mineral deposition in osteoid below the periosteal osteoblasts occurred shortly after the collagen fibrils at thin extruded from the osteoblast cell membrane and packed in compact bundles. The fibrils themselves acted to orient and to compact the mineral deposits along a direction of the fibrils. This study documented {{the progression of}} the mineral deposition in both cartilage and osteoid and integrated the actual knowledge of the initial Calcium Phosphate nucleation in endochondral ossification...|$|E
40|$|The {{chondrocyte}} maturation {{cycle and}} endochondral ossification were studied in human, <b>fetal</b> <b>cartilage</b> Anlagen and in postnatal meta-epiphyses. The {{relationship between the}} lacunar area, the inter-territorial fibril network variations, and calcium phosphorus nucleation in primary and secondary ossification centers were assessed using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphometry. The Anlage topographic, zonal classification {{was derived from the}} anatomical nomenclature of the completely developed long bone (diaphysis, metaphyses and epiphyses). A significant increase in the chondrocyte lacunar area was documented in the Anlage of epiphyseal zones 4 and 3 to zone 2 (metaphysis) and zone 1 (diaphysis), with the highest variation from zone 2 to zone 1. An inverse reduction in the intercellular matrix area and matrix interfibrillar empty space was also documented. These findings are consistent with the osmotic passage of free cartilage water from the interfibrillar space into the swelling chondrocytes, which increased the ion concentrations to a critical threshold for mineral precipitation in the matrix. The mineralized cartilage served as a scaffold for osteoblast apposition both in primary and secondary ossification centers and in the metaphyseal growth plate cartilage, though at different periods of bone Anlage development and with distinct patterns for each zone. All developmental processes shared a common initial pathway but progressed at different rates, modes and organization in diaphysis, metaphysis and epiphysis. In the ossification phase the developing vascular supply appeared to {{play a key role in}} determining the cortical or trabecular structure of the long bones...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the {{composition}} of bone and cartilage is determined by standard histological methods. We used Raman microscopy, which provides a molecular “fingerprint” of the investigated sample, to detect differences between the zones in human <b>fetal</b> femur <b>cartilage</b> {{without the need for}} additional staining or labeling. Raman area scans were made from the (pre) articular cartilage, resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic zones of growth plate and endochondral bone within human fetal femora. Multivariate data analysis was performed on Raman spectral datasets to construct cluster images with corresponding cluster averages. Cluster analysis resulted in detection of individual chondrocyte spectra that could be separated from cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) spectra and was verified by comparing cluster images with intensity-based Raman images for the deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) band. Specific dendrograms were created using Ward’s clustering method, and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with the separated and averaged Raman spectra of cells and ECM of all measured zones. Overall (dis) similarities between measured zones were effectively visualized on the dendrograms and main spectral differences were revealed by PCA allowing for label-free detection of individual cartilaginous zones and for label-free evaluation of proper cartilaginous matrix formation for future tissue engineering and clinical purposes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} reported {{the isolation of}} the cartilage-derived growth promoting factors chondromodulin-I (ChM-I) and chondromodulin-II (ChM-II) from <b>fetal</b> bovine epiphyseal <b>cartilage.</b> Both of these factors stimulate the growth and matrix formation of chondrocytes in vitro. In the present study, we found that ChM-I and ChM-II stimulated the proliferation of clonal mouse osteoblastic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells as well as primary mouse osteoblasts in culture. Unlike other known growth factors, these factors did not support the proliferation of fibroblasts. Concomitantly with growth stimulation of osteoblasts, there was a reduction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in the cells, the expression of the differentiated phenotype. These results suggest that epiphyseal cartilage may play a functional role in longitudinal bone growth by production of these unique growth-promoting factors...|$|R
40|$|Cartilage fibrils contain {{collagen}} II as {{the major}} constituent, but the presence of additional components, minor collagens, and noncollagenous glycoproteins {{is thought to be}} crucial for modulating several fibril properties. We have examined the distribution of two fibril constituents—decorin and collagen IX—in samples of fibril fragments obtained after bovine cartilage homogenization. Decorin was preferentially associated with a population of thicker fibril fragments from adult articular cartilage, but was not present on the thinnest fibrils. The binding was specific for the gap regions of the fibrils, and depended on the decorin core protein. Collagen IX, by contrast, predominated in the population with the thinnest fibrils, and was scarce on wider fibrils. Double-labeling experiments demonstrated the coexistence of decorin and collagen IX in some fibrils of intermediate diameter, although most fibril fragments from adult cartilage were strongly positive for one component and lacked the other. Fibril fragments from <b>fetal</b> epiphyseal <b>cartilage</b> showed a different pattern, with decorin and collagen IX frequently colocalized on fragments of intermediate and large diameters. Hence, the presence of collagen IX was not exclusive for fibrils of small diameter. These results establish that articular cartilage fibrils are biochemically heterogeneous. Different populations of fibrils share collagen II, but have distinct compositions with respect to macromolecules defining their surface properties...|$|R
