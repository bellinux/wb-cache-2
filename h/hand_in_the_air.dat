500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has her <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> while the teacher desperately looks {{for someone else to}} call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She reminds me of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|West's {{performance}} on the song is notably intense, forcefully rapping lines such as [...] "we above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all / I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall." [...] Swizz Beatz sets {{the tone of the}} song using several ad-libs such as [...] "one <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> if you don't really care" [...] and the line [...] "this shit is fucking ridiculous" [...] which is repeated several times throughout the song, delivered by nearly every rapper. The second verse is delivered by Jay-Z, who spends the majority of his verse deconstructing the hate that surrounds fame and poses the question, [...] "would you rather be underpaid or overrated?" [...] Jay-Z comments on how a career in the music industry creates many opponents. The third verse is delivered by Pusha T, who muses on cocaine dealing.|$|E
2500|$|Orndorff's frustrations {{were further}} fueled by Adrian Adonis, who took every {{opportunity}} {{that he could}} to mock Orndorff (including referring to him as [...] "Hulk Jr."), {{saying that he had}} gone soft from teaming with Hogan. Adonis kept on irritating Orndorff, going so far as daring Paul Orndorff to prove just how close his relationship with Hulk Hogan really was. During a televised phone call to Hulk Hogan, Orndorff was told that Hogan was too busy training to come to the phone, something which aggravated Orndorff to no end. The next time that Hogan and Orndorff teamed up, against The Moondogs, Orndorff wrestled most of the match by himself in an attempt to upstage Hogan, scoring the winning pin. The next week, during a tag match where Hogan and Orndorff faced the massive duo of Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy, Hogan and Orndorff accidentally collided and Hogan knocked Orndorff off the apron. When Studd and Bundy started to double team Hogan, Orndorff did not help out; he looked like he had hurt his eye in the collision. It was not until Studd and Bundy had Hogan in a compromised position that Orndorff reentered the ring to fend off Studd and Bundy. Orndorff then helped Hogan to his feet and raised his <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> only to give Hogan a clothesline followed by a piledriver.|$|E

60|$|Half-a-dozen mounted camel-men had {{appeared}} suddenly over {{the lip of}} the bowl-shaped hollow, standing out hard and clear against the evening sky where the copper basin met its great blue lid. They were travelling fast, and waved their rifles as they came. An instant later the bugle sounded an alarm, and the camp was up with a buzz like an overturned bee-hive. The Colonel ran back to his companions, and the black soldier to his camel.
