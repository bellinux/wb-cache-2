40|$|Mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosas Hopk., reached near {{epidemic}} {{levels in}} lodgepole pine {{stands in the}} Sulphur Creek-Black Butte area. Lodgepole pine are probably more susceptible due to the overstocked conditions of stands, and high incidence of girdling of the base of trees by porcupines. The infestation in this area was classified as static with a decreasing trend. Mountain pine beetle and pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips spp., increased to epidemic levels in blowdown and top-broken second-growth ponderosa pine in the North Fork of Roy and Grunett Creek drainages on State, private and Bureau of Land Management lands. Several hundred ponderosa pines are now infested. Sufficient brood is present to cause an increase in number of trees killed in 1974.

50|$|Ips is a genus of beetles in {{the family}} Curculionidae, the true weevils. They are bark beetles, members of the {{subfamily}} Scolytinae. Species are distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Some are known as introduced species in Australia and Africa. Many species are pests of forest trees, especially pines and spruces. They are known commonly as <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> ips <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> and pine engravers.|$|R
50|$|This beetle is {{strongly}} attracted to volatile chemicals produced by freshly cut pine stumps, {{and it will}} infest these as well as intact trees, particular selecting trees that are stressed.

40|$|Studies {{of forest}} declines are important, because they both reduce timber {{production}} and affect successional trajectories of landscapes and ecosystems. Of particular {{interest is the}} decline of red pines which is characterized by expanding areas of dead and chlorotic trees in plantations throughout the Great Lakes Region. Here we {{examine the impact of}} two bark beetle groups, namely red turpentine <b>beetles</b> and pine <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetles,</b> on tree mortality and the subsequent gap formation over time in a plantation in Wisconsin. We construct spatial-temporal statistical models that quantify the relations among red turpentine <b>beetle</b> colonization, pine <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetle</b> colonization, and mortality of red pine trees, while accounting for correlation across space and over time. For statistical inference, we adopt a Bayesian hierarchical model and devise Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for obtaining the posterior distributions of model parameters as well as posterior predictive distributions. Our data analysis results suggest that red turpentine beetle colonization is associated with higher likelihood of pine <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetle</b> colonization and pine <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetle</b> colonization is associated with higher likelihood of red pine tree mortality, whereas there is no direct association between red turpentine beetle colonization and red pine tree mortality. There is strong evidence that red turpentine beetle colonization does not kill a red pine tree directly, but rather predisposes the tree to subsequent colonization by pine <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetles.</b> The evidence is also strong that pine <b>engraver</b> bark <b>beetles</b> are the ultimate mortality agents of red pine trees...|$|R
40|$|Mountain {{pine beetle}} reached {{epidemic}} levels in second-growth ponderosa pine stands on Bureau of Indian Affairs and private {{lands on the}} Crow Indian Reservation. Approximately 9, 106 trees containing 420, 266 merchantable board feet were killed from 1971 to 1973. This is about 24 percent of the merchantable ponderosa pine in stands surveyed. Stands are stagnated, and trees appear stressed which is probably predisposing them to beetle attack. An increase in size of area infested and number of trees killed is expected in 1974. Commercial thinning to remove infested trees and reduce basal area is recommended to alleviate the problem. Slash disposal is highly recommended during logging to prevent buildup of pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle</b> populations...|$|E
40|$|Ipsdienol is an {{important}} pheromone component for pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini. Ipsdienol is a ten carbon monoterpenoid secondary alcohol and ipsdienone is the corresponding ketone. We are characterizing the activity of recombinant IDOL DH produced in Sf 9 (insect) cells. The enzyme has a high stereospecificity: (-) ipsdienol {{was found to be}} a substrate while (+) -ipsdienol was neither a substrate nor inhibitor. Closely related monoterpenoids, such as nerol, geraniol, and citral, were neither substrates nor inhibitors. Smaller compounds, such as 2 -propanol, also failed to act as an inhibitor or substrate. This indicates the binding site of this enzyme is highly selective. Failure to act as an inhibitor most likely indicates these compounds bind weakly (-) -Ipsdienol, ipsdienone, ipsenol, and ipsenone are substrates. Interestingly, menthone, a cyclic analog of ipsdienol, was found to have substrate activity. Results from gel permeation chromatography shows the active conformation of IDOL DH is a tetramer. Together these results suggest IDOLDH has a highly specific substrate binding site, and is a key component in pheromone biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} bark beetles are causing {{widespread}} tree mortality throughout the Intermountain West. Although sometimes viewed by humans as catastrophic, outbreaks of native forest insects are natural events. Native insects {{and the plants}} they use for food and reproduction have evolved together. Unlike some introduced pests, native insects kill individual trees but do not threaten {{the existence of an}} entire plant species. Native insect outbreaks are only a problem when they conflict with values that humans have for an area (i. e., recreation, wildlife habitat, scenic beauty, wood Fading trees attacked by bark beetles production or property values). A tree in the wilderness is not subject to the same human values as a tree in your backyard. Bark beetle populations have been increasing in forested areas of the western U. S. The primary reason for this increase is the combination of large areas with susceptible stand conditions (mature trees in dense stands) and trees stressed by drought. High levels of forest insect activity will likely continue if current conditions do not improve. The bark beetles causing widespread mortality in the forests of the Intermountain West are all native. The principal species include: mountain pine beetle, spruce beetle, Douglas-fir beetle, fir <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> western balsam bark beetle, and pinyon ips...|$|E

Only lindane significantly reduced established southern pine beetle broods. Phosmet caused high mortality of adult beetles within 24 hours after emergence from treated pines. Lindane, propoxur, and carbaryl were effective in preventing Ips grandicollis Eichoff and I. calligraphus Germar attacks on loblolly pine logs...|$|R
50|$|Their {{breeding}} range is boreal forest across Canada, Alaska, the north-western United States, {{as well as}} northern Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Upper Michigan. In particular the species is a burnt-forest specialist, feeding on the outbreaks of wood-boring beetles that feed on recently burnt trees. The most important wood boring beetles taken are in the families Cerambycidae and Buprestidae, along with <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles</b> and Mountain pine beetle. Most food is obtained by pecking, a smaller proportion is obtained by gleaning off branches. Black-backed woodpeckers are generally non-migratory but historically have undertaken intermittent irruptions.|$|R
40|$|Conifer {{bark beetles}} are often {{associated}} with fungal complexes whose components have different ecological roles. Some associated species are nutritionally obligate fungi, serving as nourishment to the larvae, whereas others are pathogenic bluestain fungi known {{to be involved in}} the interaction with host defenses. In this study we characterized the local and systemic defense responses of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) against Ophiostoma brunneo-ciliatum Math. (a blue-stain pathogen) and Hyalorhinocladiella macrospora (Franke-Grosm.) Harr. (a nutritional fungus). These fungi are the principal associates of the pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips acuminatus (Gyll.). Host responses were studied following inoculation with the fungi, singly and as a fungal complex, and by identifying and quantifying terpenoids, phenolic compounds and lignin. Although the length of the necrotic lesions differed between control (wound) and fungal treatments, only two compounds (pinosylvin monomethyl ether and (+) -α-pinene) were significantly affected by the presence of the fungi, indicating that Scots pine has a generic, rather than specific, induced response. The fact that both nutritional and blue-stain fungi triggered comparable induced defense responses suggests that even a non-pathogenic fungus may participate in exhausting host plant defenses, indirectly assisting in the beetle establishment process. Our findings contribute to the further development of current theory on the role of associated fungal complexes in bark beetle ecology...|$|E
40|$|Red fir (Abies magnifica) {{is a high}} {{elevation}} conifer generally growing {{between an}} altitude of 1, 400 and 2, 700 meters. In California, red fir grows in the Sierra Nevada, the Klamath Mountains, the eastern edges of the northern Californian Coast Ranges, and in the southern Cascades. Red fir commonly grows in pure stands and is often found in association with white fir (Abies concolor), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) or Jeffrey pine (Pinus Jeffreyi). Red fir is present in popular recreational areas including Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lassen Volcanic national parks {{as well as the}} Mt. Shasta area and the Lake Tahoe region. Increasing and higher-than-expected red fir mortality and decline {{over the past five years}} has been observed in the central Sierra Nevada. This mortality and decline is seen as being caused by a complex interaction of biotic, anthropogenic and abiotic factors. The abiotic factors include drought, climate change (especially decreased snowpack), and the effects of changing fire regimes. The key anthropogenic factors are air pollution and forest management. The biotic factors include red fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium abietinum f. sp. magnificae), Annosus root disease (Heterobasidion annosum), Cytospora canker (Cytospora abietis), and the fir <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle</b> (Scolytus ventralis).

40|$|The California five-spined ips, Ips paraconfusus Lanier, {{produces}} the myrcene-derived acyclic monoterpene alcohols ipsenol (2 -methyl- 6 -methylene- 7 -octen- 4 -ol) and ipsdienol (2 -methyl- 6 -methylene- 2, 7 -octadien- 4 -ol) as components of its aggregation pheromone. The pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini (Say), produces only ipsdienol. Previous {{studies have shown}} that myrcene, a monoterpene in the pines colonized by these beetles, is a direct precursor to these pheromone components. In vivo radiolabeling studies reported here showed that male I. paraconfusus incorporated [1 - 14 C]acetate into ipsenol, ipsdienol, and amitinol (trans- 2 -methyl- 6 -methylene- 3, 7 -octadien- 2 -ol), while male I. pini incorporated [1 - 14 C]acetate into ipsdienol and amitinol. Females of these species produced neither labeled nor unlabeled pheromone components. The purified radiolabeled monoterpene alcohols from-males were identified by comparison of their HPLC and GC retention times with those of unlabeled standards. HPLC-purified fractions containing the individual radiolabeled components were analyzed by GC-MS and were shown to include only the pure alcohols. To further confirm that ipsdienol and ipsenol were radiolabeled, diastereomeric ester derivatives of the isolated alcohols were synthesized and analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. After derivatization of the radiolabeled alcohols, the HPLC analysis demonstrated expected shifts in retention times with conservation of naturally occurring stereochemistry. The results provide direct evidence for de novo biosynthesis of ipsenol, ipsdienol, and amitinol by bark beetles...|$|E
40|$|In South Carolina, {{there are}} five species of pine beetles that will attack, and {{sometimes}} kill, pine trees; three species of Ips <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> the Southern Pine Beetle, and the Black Turpentine Beetle. These beetles attack a different portion of the tree; some have characteristic galleries under the bark, and pitch tubes that will aid in identification. Correctly identifying the species of pine beetles is very important as there are different control strategies. In addition to these five species, Ambrosia Beetles and Southern Pine Sawyer Beetles, often considered secondary pests, will attack stressed, dying, or recently killed pine trees...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bark beetles use monoterpenoid {{aggregation}} pheromones {{to coordinate}} host colonization and mating. These chemical signals are produced de novo in midgut cells via the mevalonate pathway, and pheromone produc-tion may be regulated by a negative feedback system mediated through the antennae. In this study, we explored {{the effect of}} antennectomy on pheromone production and transcript levels of key mevalonate pathway genes in juvenile hormone III-treated male pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> Ips pini (Say). Antennectomized males produced signifi-cantly greater amounts of pheromone than podectomized males and those with intact antennae.

40|$|The {{abundance}} {{of the southern}} pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles,</b> Ips avulsus (Eichhoff), I. grandicollis (Eichhoff), and I. calligraphus (Germar), was monitored with pheromone-baited traps in 2012 and 2013 in Arkansas and eastern Texas. Additionally, vehicle-based and comprehensive ground-based surveys were used to estimate and confirm the amount of dead and fading trees in each trapping site. Pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles</b> have historically been recognized as secondary invaders of healthy trees, but observations of pine mortality in Texas and Arkansas appeared to correspond with high population densities of Ips spp. Forest sites exhibiting subjectively high or low incidence of Ips-associated mortality in Arkansas and Texas were monitored using short trapping periods in the spring, summer, and fall of 2012 and the spring of 2013. Results of trapping indicated that Ips abundance steadily declined {{from the start of}} the study, and I. calligraphus abundance was considerably less than the other two species. Over the course of this study, a total of 127, 823 I. avulsus, 217, 636 I. grandicollis, and 26, 290 I. calligraphus were trapped. The most abundant predators trapped were: 7555 Cleridae (Thanasimus dubius F. and Enoclerus spp.), 9036 Temnochila virescens (F.), 7162 Histeridae (Platysoma spp. and Plegaderus spp.), and 42, 313 Lasconotus spp. For the sites used in this study, vehicle-based surveys did provide a good predictive model of actual stand mortality. The existence of a correlation between Ips abundance and surveys of tree mortality was investigated. A strong relationship was found between the {{abundance of}} Ips and the total number of standing dead and fading trees during the spring and summer of 2012; however, this relationship dissolved as Ips abundance declined over the course of the study. The number of fading trees alone did not provide a good indication of high Ips abundance...|$|R
40|$|Sphaeropsis sapinea (Fr. :Fr.) Dyko and Sutton, {{is among}} the most common and widely {{distributed}} pathogens of conifers worldwide. S. sapinea is disseminated over short distances by rain splash and moist wind, but significant knowledge gaps regarding long-range dispersal remain. Our objective was {{to determine whether or not}} the pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini Say, is a vector of the pathogen onto Austrian pines (Pinus nigra Arnold). In 2004 and 2005, individuals of I. pini were collected with pheromone traps at two locations in central Ohio (197 and 1, 017 individuals for 2004 and 2005, respectively) and screened for the presence of S. sapinea. In the field, fresh logs of Austrian pine were baited with pheromone lures, mechanically wounded, or left undisturbed. After 2 mo, logs were evaluated for insect feeding and the presence of S. sapinea along beetle galleries. Fresh logs were also inoculated in the greenhouse with adult I. pini that were either artificially infested or uninfested with S. sapinea spores to determine vectoring potential. Phoresy rates for individual collections ranged from 0 to 4. 1 %; average rates were 1. 5 and 2. 0 % for 2004 and 2005, respectively. Isolation frequencies of S. sapinea from baited (15 ± 5 %) and unbaited logs (3 ± 1 %) differed significantly (P = 0. 009). I. pini was also capable of transmitting the pathogen under controlled conditions. Based on phoresy rates, association, and artificial inoculation studies, we conclude that I. pini is able to transmit S. sapinea to Austrian pine stems...|$|E

A complex of Ips beetles including: the Arizona fivespined ips, Ips lecontei Swaine, the pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips pini(Say), Ips calligraphus (Germar), Ips latidens (LeConte), Ips knausi Swaine and Ips integer(Eichhoff) were the primary bark beetle species associated with ponderosa pine mortality. In this study we examine stand conditions and physiographic factors associated with bark beetle-caused tree mortality in ponderosa pine forests across five National Forests in Arizona. A total of 633 fixed-radius plots were established across five National Forests in Arizona: Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, Kaibab, Prescott, and Tonto. Prior to the bark beetle outbreak, plots with mortality had higher tree and stocking compared with plots without pine mortality. Logistic regression modeling found that probability of ponderosa pine mortality caused by bark beetles {{was positively correlated with}} tree density and inversely related with elevation and tree diameter. Given the large geographical extent of this study resulting logistic models to estimate the likelihood of bark beetle attack should have wide applicability across similar ponderosa pine forests across the Southwest. This is particularly true of a model driven by tree density and elevation constructed by combining all forests. Tree mortality resulted in significant reductions in basal area, tree density, stand density index, and mean tree diameter for ponderosa pine and for all species combined in these forests. Most of the observed pine mortality was in the 10 – 35 cm diameter class, which comprise much of the increase in tree density over the past century as a result of fire suppression and grazing practices. Ecological implications of tree mortality are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Pinyon-juniper {{woodlands}} are {{a dominant}} vegetation type throughout the Interior West on lands {{managed by the}} U. S. Forest Service and the USDI Bureau of Land Management. The woodlands have traditionally been viewed as having a low risk of wildfires {{because of the lack}} of a continuous and dense ground cover and low tree stand densities. However, stand densities are often high and are increasing in many areas and wildfires, often resulting in loss of lives and property, will occur under conditions of low humidity, high temperatures and wind speeds, and an ignition source. Woodlands commonly surround or are adjacent to many towns in the region; however, in recent years, people have moved into the woodlands to construct individual homes and housing developments. In this decade, the ecology and fire risk in pinyon-juniper woodlands have changed dramatically because of the continuing drought and the region-wide infestation of the pinyon <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips confusus, which have resulted in high pinyon mortality, increased fuel loadings, and risks of severe wildfires. Managers are attempting to reduce fire hazards and create defensible spaces in the wildland-urban-interface (W. U. I.). They have commonly used hand thinning-piling-burning prescriptions in the W. U. I. but have recently turned to mechanical mastication to accomplish stand reduction goals, especially where slope and soil surface conditions permit the safe operation of heavy equipment. In most situations the goal is to create a mosaic of open and wooded conditions on the landscape. These has advantages of maintaining wildlife habitats, tree and shrub growth, an esthetic landscape, and increasing herbaceous production while improving fire suppression opportunities and reducing fire hazards. However, managers do not know the consequences of mastication on soil nutrient and microbiological populations and on the residual tree, shrub, and herbaceous vegetation. While the number of research studies of the effects mastication on ecosystem components has increased recently, there still are many questions...|$|E

40|$|Selective logging, fire suppression, forest {{succession}} and climatic {{changes have}} resulted in high fire hazards over {{large areas of the}} western USA. Federal and state hazardous fuel reduction programs have increased accordingly to reduce the risk, extent and severity of these events, particularly in the wildland–urban interface. In this study, we examined the effects of mechanical fuel reduction treatments on the activity of bark beetles in ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl ex. Laws., forests located in Arizona and California, USA. Treatments were applied in both late spring (April–May) and late summer (August–September) and included: (1) thinned biomass chipped and randomly dispersed within each 0. 4 ha plot; (2) thinned biomass chipped, randomly dispersed within each plot and raked 2 m from the base of residual trees; (3) thinned biomass lopped- and-scattered (thinned trees cut into 1 – 2 m lengths) within each plot; (4) an untreated control. The mean percentage of residual trees attacked by bark beetles ranged from 2. 0 % (untreated control) to 30. 2 % (plots thinned in spring with all biomass chipped). A three-fold increase in the percentage of trees attacked by bark beetles was observed in chipped versus lopped-and-scattered plots. Bark beetle colonization of residual trees was higher during spring treatments, which corresponded with peak adult beetle flight periods as measured by funnel trap captures. Raking chips away from the base of residual trees did not significantly affect attack rates. Several bark beetle species were present including the roundheaded pine beetle, Dendroctonus adjunctus Blandford (AZ), western pine beetle, D. brevicomis LeConte (AZ and CA), mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins (CA), red turpentine beetle, D. valens LeConte (AZ and CA), Arizona fivespined ips, Ips lecontei Swaine (AZ), California fivespined ips, I. paraconfusus Lanier (CA) and pine engraver, I. pini (Say) (AZ). Dendroctonus valens was the most common bark beetle infesting residual trees. A significant correlation was found between the number of trees chipped per plot and the percentage of residual trees with D. valens attacks. A significantly higher percentage of residual trees was attacked by D. brevicomis in plots that were chipped in spring compared to the untreated control. In lopped-and-scattered treatments, <b>engraver</b> <b>beetles</b> produced substantial broods in logging debris, but few attacks were observed on standing trees. At present, no significant difference in tree mortality exists among treatments. A few trees appeared to have died solely from D. valens attacks, as no other scolytids were observed in the upper bole. In a laboratory study conducted to provide an explanation for the bark beetle responses observed in this study, monoterpene elution rates from chip piles declined sharply over time, but were relatively constant in lopped-and-piled treatments. The quantities of b-pinene, 3 -carene, a-pinene and myrcene eluting from chips exceeded those from lopped-and- piled slash during each of 15 sample periods. These laboratory results may, in part, explain the bark beetle response observed in chipping treatments. The implications of these results to sustainable forest management are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fir <b>engraver</b> and Douglas-fir <b>beetle</b> {{numbers were}} {{monitored}} {{during and after}} an outbreak of the Douglas-fir tussock moth. The population behavior of the two species of bark beetles was similar. Number of emerged offspring/female was highest {{during the years of}} defoliation and declined afterward. Total number of beetle attacks peaked 1 to 2 years after defoliation ended and then declined. During and 1 year after defoliation, beetles generally infested trees that had greater than 90 % defoliation. After this time infestations were not as strongly associated with heavily defoliated trees. Life tables were constructed for beetles within trees and for beetles per area of forest land. Key mortality factors acting on beetles within trees occurred during the larval and pupal stages. Mortality during adult dispersal was a key factor when beetle density per area of land was considered. Although beetle offspring emerging per dm 2 of bark surface was relatively low in defoliated trees, defoliation appeared to reduce host resistance which enabled beetles to successfully attack at lower densities, reducing intraspecific competition, and resulting in increased emergence of offspring/female parent...|$|R
40|$|Discerning {{linkages}} among trophic {{levels and}} untangling indirect interactions {{is essential to}} understanding structuring of communities and ecosystems. Indeed, indirect interactions among disparate taxa are often essential to the functional role of these species. The goal {{of this research was}} to test the hypothesis that the relationship between 2 dendrophagous taxa, the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and the pine <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips hoppingi), is an asymmetric indirect interaction mediated by a common host. We proposed that damage by the porcupine predisposes the papershell pinyon pine (Pinus remota) to colonization by pine engraver beetles. We examined porcupine tree selection, pinyon pine physiology and physiognomy, and beetle-pine associations on a study area in the southwestern Edwards Plateau of Texas from June 1997 to August 1999. Although attacks by beetles were evident on both damaged and undamaged trees, successful colonization was greater on pines damaged by porcupines. Intensity of porcupine attack, indexed by number of feeding scars and area of bark removed, also was associated with subsequent colonization by beetles. Porcupines selected pinyon pines over more abundant species (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and were selective at the level of morphology, whereas pine engraver beetles were selective of tree morphology and physiology. Trees colonized by beetles had phloem with higher concentrations of fructose and glucose and lower percent composition of limonene, sabinene, and terpinolene than uncolonized trees. Our findings supported our hypothesis of an indirect interaction between these dendrophages. We rejected alternative explanations (e. g., that these dendrophages preferred similar trees or that beetles facilitated porcupine damage) for this relationship based on the biology of Ips and their selection of host trees. We propose that release of volatile terpenes as a result of porcupine feeding and reallocation of carbon resources as a response to stress explains the facilitation of beetle colonization in porcupine-damaged trees. Our findings parallel those observed in other systems involving indirect effects and fit within the framework of theories explaining host plant-herbivore interactions...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Red fir (Abies magnifica) {{is a high}} {{elevation}} conifer generally growing {{between an}} altitude of 1, 400 and 2, 700 meters. In California, red fir grows in the Sierra Nevada, the Klamath Mountains, the eastern edges of the northern Californian Coast Ranges, and in the southern Cascades. Red fir commonly grows in pure stands and is often found in association with white fir (Abies concolor), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) or Jeffrey pine (Pinus Jeffreyi). Red fir is present in popular recreational areas including Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lassen Volcanic national parks {{as well as the}} Mt. Shasta area and the Lake Tahoe region. Increasing and higher-than-expected red fir mortality and decline {{over the past five years}} has been observed in the central Sierra Nevada. This mortality and decline is seen as being caused by a complex interaction of biotic, anthropogenic and abiotic factors. The abiotic factors include drought, climate change (especially decreased snowpack), and the effects of changing fire regimes. The key anthropogenic factors are air pollution and forest management. The biotic factors include red fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium abietinum f. sp. magnificae), Annosus root disease (Heterobasidion annosum), Cytospora canker (Cytospora abietis), and the fir <b>engraver</b> <b>beetle</b> (Scolytus ventralis). Using USFS Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) plots at a density of one every 5. 47 km (3. 4 miles) across California allowed for the first stand-level analysis of the entire red fir distribution zone in California. The results show that mortality is increasing in red fir, which suggests that at least a short term decline is occurring. The rate at which mortality is increasing varies, depending on which analysis approach is used and decreases if recently burned plots are removed from the analysis. At the individual tree level, red fir mortality (all size classes) is occurring at an annual rate of 2. 64 %. Red fir dwarf mistletoe is the most significant factor in red fir mortality and decline based on our field observations and statistical analysis. There is a clear visual and statistical difference in forest health between areas that possess red fir dwarf mistletoe and those that don't. This remains true even when stands are heavily stocked and Annosus root disease is present, suggesting that Annosus root disease (which is common throughout the red fir distribution range) is greatly exacerbated by the presence of red fir dwarf mistletoe. Cytospora canker is associated with red fir dwarf mistletoe, and is likely a significant reason why the red fir dwarf mistletoe impacts red fir forest health so significantly. The only variation in spatial pattern of red fir mortality in California is an area of very low red fir mortality around Mt. Shasta (where red fir dwarf mistletoes does not occur). There was not a consistent correlation between red fir mortality and drought stress. The amount of fir engraver activity in California is not well characterized making it difficult to assess its' role in red fir mortality...|$|E
