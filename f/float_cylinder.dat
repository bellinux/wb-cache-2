The typical OSS consists of separate identical blocks which are linked together to form a network.

The <b>floating</b> circular <b>cylinders</b> were elastic supported {{by a set of}} linear springs to provide low structural damping on the system. Eight different aspect ratios were tested, namely L/D = 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0. These aspect ratios were selected to cover the aspect ratio range of the main offshore circular platforms, such as spar and monocolumn.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the low-frequency asymptotic solution of the deep-water radiation problem for a partially submerged cylinder of arbitrary (nonsymmetric, non-smooth) shape. A five-term asymptotic expansion of the wave potential is derived which reduces to a three-term expansion when the mean volume flux across the wetted surface of the cylinder vanishes. The former case corresponds to the heaving motion and the latter one to the swaying or rolling motions of a <b>floating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This expansion is then used to obtain explicit low-frequency asymptotic expansions for all elements of the added-mass and damping tensors, as well as the amplitude and the phase angle of the outgoing waves at infinity. Most of the terms in these expansions are given in terms of simple geometric characteristics (beam, area, and centroid's position) of the immersed part of the cylinder, as well as the formal-limit (omega = 0) added mass. Numerical comparison between the asymptotic results and the ''exact'' ones, obtained by solving numerically the frequency-dependent problem, show that the agreement is satisfactory in the range 0 < omega < 0. 5 and, in some cases (e. g., for lateral motions), in 0 < omega < 0. 6, where omega is the nondimensional frequency normalized by the beam of the cylinder.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of databases of photographic images of ocean's surface, taken from various altitudes and for {{various types of}} rough ocean surface, revealed {{the presence of an}} ocean's skeletal structures (OSS). We make a stress on the phenomenon of OSS's blocks in the form of vertically oriented <b>floating</b> <b>cylinders</b> (VFC) because here we suggest the hypothesis that the VFC is a stimulator of initial phase of the "waterspout" phenomenon (WS). An {{analysis of}} the fine structure of VFC suggests the OSS to be a carrier/source of major electrodynamical properties of initial phase of every WS. This implies that the main body of WS may be interpreted as a special type of atmospheric aerosol dusty plasma. In such a framework, the WS is considered as the long-lived filament, being formed in electric discharge in the presence of electric and magnetic fields in the course of electric breakdown between the cloud and ocean surface. In this case the charged water aerosol (formed by means of VFC's capillaries in the presence of very powerful electric field) may be an analog of a microdust which is lifting upward to the cloud due to effects of electrostatic forces. With such a capillary-electrostatic model of WS, it appears possible to interpret many effects related to WS. We suggest a hypothesis for dynamics of WS and a possible scenario of its transition to classical tornado. Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, in Russia...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of databases of photographic images of ocean's surface, taken from various altitudes and for {{various types of}} rough ocean surface, revealed {{the presence of an}} ocean's skeletal structures (OSS). The OSSs differ from the formerly found skeletal structures (SS) only by the fact that OSS, in their interior, are filled in with closely packed blocks of a smaller size, up to thin capillaries of tens of micron in size. According to suggested hypothesis, the structure-forming dust is produced due to volcanic activity and atmospheric electricity. Such SS may fall on the ocean surface and produce an OSS. This idea is supported by the adsorption of air bubbles in the water by the SS to give a partial flotation of SS. In the sea water, various substances in different phase states of matter are in touch. This suggests the hypothesis, for the possibility of the action of surface tension even on the blocks of SS which is immersed in the sea. This phenomenon results in the aggregation of blocks deposited from the atmosphere on the ocean's surface, to form eventually an OSS. The skeletal structuring assumes that the individual straight and rather strong blocks may be joined flexibly, similarly to joints in a skeleton. We make a stress on the phenomenon of OSS's blocks in the form of vertically oriented <b>floating</b> <b>cylinders</b> because here we suggest the hypothesis that the VFC's strength and floating is determined by; a capillary model of an OSS.

We reconsider the 2 D <b>floating</b> <b>cylinder</b> problem studied in a groundbreaking paper of Bhatnargar and Finn from 2006. We derive the total energy relative to the undisturbed state and the total force in vertical direction. The relation between the total force and the derivative of the total energy {{with respect to the}} height of the centre of the cylinder relative to the undisturbed fluid level is found. The number of equilibria, the floating configurations and their stability are also studied. In the 2 D floating square problem, we rederive the floating configurations and their stability in the no surface tension case. Allowing surface tension, one example with a special contact angle is considered. We show that there is one unstable equilibrium of the floating square with a horizontal side. In the 3 D floating object problem with radial symmetry, the shooting method is applied to obtain the fluid height and radial distance from the vertical axis numerically in terms of the inclination angle parameter. In the vertical cylinder problem, the relation between the total energy and the total force in vertical direction is found to be consistent with 2 D cylinder case. In the floating ball problem, a non-monotone relation between height of centre and the wetting angle is found. We also give an example of two floating configurations with the same height.

40|$|The {{development}} of new types of offshore wind turbine on floating platforms requires the {{development of}} new approaches to modelling the combined platform-turbine system. In this thesis a linearised frequency-domain approach is developed which gives fast but approximate results: linearised models of the structural dynamics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics and control system dynamics are brought together to find the overall response of the floating wind turbine to harmonic wind and wave loading. Initially, a nonlinear flexible multibody dynamics code is developed and verified, which is then used to provide reference nonlinear simulation results. The structural dynamics of a wind turbine on a moving platform are shown to be nonlinear, but for realistic conditions the effects are small. An approximate analysis of the second-order response of <b>floating</b> <b>cylinders</b> to hydrodynamic loads suggests slow drift motion may be relatively small for floating wind turbines, compared to other floating offshore structures. The aerodynamic loads are linearised using both harmonic and tangent linearisation approaches; the harmonic linearisation gives improved results when stall occurs. The wake dynamics can also be included. The control system behaviour is linearised using the same method, which works well when the wind speed is far from the rated wind speed; close to the rated wind speed the nonlinearity is stronger, but further improvement should be possible. These sub-models are combined to give a simple but complete model of a floating wind turbine, with flexible blades and a flexible tower, but neglecting the control system behaviour, wake dynamics and nonlinear hydrodynamic loads. For the OC 3 -Hywind turbine, the accuracy of the results is assessed by comparison to nonlinear time-domain simulations using the commercial code Bladed. Peak-peak errors of less than 5 % are achievable for many harmonic wind and wave inputs, but certain conditions lead to larger errors. The effect of including linearised control system behaviour is demonstrated for a subset of conditions. Overall, the results are promising but more work is needed for practical application.

The WEC's piston-like arrangement consists of two <b>floating</b> concentric <b>cylinders,</b> the geometry of which allow {{the existence of a}} cylindrical moonpool between the external cylinder, the 'torus' and the inner cylinder, the 'piston'. The first-order hydrodynamic characteristics of the floating device, i. e. exciting wave forces and hydrodynamic parameters, are evaluated using a linearized diffraction-radiation semi-analytical method of analysis that is suited for the type of bodies under consideration. According to the analysis method used, matched axisymmetric eigenfiinction expansions of the velocity potentials in properly defined fluid regions around the body are introduced to solve the respective diffraction and radiation problems and to calculate the floats' hydrodynamic characteristics in the frequency domain (Mavrakos et al. 2004, 2005). Based on these characteristics, the retardation forcing terms are calculated, which account for the memory effects of the motion. In this procedure, the coupling terms between the different modes of motion are properly formulated and taken into account (Cummins, 1962; Faltinsen, 1990). The floating WEC is connected to an underwater hydraulic cylinder that feeds a hydraulic system with pressurized oil. The performance of the system under the combined excitation of both first- and second order wave loads is here analyzed. To this end, the diffraction forces originated from the second order wave potentials are computed using a semi- analytical formulation which, by extension of the associated first-order solution, is based on matched axisymmetric eieenfunction expansions.

Floaters of fish farms are typically small compared to dimensioning waves. The local two-dimensional problem of a floater subject to beam sea regular waves is considered. The problem is addressed by means of numerical simulations, model tests and simplified numerical models. A CFD numerical wave tank (NWT) for fully nonlinear wave body interaction problems is developed. The numerical model applies a one-fluid model, where a fractional step approach is used to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in time on a Cartesian staggered grid. Further, a combined Constrained Interpolation Profile (CIP-) and finite difference procedure is used. An immersed boundary technique is applied to impose boundary conditions on the floater. Two sets of model tests have been conducted. In the first set, wave loads on fixed horizontal cylinders in beam sea waves were studied. The purpose was to obtain validation data for the numerical wave tank. Two models were tested. One with a circular cross-section and one with a rectangular cross-section. Model draft was varied. Other test parameters were wave period and wave steepness. The primary variables measured were the clamping forces of the model and the wave elevation at eight positions in the flume. Numerical simulations similar to the physical experiments were performed and results compared, showing good agreement. Wave over-topping on the models was observed, both in the experiments and in the simulations. In {{the second set of}} experiments, a <b>floating</b> circular <b>cylinder</b> in beam sea regular waves was tested. The cylinder was moored using pre-tensioned mooring lines, yielding a natural frequency of the sway motion which is representative for fish farms. Primary variables measured here were the model accelerations used to obtain the body motion, surface elevation and mooring line forces. Results were compared with linear potential flow theory, semi-empirical theories and simulations with the CIP-based numerical wave tank. An instability phenomenon was observed in the experiments when the wave frequency was two times the natural frequency in sway, causing large amplitude sway motion which is not predicted by linear potential flow theory. The same instability behaviour was also observed in simulations with the CIP-based numerical wave tank and is believed to be due to nonlinear hydrodynamic effects. Experiments and numerical simulations also shows that linear potential flow theory largely over-predicts the sway motion near resonance. This is explained by effects of viscous flow separation. It is also shown that higher order harmonics of the wave loads can be significant and should be considered when fatigue analyses of fish farms are performed. IntelliSTRUC...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{unsteady}} motion {{caused by an}} impulse acting at time t= 0 on a small <b>cylinder</b> <b>floating</b> horizontally at a liquid-gas interface. This is {{a model for the}} impact of a cylinder onto a liquid surface after the initial splash. Following the impulse, the motion of the cylinder is determined by its weight per unit length (pulling it into the bulk liquid) and resistance from the liquid, which acts to keep the cylinder at the interface. The range of cylinder radii r and impact speeds U considered is such that the resistance from the liquid comes from both the interfacial tension and hydrodynamic pressures. We use two theoretical approaches to investigate this problem. In the first, we apply the arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) method developed by Li et al. ["An arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method for moving-boundary problems and its application to jumping over water," J. Comput. Phys. 208, 289 (2005) ] to compute the fluid flow caused by the impulse and the (coupled) motion of the cylinder. We show that at early times the interfacial deformation is given by a family of shapes parametrized by r/t 2 / 3. We also find that for a given density and radius there is a critical impulse speed below which the cylinder is captured by the interface and floats but above which it pierces the interface and sinks. Our second theoretical approach is a simplified one in which we assume that the interface is in equilibrium and derive an ordinary differential equation for the motion of the cylinder. Solving this we again find the existence of a critical impulse speed for sinking giving us some quantitative understanding of the results from the ALE simulations. Finally, we compare our theoretical predictions with the results of experiments for cylinder impacts by Vella and Metcalfe ["Surface tension dominated impact," Phys. Fluids 19, 072108 (2007) ]. This comparison suggests that the influence of contact line effects, neglected here, may be important in the transition from floating to sinking. © 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Floating wind {{turbines}} (FWTs) are proposed {{as a method}} to harness the significant wind energy resource in deep water. International research efforts {{have led to the}} development of coupled numerical global analysis tools for FWTs in order to understand their behavior under wind and wave actions. The hydrodynamic models in such tools are typically based on first-(and second-) order potential flow theory, sometimes also including Morison s equation. In order to accurately model highly nonlinear waves, their interaction with a floating platform, and obtain estimates of the resulting loads on the structure, a numerical wave tank approach is generally needed. In this thesis, the response of floating structures to nonlinear wave loading is investigated by means of two different numerical approaches: a fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF solver and a second-order potential flow theory solver. Firstly, the fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes/VOF numerical wave tank, developed within the open-source CFD toolbox OpenFOAMframework (version 1606 +), is validated against experimental data for two cases. These comprise the response of a 2 D floating box and a 3 D <b>floating</b> vertical <b>cylinder.</b> In order to model the motions of the floating structures, together with the generation and absorption of the waves, the interDyMFoam solver, provided by the OpenFOAMlibrary, is extended with the waves 2 Foam package, developed by Jacobsen at al. (2012). Furthermore, a simple catenary mooring line is implemented for the moored cases. Secondly, a potential flow theory based model of the OC 5 -semisubmersible floating platform is generated. The frequency-domain analysis is done with the Wadam software and the time-domain simulations with SIMO. This model is validated against measurement data from a 1 : 50 scale test campaign performed at the MARIN offshore wave basin and the fully nonlinear validated CFD model. Lastly, both numerical models of the OC 5 -semisubmersible are compared in order to assess the suitability of the diffraction model in two different conditions where nonlinearities are of relevance. The first one involves very long waves, with periods close to 20 s, which are likely to take place under swell wave conditions. These may excite the OC 5 -semisubmersible platform in heave at its natural frequency. The second situation deals with regular waves with increasing steepness. In principle, the fully nonlinear CFD model, if no experimental data is available, is needed to calibrate the diffraction model. However, once the latter is adjusted and validated, results are given at a much lower computational cost. According to the computations throughout this work, when dealing with waves with high steepness and high excitation frequencies, the motions, as well as the peak forces, are properly captured by the diffraction model. However, other local effects of importance for offshore structures, such as wave run-up, or the different components in frequency of the loading, require the use of a fully nonlinear CFD solver. Therefore for preliminary design stages a diffraction model is able to give suitable results regarding the motions and peak inline and vertical forces at a much lower computational cost; however, for detailed design, or optimisation phase stages, where local effects are of relevance, a fully nonlinear CFD model is required...|$|R
40|$|Studies about ocean waves {{have been}} {{evolving}} {{over a period}} of time. Re¬cently, there has been renewed interest in problems of refraction, diﬀraction and radiation of ocean waves around structures. In this thesis, the analytic solutions for linear waves propagating in an ocean with variable bottom to¬pography and their applications in renewable wave energy are presented. In the ﬁrst part, we present an analytic solution to the shallow water wave equa¬tion for long waves propagating over a circular hump. As a useful tool in coastal engineering, the solution may be used to study the refraction of long waves around a circular hump. It may also be used as a validation tool for any numerical model developed for coastal wave refraction. To validate the new analytic solution, we have compared our new analytical solution with a numerical solution obtained by using the ﬁnite diﬀerence method. The agreement between these two solutions is excellent. By using the analytic solution, the eﬀect of the hump dimensions on wave refraction over the circular hump are examined. In the second part of this thesis, based on the mild-slope equation derived by Smith and Sprinks [1] and the extended refraction-diﬀraction equation developed by Massel [2], we have constructed a two-layer mild-slope equation for interfacial waves propagating on the interface of a two-layer ocean model. First, we follow Smith and Sprinks’s [1] approach to derive the mild-slope equation for the propagation of interfacial waves, with the higher-order terms proportional to the bottom slope and bottom curvature all being neglected. We then derived the extended version of the mild-slope equation with the higher-order terms included. While we were able to solve the ﬁrst equation analytically, we presented a numerical solution for the second equation. As a part of the veriﬁcation process, both solutions were compared with each other and also with the single-layer mild-slope equation when the density of the upper layer goes to zero. We then used the new solution to study the eﬀect of the hump dimensions on the refraction of the interfacial waves over a circular hump. Finally, in the ﬁnal section of this thesis, we have used what we have developed before to construct the two-layer mild-slope equation with free surface on top. By utilizing this equation, we then derived an analytic solu¬tion for long waves propagating over a circular hump with a hollow circular <b>cylinder</b> <b>ﬂoating</b> in the free surface. In order to validate our new analytic solution, we have compared our problem with Mac Camy and Fuchs [3] solu¬tion, because our solution has reduced to their solution when the lower water depth, h 2, goes to zero. We have also compared our solution with the ﬂat bottom case in order to further veriﬁed our solution. Finally, by using the new solution, both diﬀraction and refraction eﬀects from the hollow cylinder and hump dimensions are examined and discussed...|$|R
