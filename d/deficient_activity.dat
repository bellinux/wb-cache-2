50|$|In rd1 animals, the retinal rod {{photoreceptor}} cells begin degenerating {{at about}} postnatal day 10, and by 3 weeks no rod photoreceptors remain. Degeneration is preceded by accumulation of cGMP in the retina and is correlated with <b>deficient</b> <b>activity</b> of the rod photoreceptor cGMP-phosphodiesterase.

The possibility of altering the course of retinal degeneration through subretinal injection of recombinant replication defective adenovirus that contained the murine cDNA for wildtype PDE6β was tested in rd1 mice. Subretinal injection of rd1 mice was carried out 4 days after birth, before the onset of rod photoreceptor degeneration. Following therapy, Pde6β transcripts and enzyme activity were detected, and histologic studies revealed that photoreceptor cell death was significantly retarded.|$|E
50|$|OHS is a milder allelic {{variant of}} Menkes disease, having a later age of onset and being {{associated}} with far less severe central neurodegeneration. The milder nature of OHS is often attributable to ‘leaky’ splice junction mutations that allow 20-30% of ATP7A messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts to be correctly processed. As in cases of Menkes disease, individuals with OHS manifest connective tissue abnormalities resulting from <b>deficient</b> <b>activity</b> of lysyl oxidase, a copper-requiring enzyme that normally deaminates lysine and hydroxylysine in {{the first step of}} collagen crosslink formation. Such individuals also often endure inconvenient dysautonomic signs and symptoms related to a partial deficiency in dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. DBH, another copper-dependent enzyme, normally converts dopamine to norepinephrine, a crucial neurotransmitter in norepinephrinergic neurons. A natural mouse model of OHS, the so-called mottled blotchy model, recapitulates the connective tissue abnormalities, DBH deficiency and mild CNS damage seen in humans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dermatological}} {{symptoms of}} PCT that include blistering and lesions on sun-exposed {{areas of the}} skin are caused by a buildup of porphyrin compounds (specifically uroporphyrinogen) {{close to the surface}} of the skin that have been oxidized by free radicals or sunlight. The oxidized porphyrins initiate degranulation of dermal mast cells, which release proteases that catabolize the surrounding proteins. [...] This begins a cell mediated positive feedback loop which matches the description of a type 4 delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The resulting blisters therefore do not appear immediately, but begin to show up 2-3 days after sun exposure. Due to the highly conjugated structure of porphyrins involving alternating single and double carbon bonds, these compounds exhibit a deep purple color, resulting in the discoloration observed in the skin. Excess alcohol intake decreases hepcidin production which leads to increased iron absorption from the gut and an increase in oxidative stress. This oxidative stress then leads to inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, creating an excess of uroporphyrinogen III which is oxidized from the relatively harmless porphyrinogens into their reduced porphyrins form. [...] Concentrated instances of oxidative stress (alcohol, physical trauma, psychological stress, etc) cause the liver to hemorrhage these porphyrins into the blood stream where they are then susceptible to oxidation.The strong association of PCT with Hepatitis C infection is not entirely understood. Studies have suggested that the cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes can lead to the release of free iron. This iron can disrupt the activity of cytochrome p450, releasing activated oxygen species. These can oxidize the UROD substrate uroporphyrinogen, which can result in the inhibition of UROD and lead to <b>deficient</b> <b>activity</b> of this key enzyme.|$|E

40|$|Molybdenum {{cofactor}} deficiency (MoCoD) is a fatal disorder manifesting, {{shortly after}} birth, with profound neurological abnormalities, mental retardation, and severe seizures unresponsive to any therapy.

50|$|Mutations in the AMT gene are {{associated}} with Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), which is an inborn error of glycine metabolism defined by <b>deficient</b> <b>activity</b> of the glycine cleavage enzyme and, as a consequence, accumulation of large quantities of glycine in all body tissues including the brain. The majority of glycine encephalopathy presents in the neonatal period (85% as the neonatal severe form and 15% as the neonatal attenuated form). Of those presenting in infancy, 50% have the infantile attenuated form and 50% have the infantile severe form. Overall, 20% of all children presenting as either neonates or infants have a less severe outcome, defined as developmental quotient greater than 20. A minority of patients have mild or atypical forms of glycine encephalopathy. The neonatal form manifests in the first hours to days of life with progressive lethargy, hypotonia, and myoclonic jerks leading to apnea and often death. Surviving infants have profound intellectual disability and intractable seizures. The infantile form is characterized by hypotonia, developmental delay, and seizures. The atypical forms range from milder disease, with onset from late infancy to adulthood, to rapidly progressing and severe disease with late onset. Glycine encephalopathy is suspected in individuals with elevated glycine concentration in blood and CSF. An increase in CSF glycine concentration together with an increased CSF-to-plasma glycine ratio suggests the diagnosis. Enzymatic confirmation of the diagnosis relies on measurement of glycine cleavage system (GCS) enzyme activity in liver obtained by open biopsy or autopsy. The majority of affected individuals have no detectable enzyme activity. The three genes in which biallelic mutations are known to cause glycine encephalopathy are: GLDC (encoding the P-protein component of the GCS complex and accounting for 70%-75% of disease), AMT (accounting for ~20% of disease), and GCSH (encoding the H-protein component of the GCS complex and accounting for <1% of disease). About 5% of individuals with enzyme-proven glycine encephalopathy {{do not have a}} mutation in any of these three genes and have a variant form of glycine encephalopathy.|$|E

In studies on a genetically determined disorder characterized by <b>deficient</b> <b>activity</b> of an enzyme described as a lysosomal lipase (4) or a lysosomal esterase (2), {{it was found that the}} lymphocytes from such patients did not contain a fatty acid ester hydrolase (1 -naphthyl acetate. pH 5. 8, resistant to 10 ’ M E 600 and 7 10 M NaF) which in lymphocytes from normal control patients has the appearance of lysosomal localization (1). This ab-sence has also been shown by biochemical assay (5) and the test is now used routinely for the diagnosis of Wolman’s disease and its clinical variants. I would suggest that the esterase with <b>deficient</b> <b>activity</b> in Wolman’s disease is probably identical to that of band 2 since this was the only band in lymphocytes resistant to fluoride.
