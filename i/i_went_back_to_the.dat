On the top of the wall, about 25 meters high, the prisoners of war were rounded up in a line. They were being stabbed by bayonets and shoved away off the wall. A number of Japanese soldiers polished their bayonets, shouted to themselves once and thrust their bayonets in the chest or back of POWs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sutcliffe {{assaulted}} {{a prostitute}} {{he had met}} whilst searching {{for a woman who}} had tricked him out of money. He left his friend's minivan and walked up St Paul's Road in Bradford until he was out of sight. When he returned, he was out of breath, {{as if he had been}} running. He told his friend Trevor Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, [...] "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> car and got in it".|$|E
2500|$|On May 24, 2011, McKinney {{appeared}} on state-run television in Libya {{and stated that}} United States participation in military intervention in the 2011 Libyan civil war was [...] "...not what {{the people of the}} United States stand for and it's not what African-Americans stand for". Also on Memri-TV, McKinney stated [...] "On a previous visit to Libya, I was able to learn about the Green Book, and the form of direct democracy that is advocated in The Green Book. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, I spoke with Senator Mike Gravel, who was a presidential candidate, just like me, in 2008, because he too is pushing a form of direct democracy for the United States. That is because the government of the United States fails to represent the interests of the American people now. The government is here, and the people of the US are here." ...|$|E

[...] Musicians and songwriters she collaborated with during the recording process include Holly Knight, Nina Gordon, Kay Hanley, John 5, Billy Steinberg, Matthew Wilder, Cyndi Lauper, Courtney Love, Joan Jett, and Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Sunday Love was not released at the time, due to Dobson being terminated by Island Records {{just days before the}} album was scheduled for release. The album was reviewed favorably in both Spin and Vibe magazine. [...] "My real good fans, my hardcore fans, have it, so that's most important," [...] Dobson says. [...] "At least it got out there to a few hands, and now it's time to make a record on my own terms." [...] "It was sad," [...] says Dobson. [...] "But instead of sitting there and being depressed and begging people for the record, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio, got people that I knew, friends that I knew, and I started again." ...|$|E

Kravitz immediately asked Blackman to fly out to LA. [...] "Lenny asked me can you play something for me over the phone", Blackman says. [...] "So I put the phone down and I started playing something like, BOOSH-bat-bat, BOOSH-BOOSH-BOOSH-bat, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phone and I said, 'Can you hear that?' He said, 'Yeah. Can you fly out to L.A. right now?'" [...] "I flew out the next morning. While I'm downstairs waiting for the instruments to come from the studio, these people started coming in. First 12, and then like 30 more. I was like, 'whoa, this is an audition'. I ended up playing and instead of staying for one or two days, I stayed for two weeks and did the first video that I did with him, [...] "Are You Gonna Go My Way". Apart from 2004, I played with him ever since." ...|$|E

I used to go painting, as you know, when I had any time off, and I went to one village in Normandy, and painted it, because I had picked it {{particularly}} and it was a waste of time, because everybody" [...] "had got through," [...] " [...] and I found what I had thought in the rubble were a whole row of footballs, and they weren't footballs - I was sitting right beside them, painting - and they weren't footballs, they were children's heads, and what it was, I discovered later, was a whole school of kids, a convent, had been pulled out of school, out of class, and lined up in this little narrow alleyway between the buildings to save them from the bombing, and the whole thing had come in on top of them, plus the nuns, but by that time [...] they were lice-ridden, and there was nothing. I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that. A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled away down the rubble." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{most famous}} Crow leaders to {{encounter}} the Little People was the legendary Crow chief Plenty Coups (Aleek-chea-ahoosh). When he {{was nine years}} old, Plenty Coup's older brother (who was a great warrior and quite handsome, and whom Plenty Coups loved deeply) was killed by raiding Lakotas. Although the tribe was preparing to move out, Plenty Coups fasted for four days, used the sweat lodge, rubbed his body with sage and cedar to remove any smell, and then went into the nearby hills where he had a vision. In his vision, {{the chief of the}} Little People took him into a spirit-world lodge, where Plenty Coups saw representations of nature (the wind, the stars, thunder, the Moon, bad storms, etc.). The dwarf chief demanded that Plenty Coups count coup, but since Plenty Coups was just nine years of age he knew that he had no great deeds to count. Nonetheless, the chief of the Little People recounted two great deeds to the spirits gathered in the lodge, and said that Plenty Coups would not only accomplish these deeds but many others as well. He also prophesied that Plenty Coups would become chief of his people, if he used his wits, and then advised Plenty Coups to develop his willpower so that he could lead his people. [...] "I had a will and I would use it, make it work for me, as the Dwarf-chief had advised. I became very happy, lying there looking up into the sky. My heart began to sing like a bird, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, needing no man to tell me the meaning of my dream. I took a sweat-bath and rested in my father's lodge. I knew myself now." ...|$|E
