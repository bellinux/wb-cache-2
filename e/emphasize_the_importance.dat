The climax of the film also proved difficult to make. He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention.

5|$|The modern {{family is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} originated in the 1830s: courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, married couples began to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships. This led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced many women into the workplace in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In 1932, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working.|$|E
5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that the hips face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E

Gordon Allport, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers were all advocates of the uniqueness of individuals.

This approach has led to important results in explaining acquisition phenomena such as mutual exclusivity, one-trial learning or fast mapping, and the use of social intentions.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} panels contain both {{saints and}} donors; the kneeling donors face inwards towards the center panel. These exterior panels are unusual for devotional triptychs {{of the period}} in that the donors face each other, seemingly without an object for their devotion; the usual convention was to show them facing saints. Art historians speculate Memling meant to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the devotional scenes on the interior panels by having the donors gaze directly at the opening between the panel doors.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of contact mechanics in the mid-twentieth century may be attributed to names such as Bowden and Tabor. Bowden and Tabor were the first to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of surface roughness for bodies in contact. Through investigation of the surface roughness, the true contact area between friction partners is found to be less than the apparent contact area. Such understanding also drastically changed the direction of undertakings in tribology. The works of Bowden and Tabor yielded several theories in contact mechanics of rough surfaces.|$|E

She cited a number of cases to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of the state taking responsibility for this class of unfortunates. Dix's plea was to provide moral treatment for the mentally ill, which consisted of three values: modesty, chastity, and delicacy.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{this is a}} rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} by which cells {{synthesize}} glucose from metabolic precursors. The blood glucose level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression. To <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of PEPCK in glucose homeostasis, over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far {{the most common form of}} diabetes in humans. Due to the importance of blood glucose homeostasis, a number of hormones regulate a set of genes (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of glucose synthesis.|$|E

Crops from the New World began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and the Philippines; these crops included corn, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and squash. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were previously unused.|$|E

At the same time, Raymond Borel, {{the editor of the}} French medical journal TONUS, had started a group called Secours Médical Français ("French Medical Relief") in {{response}} to the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed at least 625,000 in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Borel had intended to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disasters. On 22 December 1971, the two groups of colleagues merged to form Médecins Sans Frontières.|$|E
25|$|With the {{reduction}} {{of the size of the}} ROC armed forces in recent years, the Army has endured the largest number of cutbacks as ROC military doctrine has begun to <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of offshore engagement with the Navy and Air Force. Subsequent to this shift in emphasis, the ROC Navy and Air Force have taken precedence over the ROC Army in defense doctrine and weapons procurement. Recent short-term goals in the Army include acquisition and development of joint command and control systems, advanced attack helicopters and armored vehicles, Multiple Launch Rocket System and field air defense systems. The Army is also in the process of transitioning to an all volunteer force.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, a new {{theoretical}} trend {{had emerged}} in several Western European communist parties {{that came to}} be known as Eurocommunism. Rejecting the domination of the Soviet Communist Party, it emphasized the development of theories and practices that were more applicable to Western Europe. The Soviet government disliked this Eurocommunist trend, and hoped that through holding a conference, they could achieve a document constituting a de facto charter of the European communist movement which would maintain their dominant role. Soviet discourse did at the time <b>emphasize</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of a united communist movement across the continent, denying differences between parties and labelling the distinction between Eastern and Western Europe as artificial.|$|E
