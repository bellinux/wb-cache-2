5|$|Pierlot and Spaak, {{together}} with Pierlot's family, crossed into Francoist Spain with an official visa, but {{were arrested in}} Barcelona and held under house arrest in a hotel. On 18 October, they escaped from confinement and headed for Portugal where the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar, although neutral, was more sympathetic to the Allied cause than Spain. They <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> in London on 22 October.|$|E
5|$|After {{being fully}} {{repaired}} following the earthquake {{and the ensuing}} tsunami, ICGV Þór was delivered to ICG authorities and personnel at the ASMAR shipyard on 23 September 2011. The ship then embarked on the voyage to Reykjavík harbour, and was slated to arrive in late October of the same year. After making stops {{in cities such as}} Halifax, Nova Scotia, the ship <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> in Reykjavík on 27 October 2011. The vessel maintains a complement (number of personnel on board the ship) of 48.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, compact discs were making {{significant}} headway as a storage medium {{for music and}} video games. NEC {{had been the first}} to use compact disc technology in a video game console with their PC Engine CD-ROM² System add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months. That same year, Nintendo announced a partnership with Sony to develop its own CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Commodore International released their CD-based CDTV multimedia system centered in early 1991, while long-in-waiting CD-i from Philips <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> towards the end of that year.|$|E
5|$|Daud Khan, who {{launched}} his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> at the Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms of surrender and payment of tribute were not {{acceptable to the}} Chiros'; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chiro rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Chiros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied by Daud Khan, and the Chiros fled to the jungles. Hindus were driven out, the temples were destroyed, and Islamic rule imposed.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E

50|$|In January 1945 the {{officers}} were marched out westward, <b>finally</b> <b>arriving</b> at Oflag III-A in Luckenwalde, south of Berlin. On 21 April 1945 the Red Army liberated the camp. On 5 May 1945 the Norwegians were transported east to a camp near Lignica in Silesia, then travelled for several days by train to Hamburg and Aarhus, Denmark, <b>finally</b> <b>arriving</b> in Oslo on 28 May 1945.|$|R
5|$|Foster and Eddy <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they}} found their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he had eaten the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{benefited from}} Montagu's withdrawal, {{as his own}} {{battered}} fleet passed close {{to the scene of}} this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, the Skagen Fisherman's Association was {{established}} {{with the purpose}} of facilitating the local fishing industry through the railway. In 1890, the Skagensbanen narrow-gauge railway from Frederikshavn <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> in Skagen, connecting the town to the rest of Denmark. The tracks were widened in 1916 to avoid the need to transfer cargoes of fish in Frederikshavn. Many of the town's typical yellow-plastered houses with red roofs which grew up along Sankt Laurentii Vej from 1890 to 1930 were designed by Ulrik Plesner. He was also the architect behind many other buildings in the town, including the railway station, Brøndums Hotel and Skagen Museum. Skagen Missionshus was opened in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Kippenberger <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> on the Western Front in September 1916, as {{a private}} in the 1st Canterbury Regiment. His arrival at the front coincided with the Somme Offensive. He {{took part in the}} Battle of Flers-Courcelette which began on 15 September and {{remained}} in the front lines for over three weeks before the regiment was withdrawn. His unit suffered heavy casualties during this time; Kippenberger was one of just five soldiers left in his platoon after the battle ended.|$|E
5|$|Success <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> {{during the}} 2001–02 season. Arsenal {{finished}} seven points above Liverpool {{to win the}} Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final. Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club. There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.|$|E
5|$|While La Salle was gone, six {{of those}} who had {{remained}} on the Belle <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the Belle was always drunk. Many of the sailors {{did not know how to}} sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his studies, ML Pin accompanied Princess Kalyanga Sombati Kitiyakara on a one-month trip in Europe. Upon return to London, {{he attended the}} First World Conference on Adult Education on behalf of Siam, but {{during the same time}} his health deteriorated further, and he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Accordingly, his return trip to Siam had to be postponed in order for him to recover in Switzerland. There he spent almost two years in Davos and later Klosters, until September 1931 when he attended the League of Nations annual conference before returning to Siam via a Nippon Yusen ship departing from Naples, Italy. He <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> in Siam on 23 October 1931, after spending over nine years abroad.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> in mid-October, he came straight back into the side after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used on the right of midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. The goal earned him the club's Moment of the Season award.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E
5|$|Charles and Zita {{temporarily}} resided at Castle Tata, {{the home}} of Count Esterházy, until a suitable permanent exile could be found. Malta was mooted as a possibility, but was declined by Lord Curzon, and French territory was ruled out due {{to the possibility of}} Zita's brothers intriguing on Charles's behalf. Eventually, the Portuguese island of Madeira was chosen. On 31 October 1921, the former Imperial couple were taken by rail from Tihany to Baja, where the Royal Navy monitor HMS Glowworm was waiting. They <b>finally</b> <b>arrived</b> at Funchal on 19 November. Their children were being looked after at Wartegg Castle in Switzerland by Charles's step-grandmother Maria Theresa, although Zita managed to see them in Zurich when her son Robert needed an operation for appendicitis. The children joined their parents in Madeira in February 1922.|$|E
