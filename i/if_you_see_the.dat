When mixing the soundtrack in Dolby Atmos, as Favreau said, [...] "we isolated instruments when we could. And in the sound mix, we created a Fantasound mix. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> film in Atmos, you will feel that there are instruments that move around the theater." [...] A mention for Fantasound appears in the film's closing credits.|$|E

Nicole Scherzinger told MTV News that the video was all about having fun. [...] "Busta Rhymes is pretty phat, man. He is so much fun. He's so humble and he just makes you feel good. When you're around him, you feel magical. The lyrics are, 'Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me.'... But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> video, it's all about being who you are, having fun and being confident — and feeling hot. It's not so much about looking hot ... although looking hot is important." ...|$|E

I do not think it likely they will do so; still it is best to be prepared, and in that case you must paddle far away in the recesses. They might search for a long time before they find you. I trust that your imprisonment here will not be long, but that we may hit upon some plan of getting you out of the citadel. I would gladly go with you to share your solitude, but I must remain outside to plan some way of escape." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{death of}} Mr. [...] "Josh Billings" [...] may have diminished {{the stock of}} {{harmless}} pleasures, but can hardly {{be said to have}} eclipsed the gaiety of nations. In this country, at least, however it may have been in the States, Josh Billings was by no means the favourite or leading American humorist. If phonetic spelling were universal, much of his fun would disappear. His place was nearer that of Orpheus C. Kerr than of Artemus Ward, or of Mark Twain. It has long been the English habit to look for most of our broad fun across the Atlantic. Americans say we are not a funny people. A chivalrous and mediaeval French writer, not unfrequently quoted, once made a kindred remark. We are not at present a boisterously comic lot of geniuses, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tears running down the eyes of a fellow-countryman reading in a railway carriage, if he be writhing with mirth too powerful for expression, the odds are that he has got hold of a Yankee book.|$|E

Occasionally getting up to dip the towel in water and tie it on again, he continued at this employment for nearly three hours; then folded up the leaves of writing, woke the boy, and gave them to him, with this remarkable expression: [...] "Now, then, young sleepy-head, quick march! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> governor, tell him to have the money ready for me when I call for it." [...] The boy grinned and disappeared. I was sorely tempted to follow [...] "sleepy-head," [...] but, on reflection, considered it safest still to keep my eye on the proceedings of Mr. Jay.|$|E
