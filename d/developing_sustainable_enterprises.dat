40|$|Our {{world in}} the 21 st Century {{is one of a}} “crisis society”. That is, we have reached a state where most of our major systems – economic, environmental, social – in are crisis and in need of restructuring. We can see this play out in the global financial, climate, social and {{identity}} crises we face. The underlying causes of these crises are our current systems of production and consumption. We suggest the solution lies in moving beyond addressing the crises individually and symptomatically towards <b>developing</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprises,</b> sustainable communities and sustainable lifestyles. From these perspectives, we can begin understand better the interrelationships creating this crisis society and more holistically address and repair the damage we done to the Earth and ourselves. We conclude by identifying areas of future research needed to facilitate this movement towards a sustainable society...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the world, {{there are}} imperatives and {{opportunities}} to <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprises</b> based on plants and animals to alleviate poverty. This is true for indigenous people across northern Australia, although to date there has been very limited commercial use of wildlife within indigenous Australian communities. In this study, we examine factors affecting the establishment of enterprises utilising animal species in remote indigenous communities and suggest ways of improving uptake. We found four major areas affecting the progress of these enterprises: a lack of comprehensive market information and dissemination of that knowledge; a lack of basic infrastructure and training; {{a need for more}} appropriate and flexible government policy and regulation; and adverse public perceptions. Commercialisation of native species is at a relatively early stage compared to tropical Asia, Africa and South America, and development of these enterprises has the potential to benefit indigenous livelihoods in remote and marginal areas in Australia...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper can be segmented into three parts. The first segment aims {{to understand the}} concept of sustainability by looking at the evolution of the definition over time, as well as relevant scientifically founded frameworks that explain the root causes that have generated our current unsustainable state of society. e second segment looks at stories of enterprises that have managed to successfully integrate sustainability into their business model to <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> on-going operations that have bene ted all stakeholders involved equitably. The third segment is an initial assessment of the Peruvian alpaca wool sector to demonstrate some of the challenges entrepreneurs face to <b>develop</b> a <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise,</b> as well as probe applicability of the tools we developed from our work in the previous two segments. Findings from the first and second segments of this paper served as fundamental basis for the development of our output: The Bottom-up pyramid model, and the Sustainability guiding principles. The Bottom-up pyramid model visually represents our understanding of the required components to <b>develop</b> a <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> from the ground up. The main takeaway of this representation is that a <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> should be founded on knowledge from the incumbent community home to a natural resource, and that business development and growth should be bottom-up, taking into account community concerns and points of view. e Sustainability guiding principles are a list of guidelines entrepre- neurs can use to get a better understanding of some of the challenges they may face when attempting to <b>develop</b> a <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> in a rural community. Ultimately, these instruments are aimed at providing guidance to leaders and entrepreneurs who want to establish business models with sustainable operations that do not compromise the long- term welfare of a natural resource and the community reliant on it. e last segment of this paper aims to probe the tools we developed to iterate their practicality and relevance with a contemporary real-world situation. We chose the alpaca wool sector in Peru because it is representative of the types of hurdles leaders could face when attempting to initiate a <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Additionally, one of the team’s researchers had access to stakeholders in this sector, which provided primary research to complement and corroborate our literary review. is assessment is an initial step that needs further validation with more pragmatic information and on-site data for a more detailed analysis of the issues hindering specific communities in the Andes...|$|R
40|$|Vuk’uphile Learnership {{programme}} is {{a contractor}} development programme by the Government of South Africa aimed at developing emerging contractors into fully fledged contractors able to execute labour intensive projects. Despite government’s commitment to emerging contractor empowerment {{there are reports}} of poor performance by emerging contractors under the learnership, this includes contractor turnover, some of the projects undertaken had been abandoned, and some of the contractors or entities who participated in the programme were not in the construction industry anymore. This study examines progress of Vuk’uphile 2, whether it is achieving its intended objectives in the Eastern Cape or not. This study followed a qualitative approach, semi structured interviews and documentary analysis was used for collecting data. The findings indicate that the programme has a potential of utilizing infrastructure development projects to <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprises</b> and draw significant numbers of people into meaningful participation in the construction industry. Of the contractors who completed the prescripts of the programme turned to be successful even after learnership. The study recommends that systems of selecting learners, trainers and mentors be strengthened and should be inducted on their respective roles in Vuk’uphile. Mentors should be afforded constant performance evaluation...|$|R
40|$|More than 45 % of Fiji’s {{population}} {{lives in the}} rural areas and a significantly large proportion lives on meager income. There have been many efforts in the past to improve rural economy in Fiji but only limited successes have been achieved. There are many constraints that hinder sustainable development of this sector. A wide range of well designed policies are needed to increase primary production and simultaneously <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> agribusiness <b>enterprises</b> to add value and generate more rural income. This paper analyses these issues and delves on policy prescriptions to create the right business environment to encourage agripreneurs to boost farm production through scientific commercial farming. It further argues that strengthening agribusiness linkages with small-scale farmers would provide both the basis and means of rural economy contributing to poverty reduction and sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of {{university}} education is to prepare young people to be responsible citizens for the future. In the business world, the notion of sustainability is increasingly recognised as an important agenda. Both the Higher Education Funding Council (2008) and the Quality Assurance Agency (2014) acknowledge the critical role {{of higher education in}} educating socially responsible and ethically aware graduates. In line with this trend, many business schools have responded by offering sustainability related subjects and exploring pedagogical tools for engagement. Developing sustainability literacy (Stibbe 2011), shifting mindsets (Stubbs and Cocklin, 2008), developing critical thinking skills (Brookfield, 2011) and creating significant learning experiences for students (Dee Fink 2003) are just some examples of approaches which have proved successful. However, such initiatives and the concept of sustainability itself pose some difficult educational challenges for both educators and students. This paper explores the impact of an innovative module on business and sustainability entitled <b>Develop</b> <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Enterprises</b> which is offered as an option to second year students in the Business School at Canterbury Christ Church University. This is the second year that the module has run and sixty five students elected to participate. Evidence of impact has been gathered (a) using a pre and post module questionnaire; (b) through the ‘voices’ of four students who have responded to the module in different ways. Tutor reflections provide an additional viewpoint. The student contributions make this an unusual and strongly grounded presentation which will illustrate a shared experience between students and tutor on a learning journey...|$|R
40|$|The Westerwald Prize is {{an internationally}} {{recognised}} ceramics competition held {{at one of}} Germany’s principal ceramic museums. The AHRB funded research project which resulted in these ceramic tiles aimed {{to assess the impact}} of integrating digital technologies into the process of designing and making low relief ceramic surfaces in the wider context of <b>developing</b> <b>sustainable</b> creative <b>enterprise</b> in the Southwest. Through practice based research methods the project developed a range of digitally based strategies for creating low relief ceramic surfaces with new aesthetic qualities. This research informed the development of the final design for the ceramic tiles produced in collaboration with Dartington Pottery. The production of batches of tiles through collaboration with this SME was a key element in the project. The collaboration sought to test the combining of digital design and production techniques with established crafts knowledge and local production in order to develop a model of <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> appropriate to the region and potentially beyond. The research can be regarded as making a contribution to the body of knowledge which seeks to establish a place for digital design and production systems alongside more established ceramic making technologies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{social enterprise}} sustainability by comparing recent international research with prior findings seeking {{to identify the}} important factors that facilitate social enterprise development. Design/methodology/approach: The research used a concurrent, convergent mixed methods approach on a sample of 93 social enterprise leaders using surveys and face-to-face interviews. The participants were sourced from a cross-section of social enterprise organisational types from urban and regional locations in Australia and Scotland. Findings: The findings support prior research, identifying resourcing, organisational capabilities, collaborative networks and legitimacy as influential {{in the success of}} social enterprises. However, the research contributes new knowledge by revealing an overarching growth orientation as the dominant factor in the strategic management for sustainability of these ventures. This growth orientation is generally associated with the intent to achieve profitability. Thus, social enterprise managers view a commercially focused growth orientation as an overarching strategic factor that underpins organisational sustainability. Originality/value: The paper delivers new insights into the strategic orientation of social ventures of benefit to policy makers and practitioners alike. The findings are significant for policy makers providing perspectives into how governmental assistance can be targeted to <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> social <b>enterprises,</b> particularly the need to support the growth of these ventures. Similarly practitioners are alerted to the strategic imperatives of incorporating a commercially focused growth orientation and the latent potential that exists in the networks of social enterprise...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} faced {{with the problem of}} {{integration}} between sustainable business functions. Sustainability data are not sufficiently integrated and used for decision making. To solve this problem, organisations need information systems to facilitate their sustainability initiatives. A number of vendors such as SAP, Microsoft and Oracle have <b>developed</b> <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Resource Planning (S-ERP) systems as a holistic solution to support sustainability initiatives. However, organisations still face the problem of implementing this system. There is a lack of master plan, which shows the stages, dimensions and steps to assist the practitioners in implementing S-ERP systems. Therefore, this study attempts to develop an S-ERP implementation master plan that consists of roadmap, framework and guidelines, and to evaluate the usability of the master plan from academicians and practitioners perspective. In order to attain the research objectives, this study employs a conceptual research method which relies primarily on the literature {{for the development of a}} master plan. Various research fields including sustainability, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and relevant literature were observed in order to discover how academicians and practitioners solved the problems of integration between sustainable business functions. Since an S-ERP system is a complex system that needs appropriate strategy and planning, various concepts including project management, strategic management, and sustainability were hugely employed in developing the master plan. In addition, the usability of the master plan was evaluated by 12 experts from the academia and industry via a peer review method. This evaluation consists of two main phases including data collection through semi-structured interview and data analysis using ATLAS. ti 6 software. As a result, the roadmap in the S-ERP system implementation master plan was divided into two concepts: general overview and specific features, followed by the purpose of each step. Moreover, the framework in the S-ERP system implementation master plan was divided into two frameworks: sustainability implementation portfolio and S-ERP implementation project. Following the concept employed in the frameworks, the guidelines were divided into two guidelines: sustainability implementation portfolio and S-ERP implementation project. From the evaluation results, the experts confirmed that the proposed S-ERP implementation master plan can generally be used for implementing S-ERP systems in all types of industry. The master plan for the implementation of S-ERP system could serve as a theoretical base for further research in S-ERP system, which can give more insights into the system implementation. In addition, this master plan could serve as a tool for practitioners in implementing S-ERP systems within organisations...|$|R
40|$|As the world’s {{population}} grows, {{there are}} greater demands {{placed on the}} natural environment to feed people – people whose dietary expectations have changed with globalization and a greater awareness of how other people live. With this increase in the consumption of animal protein, aquaculture has been portrayed as the latest technological panacea to save the environment, promote economic development, and strengthen food security. Aquaculture has also been vilified as depriving fishers of {{their way of life}} and causing damage to the marine and coastal environment. In the United States, while {{there are a number of}} structural impediments (especially a confusing array of regulatory bodies at the federal level), there are also social and state supports that allow for the development of aquaculture as a sustainable alternative to capture fisheries. Based on participant-observation fieldwork on North Carolina fish farmers in 2011 - 2012, this project will examine how elements in the culture of aquaculture can <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> fish farming. Problems in the sustainability of aquaculture have been traced to: a tight coupling to ecosystems and dependence on common-pool resources; poor farm management; weak governance, especially over the environment and market; and a lack of knowledge flow (scientific, technological, and economic) among farmers and between farmers, state agents, and consumers. Because the bulk of NC aquaculture is freshwater or in recirculating aquaculture systems, small-scale, and producing products largely for a niche market (for live fish or lesser-known species such as prawn), fish farmers and the state government in North Carolina are largely able to rely on information-based environmental governance to <b>develop</b> <b>sustainable</b> aquaculture <b>enterprises.</b> The connections between fish farmers, researchers, and state agents, as seen in the emergence of new aquaculture cooperatives, provide support for the development of sustainable practices, especially as new aquaculturalists learn how to farm fis...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, sustainability, {{sustainable}} development, corporate {{responsibility and}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{have become part}} of the common parlance of business and academia. However, there remains some confusion and divergence of opinion about the exact meaning of these terms. This study aims to shed light on the <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> concept, addressing questions such as what a <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> is, what its main characteristics are, and how it differs from the traditional enterprise model. It explores these issues with reference to the eighteen market sector leaders of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Indexes (DJSI). As part of its analysis, The <b>Sustainable</b> <b>Enterprise</b> describes the underlying values a firm must embed in order to advance towards sustainability. The core value of the <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> is an awareness of the system it is part of and a sense of belonging to it. Instead of being a net predator of the physical and social environment, the <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> obtains resources from the system with the purpose of contributing to the net creation of wealth. Applying this yardstick to the leading companies on the DJSI, this study explores how they are embedding sustainability in their governance, strategy formulation and other management systems. And how their openness to the social and physical environment has helped them develop an honest, fluid dialogue with stakeholder groups. The results and best practices described in this book will assist companies {{aware of the importance of}} sustainability and keen to incorporate sustainable development as a core value driver, while its contribution to the conceptualization of the <b>sustainable</b> <b>enterprise</b> should usefully inform future research in the field.
