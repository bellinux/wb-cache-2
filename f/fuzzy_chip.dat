40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new circuit to {{implement}} a Mamdani-type interval type- 2 neural <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chip</b> with on-chip incremental learning ability (IT 2 NFC-OL) for applications in changing environments. Traditional interval type- 2 fuzzy systems use an iterative procedure to find the system outputs, which is computationally expensive, especially for hardware implementation. To address this problem, the IT 2 NFC-OL uses a simplified type reduction operation to reduce the hardware implementation cost without degrading the learning performance. The software-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL is characterized by online structure learning and parameter learning using a gradient descent algorithm. The learned fuzzy model is then implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. The FPGA-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL performs not only fuzzy inference but also online consequent parameter learning for applications in changing environments. Novel circuits for the computation of system outputs and the update of interval consequent values are proposed. The learning performance of the software-implemented IT 2 NFC-OL and the on-chip learning ability are verified with applications to time-varying data sequence prediction and system control problems and by comparisons with different software-implemented type- 1 and type- 2 neural fuzzy systems and interval type- 2 fuzzy chips...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the architecture of}} two VLSI Fuzzy chips designed to run at very high speed: 50 Mega Fuzzy Inference per Second (MFIPS) at least. The two projects differ {{in the number of}} inputs; one processes 2 - 4 seven bit inputs while the other one 8 - 16 seven bit inputs. The two chips have been designed for applications in High Energy Physics Experiments (HEPE) where the apparatus, called trigger device, needs to discriminate different nuclear events in few microseconds. So far most of the fuzzy logic applica-tions do not require high speed because not required by the industrial applications, therefore they have been done by implementing the fuzzy system on microprocessors, DSPs, or on commercial fuzzy chips which do not have very high speed performances like those necessary for HEPE. In the first phase of our research 1. 0 ym VLSI <b>fuzzy</b> <b>chip</b> [11, [2] prototype with four 7 bit inputs and one output running at 50 MFIPS was designed and constructed whose processing rate depends upon the number of rules of the fuzzy system. To further increase the speed we have faced the problem of processing, when possible, only the active fuzzy rules which are a few percent of the total ones. The research carried out on this prototype allowed us to extract some general conclu-sions:- for applications with no more than 4 inputs only the active rules are processed. Our design has a processing rate of 320 ns for 4 inputs, whichever is the fuzzy system. The process-ing rate is higher if less than 4 inputs are processed and reaches 100 ns for two inputs. - for applications which need 8 - 16 inputs an Active Rule Selector (ARS) has been designed to increase the process-ing speed which is 20 ns times the number of processed rules. The ARS is able to reject most of the non active rules.

40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión de autor. Multiplier and divider {{circuits}} {{are usually}} {{required in the}} fields of analog signal processing and parallel-computing neural or fuzzy systems. In particular, this paper focuses on the hardware implementation of fuzzy controllers, where the divider circuit is usually the bottleneck. Multiplier/divider circuits can be implemented with a combination of A/D-D/A converters. An efficient design based on current-mode data converters is presented herein. Continuous-time algorithmic converters are chosen to reduce the control circuitry and to obtain a modular design based on a cascade of bit cells. Several circuit structures to implement these cells are presented and discussed. The one that is selected enables a better trade-off speed/power than others previously reported in the literature while maintaining a low area occupation. The resulting multiplier/divider circuit offers a low voltage operation, provides the division result in both analog and digital formats, and it is suitable for applications of low or middle resolution (up to 9 bits) like applications to fuzzy controllers. The analysis is illustrated with Hspice simulations and experimental results from a CMOS multiplier/divider prototype with 5 -bit resolution.
