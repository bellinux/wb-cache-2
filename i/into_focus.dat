It contains interviews with indie horror filmmakers and other horror experts, including Erik Marcisak, Bill Zebub, Fred Vogel, Carol J.

5|$|In {{the music}} video, {{it begins with}} an {{out-of-focus}} view of Wade, seemingly alone, coming up a hill towards the camera. When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes <b>into</b> <b>focus</b> and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video. The video's effects allow people to seemingly appear out of nowhere throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps <b>into</b> <b>focus.</b> This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come <b>into</b> <b>focus.</b> The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} hours of March28, 2000, a {{powerful}} F3 tornado struck downtown Fort Worth, Texas, United States and adjacent areas, causing significant damage to numerous buildings and skyscrapers {{as well as}} two deaths. The tornado {{was part of a larger}} severe weather outbreak that caused widespread storms across Texas and Oklahoma in late-March, spurred primarily by the moist and unstable atmospheric environment over the South Central United States as a result of an eastward-moving upper-level low and shortwave trough. The tornado outbreak was well-forecasted by both computer forecast models and the National Weather Service, though the eventual focal point for the severe weather—North Texas—only came <b>into</b> <b>focus</b> on March28 as the conditions favorable for tornadic development quickly took hold.|$|E
40|$|Abstract from short. pdf file. Doctoral supervisor: Dr. Emmanuel Liscum, III. Includes vita. Phototropism is {{the ability}} of a plant to bend in {{response}} to directional light. he shoot of a plant exhibits a positive response bending toward the light to optimize solar collection. The roots exhibit a negative response bending away from the light to stabilize the plant and to acquire moisture that accumulates away from direct light. Plants that are more phototropic produce more food and are more drought tolerant. The blue light photoreceptrors of the plant that initiate the phototropic response are phototropin 1 and phototropin 2. Phototropin 1 (phot 1) initiates phototropism when light is limited and the phototropic response is most critical. In darkness phot 1 is randomly distributed at the plasma membrane. In response to high light, phot 1 reorganizes <b>into</b> <b>foci</b> at the plasma membrane and is subsequently degraded in the proteasome. Under low light, phot 1 remains in random distribution. Our data shows that accumulation <b>into</b> <b>foci</b> may prevent phototropic signaling suggesting a complex model for receptor signaling and desensitization in response to varying rates of light. Furthermore, phot 1 is monoubiquitinated in response to low light and polyubiquitinated in response to high light dependent on the substrate adaptor NONPHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL 3 (NPH 3). In seedlings lacking NPH 3, phot 1 accumulates <b>into</b> <b>foci</b> under all light conditions suggesting that monoubiquitination prevents receptor desensitization.

5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, {{and on the way}} back he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first time}} brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany <b>into</b> <b>focus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought <b>into</b> <b>focus,</b> in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture <b>into</b> <b>focus</b> by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} curved {{gratings}} as sectors of concentric circular gratings to couple linearly polarised light <b>into</b> <b>focused</b> surface plasmons is investigated by theory, simulation, and experiment. The experimental and simulation {{results show that}} increasing the sector angle of the curved gratings decreases {{the width of the}} lateral distribution of surface plasmons resulting in focusing of surface plasmons, which is analogous to the behaviour of classical optical lenses. We also show that two faced curved gratings, with their groove radius mismatched by half of the plasmon wavelength (asymmetric configuration), can couple linearly polarised light into a single focal spot of concentrated surface plasmons with smaller depth of focus and higher intensity in comparison to single curved gratings. The major advantage of these structures is the coupling of linearly polarised light <b>into</b> <b>focused</b> surface plasmons with access to, and control of, the plasmon focal spot, which facilitate their potential applications in sensing, detection, and nonlinear plasmonics. 8 page(s...|$|R
