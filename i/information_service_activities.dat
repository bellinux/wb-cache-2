30|$|The STRI of Swiss {{computer}} services (0.222) ranks above the sector average (0.164) and the sector’s OECD average (0.151). Computer services {{as defined by}} the STRI incorporate computer programming, consultancy and related activities, and <b>information</b> <b>service</b> <b>activities</b> (OECD 2014 d). The sector is competitive and there are no sector-specific regulatory measures (Nordås et al. 2014 b). Restrictions to the movement of people {{play a vital role in}} this sector. While trade in {{computer services}} is facilitated by electronic networks, it also requires on-site visits for technical support or consulting services (OECD 2014 d). The STRI value for Switzerland is mainly determined by the existence of quotas on the number of first-time short stay and residence permits for work purposes, labor market tests, and a limitation on the duration of stay for work purposes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. These last years, CDPP has {{developed}} a new service, AMDA (Automated Multi-Dataset Analysis), which is a web-based facility for on line analysis of space physics data (magnetospheric, heliospheric, planetary plasmas) coming from either its local database or distant ones. This tool allows the user to perform on line classical manipulations such as data visualization, parameter computation or data extraction. AMDA also offers innovative functionalities such as event search {{on the content of}} the data in either visual or automated way. AMDA has been recently integrated as a service to the scientific community for the Plasma Physics thematic node of the EuroPlaNet IDIS (Integrated and Distributed <b>Information</b> <b>Service)</b> <b>activities.</b> We will present the service AMDA and the planetary plasma data accessible via the service. We will then illustrate some of its applications (boundary identification and planetary space weather) for the comparative analysis of the planetary ionized environments. We will finally discuss future developments under study at CDPP to integrate with AMDA new datasets (Jupiter, comets) and new (astronomical) tools. ...|$|E

50|$|The first {{description}} of a wearable ear-worn multimedia platform for health monitoring, heart rate monitoring, entertainment, guidance, and cloud-based communications was described by Valencell in 2006. Current advancements {{in the development of}} hearables aim at feature integration, size reduction, and covering a diverse range of applications. Controlled by touch, movement, thought or voice (or any combination of the mentioned control mechanisms) these miniaturized in ear computers are designed primarily for the purposes of mobile communication, real time <b>information</b> <b>services,</b> <b>activity</b> tracking and various monitoring applications focussing on the wearers health conditions and body performance, mostly in combination with a wireless media player. The concept of hearables thus strongly follows an holistic technological approach, targeting (at least in the long run) the consolidation of different major state of the art communication and information technologies in one single device, discreetly concealed in a small earbud. Among the predominant future uses intended for hearables are therefore advisory services currently only provided by conventional web applications (weather forecasts, news blogs, proximity searches) or by dedicated devices (such as stand alone route planners), while current developments strongly focus on the implementation of hearables as health monitors, Activity Trackers and fitness trackers.|$|R

To achieve this objective, The Kenya National Libraries Service (KNLS) has partnered with other institutions like Book Aid International in the acquisition of information materials and supporting the reading culture among Kenyan communities. In empowering farmers, a partnership between KNLS and Ministry of Agriculture, through National Farmers <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b> (NAFIS) {{has made it possible}} for farmers to access online <b>information</b> <b>services</b> regarding farming <b>activities</b> (i.e. Crop farming and Animal farming) and also know the prevailing market prices for their produce. In addition, farmers have access to an online extension officer who responds to any of their queries. Another major step in the provision of information has been the partnership entered between KNLS and the Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) formerly known as Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK) with an aim of developing e-Resource centres in all rural libraries. This will be very instrumental in the provision of access to information for all. Kenya as a Country has demonstrated the commitment to improve education, create opportunities and empower communities through the digital platform. Various mechanisms have been identified in order to achieve this goal, and ensuring that the rural citizens have access to computers and internet services, is a major milestone. Many other partners continue to support libraries in Kenya and some of them include EIFL, Safaricom, Finlays, Practical Action, KASNEB, American Embassy and Goethe Institut among others.|$|R
