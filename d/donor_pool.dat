40|$|The {{diversity}} of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) genes was evaluated in Portuguese and the observed genotypic profiles were found {{related to the}} ones reported in European populations. The KIR repertoire after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is determined by these gene frequencies and the KIR group B motifs are the less common. We estimated donor–KIR/recipient–ligand interactions in transplants with related donors and unrelated donors found in a local registry or from abroad. A large fraction of transplants had all three ligands of inhibitory receptors, and therefore, in theory were not prone to natural killer cell (NK) mediated alloreactivity. Furthermore, the distribution of KIR alloreactive interactions was found independent of the donor–recipient genetic proximity, probably because of different gene segregation and comparable KIR frequencies in the <b>donor</b> <b>pools...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{benefits}} of fibrinogen concentrate in hypofibrinogenaemia {{have been established}} in congenital and {{has been used in}} acquired disorders. Most European countries have already changed their practice, using fibrinogen concentrate. Methods: We compared the use of fibrinogen concentrate in acquired hypofibrinogenaemia to cryoprecipitate, which continues to be the standard of care in the UK. We undertook a retrospective analysis of fibrinogen increment in patients treated for acquired hypofibrinogenaemia. Results: Sixty four transfusion episodes receiving cryoprecipitate and 36 episodes receiving fibrinogen concentrate were compared. The median increment following 10 <b>donor</b> <b>pools</b> (two bags) of cryoprecipitate was 0. 26. g/l, compared to 0. 44. g/l following 2. g of fibrinogen concentrate. Conclusion: With its superior safety profile from infectious diseases, this provides further evidence to support the use of fibrinogen concentrate. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The growth of recipient and <b>donor</b> <b>pools</b> may enhance the opportunity for assessing histocompatibility, for which distinguishing between autoantibodies and human leukocyte antigen-determined reactivity is important, and some general nonresponders may be detected. Therapy with cyclosporine has improved the outcome after transplantation, but further refinement is needed, perhaps with pharmacologic synergy, to minimize nephrotoxicity and maximize specific immunosuppression.

[...] Of particular concern are PERVS (porcine endogenous retroviruses), vertically transmitted microbes that embed in swine genomes. The risks with xenosis are twofold, as not only could the individual become infected, but a novel infection could initiate an epidemic in the human population. Because of this risk, the FDA has suggested any recipients of xenotransplants shall be closely monitored for the remainder of their life, and quarantined if they show signs of xenosis.|$|E
