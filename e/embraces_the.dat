5|$|Doggett finally <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> {{memory of}} his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he {{began to think of}} evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The X-Files {{centers on}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal; the skeptical Scully was {{initially}} assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Mulder and Scully are interviewed for the Fox reality television program Cops during an X-Files investigation. Mulder, hunting what he believes to be a werewolf, discovers that the monster terrorizing people instead feeds on fear. While Mulder <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> publicity of Cops, Scully is more uncomfortable about appearing on national television.|$|E

This paper utilises {{a recent survey of}} large Australian organisations to investigate the characteristics of the organisations that have <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> industrial relations reform agenda. We find evidence that certain industries, such as Mining, have <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> reform agenda. We also find that organisations who have <b>embraced</b> <b>the</b> reform agenda tend to have rather different human resource management practices to those who have not. ...|$|R

5|$|The Buddhist {{version of}} the Bhasmasura tale {{continues}} with Shiva (Ishvara) asking the female-Vishnu, who is seated on a swing, to marry him. She asks Shiva to get the permission of his wife Umayangana to take her home. Shiva returns with Umayangana's consent to find the female-Vishnu pregnant, who sends him back to get permission to bring a pregnant woman home. When he returns, a child is born and female-Vishnu is pregnant again. She requests Shiva to seek approval to bring a pregnant woman with a child home. This happens six more times. Finally, Shiva brings Umayangana with him to witness the miraculous woman. Vishnu then returns to his male form. Umayangana <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> six youngest children merging them into the six-headed Skanda, while the eldest, named Aiyanayaka ("eldest brother") remains intact. Aiyanayaka is identified with Aiyanar.|$|E

25|$|Walden Two is {{controversial}} because its characters {{speak of a}} rejection of free will, including {{a rejection of the}} proposition that human behavior is controlled by a non-corporeal entity, such as a spirit or a soul. Walden Two <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> proposition that the behavior of organisms, including humans, is determined by environmental variables, and that systematically altering environmental variables can generate a sociocultural system that very closely approximates utopia.|$|E

25|$|Broadly defined, Religious Zionism is a {{movement}} that <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> idea of Jewish national sovereignty, often {{in connection with the}} belief in the ability of the Jewish people to bring about a redemptive state through natural means, and often attributing religious significance to the modern State of Israel. (This attitude is rejected by most Haredim – but not all, particularly the Hardal movement.) Thus, in this sense, Religious Zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including Modern Orthodoxy.|$|E

25|$|Judaism {{relates the}} quality of one's soul to one's {{performance}} of the commandments, mitzvot, and reaching higher levels of understanding, and thus closeness to God. A person with such closeness is called a tzadik. Therefore, Judaism <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> commemoration of the day of one's death, nahala/Yahrtzeit and not the birthday as a festivity of remembrance, for only {{toward the end of}} life's struggles, tests and challenges could human souls be judged and credited - b'ezrat HaShem ("with God's help") - for righteousness and holiness. Judaism places great importance on the study of the souls.|$|E
25|$|The mosaic {{decoration}} of a cross-in-square church may {{be divided into}} three zones defined by the architectural articulation of the interior: an upper zone, which <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> cupolas, high vaults, and the conch of the apse; a middle zone, including the squinches, pendentives, and upper parts of the vaults; and the lowest zone, composed of the lower or secondary vaults and the lower parts of the walls. The tripartite division has cosmographic significance: the uppermost zone corresponds to heaven, the middle zone to paradise or the Holy Land, and the lower zone to the terrestrial world.|$|E

25|$|Although Strabo shows {{skepticism}} as {{to their}} historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. Solinus <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> account of Pliny. Under Aurelianus, captured Gothic women were identified as Amazons (Claudianus). The account of Justinus was influential, and {{was used as a}} source by Orosius who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, Adam of Bremen placing them at the Baltic Sea and Paulus Diaconus in the heart of Germania.|$|E
25|$|Disinterested benevolence was {{the basis}} for piety, {{according}} to the New Divinity. It originates at conversion when the Holy Spirit was believed to renew the heart so that the convert desires union with Christ through faith and <b>embraces</b> <b>the</b> way of the cross, which is self-sacrifice. In this, self-love is eliminated and the convert seeks happiness in God and his creation. For Edwards, a disinterest in one's self and a preoccupation with God's moral excellence was an indication that such a person had been regenerated. Such persons no longer worried over the status of their own souls because their love for God and the contemplation of his glory made assurance of one's salvation virtually an afterthought.|$|E

Glen Canyon was established in 1958 to provide for recreational activities on Lake Powell formed behind Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, one of the highest dams in the world. The Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, California, was established by Act of Congress in 1962. The National Park Service, however, administers the recreational facilities only at Whiskeytown Reservoir, while the Forest Service takes care of similar, more extensive facilities at Shasta and Trinity.|$|E
