5000|$|Known to Tejano Music devotees as El Tejano Enamorado, Oscar Martinez {{was born}} in Corpus Christi, Texas to Eloisa and Pedro Martinez in a small barrio known as “Loma Rosa.” Oscar’s mother, Eloisa, had two sisters; Goya and Ramona; two half-brothers, Manuel and Pedro Guerra; and a half-sister, Erlinda Guerra. Oscar’s father, Pedro A. Martinez, worked at an oil mill in the cotton bale department. The family {{lived in a house}} at 407 Duncan Street, which was located just across the {{railroad}} tracks from the oil mill. Oscar grew up with three brothers, Joe, Johnny and Victor. He also had a half-brother, Daniel.In the area close to present Port and Agnes streets, near an oil cotton factory known to residents as “La Mantequeria,” Oscar’s grandmother, Dona Santos Guitron Galindo, owned several businesses that included rental apartments, and a small grocery store, where she used a small corn <b>graining</b> <b>machine</b> to prepare and sell [...] masa de maiz (corn dough). In those days this masa de maiz was used to make corn tortillas. In addition to masa, Oscar’s grandmother hawked butter, eggs and other goods to barrio residents. She also owned cows, chickens, rabbits and goats. Oscar attended Southgate Elementary School and Driscoll Jr. High. It was there that Oscar joined the band and was assigned the tuba as his instrument. Oscar attended and graduated (1953) from Roy Miller High School where he played in the school’s Buccaneer Band.|$|E

The peculiarity of this machine is the possibility to map directly part of dataflow graph programs in hardware for the simple FU design [VER 94 b]. Since ALFA does not support the conventional processor cycle, at cluster level its behavior is asynchronous and determinate when part of a dataflow graph is mapped and executed on it. After compile time, in ALFA, instructions and data are no longer related, and no control token is generated during the computation, but only data tokens. Consequently, during the execution phase no memory is required to contain the partial results exchanged among FUs of a same cluster.

They {{decided to use the}} [...] "Gleaner" [...] name for their radically redesigned <b>grain</b> harvesting <b>machine</b> based on inspiration from [...] "The Gleaners", a famous 1857 painting by Jean-François Millet. Gleaning is the act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested, or on fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest, and in the , it is the act of frugally recovering resources from low-yield contexts. Thus, with the Gleaner name, the company evoked a positive connotation in potential customers' minds, of a brand of harvester that would leave none of the grain behind. A combine harvester combines the reaping (plus or minus binding), threshing, and winnowing functions all into one machine—hence the [...] "combine" [...] part of its name. To that list, the Baldwin brothers' Gleaner added self-propulsion. Earlier combines, the so-called pull-type or tractor-drawn combines, were towed by tractors.|$|R
