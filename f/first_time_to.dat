5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up now for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be decided by this Court, we consider it as having been long since settled in public opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of opinion {{in favor of the}} negative of the proposition.|$|E
5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E

5|$|At that time, {{the group}} had {{generated}} sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E
5|$|During the 1991–92 season, Canisius {{compiled}} an 8–22 record {{prior to}} Beilein's arrival. In 1992, Beilein arrived at Canisius College {{as head coach}} for the 1992–93 season, and was able for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> hire assistant coaches. A Western New York native, {{he had grown up}} a Canisius basketball fan because his uncle, Joe Niland, had been a former player and coach there. At Canisius—his first Division I coaching position—Beilein reached the NCAA Tournament once and the NIT twice in his five seasons.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} by Col. Parsons in 1861, the ballroom {{in the upper}} story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since {{its construction}} in 1861. It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write their names and the date of their visit on the mortar between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still legible.|$|E

5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Joan Gamper became club {{president}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> save the club from bankruptcy. The club had not won since the Campeonato de Cataluña in 1905; this caused their financial trouble. One of his main achievements was to help Barcelona acquire its own stadium and thus achieve a stable income.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 {{and into}} 2004, the brigade {{deployed}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> Afghanistan {{as part of}} Operation Enduring Freedom. As the only aviation brigade in the theater, the brigade provided air support for all U.S. Army units operating in the country. The brigade's mission at that time focused on close air support, medevac missions, and other duties involving combat with Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in the country. The brigade returned to Fort Drum in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed, {{a rapper}} and disc jockey {{living with his}} parents in Islington, London, N1. He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm, {{with whom he had}} a child. On 16 January 1986, three months after the murder, his name was {{mentioned}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> detectives by a man they had arrested, Bernard Kinghorn. Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite, whom he said he knew only by sight, stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife. Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation, telling the BBC three years later that it had been false.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1980 Sellers {{arrived in}} London from Geneva.

He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his Goon Show partners Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July. On {{the day of the}} dinner, Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from a heart attack. He was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, London, and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980, aged 54.|$|E
5|$|The {{badge of}} Chamois Niortais {{features}} a chamois goat {{standing on a}} football, and {{the background of the}} crest is royal blue, which has featured in the club's home colours since its founding. When the club was founded in 1925, Chamois Niortais adopted a white strip. Since then, however, the club has usually played in a home strip of royal blue jersey, shorts and socks. In the 2007–08 season the team played in a gold and black kit for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> commemorate 20 years since the club competed in Division 1.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of the Rüstungsstab allowed Speer, for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the Wehrmacht {{under the authority of}} his ministry, further marginalising the Reich Ministry of Aviation. Several departments, including the once powerful Technical Office, were disbanded or transferred to the new task force. The task force oversaw the day-to-day development and production activities relating to the He 162, the Volksjäger ("people's fighter"), as part of the Emergency Fighter Program.|$|E
5|$|The studio {{also put}} {{together}} a trailer of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andrea meets Miranda for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> be used at previews and film festivals until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation {{for the rest of}} the film without giving anything away.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its existence, Christine was {{monitored}} by astronauts in the Skylab 3 project.
