40|$|Practical sensing of biopotentials such as EEG or ECG in {{operational}} settings {{has been}} severely {{limited by the}} need for skin preparation and conductive electrolytes at the skin-sensor interface. Another seldom-noted problem has been {{the need for a}} conductive connection from the body to <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> of common-mode noise volt-ages. At QUASAR, we have developed a novel hybrid (capacitive/conductive) sensor that requires no skin prepara-tion or electrolytes. In addition we have developed a special common-mode follower that allows a dry electrode to be used <b>for</b> the <b>ground.</b> The electronics <b>for</b> the sensors and common-mode follower have low power requirements and are miniaturized to fit within a compact sensor case. We are extending our tests of the hybrid sensor in three human-machine interaction contexts: 1) a real-time system of multimodal physiological gauges for improved hu-man-automation reliability, 2) EEG-based cognitive-overload detection in an urban combat simulation, and 3) a brain-computer interface for EEG-based communication in the severely disabled. In all three contexts we compared the QUASAR hybrid sensors with traditional conductive electrodes for EEG or ECG recordings. We discuss the re-cording fidelity, noise characteristics, ease of use, and reliability of the hybrid sensors versus the conventional con-ductive electrodes in all contexts...|$|R
3000|$|The Character Act also {{lowered the}} {{threshold}} for the criminal association <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> <b>cancellation</b> from actual association to making it {{sufficient for the}} Minister to ‘reasonably suspect’ that ‘a person has been or {{is a member of}} or has or had an association with, a group, organisation or person [...]... and that the group, organisation or person has been or is involved in criminal conduct’ (s 501 (6)(b)(i)). The Explanatory Memorandum makes it clear that ‘mere membership’ of such organisation or group is sufficient to fail the character test. There is no requirement that there be a ‘demonstration of special knowledge of, or participation in, the suspected criminal conduct by the visa applicant or visa holder’ (Explanatory Memorandum, 2014, 9). Indeed, in Roach v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2016] FCA 750, Perry J concluded that this membership provision, as amended by the Character Act, is in effect a deeming provision. That is, a person who is suspected of being a member of a group or organisation that is suspected of being involved in criminal activities will automatically fail the character test (similarly to someone who has a ‘substantial criminal record’).

30|$|Once a <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> {{character}} visa <b>cancellation</b> {{referred to}} above is enlivened, either the Minister (exercising power personally under s 501 (3)) or a delegate of the Minister (under s 501 (2)), can cancel a visa. There are two major differences between these powers. If the decision to cancel is made by a delegate of the Minister, the decision {{is subject to the}} ‘rules of natural justice’ and the code of procedure set out in the Act (Migration Act, s 501 (5)). These require that the person be notified of the intention to cancel and given a chance to respond and make arguments as to why the visa should not be cancelled (Migration Act, s 51 A— 64). The decision of a delegate is reviewable by a merits review body, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Migration Act, s 500 (1)(b)).|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Acquisition Management System (AMS) of the Department of Defense (DoD) is established {{to ensure that}} the needs of the warfighter are fulfilled in the most cost-effective manner possible. The establishment of Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) on Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) ensures that critical measures of performance are continuously monitored as the identification of a military requirement becomes a fulfilled capability. Threshold values for KPPs identified during an acquisition determine the minimum acceptable level of performance. Failure to meet the threshold level of an individual KPP is <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> program <b>cancellation.</b> The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) has mandated that all defense acquisition programs should be kept to a maximum of eight for any individual program. Due to the multifaceted aspect of modern military aircraft acquisition programs, frequently there are numerous parameters of critical importance. For this reason, any repetition of measure between KPPs must be minimized. The decision of the Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (PUSD (AT&L)) to include fuel efficiency as a KPP on all future acquisitions is an unnecessary exercise for military aircraft. This thesis develops a model in which multiple aircraft are examined flying different mission profiles carrying different weapon payloads. Strong relationships between factors such as combat radius, payload and on-station endurance versus fuel efficiency are demonstrated by regression analysis of the model output. Consequently, any measure of fuel efficiency as a KPP is shown to be redundant. Furthermore, the methodology developed in this thesis may have further uses for the development of logistics planning factors for present and future military aircraft applications.
