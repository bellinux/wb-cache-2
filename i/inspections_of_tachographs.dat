50|$|When the use <b>of</b> <b>tachographs</b> {{was imposed}} by the European Union on its member states in the 1980s, governments and {{operating}} companies were opposed {{on the grounds that}} tachographs were expensive and unnecessary, and contributed nothing to road safety.

50|$|Drivers {{and their}} trade unions {{initially}} opposed the use <b>of</b> <b>tachographs</b> because they feared that employers would examine the records {{and reduce the}} driver's pay for any time stopped, even if the stop was for a good reason, such as checking the vehicle or going to the toilet.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{technical}} report is to describe the proof-of-concept of the CEN-DSRC imple- mentation of the remote interrogation function of the new version <b>of</b> the digital <b>tachograph.</b> The current digital tachograph (DT) system to monitor the driving time in commercial ve- hicles above 3. 5 tons is governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821 / 85 of 20 December 1985, which was modified at several occasions and more recently in 2006, when the digital tachograph was introduced, and in 2009, when it was updated to technical progress to avoid fraud and reduce the administrative burden. In July 2011 the Commission made a proposal (COM(2011) 451 final) to modify the tachograph regulation, {{which has been the}} object of discussions in Council and Parliament {{in the course of the}} ordinary legislative procedure. The final version of the approved regulation was published in February 2014 (Regulation 165 / 2014 (Commission, 2004)). The technical specifications <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> were published as Regulation 799 / 2016 (Commission, 2011). One of the main functions is the remote interrogation <b>of</b> the Smart <b>Tachograph</b> (ST) installed in the commercial vehicle through the CEN-DSRC standard. The function supports law enforcers in the checking of potential frauds or malfunctions in the ST. To support the future deployment <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> and to validate the technical specifications <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> regarding the remote interrogation function, JRC issued a tender to the DSRC manufacturer Q-FREE to implement a prototype of the new remote interrogation systems.
