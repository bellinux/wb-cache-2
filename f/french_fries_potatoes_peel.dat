40|$|ABSTRACT Epidemiological {{investigations}} repeatedly {{show that}} the regular consumption of dark green and crucif-erous vegetables, tomatoes and citrus fruits in particular is related to reduced cancer risk. We used the 1994 – 1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals to examine the types {{of fruits and vegetables}} consumed by Americans. The analytic sample population, which consisted of 4806 men and women (25 – 75 y old) who completed two nonconsecutive 24 -h recalls, consumed 3. 6 6 2. 3 servings of vegetables and 1. 6 6 2. 0 servings of fruit daily. Iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>potatoes,</b> bananas and orange juice were the most commonly consumed fruits and vegetables, accounting for nearly 30 % of all fruits and vegetables consumed. The most popular items, lettuce and tomatoes, were consumed by 39 – 42 % of the sample population during the reporting period. Fewer respondents (16 – 24 %) consumed <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>potatoes,</b> bananas or orange juice. Only 3 % of the sample consumed broccoli during the reporting period. White potato consumption averaged 1. 1 servings daily, with <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>potatoes</b> representing 0. 4 serving. Tomato product consumption averaged 0. 5 serving daily, dark green vegetable consumption averaged 0. 2 serving daily and citrus, berries or melon consumption amounted to nearly 0. 8 serving daily. These data indicate that Americans are consuming more fruits and vegetables but that dark green and cruciferous vegetable intake is low. J. Nutr. 130 : 3063 – 3067, 2000.

40|$|Green potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers are {{rejected}} by the processing industry. Therefore their amount should be reduced to minimum. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the reduction of greening of new <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> varieties in experiments conducted from 1998 to 2001 on ridge qualities like geometry and the compression and crumbling degree of the loose soil in the ridge. The experiments were mainly carried out on the experimental husbandry farm Westmaas on a Calcaric Fluvisol having a clay content of ca. 200 g kg¿ 1. <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> <b>potato</b> varieties used were Agria and Fambo, whereas Bintje was used as a reference. Row spacings were 0. 75 m (30 in.) and 0. 90 m (36 in.). Net ridge size was determined by the internal height (distance between the plate and the top of the ridge) and by the width of the top of the ridge combined with planting near the surface of the plate. For the traditional <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> variety Bintje a reduction in greening was achieved by ridges having a gross size of 0. 06 ¿ 0. 07 m 2. New <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> <b>potato</b> varieties like Agria and Fambo, however, are characterized by higher yields, larger cluster widths and longer tubers than Bintje. These properties favor the greening of tubers and require adjustment of the ridge geometry. Increase of the internal height and of the top width were found to be crucial to reduce greening of tubers to minimum. An increase of the top width of standard 0. 75 m ridges from 0. 15 ¿ 0. 18 to 0. 25 m combined with an internal height of 0. 18 ¿ 0. 20 m was realized by the so-called plateau ridges. This ridge type required ca. 0. 04 m deeper seedbed than the depth of the seedbed for standard 0. 75 m ridges. Without deeper loosening of the seedbed such larger ridges could also be realized by an increase of row spacing to 0. 90 m. Net yields of new <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> varieties of plateau and 0. 90 m ridges were generally similar or higher than the yields of standard 0. 75 m ridges with the same internal height. With 0. 90 m ridges over-sizing occurred sometimes. Greening of new varieties of <b>French</b> <b>fry</b> <b>potatoes</b> was reduced to minimum by the new knowledge on ridge geometry: an increase of the internal ridge height to 0. 18 ¿ 0. 20 m, a top width to 0. 25 m and reduction of cracking by relatively coarse, non-compressed ridges...|$|R

40|$|In the TRANSFAIR study, foods {{contributing}} to 95 % of total fat intake {{were collected in}} 14 European countries. In addition to edible fats, dairy, meat, and bakery products some specific food items with relatively high amounts oftransfatty acids were found. <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>potatoes,</b> both those from fast-food restaurants and those from the supermarkets (including potato chips), contained mostly between 12 and 35 %transfatty acid, but some products fried in animal fat or vegetable oil contained lower proportions between 0. 5 and 7 % total fatty acids. Deep-fried croquettes were also rich intransfatty acids. Microwave popcorn samples contained 27 - 34 %transfatty acids. Ready-made popcorn was low intransfatty acids but generally contained even more saturated fatty acids. Dry soup and sauce mixes and cubes and high-fat, frosted breakfast cereals were other examples of foods that often contained > 10 %transfatty acids. It is concluded that any deep-fried product such as <b>French</b> <b>fried</b> <b>potatoes</b> may contain high proportions of isomerictransfatty acids. Processed foods with a long shelf life such as dry soup powders and cubes, savory snacks, and popcorn often contained relatively high proportions oftransfatty acids, although the contributions of these products to total fat intake are probably small. The foods and snacks with a high proportion oftransfatty acids usually contained less saturated fatty acids and morecis-unsaturated fatty acids than respective foods prepared with low-transsaturated vegetable fats or animal fats. © 1998 Academic Press...|$|R
