40|$|The ASPEN PLUS {{commercial}} {{simulation software}} {{has been used}} to develop a process model for a conceptual process to convert municipal solid waste (MSW) to hydrogen. The process consists of hydrothermal treatment of the MSW in water to create a slurry suitable as feedstock for an oxygen blown Texaco gasifier. A method of reducing the complicated MSW feed material to a manageable set of components is outlined along with a framework for modeling the stoichiometric changes associated with the hydrothermal treatment process. Model results indicate that 0. 672 kmol/s of hydrogen can be produced from the processing of 30 kg/s (2600 tonne/day) of raw MSW. A number of variations on the basic processing parameters are explored and indicate that there is a clear incentive to reduce the <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> in the processed slurry feed and that cofeeding a low value heavy oil may be economically attractive...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Batch {{anaerobic}} digestion tests of primary sludge and {{waste activated sludge}} were conducted for a duration of 123 days to determine the ultimate degradability of the sludges. For primary sludges the <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> of the particulate COD that was predicted by the wastewater models could be employed to predict their biodegradability under anaerobic conditions. The degradation of waste activated sludge was adequately characterized for the first 60 days of digestion using a model that assumed equivalent biodegradability of particulate COD components under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However after 60 days of {{anaerobic digestion}} it appeared that decay of the endogenous products was occurring. This could be described with a first order decay function with a coefficient of 0. 0075 d- 1. For continuous flow digesters operating at SRTs of 30 - 60 days, the predicted VSS destruction with the modified model was approximately 10 % higher than that predicted {{on the basis of}} inert endogenous decay products...|$|E
40|$|Charcoal is {{the result}} of natural and {{anthropogenic}} burning events, when biomass is exposed to elevated temperatures under conditions of restricted oxygen. This process produces a range of materials, collectively known as pyrogenic carbon, the most <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> of which is known as black carbon (BC). BC degrades extremely slowly and is resistant to diagenetic alteration involving the addition of exogenous carbon, making it a useful target substance for radiocarbon dating particularly of more ancient samples, where contamination issues are critical. We present results of tests using a new method for the quantification and isolation of BC, known as hydropyrolysis (hypy). Results show controlled reductive removal of non-BC organic components in charcoal samples, including lignocellulosic and humic material. The process is reproducible and rapid, making hypy a promising new approach not only for isolation of purified BC for 14 C measurement but also in quantification of different labile and resistant sample C fractions...|$|E

Species are classified as »very labile«, »moderately labile«, »slowly labile« and »inert« depending on the characteristic time scale of the measuring technique using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) and the retention on Chelex- 100 resin in successive column and batch procedures. The results show that in two extremely different microenvironments (with S of about 17 %c and ~ 45 %o) the slowly labile and <b>inert</b> <b>fractions</b> prevail particularly at the surface layer, whereas in the main water body of the gulf the very labile fraction is the predominant one.

This paper presents the levels of metals in sediments from Richards Bay Harbour, 20 years after the construc-tion of the harbour and studied spatial and temporal, as well as the proportion of the bioavailable metal fraction. Sediment samples were collected from nine sites in Richards Bay Harbour. Sequential extractions of metals were carried out and sam-ples were analysed for aluminium, chromium, copper, iron, manganese and zinc. Metal concentrations in sediment samples varied only slightly between seasons but showed significant spatial variation, which was significantly correlated to sediment particle size composition. Highest metal concentrations were found in sites with substrata dominated by fine mud. Manganese and Zn had more than 50 % of this concentrated in the easily reducible fractions. Zinc concentrations were not elevated when compared to historic data. More than 70 % of Cr was concentrated in the <b>inert</b> <b>fractions</b> nevertheless concentrations recorded at some sites were still above action levels when considering only the bioavailable fractions...|$|R

The parameters that were varied include the initial bed temperature, {{fuel mass flow rate}}, <b>inert</b> tar <b>fraction,</b> and kinetic energy losses caused by particle–particle and particle–wall collisions. The results of each parameter variation are compared with a base scenario, previously described in detail in Part I of this study (Gerber & Oevermann, 2014). The results are interpreted by comparing the reactor outlet temperature, averaged particle temperature, overall wood mass, overall charcoal mass, concentrations of several gaseous species, and axial barycenter data for particles obtained with different sets of parameters. The <b>inert</b> tar <b>fraction</b> and fuel mass flow rate are the most sensitive parameter, while the particle–particle and particle–wall contact parameters have only a small impact on the results. Increasing the reactive tar components by 19 % almost doubled the amount of reactive tars at the reactor outlet, while decreasing the restitution coefficients of the particle collisions by 0. 2 results in higher overall gas production but almost no change in bed height.

40|$|Despite of the {{significance}} of the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic materials, {{only a limited number of}} studies have been carried out to evaluate the lignocellulosic digestion kinetics, and information about the modeling of this process is limited. In this work, a mathematical model, based on the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM 1), was developed to describe the anaerobic conversion of lignocellulose-rich aquatic plants, with cattail as an example, by rumen microbes. Cattail was fractionated into slowly hydrolysable fraction (SHF), readily hydrolysable fraction (RHF) and <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> in the model. The SHF was hydrolyzed by rumen microbes and resulted in the production of RHF. The SHF and RHF had different hydrolysis rates but both with surface-limiting kinetics. The rumen microbial population diversity, including the cattail-, butyrate-, acetate- and H 2 -degraders, was all incorporated in the model structure. Experiments were carried out to identify the parameters and to calibrate and validate this model. The simulation results match the experimental data, implying that the fractionation of cattail into two biodegradation parts, i. e., SHF and RHF, and modeling their hydrolysis rate with a surface-limiting kinetics were appropriate. The model was capable of simulating the anaerobic biodegradation of cattail by the rumen cultures...|$|E

They also presented with a features of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and schistocytes on peripheral smear. Renal failure was present in all three cases. Two cases were treated with peritoneal dialysis while the other showed spontaneous improvement in renal parameters. The earliest onset was at 12  h. Biran et al. (2007) hypothesised that “endothelial damage that occurs in birth asphyxia leads to a vicious cycle of consumption of platelets and plasma factors involved in hemostasis and fibrinolysis (complement factors H/I and ADAMTS 13)”. Complement factor H/I deficiency is known to cause excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway causing injury to the capillary endothelial cells and subsequent symptoms of HUS (Caprioli et al. 2001). ADAMTS 13 is a metalloprotease enzyme which is needed to cleave the large multimers of vWF (von Willebrand factor) into smaller <b>inert</b> <b>fractions.</b> In the absence of this enzyme, the uncleaved large multimers induce platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of endothelial injury leading to platelet rich thrombi in the end organs (Furlan and Lämmle 2000). Besides consumption of these factors, congenital deficiency of ADAMTS can also precipitate HUS. We did not investigate for these deficiencies {{and it is possible}} that these deficiencies coexisted in our case.|$|R

In 2007, in Romania, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) was generally landfilled without pre-treatment and energy valorization absent. Some initiatives are in progress but landfilling is still dominant. The entrance in the EU gave an important push to the industrial sectors, increasing the demand of fuels. In this frame an important option regards the use of Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) as industrial fuel substitute. In Romania, SRF could be generated from MSW using the bio-drying process with post-separation of <b>inert</b> <b>fractions</b> as the percentage of organic fraction in the residual MSW is significant. Today in Romania bio-drying plants for residual municipal waste (RMSW) are under discussion but not yet implemented. The present paper deals with the potential use of SRF in Romania. Some aspects of local and global environmental impact related to a partial substitution of conventional fuels with SRF for industrial uses are discussed too. Some considerations are also based on the assessment of the Romanian SRF characteristics that could be potentially generated. The scenarios that are discussed concern the use of SRF obtainable taking into account also the development of the Romanian MSW composition and the effects of the selective collection evolution...|$|R

It was there pointed out that a clue had been found, the following out of which promised to lead to the desired goal. This clue eventuated from the observation that when the highly impure and complex, though therapeutically servicable insulin extracts of commerce are boiled for a short time with N/ 10 sodium carbonate the resulting physioloogical inactivation of the extracts is always associated with an alteration of a part of their sulphur, an element which our experiments justified us in believing to be an integral constituent of the hormone itself. After such treatment with a weak alkali a new property appears in the altered insulin in that it now shows an extraordinary sensitivity to very dilute acides which immediately, and contrary to their usual action, liberate hydrogen sulphide from it. It was found that <b>inert</b> <b>fractions</b> prepared from such extracts of the pancreas contain very little of this labile sulphur and a table was constructed which showed that the labile suplphur of a preparation is directly proportional to its hypoglycaemic activity for experimental animals. In other words, the higher amount of labile sulphur in a given preparation the greater its potency in lowering the percentage of blood sugar...|$|R

Different types of combustible dust of various sizes, such as coal, powdered sugar, lycopodium, anthraquinone, rice and coffee husks, beech wood flour or ground coffee were mixed with alumina and kieselguhr before being tested. Parameters measured were 1) minimum ignition temperature (MIT) in 5 mm layer, 2) minimum ignition temperature in cloud (Godbert-Greenwald oven) and 3) minimum ignition energy (MIE) (in a Kühner-Mike 3 apparatus). It appears from this study that the MIT in 5 mm layer is strongly influenced by an <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> >= 60 % (weight). There is also {{a significant increase in}} MIT in cloud form when the fraction of inert dust exceeds 60 % (weight). This threshold {{is a function of the}} bulk density of the inert substance selected for these tests. However, in cases where the density of the inert dust is different from that of the combustible dust, there appears to be a separation of the two constituents of the mixture after its pneumatic dispersion during the test. As a consequence, {{the influence of}} inert dust is less pronounced in the case of MIT for dust clouds than for the MIT of a dust layer.

40|$|Nowadays, the construction, remodelling and {{demolition}} operations {{can cause}} serious environment impacts. These activities produce materials defined as construction and demolition wastes (CDW). The CDW generated in Europe represents around 25 - 30 % of total waste. In EU 28 CDW production is about 821, 160, 000 t, {{but there is}} a significant difference among the European countries, mainly because of the variation of construction and demolition activity. In 2011, the total production of CDW in Portugal was around 930, 000 t, but regional production is not homogeneous. The substantial <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> from the CDW makes them suitable for reuse. The present study aims to quantify and characterize CDW from residential recuperation of small constructions in Portugal and then propose mitigating measures to improve CDW management. The results obtained by bibliographic research revealed that the construction and demolition activity has decreased significantly in the last years and consequently CDW production. In addition, it was observed a big number of entities were involved in CDW management. Therefore, it was necessary to select a specific area from Portugal (Setubal region) which has thirteen City Halls. The surveys had scarce response. This {{can be explained by the}} lack of obligation of enterprises with less than ten employees to register CDW production and because in some regions the CDW are mixed with municipal solid waste. Most of the CDW collected from Setubal region was disposed in landfill. In order to reduce CDW production it is necessary to promote and make available recycled materials for small works at low cost. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

Using a sequential extraction procedure and a parabolic diffusion equation, the ageing of added copper(Cu) in bentonite without and with humic acid (HA) was investigated as a function of incubation time over one year. At the same time, the effect of pH on Cu ageing in bentonite with HA was also studied. The most labile Cu fractions (water-soluble Cu, Cu extracted by NH(4) NO(3) and EDTA) gradually transformed into less extractable forms. The modelled diffusion equation suggested that the ageing processes were controlled by surface nucleation/precipitation and diffusion. In the presence of HA, the contribution from surface nucleation/precipitation increased significantly, whereas that from diffusion decreased, this indicated the addition of HA significantly enhanced the short-term ageing by complexation with Cu ions, but strongly inhibited the further diffusion of Cu ions into interlayer of bentonite during long-term ageing owing to the more stable complexes formed on solid surface. With increasing pH in bentonite with HA, the apparent diffusion rate coefficient (D/r(2)) increased greatly, which showed that during long-term ageing pH played an important role in reducing the extractability as a result of the significant increase in residual Cu (RES-Cu), the most <b>inert</b> <b>fraction,</b> due to micropore diffusion...|$|E

The three-compartment model was adequate for simulation of continuous, batch and transient experiments with activated sludge fed on vanillin. The model assumed three basic compartments in a cell: (1) a building-block for synthesis of energy-rich compounds, small metabolites, DNA and storage materials; (2) the protein-synthesizing machinery; (3) the pool of enzymes and other proteins. The concept of viability was incorporated by postulating irreversible conversions of the three compartments to <b>inert</b> <b>fractions.</b> The two-stage activated-sludge process was improved and a mathematical model was developed for kinetic optimalization of the process. The two-stage process {{was better than the}} one-stage process in rate of vanillin breakdown. The kinetic coefficients of the second stage were affected by concentration and composition of intermediate substrate. Increase of maximum yield coefficient and simultaneous decrease of maintenance coefficient of the second stage with decreasing concentration of intermediate substrate were predicted by fitting the biochemical data of the second stage to the model. The production of biomass in the two-stage system under optimum kinetics was always greater than that of the one-stage system. The presence of acetate allowed higher rates at low concentrations of substrate, reducing the kinetic' advantage of the two-stage process. The predominant populations of bacteria in the chemostat altered if the specific growth rate was increased by a factor 4 or when acetate was added to the vanillin-basal medium.

Results of the project: The waste quantity of the investigated infra-structural wastes ascertained {{in the frame of}} the research project is approx. 36 kg/(l*a). From this more than 60 % consist of street-sweepings and headshoulder material from roads in municipalities and communities. Further 37 % result from the range of waste water purification. The remaining infra-structural ranges (long-distance rail traffic and air transport etc.) show a very small portion of approx. 4 % of the total quantity. Taking the LAGA guideline into account (requirements for the material recovery of mineral wastes/residues - TR Soil) road-side foliage is poorly loaded (allocation value Z 1. 1) and residues from sink water traps especially from twon centres are highly loaded (allocation value Z 2). The sewer residues and street-sweepings are situated in between (allocation value Z 1. 2). The investigation of different treatment processes (wet and dry processes) has mostly been executed with street-sweepings. Normally during wet treatment the input material is separated into the fractions purified sand, light fraction, coarse impurities and components to be clarified by means of process water. Using dry treatment the material stream is separated by means of dry mechanical separation in an <b>inert</b> <b>fraction,</b> a light fraction, coarse impurities and depending on the process in filter dust.

Using preheated air can be a powerful tool to control the ignition and combustion processes in a waste combustion plant. To use this tool effectively, the influence of the preheated air on the fuel bed needs to be well understood. The present work is done to develop a model that predicts the spontaneous ignition temperature of the fuel bed and the critical temperature of the primary air at which the fuel bed ignites. The influence of primary air flow rate and addition of inert are modeled for a packed bed of wood. From the model a dimensionless parameter is derived in which all investigated parameters (fuel type, air flow rate and <b>inert</b> <b>fraction)</b> are combined. This parameter appears to be sufficient to describe both the spontaneous ignition and the critical air temperature.

Besides calculations for the temperatures, the ignition time and location are calculated as well. The ignition time is under-predicted due to the assumption of a uniform temperature distribution inside the particles. The location of ignition is predicted well.

In this study we conducted titrations of coastal seawaters with iron and copper at pH 7. 91, 7. 37 and 6. 99 (expressed on the total pH scale). Changes in the concentration of iron and copper that complexed with the added ligands 1 -nitroso- 2 -napthol and salicylaldoxime respectively were determined by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry - competitive ligand equilibrium (AdCSV-CLE). Interpretation of the results, assuming complexation by a low concentration of discrete ligands, showed that conditional stability constants for iron complexes increased relative to inorganic iron complexation as pH decreased by approximately 1 log unit per pH unit, whilst those for copper did not change. No trend was observed for concentrations of iron and copper complexing ligands over the pH range examined. We also interpreted our titration data by describing chemical binding and polyelectrolytic effects using non-ideal competitive adsorption in Donnan-like gels (NICA-Donnan model) in a proof of concept study. The NICA-Donnan approach allows {{for the development of}} a set of model parameters that are independent of ionic strength and pH, and thus calculation of metal speciation can be undertaken at ambient sample pH or the pH of a future, more acidic ocean. There is currently a lack of basic NICA-Donnan parameters applicable to marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) so we assumed that the measured marine dissolved organic carbon could be characterized as terrestrial fulvic acids.

The present work is done to investigate in a systematically way the spontaneous ignition behaviour of a packed bed heated with a preheated air stream. Experiments on a lab scale packed bed reactor are carried out for various fuel types. Because MSW is an highly inhomogeneous fuel, wood and char are used as model fuels. To include the inhomogeneous character of MWS, also experiments are carried out with RDF. Parameters such as primary air flow velocity and temperature, addition of inert material, moisture content of the fuel (wood chips) and particle size (char) have been changed to see their effect on the spontaneous ignition temperature and on the minimum air temperature needed for ignition. The spontaneous ignition temperature is defined as the bed temperature at which a transition takes place from a negligible or slow fuel reaction rate to a rapid oxidation of either the volatiles or the solid fuel without an external source such as a spark or a flame. The minimum or critical air temperature is defined as the lowest air temperature at which ignition can be obtained. It is found that the type of fuel has influence on the ignition temperatures. Besides both the critical air temperature needed for the spontaneous ignition and the spontaneous ignition temperature increase with an increase in the primary air velocity (between 0. 1 and 0. 5 m/s) and increasing the added <b>inert</b> <b>fraction</b> (between 0 and 40 wt%), irrespective of the fuel type.

500|$|Decompression can be {{accelerated}} {{by the use of}} breathing gases during ascent with lowered <b>inert</b> gas <b>fractions</b> (as a result of increased oxygen fraction). This will result in a greater diffusion gradient for a given ambient pressure, and consequently accelerated decompression for a relatively low risk of bubble formation. Nitrox mixtures and oxygen are the most commonly used gases for this purpose, but oxygen rich trimix blends can also be used after a trimix dive, and oxygen rich heliox blends after a heliox dive, and these may reduce risk of isobaric counterdiffusion complications. Doolette and Mitchell showed that when a switch is made to a gas with a different proportion of inert gas components, it is possible for an inert component previously absent, or present as a lower fraction, to in-gas faster than the other inert components are eliminated (inert gas counterdiffusion), sometimes resulting in raising the total tissue tension of inert gases in a tissue to exceed the ambient pressure sufficiently to cause bubble formation, even if the ambient pressure has not been reduced {{at the time of the}} gas switch. They conclude that [...] "breathing-gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression".|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A Mean Value Model (MVM) for a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) {{engine is}} presented. Using a phenomenological zero-dimensional {{approach}} with five continuous and three discrete states we first model {{the effects of}} the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve, the exhaust Rebreathing Lift (RBL), and the fueling rate on the state of charge in the cylinder at intake valve closing. An Arrhenius integral is then used to model the start of combustion, θsoc. A series of simple algebraic relations that captures the combustion duration and heat release is finally used to model the state of charge after the HCCI combustion and the Location of Peak Pressure (LPP). The model is parameterized and validated using steady-state test data from an experimental engine at the General Motors Corporation. The simple model captures the temperature, pressure, air-to-fuel ratio, and <b>inert</b> gas <b>fraction</b> of the exhausted mass flow. This characterization is important for the overall HCCI dynamics because the thermodynamic state (pressure, tem-perature) and concentration (oxygen and inert gas) of the exhausted mass flow affect the next combustion event. The high dilution level in HCCI engines increases the significance of this internal feedback that generally exists to a smaller extent in conventional spark-ignition and compression-ignition internal combustion engines.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{properties of}} various biomass and wood materials from various references {{and from our}} laboratory were reanalysed. The net heat of combustion for cellulosic materials {{was found to be}} 13. 23 kJ/g times the ratio of stoichiometric oxygen mass to fuel mass, ro, regardless of the material composition. Bomb calorimeter data for original, charred and volatilized material components provide gross heating values, while elemental analysis of the materials for carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and ash provide direct evaluation for ro. We corrected these data as provided in various references by converting gross heating values to lower heating values and converting elemental compositions, char fractions and ro to a moisture-free and ash-free basis. Some existing formulae were found to disagree with data from vegetation, charred wood with high ash content, and with volatiles from cellulose treated with the fire retardant NaOH. We also established various functional correlations of ro with elemental compositions, or volatization fractions of untreated and treated materials, or material fractions for cellulose, lignin and extractives, or volatile fractions for tar, combustible gases and inert gases in pure nitrogen carrier gas. An interesting predictive result provides nearly constant heat of combustion while the volatile tar fraction is decreasing and combustible and <b>inert</b> gas <b>fractions</b> are increasing with time during the charring of Douglas-fir wood.

All of the vehicles place 22, 680 kilograms of payload into a 500 -kilometer orbit. The upper stage(s) uses hydrogen-oxygen rockets. The effect on payload <b>fraction</b> and vehicle <b>inert</b> weight of methane and methane-FLOX as a fuel-propellant combination for the three-stage vehicle is indicated. Compared with a rocket first stage for a two-stage shuttle, an airbreathing first stage results in a higher payload fraction and a lower operating cost, but a higher total cost. The effect on cost of program size and first-stage flyback is indicated. The addition of an expendable rocket second stage (three-stage vehicle) improves the payload fraction but is unattractive economically...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{recycled}} aggregates is promoted by EU with guidelines for common strategies for a correct re-use of construction and demolition (C&D) [Poon et al., 2001]. In Italy, {{the legislation is}} encouraging the re-use of C&D inert materials but, due to the scarcity of suitable plants for processing, this resource {{is used as a}} lower quality materials for low grade application. In this study, different grain-size fractions, obtained by a grain-size sorting, from a C&D processing plant in Rovigo (NE Italy), were investigated through chemical and physical testing, to evaluate their composition, assisting in the development of improved recycling methodologies for concrete. Chemical-mineralogical and physical analysis have shown that the material is roughly homogenous. Several concrete mixes were prepared using different percentage {{of recycled}} aggregate and tested. The data have shown that the introduction of 30 % of <b>inert</b> recycled coarse <b>fraction,</b> substituting natural coarse aggregate, does not affect the concrete...|$|R
40|$|Sorption isotherms for {{metals in}} soil {{obtained}} in the laboratory generally underpredict the observed metal content in the solid phase in the field. Isotherms based on in-situ data are therefore required. The {{aim of this study}} is to obtain field-based sorption isotherms for Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn as input for the heavy-metal accumulation model SOACAS. Two types of sorption isotherms were fitted using field data sets in this research: the Freundlich type, with one solid-phase fraction was fitted by Stepwise Linear Regression (LR), and a model with two solid phase mass fractions, a reactive fraction and a non-reactive fraction, was fitted with Nonlinear Least Squares Regression (NLSSR). From the results of the LR and the NLLSR fits of the Hoop-Janssen data set, the generally explained variance for the Zn models is shown to be the highest, followed by the Cd models. The explained variance of the Cu and Pb models is lower. The performance of the LR models and the NLLSR models is comparable. The NLLSR fits of the 2 -phase isotherms of the Hoop-Janssen data set almost never include a statistically significant <b>inert</b> metal <b>fraction.</b> This implies that a 2 -phase model can, in most cases, not be derived from this data set. The LR models derived from field data (this research) predicts the observed metal content in the solid phase in the field best compared with isotherms derived from batch data. The extension of the field partition data set and quality improvement is recommended for future research...|$|R
40|$|KEYWORDS INTRODUCTION RESULTS DISCUSSION REFERENCES ABSTRACT In lab-scale {{experiments}} with sludge from a 2 -stage activated sludge system (AB process) it is {{shown that the}} <b>inert</b> soluble COD <b>fraction</b> of the wastewater is always significantly higher if the wastewater is added to A-sludge (SRT ca. 0. 5 d) in comparison to B-sludge (SRT ca. 20 d). At {{the same time the}} readily biodegradable COD (S S) is lower with A-sludge, which showed neither adsorption nor storage of S S. It is hypothesised that very low sludge ages result in selecting fast growing bacteria, which can utilise only part of the S S in the raw wastewater. The other part of S S remains in the wastewater and can be utilised for enhanced denitrification in the second stage. The key for a successful modelling of processes with a sludge age lower than 1 day is to make the wastewater characterization for COD and some of the important kinetic parameters dependent on sludge age.
