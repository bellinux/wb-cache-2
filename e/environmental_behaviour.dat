2500|$|Uranium in the {{environment}} refers to the science of the sources, <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and effects of uranium on humans and other animals. Uranium is weakly radioactive and remains so because of its long physical half-life (4.468 billion years for uranium-238). [...] The biological half-life (the average {{time it takes for}} the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days. [...] Normal functioning of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a toxic metal. The use of depleted uranium (DU) in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that environmental literacy, {{in the early}} stages of education, can provide a strong foundation for future <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours,</b> as well as help in the transition towards more sustainable societies. This paper is based upon an evaluation of the environmental attitudes of students in a primary school in rural Slovenia. The attitudes were assessed according to the students' behaviours in their family (primary) and school (secondary) and family contexts. The results show that traditional teaching, in this school, accounts for only one-third of the recognised factors that influence the students' <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The other factors that foster <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> include the primary and secondary social environments, the structural and infrastructural condition in the school, and gender, where emotional attitudes play a key role.

40|$|Purpose - This study {{seeks to}} explore the {{relationships}} between environmental beliefs and <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{from the perspectives of}} those who have adopted <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> as consumers of green companies; rather than those who articulate environmental attitudes. Design/methodology/approach - In recent times there has been a growing awareness amongst consumers of the importance of environment consciousness within the context of purchasing goods or services and household habits. Theories of planned behaviour postulate a relationship between environmental beliefs and environmental behaviours; however, much of the prior research has been non-conclusive with little or no support for such relationships. In identifying whether there are any links between consumers’ key environmental beliefs, norms and behaviours data collection was carried out by using a survey of green consumers of three Australian companies. Findings - The study found that some aspects of environmental beliefs are significantly associated with particular environmental norms concerning willingness to pay and responsibilities for pollution control and particular <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> including recycling activities and purchase decisions such as buying energy efficient appliances. Originality/value - The findings suggest that consumers are likely to pay higher prices or reduce their standard of living to protect the environment.

The research was carried out with a total of 243 teacher candidates (131 male and 112 female) from Elementary Department of Faculty of Education at Siirt University in Turkey. It was used the “New Environmental Paradigms Scale”, which was first time developed by Dunlap and Van Liere (1978) and revised by Dunlap et. al.

40|$|While {{mounting}} {{environmental issues}} (e. g., climate change) {{mean that there}} is an increasing urgency for behavioural change this can be difficult to achieve. This thesis applied learning from health psychology to the issue of why pro-environmental intentions do not necessarily translate into action. Research had found that people working towards health goals were not succeeding or were making slow progress because they employed compensatory beliefs to justify succumbing to desires that conflicted with their health goals. A compensatory belief is the belief that the negative consequences of one action can be compensated for by another action. This research investigated whether, when, why and how compensatory beliefs may be used in relation to <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours.</b> This research began with exploratory qualitative work using cognitive and semi-structured interviews. These findings were then followed up by experimental work. Study 2 found that participants who reflected on their negative <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> expressed significantly stronger (compensatory) intentions to be pro-environmental than participants who reflected on their positive <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Studies 3 - 5 explored the influence of behavioural history on compensation and licensing across a series of scenarios using vignettes. Evidence was found that participants balanced environmental (or pro-social) interests with self-interest. Study 6 looked at the effects of goal saliency and construal on compensatory behaviours, finding that, participants who inferred good progress were more motivated to be pro-environmental. Overall, the research provides some evidence (albeit equivocal) of compensation and licensing in relation to <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The findings as a whole suggest that prompting feelings of environmental guilt is not an advisable strategy to engage people in pro-environmental behaviour. In contrast, prompting people to reflect on their existing pro-environmental behaviours or to imagine how they would feel after engaging in environmental action does motivate environmental action. ...|$|R

40|$|Magister Artium (Psychology) - MA(Psych) This {{study is}} a {{quantitative}} investigation into anglers’ <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours,</b> as associated with the human-nature relationship, {{within the context of}} sustainability and conservation psychology. Although much has been researched around pro-environmental behaviours that link to the household (such as energy use and recycling behaviours) and materialism (buying environmentally friendly products), there is comparatively little to show for variables associated with pro-environmental decision-making that relates to the protection of nature. One such environmental problem involves the disregard for environmental laws protecting marine life. The study aimed to extend this line of research by looking at certain <b>environmental</b> fishing <b>behaviours</b> in a sample of recreational False Bay anglers, and using their relationship with nature (i. e. {{the degree to which the}} self recognises an interconnectedness between humans and the natural world) to explain these behaviours. Participants were required to sign a consent form, and participated anonymously in the study, particularly due to the sensitive nature of the information they disclose. A convenience sample of 99 anglers was assessed. ANOVA yielded significant biographical differences in NR with regards to particular age, level of education and residential area groups. Logistic regression analysis indicated that Nature Relatedness had significant predictive capacity for these <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> (= 0. 061), although the Nature Relatedness subscales did not. In conclusion it was speculated that NR might not offer a deep explanation for <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviours</b> in this group, considering a weak correlation between NR and behaviour (r = -. 186) and the inability of the NR subscales to predict behaviour. Further research in this area is needed to provide more conclusive results...|$|R

50|$|The CDM is a {{flexible}} mechanism set {{up under the}} Kyoto Protocol {{with the aim of}} creating ‘Carbon Credits’ for trade in trading schemes such as the EU ETS. Despite coming under heavy criticism (see Evans, p134-135; and Burniaux et al., p58-65), the theory is that as the marginal cost of environmental abatement is lower in non-Annex B countries a scheme like this will promote technology transfer from Annex B to non-Annex B countries resulting in cheaper emissions reductions. Because under consumption-based emissions accounting a country is responsible for the emissions caused by its imports, {{it is important for the}} importing country to encourage good <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviour</b> and promote the cleanest production technologies available in the exporting country. Therefore, unlike the Kyoto Protocol where the CDM was added later, consumption-based emissions accounting inherently promotes clean development in the foreign country because of the way it allocates emissions. One loophole that remains relevant is ‘carbon colonialism’ whereby developed countries do not mitigate the underlying problem but simply continue to increase consumption offsetting this by exploiting the abatement potential of developing countries.|$|E

SMEs are also responsible for around 60% of commercial waste and 43% of all serious industrial pollution incidents. The perception of SME <b>environmental</b> <b>behaviour</b> is generally poor.

The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated flame retardants. In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus brominated flame retardants. About a dozen halogen free flame retardants were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied flame retardants were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS).
