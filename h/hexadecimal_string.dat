50|$|As an example, a {{routing prefix}} in the fd00::/8 range would be {{constructed}} by generating a random 40-bit <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>string,</b> {{taken to be}} e48dba82e1 in this example. The string is appended to the fd00::/8 prefix. This forms the 48-bit routing prefix fde4:8dba:82e1::/48. With this prefix, 65536 subnets of size /64 are available for the private network: fde4:8dba:82e1::/64 to fde4:8dba:82e1:ffff::/64.|$|E
5000|$|The {{characteristics}} of this secret or key {{are determined by}} the system which uses it; some system designs require that such keys be in a particular format. It can be a password, a passphrase, or a <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>string.</b> The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems.|$|E
5000|$|Where [...] "new" [...] is the {{standard}} routine in Pascal for allocating memory for a pointer, and [...] "hex" [...] is presumably a routine to print the <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>string</b> describing {{the value of an}} integer. This would allow the display of the address of a pointer, something which is not normally permitted. (Pointers cannot be read or written, only assigned [...]) Assigning a value to an integer variant of a pointer would allow examining or writing to any location in system memory: ...|$|E
50|$|Well-known binary (WKB) {{representations}} {{are typically}} shown in <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>strings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FreeSWAN ipsec {{implementation}} precedes Base64 strings with 0s, so {{they can}} be distinguished from text or <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>strings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{displayed}} {{for human}} inspection, fingerprints are usually encoded into <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>strings.</b> These strings are then formatted into groups of characters for readability. For example, a 128-bit MD5 fingerprint would be displayed as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Macs {{made after}} 1987 but prior to 1998, upon failing the POST, will {{immediately}} halt with a [...] "death chime", {{which is a}} sound that varies by model; {{it can be a}} beep, a car crash sound, the sound of shattering glass, a short musical tone, or more. On the screen, if working, will be the Sad Mac icon, along with two hexadecimal strings, which can be used to identify the problem. Macs made prior to 1987 crashed silently with the <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>string</b> and a Sad Mac icon.|$|E
50|$|WPA Enterprise {{provides}} RADIUS based authentication using 802.1x. WPA Personal uses a pre-shared Shared Key (PSK) {{to establish}} the security using an 8 to 63 character passphrase. The PSK may also be entered as a 64 character <b>hexadecimal</b> <b>string.</b> Weak PSK passphrases can be broken using off-line dictionary attacks by capturing the messages in the four-way exchange when the client reconnects after being deauthenticated. Wireless suites such as aircrack-ng can crack a weak passphrase {{in less than a}} minute. Other WEP/WPA crackers are AirSnort and Auditor Security Collection. Still, WPA Personal is secure when used with ‘good’ passphrases or a full 64-character hexadecimal key.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is a JavaScript implementation of the above algorithm for converting any number to a <b>hexadecimal</b> in <b>String</b> representation. Its purpose is to illustrate the above algorithm. To work with data seriously, however, {{it is much more}} advisable to work with bitwise operators.|$|R
