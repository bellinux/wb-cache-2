40|$|The {{transgene}} locus KH 15, {{which is}} highly susceptible to silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana, contains two inversely repeated beta -glucuronidase (<b>gus)</b> <b>genes</b> {{separated by a}} palindromic sequence and has a low GUS activity, {{was found to be}} heavily methylated in the gus coding sequence and {{in the center of the}} inverted repeat.

Despite the presence of a 732 -bp palindromic sequence in the deletion line derived from KH 15, this sequence was not methylated. Whereas the KH 15 locus triggers methylation of homologous <b>gus</b> <b>genes</b> when placed in trans to them, the deletion derivative did not. suggesting that the capacity for cross-talk was severely affected by disruption of the palindromic arrangement.

Obviously, the production of these engineered plants have great agricultural and laboratory promise. However, creating an appropriate reporter vector has shown to be problematic. cis-regulatory elements {{play a major role}} in the transcriptional activation of genes in plants, and many are not well understood. Many phytosensors either under express their reporter genes or report false-positives due to synthetic promoters. The authors of Rao et al. (2010) utilized the FLP recombinase tool for the production of a highly efficient phytosensors. The authors used a heat shock promoter to induce the production of FLP while a FRT-flanked vector separated the CaMV 35S promoter from the beta-glucuronidase gene (GUS). When the plants were exposed to heat-shock, FLP-induction led to the excision of the FRT-flanked vector, effectively moving the <b>GUS</b> <b>gene</b> directly downstream of the CaMV 35S promoter. The activation of GUS led to the leaves of the plants to change from green to blue; thus, the phytosensor effectively reported stress to the model system! ...|$|E

Cotyledonary and hypocotyls explants obtained from 4 and 7 days old seedling of Elite and RJS 003 varieties were utilized in this study. Genetic transformation was implemented through Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA 4404 containing PBI 121 plasmid and Agrobacterium tumefaciens C 58, LBA 4404, AGL 0 and EHA 101 strains which contain P 6 u- ubi- fvt 1 construct. The T-DNA region of P 6 u- Ubi- Fvt 1 plasmid included HPT (Hygromycin phosphotransferase) plant selectable marker and Fld (flavodoxin) gene.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{interest}} for the presence and role of endogenous GUS in plants increased, being previously limited {{to the use of}} GUS from E. coli as a reporter <b>gene.</b> Three different <b>GUS</b> <b>genes</b> have been identified in A. thaliana and different roles have been suggested, mainly associated to plant cell wall remodelling and to the regulation of the presence in the active form of molecules with regulative functions. This thesis investigated several aspects: A) artefacts in histochemical GUS detection, B) role of GUS in pollen tube germination and growth, C) GUS expression in N. tabacum and A. thaliana, D) identification of <b>GUS</b> <b>genes</b> in N. tabcum and their phylogenetic analysis in angiosperms. A) Histochemical detection of E. coli GUS activity in transformed plants can be impaired by the presence of GUS inhibitors and by the solubility of an intermediate reaction product formed when X-glu is used as substrate. The expression of LAT 52 has been revised. B) The use of saccharolattone, a GUS inhibitor, suggests that GUS is involved in pollen tube germination and growth. C) GUS expression was observed in all organs of N. tabacum and A. thaliana. Expression studies, in collaboration with researchers of Calabria University, have been performed in Arabidopsis, by in situ mRNA hybridization: GUS 3 is specifically expressed in border like cells and probably it is involved in their detachment from root tip; GUS 1 and GUS 2 are expressed in the root cup meristem, resulting perhaps involved in regulation of the mitotic cycle.

However, there is no report of a rice line developed in Korea that can be used for regeneration of fertile and genetically stable transformants. In this paper, we first demonstrate that a Korean variety, Nakdongbyeo, is suitable to obtain transgenic rice plants. Protoplasts from embryogenic suspension cultures were co-transformed with HPT (hygromycin phosphohansferase) and <b>GUS</b> (β-glucuronidase) <b>genes</b> in seperate plasmids in the presence of PEG (polyethylene glycol). In 5 independent experiments, the average frequency of calli showing hygromycin resistance were 1. 73 %. Plantlets were regenerated from the Hyg^R calli.

Sponsorship: BBSRC/MAFFTwo oat varieties, Melys (spring variety) and Bulwark (winter variety) were transformed by particle bombardment of primary embryogenic callus using either a ubi-bar-ubi-gus co-integration vector or co-transformed (Melys) with a ubi-bar plasmid together {{with one of}} three plasmids containing the ?-glucuronidase (<b>gus)</b> <b>gene</b> {{under the control of}} either a rice actin promoter, a CaMV 35 S promoter or a wheat high molecular weight glutenin promoter. Morphologically normal and fertile transgenic plants were regenerated following callus selection with glufosinate ammonium. Evidence for the integration and functioning of the selectable (bar) and reporter (gus) genes in To and T 1 plants was confirmed by PCR, Southern hybridisation, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), histochemical assays, and by progeny analysis. Transformation rates varied from 0. 2 to 5. 0 lines/plate of callus bombarded, with co-transformation frequencies of 83 to 100 percnt;, and co-expression frequencies of 60 to 100 percnt;.

Supertransforming rice calluses with a direct-repeat (d/r) construct, although not as effective as those with the i/r construct, was also substantially more effective in silencing the resident <b>GUS</b> <b>gene</b> than the simple sense and antisense constructs. DNA hybridisation analyses revealed that every callus line supertransformed with either simple sense or antisense constructs, and subsequently showing GUS silencing, had the silence-inducing transgenes integrated into the plant genome in inverted-repeat configurations. The silenced lines containing i/r and d/r constructs did not necessarily have inverted-repeat T-DNA insertions. There was significant methylation of the GUS sequences in most of the silenced lines but not in the unsilenced lines. However, demethylation treatment of silenced lines with 5 -azacytidine did not reverse the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of GUS. Whereas the levels of RNA specific to the resident <b>GUS</b> <b>gene</b> were uniformly low in the silenced lines, RNA specific to the inducer transgenes accumulated to a substantial level, and the majority of the i/r RNA was unpolyadenylated.

We used the #Casuarina glauca$ and #Allocasuarina verticillata$ transformation system to examine the properties of the soybean (Ibc 3), #Parasponia andersonii$, and #Trema tomentosa$ hemoglobin gene promoters in actinorhizal plants. Expression of the hemoglobin promoters <b>gus</b> <b>genes</b> was examined by fluorometric and histochemical assays. The fluorometric assays in various organs showed that the soybean and #P. andersonii$ promoters were most active in nodules whereas the #T. tomentosa$ promoter gave a very high activity in roots. The histochemical study showed that GUS activity directed by the soybean and the #P. andersonii$ <b>gus</b> chimeric <b>genes</b> appeared mainly confined to the infected cells of the #C. glauca$ and #A. verticillata$ nodules. The #T. tomentosa$ hemoglobin promoter was primarily expressed in the root's cortex and vascular tissue.

The increase in GUS activity {{was positively correlated with}} the amount of RF 2 a, and the expression pattern of the RTBV promoter was altered from phloem-specific to constitutive. Constitutive expression of RF 2 a did not induce morphological changes in the transgenic plants. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of the b-ZIP domain of RF 2 a had a strong effect on the development of transgenic plants. These studies suggest that expression of the b-Zip domain can interfere with the function of homologues of RF 2 a that regulate development of tobacco plants...|$|R
