To provide the power, TVA engaged {{in one of the}} largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the U.S. By early in 1942, when the effort reached its peak, 12 hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time, and design and construction employment reached a total of 28,000. The largest project of this period was the Fontana Dam. After negotiations led by Vice-President Harry Truman ("I want aluminum. I don't care if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> from Alcoa or Al Capone."), TVA purchased the land from Nantahala Power and Light, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alcoa, and built Fontana Dam.|$|E

On 2 May, he played the song to Bob Dylan at the latter's hotel suite in London; as the track started, Dylan said dismissively: [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> You don't want to be cute anymore." [...] According to Marianne Faithfull, who was also present, Dylan then walked out of the room. McCartney recalled that when the Beatles played the song to members of the Rolling Stones and the Who, they [...] "visibly sat up and were interested", whereas Cilla Black [...] "just laughed".|$|E

It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness." [...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it.</b> It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E

500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it?</b> [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{viewed the}} novel as a story of [...] "love and money," [...] noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, {{executive}} producer Sydney Pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. [...] "I'm from Indiana; if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> everyone gets it," [...] he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, [...] "You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?" [...] She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than {{in the book and}} added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. [...] "Family dramas," [...] he stated, [...] "are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will." ...|$|E

The disc included a version of Melissa Etheridge's [...] "You Can Sleep While I Drive" [...] and Tammy Wynette's [...] "Till <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>it</b> Right". The album found widespread popularity, with its first two singles becoming Yearwood's first number 1 in three years: [...] "XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)" [...] and the title track. Its third single, [...] "I Wanna Go Too Far" [...] would reach the Top10 after its release {{at the end of}} 1995.

Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other.

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Wynette, along with singer Loretta Lynn, ruled the country charts {{and was one}} of the most {{successful}} female vocalists of the genre. During the early 1970s, number-one singles included [...] "He Loves Me All the Way" [...] "Run Woman, Run" [...] and [...] "The Wonders You Perform" [...] (all from 1970), [...] "Good Lovin' (Makes it Right)", [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] (both 1971) [...] "My Man (Understands)", [...] "'Til <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>it</b> Right" [...] (1972), and [...] "Kids Say the Darndest Things" [...] (1973). One of them, [...] "The Wonders You Perform", was a hit in Italy in 1971, thanks to Ornella Vanoni, who recorded the song in an Italian version, [...] "Domani è un altro giorno" [...] ("Tomorrow is another day"). Concurrent to her solo success, a number of her duets with Jones reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts during this time, including [...] "The Ceremony" [...] (1972), [...] "We're Gonna Hold On" [...] (1973), and [...] "Golden Ring" [...] (1976).

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.
