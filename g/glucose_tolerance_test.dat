40|$|There is {{need for}} simple, {{inexpensive}} measures of <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance,</b> insulin sensitivity, and insulin secretion in dogs. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the closeness of correlation between fasting and dynamic measures of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, the precision of fasting measures, and the agreement between results of standard and simplified <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> in dogs. A retrospective descriptive study using 6 naturally occurring obese and 6 lean dogs was conducted. Data from frequently sampled intravenous <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> (FSIGTTs) in 6 obese and 6 lean client-owned dogs were used to calculate HOMA, QUICKI, fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Fasting measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion were compared with MINMOD analysis of FSIGTTs using Pearson correlation coefficients, and they were evaluated for precision by the discriminant ratio. Simplified sampling protocols were compared with standard FSIGTTs using Lin 2 ̆ 7 s concordance correlation coefficients, limits of agreement, and Pearson correlation coefficients. All fasting measures except fasting plasma glucose concentration were moderately correlated with MINMOD-estimated insulin sensitivity (|r| = 0. 62 - 0. 80; P < 0. 03), and those that combined fasting insulin and glucose were moderately closely correlated with MINMOD-estimated insulin secretion (r = 0. 60 - 0. 79; P < 0. 04). HOMA calculated using the nonlinear formulae had the closest estimated correlation (r = 0. 77 and 0. 74) and the best discrimination for insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion (discriminant ratio 4. 4 and 3. 4, respectively). Simplified sampling protocols with half as many samples collected over 3 h had close agreement with the full sampling protocol.

40|$|Determination of the {{long-term}} function of islet transplantation {{in relation to the}} implantation site and the numbers of islets is of scientific interest and, with human islet transplant trials in progress, is a pressing clinical question. In this study, highly purified canine islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and Ficoll purification, and autotransplanted into either the spleen (in 10 dogs) or the liver (in 12 dogs). Dogs transplanted with islets into the spleen or liver received 264, 300 ± 20, 300 (mean ± SEM) and 158, 600 ± 15, 100 islet equivalents (150 -μm-sized islets) respectively. Graft survival at 1 yr was 86 % in intrasplenic islet autografts (ISTx) and 50 % in intraportal islet autografts (IPTx). Intravenous <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> and mixed meal-oral glucose tests were performed 1 - 12 mo from islet transplantation. Compared to controls, ISTx and IPTx dogs showed a similar decrease of <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> after both intravenous <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests</b> and mixed meal-oral glucose <b>tests.</b> On intravenous <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>tests,</b> plasma insulin levels were lower in ISTx than in IPTx dogs and controls. On mixed meal-oral glucose tests, insulin values were higher in IPTx dogs than in controls. There was a positive correlation (r =. 56, p < 0. 05) between the number of transplanted islet equivalents and the K values. These results demonstrate that, in dogs with islet transplant: 1) long-term islet survival can be achieved in the spleen better than in the liver; 2) islet survival is related to the mass of transplanted islets in the spleen, but not in the liver, where other factors probably affect islet survival; 3) the ability of metabolizing glucose is reduced after both intrasplenic and intraportal islet autografts; 4) both reduced insulin secretion (predominant in ISTx dogs on intravenous <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>testing)</b> and insulin resistance (predominant in IPTx dogs on mixed meal-oral glucose tests) are the probable causes of the decreased <b>glucose</b> <b>tolerance.</b> © 1992...|$|R
