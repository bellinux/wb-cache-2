40|$|Background: In Europe, {{extracts}} of Equisetum arvense (common horsetail) have a {{long tradition}} {{in the treatment of}} inflammatory disorders. To understand the molecular basis for its use, we investigated the immunomodulatory capacity of a standardized commercially available common horsetail extract on human primary lymphocyte function in vitro. Methods: The standardized <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equisetum</b> arvense was phytochemically characterized. Effects on proliferation, viability and activity of mitogen-activated human lymphocytes were assessed in comparison to cyclosporine A using annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays and flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterization, respectively. Intracellular levels of effector molecules (IL- 2, IFN-γ and TNF-α) were analyzed with cytokine assays. Results: T cell proliferation was inhibited dose dependently by the Equisetum extract without induction of apoptosis or necrosis. This effect was mediated through inhibition of lymphocyte activation, specifically by diminishing CD 69 and IL- 2 surface receptor expression and intracellular IL- 2 production. Furthermore, treatment with Equisetum arvense inhibited effector functions, as indicated by reduced production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. Conclusions: The data indicate that the used <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equisetum</b> arvense interferes with the polyfunctionality of immunocompetent cells thereby providing an anti-inflammatory mode-of-action...|$|E

Aim of the study: To assess the ability <b>of</b> <b>extracts</b> from <b>Equisetum</b> giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke to block genital viral infection by herpes simplex virus type 2. Materials and Methods: Equisetum giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke were collected from the Amazon region of La Paz, Bolivia. Extracts were prepared and screened for anti-viral activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) using both in vitro and in in vivo models <b>of</b> infection. Results: <b>Equisetum</b> giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke efficiently blocked HSV- 2 infection of cell cultures without major cell cytotoxic effects. <b>Extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equisetum</b> giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke could prevent HSV- 2 disease development when administered together with virus in a mouse model of genital HSV- 2 infection. In vitro analyses revealed that both plant extracts exerted their anti-HSV- 2 effects by interfering with viral cell attachment and entry, but could not block viral replication post entry. Conclusions: These studies show that <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equisetum</b> giganteum L and Copaifera reticulate Ducke have potent antiviral activities against HSV- 2 comparable to those two previously identified plants, Croton lechleri Mull.

40|$|Styrylpyrone synthase was {{detected}} in cell free <b>extracts</b> from gametophytes <b>of</b> <b>Equisetum</b> arvense. This new enzyme catalyses {{the formation of}} styrylpyrones from malonyl-CoA and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA precursors. A standard enzyme assay was established. The enzyme activity was characterized in partially purified protein extracts. p-Coumaroyl-CoA was accepted as substrate at pH 6. 0 - 8. 5 in various buffer systems {{with the formation of}} bisnoryangonin, and optimum enzyme activity was observed in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7. 5. Caffeoyl-CoA was accepted as substrate only in potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6. 0 - 7. 5 with formation of hispidin; optimum enzymeactivity was observed at pH 7. 0. The apparent K(m) values were 220 mu m for caffeoyl-CoA and 230 mu m for p-coumaroyl-CoA. The temperature optimum of the enzyme activity was 37 degree for bisnoryangonin and 30 degree for hispidin formation. Molecular weight determination by FPLC indicated that this protein has a native molecular weight of ca 56 - 77 kDa. Styrylpyrones accumulate in rhizomes of sporophytes and gametophytes of E. arvense as major constitutive metabolites. In these organs no flavonoids could be detected. In green sprouts, styrylpyrone accumulation is only detected as a local response to mechanical wounding or microbial attack, and flavonoids are accumulated as major polyketide metabolites. Thus, chalcone synthase is active in the sporophytes and might have developed in the course of evolution from styrylpyrone synthase present in the more primitive gametophytes...|$|R
