50|$|Chino (Derek Ramsay), a rich playboy, meets Lani (Cristine Reyes), a GI baby of {{a former}} prostitute, when he visits Angeles City for a bar hopping. During Chino and Lani’s {{whirlwind}} romance, Chino gets into a fight with a mayor’s son that leads his brother Sammy (John Estrada) {{to send him to}} America. Lani, with no knowledge of Chino’s departure to America, follows Chino to Manila to tell him about her pregnancy. Upon Lani’s visit, Sammy refuses Lani entry to their house. As Sammy leaves the house, not looking at the commotion Lani is causing outside his car, he instructs his driver to ignore Lani’s pleas and carry on <b>driving.</b> <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> accidentally bumps into Lani, causing her miscarriage.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving gear}} is a {{rotating}} rod spring-loaded 7-roll drive. It consists of five wheels, a guide wheel {{at the rear}} and the front drive wheel. Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light chain. In off-road <b>driving,</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> must be careful to keep the chain tension constant. Even with a failed torsion bar the M548 is still roadworthy. The power of the motor drives the transfer gearcase, generator and the cooling of the differential/steering gear. The transfer gearcase {{can be used as}} a separating clutch when towing the vehicle and serves to reduce the motor's speed. The power transmission between the drive follows the torque converter with an automatic lock-up clutch.|$|E

30|$|Second {{difference}} is that, although Hybrid {{has a much}} lower environmental impact than the other two, its throttle standard deviation tends to be higher. Again the difference can {{be due to the}} fact that, when <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> Hybrid, <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> have just <b>the</b> accelerator to control it and therefore they tend to use it more. In other words with a manual gearbox <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> can decide to shift to a lower gear to have high acceleration while with an automated gearbox he/she can only kick down the accelerator.|$|R
5000|$|On September 11, 2003 30-year-old Omaha Police Officer Jason Tye Pratt {{pulled a}} vehicle over at 10:30 p.m. for {{speeding}} and erratic <b>driving.</b> <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> {{of the vehicle}} was 21-year-old Albert Rucker, a fugitive wanted by police on two felony warrants. Rucker had 141 arrests on his record http://www.sparkpod.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/sparkpod.woa/wa/view?1016160 by then. Rucker pulled over, left his vehicle and fled the scene. Pratt assisted the other Officers at the scene searching for Rucker. Rucker shot Pratt in the head as he approached him in hiding. Rucker then engaged backup Officer Frank Platt in a shootout {{in which he was}} mortally wounded by Platt. Rucker died four hours later in the hospital. Officer Jason Pratt died 8 days later on September 19. The incident gained national attention. On a visit to Omaha with Pratt's widow, Stacy, and family, US Attorney General John Ashcroft stated [...] "the justice system had failed Pratt and her two daughters". This was {{based on the fact that}} Rucker had repeatedly appeared before Douglas County District Judge, Sandra Dougherty, since 1999, and she had lowered Rucker's bond each time.|$|E
50|$|Cylinder {{deactivation}} is used {{to reduce}} the fuel consumption and emissions of an internal combustion engine during light-load operation. In typical light-load <b>driving</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> uses only around 30 percent of an engine’s maximum power. In these conditions, the throttle valve is nearly closed, and the engine needs to work to draw air. This causes an inefficiency known as pumping loss. Some large capacity engines need to be throttled so much at light load that the cylinder pressure at top dead centre is approximately half that of a small 4-cylinder engine. Low cylinder pressure results in lower fuel efficiency. The use of cylinder deactivation at light load means there are fewer cylinders drawing air from the intake manifold, which works to increase its fluid (air) pressure. Operation without variable displacement is wasteful because fuel is continuously pumped into each cylinder and combusted even though maximum performance is not required. By shutting down half of an engine's cylinders, the amount of fuel being consumed is much less. Between reducing the pumping losses, which increases pressure in each operating cylinder, and decreasing the amount of fuel being pumped into the cylinders, fuel consumption can be reduced by 8 to 25 percent in highway conditions.|$|E

To calculate this acceleration, we approximate the driver with an optimal regulator, and derive an optimal trajectory through which the acceleration can be found. Our de¯nition of an optimal trajectory, is such that resulting path should be both comfortable, safe, fast and legal. Simulations indicate that the new model can lead to signi¯cant gains in both tracking and prediction performance...|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies of}} real-life driving are {{reported}} in which individual differences in fatigue and stress were explored in Australian professional and non-professional drivers.

In Study 2 104 non-professional drivers completed the same subjective state measures before and after a short-duration drive, as drivers in Study 1. Drivers also completed the Fatigue Proneness Scale. Fatigue-prone drivers in both studies showed elevated levels of state fatigue, tension, unpleasant mood and task-related cognitive interference.

30|$|Little {{is known}} about the manner in which drivers {{interact}} with new technologies in vehicles. Many such technologies are thought to increase <b>the</b> risk of <b>driver</b> distraction since they may increase the likelihood that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> will take his or her “eyes off the road” during <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> task and hence not focus on the traffic conditions (i.e., become ‘distracted’) thereby increasing the crash-risk. In this study, ‘eyes-off-road’ is defined as any point during <b>driving</b> at which <b>the</b> visual attention is diverted away from the road towards the vehicle interior or mirrors. Hedlund [1] provides a useful definition of distraction; he defines it as being “a diversion of attention from <b>driving,</b> because <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is temporarily focusing on an object, person, task or event not related to <b>driving,</b> which reduces <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> awareness, decision making ability and/or performance, leading to an increased risk of corrective actions, near-crashes, or crashes”.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, road {{accidents}} {{have increased}} significantly. One {{of the major}} reasons for these accidents, as reported is driver fatigue. Due to continuous and longtime <b>driving,</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> gets exhausted and drowsy which may lead to an accident. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for a system to measure the fatigue level of driver and alert him when he/she feels drowsy to avoid accidents. Thus, we propose a system which comprises of a camera installed on the car dashboard. The camera detect the driver's face and observe the alteration in its facial features and uses these features to observe the fatigue level. Facial features include eyes and mouth. Principle Component Analysis is thus implemented to reduce the features while minimizing the amount of information lost. The parameters thus obtained are processed through Support Vector Classifier for classifying the fatigue level. After that classifier output is sent to the alert unit.

40|$|Environmental concerns, {{security}} of fuel supply and CO 2 regulations are driving {{innovation in the}} automotive industry towards electric and hybrid electric vehicles. The fuel economy and emission performance of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) strongly depends on the energy management system (EMS). Prior knowledge of driving information {{could be used to}} enhance the performance of a HEV. However, how the necessary information can be obtained to use in EMS optimisation still remains a challenge. In this paper the effect of driver style and driving events like city and highway driving on plug in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) energy demand is studied. Using real world driving data from three drivers of very different driver style, a simulation has been exercised for a given route having city and highway driving. Driver style and driving events both affect vehicle energy demand. In both driving events considered, vehicle energy demand is different due to driver styles. The major part of city driving is reactive driving influenced by external factors and driver leading to variation in vehicle speed and hence energy demand. In free highway <b>driving,</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> choice of cruise speed is the only factor affecting vehicle energy demand...|$|E
40|$|Low {{visibility}} {{is one of}} {{the reasons}} for rear accident at night. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the leading vehicle based on multisensor to decrease rear accidents at night. Then, we use image enhancement algorithm to improve the human vision. First, by millimeter wave radar to get the world coordinate of the preceding vehicles and establish the transformation of the relationship between the world coordinate and image pixels coordinate, we can convert the world coordinates of the radar target to image coordinate in order to form the region of interesting image. And then, by using the image processing method, we can reduce interference from the outside environment. Depending on D-S evidence theory, we can achieve a general value of reliability to test vehicles of interest. The experimental results show that the method can effectively eliminate the influence of illumination condition at night, accurately detect leading vehicles, and determine their location and accurate positioning. In order to improve nighttime <b>driving,</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> shortage vision, reduce rear-end accident. Enhancing nighttime color image by three algorithms, a comparative study and evaluation by three algorithms are presented. The evaluation demonstrates that results after image enhancement satisfy the human visual habits...|$|E
