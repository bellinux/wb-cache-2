50|$|Generating a {{sufficient}} amount of revenue to finance government {{is arguably the}} most important purpose of the tax system. Optimal taxation, which is the theory of designing and implementing taxes that reduce inefficiency and distortion in the market through Pareto optimal moves under given constraints, is constantly debated. Though inequality will always exist within even the most efficient markets, the goal of taxation is to eliminate as much inefficiency as possible and to raise revenue to fund government expenditures. With any tax, there will be an excess burden, or additional cost, to the consumer and the producer. Whenever the consumer purchases the taxed good or service, and the <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity,</b> or responsiveness, of the demanded product, the greater the excess burden is on either the consumer or producer. Those individuals or corporations who have the most inelastic demand curve pay the brunt of the excess burden curve. However, the tradeoff of placing larger taxes on inelastic goods is that the higher tax will lead to lower quantity exchanged and thus a smaller deadweight loss of reduced revenue.|$|E

50|$|Even though dry instant noodles {{might not}} show {{any sign of}} elasticity, cooked instant noodles {{generally}} have <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity</b> than other types of noodles when they are cooked, and the unique wavy form also differentiates instant noodles from other common noodles like udon or flat noodles. The wavy form of instant noodles sometimes creates random spirals after noodles are cooked, which can give a unique springiness to the noodle strands. The wavy form of instant noodles is formed when noodle dough sheets are being cut by rotation slitters. As mentioned above, due {{to the difference between}} the velocity of conveying belt and blade rotation, noodle dough sheets could be pressed by blades multiple times within a certain area, and that creates the unique wavy form of instant noodles. During pressing by heavy blades, the continuous gluten structure is ruptured at certain points and does not return to its original shape, but the remaining gluten structures are strong enough to keep it hanging; therefore, wavy noodle strands are formed and maintained during processing. Other than the physical springiness, the selection of ingredients also ensures the high elasticity of instant noodles. Instant noodles require wheat flour with high protein content to ensure noodle strands are be broken during processing, which will make a more viscoelastic noodle dough and result in more elastic noodles. Furthermore, potato starch is a key ingredient in instant noodles, which has characteristics of low gelatinization temperature, high viscosity, and rapid swelling. Therefore, the addition of starch could also increase the elasticity of noodles. High salt content in instant noodles also increase the elasticity of noodle strands. Salt, dissolved in water as ions, could strengthen the interaction between gluten structures which can also increase the elasticity of noodles.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} non-cooperative and cooperative strategies {{with respect to}} manufacturer and retailer coupons. In a model with one manufacturer selling its product to one retailer, {{it is found that}} the retailer can achieve third-degree price discrimination equilibrium in retail markets by issuing coupons to demanders with <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity.</b> Although facing only one retailer, the manufacturer can also achieve the same third-degree price discrimination equilibrium by issuing coupons directly to demanders of <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity.</b> However, when only one firm issues the coupon, both manufacturer and retailer coupons can help alleviate the channel profit loss due to double marginalization. If the manufacturer and the retailer non-cooperatively issue coupons, then the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium outcomes are equivalent to those under the successive third-degree price discrimination. Moreover, cooperative strategies between the manufacturer and the retailer can eliminate double marginalization, achieve the vertical integration effect, and lead to higher profits, consumer surpluses, and social surpluses than non-cooperative coupon strategies.

30|$|Flow {{resistance}} {{is the third}} mechanism that can improve volumetric or macroscopic sweep efficiency during polymer flooding. Dehghanpour and Kuru (2010) investigated the effect of viscoelastic fluid rheology on {{the formation of an}} “internal cake” (frictional pressure drop). They observed that the fluid with <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity</b> exhibited significantly higher pressure drop during flow through porous media. This elastic effect that results in additional pressure drop could be enhanced by widening the molecular weight distribution without changing the shear viscosity. A similar trend was obtained by Urbissinova et al. (2010), who also evaluated the contribution of polymer’s elasticity in EOR. Likewise, they observed that the polymer solution showing <b>higher</b> <b>elasticity</b> experienced higher flow resistance (pressure drop) to flow through porous media than the polymer with lower elasticity, even though their shear viscosities were identical, which rendered improved macro-scale sweep efficiency and oil recovery (Veerabhadrappa 2012). This mechanism may also improve the microscopic displacement efficiency in displacing residual oil immobilized in the core by capillary forces and rock configuration (Wang et al. 2000).|$|E
40|$|This paper updates {{a review}} {{conducted}} by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1996 in which the agency evaluated the academic research {{on the effects of}} changes in after-tax wages on labor supply in the U. S. economy. That review concluded that substitution elasticities were larger in absolute value than income elasticities and that the decision to work was more responsive to after-tax wages than was the choice of hours. In this update, we find that for men and single women, estimates of substitution elasticities have increased, and income elasticities still appear to be smaller in absolute value than substitution elasticities. We also find that labor supply elasticities of married women have fallen substantially in the last three decades, although they are still <b>higher</b> than the <b>elasticities</b> of men and unmarried women. Based on our review, the elasticities of broad measures of income (total income less capital gains) from tax return data are in most instances consistent with the labor supply elasticities estimated using survey data.

3000|$|Our {{results also}} confirm that disparities do {{exist in the}} sense that labour markets are {{heterogeneous}} and exhibit segmentation at different dissections. In general, we find that the determinants of industrial labour demand are quantitatively different, mainly across regions and, to some extent, across subsectors and plant sizes, in the latter cases when we focus on demand for temporary workers. For example, the <b>highest</b> long-run own-price <b>elasticity</b> is found for unskilled-permanent workers located in Pereira (−[*] 1.843) while the lowest corresponds to unskilled-temporary in Bogotá (−[*] 0.27). Interestingly, the elasticities of permanent skilled workers range between −[*] 0.555 (Bogotá) and −[*] 1.3 (Manizales). Thus, we claim that heterogeneity of labour demand is reflected the most in the estimated coefficients across cities and draw attention to the implications of this heterogeneity for labour policy design and outcomes. In particular, wage setting across cities should be studied in order to understand whether the <b>higher</b> <b>elasticities</b> respond to rigidities. In addition, some retraining programs might be designed to face the output shocks given the <b>high</b> <b>elasticities</b> found in some regions. 5 [...]...|$|R
