500|$|Acoustical Manufacturing Company had {{launched}} a ribbon-hybrid, horn-loaded [...] "Corner Ribbon Loudspeaker" [...] in 1949, {{but this was}} not commercially successful. The electrostatics were designed by David Williamson, and the company's founder, Peter Walker, from a principle elaborated by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric that was granted a patent in 1934. However, more immediately, a book published in the US in 1954 extolling the scientific merits of the electrostatic [...] transducer inspired Walker to develop an electrostatic loudspeaker of his own; this was technologically enabled by the Mylar film developed by Dupont that came to market in 1949. Walker demonstrated a prototype electrostatic panel speaker (with exceptional clarity in the midrange), and a full-frequency <b>infinite</b> <b>baffle</b> speaker (with ample bass response) at the British Sound Recording Association Annual Exhibition in May 1955. After more research, the large panel speaker with better response over the whole frequency range was demonstrated to the Physical Society in March 1956. The ESL entered commercial production in 1957, and was discontinued only in 1985.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>infinite</b> <b>baffles</b> are {{impractical}} and finite baffles tend {{to suffer}} poor response as wavelengths approach {{the dimensions of}} the baffle (i.e. at lower frequencies), most loudspeaker cabinets use some sort of structure (usually a box) to contain the out of phase sound energy.

For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus [...] "focusing" [...] them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.|$|E

40|$|The study {{presented}} is {{an investigation}} of the non-linear dynamics and stability of simply supported, circular cylindrical shells containing inviscid incompressible fluid flow. Non-linearities due to large-amplitude shell motion are considered by using the non-linear Donnell´s shallow shell theory, with account taken of the effect of viscous structural damping. Linear potential flow theory is applied to describe the fluid-structure interaction. The system is discretiszd by Galerkin´s method, and is investigated by using a model involving seven degrees of freedom, allowing for travelling wave response of the shell and shell axisymmetric contraction. Two different boundary conditions are applied to the fluid flow beyond the shell, corresponding to: (i) <b>infinite</b> <b>baffles</b> (rigid extensions of the shell), and (ii) connection with a flexible wall of infinite extent in the longitudinal direction, permitting solution by separation of variables; they give two different kinds of dynamical behaviour of the system, {{as a consequence of the}} fact that axisymmetric contraction, responsible for the softening non-linear dynamical behaviour of shells, is not allowed if the fluid flow beyond the shell is constrained by rigid baffles.

40|$|The use of {{a purely}} {{analytical}} model to describe {{the details of a}} loudspeaker's acoustic performance is so cumbersome as to be practically impossible. Unfortunately, there are very few closed-form acoustic equations that are of much use to a loudspeaker designer. Even though the acoustic wave equation, D 2 p- 1 /c 2 (J 2 p/Jt 2) = 0 is compact, its solutions are generally not expressible in such a simple form. Solutions to the wave equation depend, in general, on two components: source terms and boundary conditions. A number of rudimentary source models are employed for instructional purposes in texts on acoustics. These include a spherical source with radial motion (a "breathing " sphere) and a flat circular piston. Boundary conditions often used for textbook analyses include <b>infinite</b> <b>baffles,</b> semi-infinite cylindrical tubes, and semi-infinite horns of various shapes. Even with these simplifications, the mathematics required to solve acoustic radiation problems are nontrivial.

The shapes of real-world transducers, horns, and loudspeaker enclosures are sufficiently complex that they cannot be accurately represented in concise mathematical forms.

However the term “infinite-baffle loudspeaker” can fairly be applied to any loudspeaker that behaves (or closely approximates) in all respects as if the drive unit is mounted in a genuine <b>infinite</b> <b>baffle.</b> The term is often and erroneously used of sealed enclosures which cannot exhibit infinite-baffle behavior unless their internal volume is much greater than the Vas Thiele/Small of the drive unit AND the front baffle dimensions are ideally several wavelengths of the lowest output frequency. It is important to distinguish between genuine infinite-baffle topology and so-called infinite-baffle or IB “enclosures” which may not meet genuine infinite-baffle criteria. The distinction becomes important when interpreting textbook usage of the term.|$|E

40|$|The aeroacoustic problem {{associated}} with the radiation of fan noise from the inlet of a turbofan aircraft engine, the dimensions of which are generally many {{times larger than the}} acoustical wavelengths of the major energy-carrying frequencies, is considered. In the present approach, a conventional finite element solution in the inner region is compatibly matched to a 'wave envelope' finite element solution in a large but finite outer region. The inclusion of a wavelike variation with the correct asymptotic decay in the shape functions for the outer region preserves the correct behavior of the solution at large distances. The method is initially presented for a simple one-dimensional model based on the solution of Webster's horn equation.

The constitutive equations for solid domain and the pressure acoustic equation for liquid domain are coupled via boundary conditions and solved numerically using the finite element method. Structural mode shapes and eigenfrequencies computed for plate submerged in water are compared to analogous results obtained for air and for the in vacuo case.

40|$|Predicting the {{insertion}} loss of an opening backed with an enclosed space {{is important for}} building noise control. Recent research in sound transmission through apertures of finite depth in <b>infinite</b> rigid <b>baffles</b> has included the effects of propagating and evanescent modes within the aperture in order to extend models to higher frequencies. The present study extends the model {{to the case of}} the aperture backed by a cavity as opposed to sound radiating into half-space. The role of coupling between the aperture modes, radiation modes, and cavity modes in the transmission was investigated. The results were compared to those of previous models which neglected the depth of the aperture and finite element modeling using COMSOL Multiphysics. Comparisons show that the current model is effective at predicting the sound transmission loss through the aperture and the acoustic field within the cavity for an obliquely incident plane wave. By changing impedance conditions on the half-space side of the aperture and within the aperture, the model has been used to evaluate passive noise control techniques...|$|R
50|$|Phase {{inversion}} {{is achieved}} by selecting a length of line that {{is equal to the}} quarter wavelength of the target lowest frequency. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows a hard boundary at one end (the speaker) and the open-ended line vent at the other. The phase relationship between the bass driver and vent is in phase in the pass band until the frequency approaches the quarter wavelength, when the relationship reaches 90 degrees as shown. However by this time the vent is producing most of the output (Fig. 2). Because the line is operating over several octaves with the drive unit, cone excursion is reduced, providing higher SPL’s and lower distortion levels, compared with reflex and <b>infinite</b> <b>baffle</b> designs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the 'open baffle' approach is to mount the loudspeaker driver in a very large sealed enclosure, providing minimal 'air spring' restoring force to the cone. This minimizes {{the change in the}} driver's resonant frequency caused by the enclosure. Some <b>infinite</b> <b>baffle</b> 'enclosures' have used an adjoining room, basement, or a closet or attic. This is often the case with exotic rotary woofer installations, as they are intended to go to frequencies lower than 20 Hertz and displace large volumes of air.

For the case of plane waves on a rectangular panel with anechoic edge conditions, and for the case of standing waves on a rectangular panel with simply supported edge conditions, the equations resulting from one of the standard reductions from quadruple to double integrals are given. These double integral equations can be reduced to single integral equations, but the versions of these equations given in the literature did not always converge when used with adaptive integral routines and were sometimes slower than the double integral versions. This is because the terms in the integrands in the existing equations have singularities. Although these singularities cancel, they caused problems for the adaptive integral routines.
