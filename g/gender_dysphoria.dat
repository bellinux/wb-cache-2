50|$|<b>Gender</b> dysphoria:Gender <b>dysphoria</b> or <b>gender</b> {{identity}} disorder (GID) {{occurs when}} the child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|R

25|$|In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{published}} the DSM-5 {{in which the}} GIDC diagnosis was removed and replaced with <b>gender</b> <b>dysphoria,</b> {{for the first time}} in its own distinct chapter. Lev states that <b>gender</b> <b>dysphoria</b> places the focus on distress with one's body rather than conformity with societal gender norms, and that this change was accompanied by changes to sexist language and a reduced reliance on binary gender categories. <b>Gender</b> <b>dysphoria</b> reframes the diagnosis as a time-limited distress of the body which is potentially rectified with access to gender transition procedures, rather than a lifetime disorder of the identity.|$|E

The implications of such an alternative reading are both particular and more general: the particular implications for this case are that gender reassignment may not free Alex from the web of parental desire and narcissism, and therefore it is difficult to say with any confidence that the decision was {{in the best interests of}} the child; and the more general implications of the reading are that gender is largely the product of convention and should not be viewed as inherently natural, inevitable and dichotomous.

Reports on the prevalence of detectable HPV DNA among transsexuals (not sex workers) are scarce. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the prevalence of detectable HPV DNA in a clinic sample of transsexuals and to assess the relationship between detectable HPV DNA and cytological outcomes. METHODS: Clinical samples (oral, anal, vaginal, cervicovaginal and penile scraped cells) from 35 transsexuals (surgically treated and surgically untreated) who attended the outpatient Clinic of <b>Gender</b> Identity <b>Dysphoria</b> of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Policlinico Hospital (Bari, Italy) were collected for cytological analysis and HPV DNA detection and typing. All enrolled subjects answered an anonymous structured questionnaire about their sexual habits.

25|$|The current {{diagnosis}} for transsexual {{people who}} present themselves for medical treatment is <b>gender</b> <b>dysphoria</b> (leaving out {{those who have}} sexual identity disorders without gender concerns). According to the Standards of care formulated by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), formerly the Harry Benjamin International <b>Gender</b> <b>Dysphoria</b> Association, this diagnostic label is often necessary to obtain sex reassignment therapy with health insurance coverage, and the designation of gender identity disorders as mental disorders is not a license for stigmatization or for the deprivation of gender patients' civil rights.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{transsexualism}} {{has also}} {{been included in the}} American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). With the DSM-5, transsexualism was removed as a diagnosis, and a diagnosis of <b>gender</b> <b>dysphoria</b> was created in its place. This change was made to reflect the consensus view by members of the APA that transsexuality is not in and of itself a disorder and that transsexual people should not be stigmatized unnecessarily. By including a diagnosis for <b>gender</b> <b>dysphoria,</b> transsexual people are still able to access medical care through the process of transition.|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{diagnosis}} of gender identity disorder (child and adolescent criteria) as used in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). It considers how gender identity disorder came {{to be in the}} fourth edition, and explores some of the problematic aspects of the DSM-IV criteria. The authors argue that research has focused on cross-gender behaviours and gender role, and consequently muddled issues of pathology. In particular, that this has served to pressure boys to conform to traditional gender and heterosexual roles. The authors suggest that the pathology accompanying <b>gender</b> identity <b>dysphoria</b> should be the focus of the clinical work rather than treating gender role behaviour. It is proposed that the model of atypical gender identity organization, is able to account for the diverse factors that may be contributing to a discordant gender identity, without labelling what may be a normal developmental pathway as pathological.

Bearing in mind its importance not only in the assessment of personality but also in predicting adaptive capacity, the goal of our research is based on the examination of Self-Perception of adult transsexual persons. Method. The study was conducted using a Rorschach test, which provides an insight into various aspects of Self-Perception. The sample consisted of 15 transsexual persons, who passed the standard diagnostic procedure. Results. The results suggest that transsexual persons manage to maintain Adequate Self-Esteem. Hypervigilance Index and Obsessive Style Index are negative, while the values showing a negative quality of Self-Regard and the capacity for introspection tend to increase. In the process of Self-Introspection, negative and painful emotional states are often perceived. Conclusion. The estimation of Self-Perception in adult transsexual persons indicates a trend of subjective perception of a personal imperfection or inadequacy.

This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.

25|$|Since the mid-1970s, Zucker {{has treated}} about 500 pre-adolescent gender-variant {{children}} to have them accept the gender identity they were assigned at birth until they are at an age he believes they may determine their own gender identity.

25|$|It is {{expected}} {{for children to}} develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to make judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment.

Between 1956 and 1958 Burou independently developed the anteriorly pedicled penile skin flap inversion vaginoplasty in his clinic. The technique became the “gold standard” of skin-lined vaginoplasty in transsexuals. Burou performed well over 800 confirmed vaginoplasties by 1974.
