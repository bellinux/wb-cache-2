5|$|Borates {{are used}} as <b>environmentally</b> benign wood preservatives.|$|E
5|$|Cement is not {{particularly}} <b>environmentally</b> friendly, since the manufacturing process generates large amounts of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attempts}} were made to make the base more <b>environmentally</b> friendly, in 2001 local commercial interests promoting the airport lost federal support.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{challenge facing}} marketers {{is to identify}} which consumers {{are willing to pay}} more for <b>environmentally</b> friendly products. It is apparent that an enhanced knowledge of the profile of this segment of consumers would be extremely useful.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Abdulkadir Ahmed Said {{released}} the Somali-Italian co-production La Conchiglia (Aleel). Another <b>environmentally</b> conscious short film, it predicted the devastating effects that illegal toxic waste dumping by foreign vessels {{would have on}} local marine life and the fishermen who depended on it.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fixing {{carbon dioxide in}} photosynthesis, some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This <b>environmentally</b> important trait {{can be found in}} most bacteria of the metabolic types listed above.|$|E
5|$|StrobilurinA {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the fruit bodies. Strobilurins have fungicidal activities and well known for their broad fungicidal spectrum, low toxicity against mammalian cells, and <b>environmentally</b> benign characteristics.|$|E
5|$|WhiteWaterWorld is {{currently}} ranked {{as one of}} the world's most water efficient parks because of its sustainable water management and <b>environmentally</b> friendly technology.|$|E
5|$|With {{respect to}} the former, the method {{developed}} by Larock in 1995 represents an <b>environmentally</b> and cost-attractive method as a catalytic substitute for the Saegusa–Ito oxidation.|$|E
5|$|A new owner, Michael Duane Roberts, {{bought the}} Vortex Mine in 2008. Its {{operations}} {{were designed to}} be <b>environmentally</b> friendly, using methods such as recycling all water and not using other chemicals. Roberts died in a mining accident in 2012. , there was also mining activity by individual hobby miners on small parcels at Sapphire Village, but the Roncor mines remained inactive.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as <b>environmentally</b> friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E
5|$|Cole was {{involved}} in creating an <b>environmentally</b> friendly knitwear company, The North Circular, which launched in 2009. The North Circular products are hand knit in the UK with British yarns, from which 5% of all profits, and all of Cole's, are donated to the Environmental Justice Foundation. She launched a womenswear range for the company in February 2010.|$|E
5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an <b>environmentally</b> sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the complex}} began in 2002, with {{construction}} beginning in 2003. After completion in 2005, the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability, the second city hall in the United States to earn that distinction. <b>Environmentally</b> friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, and solar panels to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and other}} facultative anaerobes {{constitute}} about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission {{is the major}} route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for {{a limited amount of}} time, which makes them potential indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. A growing body of research, though, has examined <b>environmentally</b> persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside a host.|$|E
5|$|Gallium has {{no known}} natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves {{in a similar}} manner to ferric salts in {{biological}} systems, and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals. Gallium is used in thermometers as a non-toxic and <b>environmentally</b> friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and <b>environmentally</b> friendly, but has {{historically}} been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|Green {{marketing}} {{products that}} are presumed to be <b>environmentally</b> safe. It incorporates {{a broad range of}} activities, including product modification, changes to the production process, , as well as modifying advertising. Yet defining green marketing is not a simple task where several meanings intersect and contradict each other; an example of this will be the existence of varying social, environmental and retail definitions attached to this term.Other similar terms used are environmental marketing and ecological marketing.|$|E
5|$|Hengistbury Head Local Nature Reserve is {{currently}} owned and managed by Bournemouth Borough Council. In 1990, {{the land was}} declared a Local Nature Reserve, as a commitment by the town of Bournemouth to conserve and enhance the environment. The heathland forms part of the Dorset Heaths and is internationally protected as a Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area. Nearby, {{the upper reaches of}} Christchurch Harbour (including the meadows at Wick) are recognised as an <b>Environmentally</b> Sensitive Area.|$|E
5|$|In {{medicine}} and chemistry, SRI developed dry-powder drugs, laser photocoagulation (a treatment for some eye maladies), remote surgery (also known as telerobotic surgery), bio-agent detection using upconverting phosphor technology, the experimental anticancer drugs Tirapazamine and TAS-108, ammonium dinitramide (an <b>environmentally</b> benign oxidizer for safe and cost-effective disposal of hazardous materials), the electroactive polymer ("artificial muscle"), new uses for diamagnetic levitation, and the antimalarial drug Halofantrine.|$|E
5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the <b>environmentally</b> important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be <b>environmentally</b> damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is used in}} {{high voltage}} power cables as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out. Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>environmentally</b> hazardous waste. Lead is one of three metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials, helping detect organic acids, aldehydes, and acidic gases.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{close to}} the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as <b>environmentally</b> beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E
5|$|Sustainable seafood is seafood {{from either}} fished or farmed sources that can {{maintain}} or increase {{production in the}} future without jeopardizing the ecosystems from which it was acquired. The sustainable seafood movement has gained momentum as more people become aware about both overfishing and <b>environmentally</b> destructive fishing methods.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Metro has won {{awards for}} <b>environmentally</b> {{friendly}} practices from organisations including the United Nations, RINA, and the International Organization for Standardization, becoming the second metro in the world, after the New York City Subway, to be ISO 14001 certified for <b>environmentally</b> friendly construction. Most of the Metro stations on the Blue Line conduct rainwater harvesting {{as an environmental}} protection measure. It is also the first railway project {{in the world to}} earn carbon credits after being registered with the United Nations under the Clean Development Mechanism, and has so far earned 400,000 carbon credits by saving energy through the use of regenerative braking systems on its trains. To reduce its dependence on non-renewable sources of energy, DMRC is looking forward to harness solar energy and install solar panels at the Karkardooma, Noida Sector-21, Anand Vihar and Pragati Maidan Metro stations and DMRC's residential complex at Pushp Vihar. As of March 2017, the DMRC has commissioned 20 MWp (megawatt peak) of solar power plants across 21 locations on the metro network. This is planned to increase to 31 MWp by March 2018, and 50 MWp by 2021.|$|E
5|$|The US {{state of}} Oregon uses {{magnesium}} chloride, a relatively cheap chemical similar in snow-melting effects to sodium chloride, but less reactive, while New Zealand uses calcium magnesium acetate, which avoids the <b>environmentally</b> harmful chloride ion altogether. Urea is sometimes used to grit suspension bridges, {{as it does}} not corrode iron or steel at all, but urea is less effective than salt, and can cost up to 7 times more weight-for-weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Wold Architects and built by Jorgenson Construction, Inc. The sloping glass walls in the front entrance were designed to emulate the many car dealerships along University Avenue. The school was built to be <b>environmentally</b> friendly, and the school district intends {{to apply for a}} Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Certification.|$|E
5|$|The {{organizers}} of Earth Day scored Minneapolis ninth best overall and second among mid-sized cities in their 2007 Urban Environment Report, a study based on indicators {{of environmental health}} and their effect on people. Minneapolis has also been cited {{as one of the}} most <b>environmentally</b> responsible cities in America.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in Nuuk, {{the modern}} <b>environmentally</b> {{friendly}} construction technologies {{have not yet}} arrived to Sisimiut, and in 2010 the existing communal-block district remained {{in a state of}} partial disrepair. The Qeqqata municipality however is planning the town expansion in the 2010s, with the area north of the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay reserved for real estate. The new neighborhood will bear the name Akia.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N2O as an anesthetic. Thus, {{it can be}} used with oxygen in concentrations that have a lower risk of hypoxia. Unlike nitrous oxide (N2O), xenon is not a greenhouse gas and is viewed as <b>environmentally</b> friendly. Though recycled in modern systems, xenon vented to the atmosphere is only returning to its original source, without environmental impact.|$|E
5|$|ZnO is a {{promising}} anode material for lithium-ion battery {{because it is}} cheap, biocompatible, and <b>environmentally</b> friendly. ZnO has a higher theoretical capacity (978 mAh g−1) than many other transition metal oxides such as CoO (715 mAh g−1), NiO (718 mAh g−1) and CuO (674 mAh g−1).|$|E
5|$|A benefit {{corporation}} {{is an alternative}} to its standard counterpart as it operates under the legal premise of 1) creating a positive impact socially and <b>environmentally</b> in its materials, 2) uphold corporate social responsibility in terms of considering its workers, its community, and the environment as well as challenge its current boundaries in those areas, and 3) report its activity as a company {{as well as its}} achievements in social and environmental areas publicly using a non-partisan third party source.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other <b>environmentally</b> valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E
5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most <b>environmentally</b> damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E
5|$|Argo Tea {{advocates for}} sustainability, {{demonstrates}} concern {{and awareness of}} environmental issues in their business plan and uses charitable donations to promote research as noted above. The company has an <b>environmentally</b> friendly business plan that includes encouraging use of reusable service-ware such as ceramic mugs and plates and washable silverware by its dine-in customers. Argo also markets reusable tea tumblers, which enable its customers to obtain discounted pricing on its drinks. The company considers sustainability and environmental consciousness in all phases of its business including supplier, operations, store design and product decisions.|$|E
5|$|Both B.s. var.collina and var.spinulosa are {{commonly}} seen in nurseries; {{given that the}} varieties can hybridise, attempting to find a local provenance form from a local community nursery, Bushcare or Australian Plants Society group is preferable <b>environmentally</b> if they are intended for planting in gardens near bushland where native populations occur. There are some dwarf forms available for the city gardener – 'Stumpy Gold' {{is a form of}} variety collina originally from the Central Coast, while 'Birthday Candles', 'Coastal Cushion' and 'Golden Cascade' are forms of variety spinulosa from the South Coast of New South Wales.|$|E
