30|$|In {{addition}} to the government services, the need of a mobile and portable trusted environment is realized in other application domains including enterprise applications. In recent times, a number of commercial products have emerged for enterprise applications. Encryptakey is a small portable (USB form <b>factor)</b> <b>device</b> that allows mobile users to create a seamless and secure environment in which one can perform digital transactions, surf the Web, conduct business and communicate securely and privately [10]. Encryptakey is a biometrically authenticated device which offers multiple-levels of authentication and comprises its own micro chip, memory, RFID capability and Bluetooth interface. Encryptakey, when plugged into a local computer, unloads the native operating system of the host machine and downloads its own operating system (OS) which it works with exclusively. In doing so Encryptakey is shielded from any form of malware (e.g. viruses, key-loggers, screen-scrapers) that may reside on the OS of the host machine. Encryptakey embodies the same principle of isolation for creating a trusted environment on a host machine similar to DORIS/DIVA. However, one significant difference is that Encryptakey must unload the native operating system to install its own OS. This feature {{does not meet the}} seamless mobility and portability requirements.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} {{the first study}} of an {{important}} realization of directional communication, beamforming, on mobile devices. We first demonstrate that beamforming is already feasible on mobile devices in terms of form <b>factor,</b> <b>device</b> mobility and power efficiency. Surprisingly, we show that by making an increasingly profitable tradeoff between transmit and circuit power, beamforming with state-of-the-art integrated CMOS implementations can be more power-efficient than its single antenna counterpart. We then investigate the optimal way of using beamforming in terms of device power efficiency, by allowing a dynamic number of active antennas. We propose a simple yet effective solution, BeamAdapt, which allows each mobile client in a network to individually identify the optimal number of active antennas with guaranteed convergence and close-to-optimal performance. We finally report a WARP-based prototype of BeamAdapt and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness in realistic environments, and then complement the prototype-based experiments with Qualnet-based simulation of a large-scale network. Our results show that BeamAdapt with four antennas can reduce the power consumption of mobile clients {{by more than half}} compared to a single antenna, while maintaining a required network throughput...|$|E
40|$|Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) {{have been}} proven to be ultrasensitive sensors {{for a variety of}} {{physical}} variables with unprecedented sensitivity, including force, mass, electrical charge, magnetic field, pressure, and heat. This thesis is intended to discuss using NEMS devices as chemical gas sensors, in a portable and compact total chemical analysis system. An integrated transduction method using piezoresistive metallic thin film is described, which enables both fabrication and operation of nanoscale NEMS resonator devices with resonance frequency up to very high frequency (VHF). The advantages over using traditional doped semiconductor film as piezoresistive material is discussed. Performance and noise properties of the devices are carefully characterized. The dependence between quality <b>factor,</b> <b>device</b> dimension, and pressure is studied, and very high quality factor is obtained with devices at nanoscale dimensions, indicating advantages over their microscale counterparts. Subsequently, the resonator devices are employed as a mass sensor, demonstrating attogram scale mass sensitivity in ambient conditions. Application of these devices as detectors in a gas chromatographic (GC) system is then described, together with method of coating them with functional polymeric film. Detection of multiple analytes of nerve gas simulants with ultrahigh speed, superior sensitivity, and excellent selectivity is achieved. The replacement of conventional bulky detectors with an NEMS detector makes fully integrated microscale gas analysis system possible, which has promising potential applications in health care, medical science, and environmental science...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse cervical range of motion, assessed over time by means of a digital inclinometer (EDI- 320) and a three-dimensional electromagnetic tracking device (Flock of Birds). The maximum active cervical range of motion was assessed with two measurement devices in three sessions over time, with 6 -week intervals. In total, 26 women and 24 men (mean age: 44. 4, SD: 9. 9) without known pathology of the cervical spine participated. Four movements were measured axial rotation with the cervical spine in a flexed and in an extended position, flexion-extension, and lateral bending. The results showed that the factor time was significant for rotation in extension and rotation in flexion. The <b>factor</b> <b>device</b> was significant for all movements measured, and the interaction term between time and device was significant for all movements except rotation in extension. The Flock of Birds measured significantly higher ranges of motion on all motions except for lateral bending. A substantial variation in cervical range of motion was observed over time (ranging from - 5. 6 to 8. 1) as well as between devices (ranging from - 13. 1 to 29. 9).

40|$|A step-stress {{accelerated}} degradation testing (SSADT) {{method was}} employed {{for the first}} time to evaluate the stability of CuInGaSe 2 (CIGS) solar cells and device component materials in four Al-framed test structures encapsulated with an edge sealant and three kinds of backsheet or moisture barrier film for moisture ingress control. The SSADT exposure used a 15 oC and then a 15 % relative humidity (RH) increment step, beginning from 40 oC/ 40 %RH (T/RH = 40 / 40) to 85 oC/ 70 %RH (85 / 70) as of the moment. The voluminous data acquired and processed as of total DH = 3956 h with 85 / 70 = 704 h produced the following results. The best CIGS solar cells in sample Set- 1 with a moisture-permeable TPT backsheet showed essentially identical I-V degradation trend regardless of the Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer thickness ranging from standard 0. 12 &# 956;m to 0. 50 &# 956;m on the cells. No clear 'stepwise' feature in the I-V parameter degradation curves corresponding to the SSADT T/RH/time profile was observed. Irregularity in I-V performance degradation pattern was observed with some cells showing early degradation at low T/RH < 55 / 55 and some showing large Voc, FF, and efficiency degradation due to increased series Rs (ohm-cm 2) at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. Results of (electrochemical) impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) analysis indicate degradation of the CIGS solar cells corresponded to increased series resistance Rs (ohm) and degraded parallel (minority carrier diffusion/recombination) resistance Rp, capacitance C, overall time constant Rp*C, and 'capacitor quality' factor (CPE-P), which were related to the cells? p-n junction properties. Heating at 85 / 70 appeared to benefit the CIGS solar cells as indicated by the largely recovered CPE-P <b>factor.</b> <b>Device</b> component materials, Mo on soda lime glass (Mo/SLG), bilayer ZnO (BZO), AlNi grid contact, and CdS/CIGS/Mo/SLG in test structures with TPT showed notable to significant degradation at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. At T/RH = 85 / 70, substantial blistering of BZO layers on CIGS cell pieces was observed that was not seen on BZO/glass, and a CdS/CIGS sample displayed a small darkening and then flaking feature. Additionally, standard AlNi grid contact was less stable than thin Ni grid contact at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. The edge sealant and moisture-blocking films were effective to block moisture ingress, as evidenced by the good stability of most CIGS solar cells and device components at T/RH = 85 / 70 for 704 h, and by preservation of the initial blue color on the RH indicator strips. The SSADT experiment is ongoing to be completed at T/RH = 85 / 85...|$|E

We report {{on the use of}} cathodoluminescence (CL) to identify individual TD positions within microdisk lasers containing either InGaN quantum wells or quantum dots.
