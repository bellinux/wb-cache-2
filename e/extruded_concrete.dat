40|$|AbstractThe {{article is}} devoted to the study of {{properties}} of light-weight <b>extruded</b> fine-grain cement <b>concrete</b> with hollow glass microspheres (HGMS). For improving the properties of light-weight concrete the authors suggested to use the extrusion technology. The compositions of light-weight <b>extruded</b> fine-grain <b>concrete</b> and their basic properties are shown. The deformation characteristics of light-weight fine-grain concrete with HGMS such as specific values of the energy of deformation and destruction of concrete as well as the elasticity modulus are shown. It has been proved that the extrusion reduces the water requirement of the concrete mixture with the microspheres, promotes compacting the concrete structure, significantly increases the concrete strength and crack resistance, reduces water vapor permeability and heat conductivity. The results of microstructure and X-ray diffraction analyzes of light-weight <b>extruded</b> fine-grain <b>concrete</b> are given. Based on this research work, a technology for production of light-weight <b>extruded</b> fine-grain cement <b>concrete</b> with HGMS was developed. The units produced by this technology were successfully applied in cottage construction...|$|R
50|$|Slabs in {{prestressed}} concrete are usually produced in lengths {{of up to}} 200 meters. The process involves <b>extruding</b> wet <b>concrete</b> along with the prestressed steel wire rope from a moving mold. The continuous slab is then cut by big diamond circular saw according to the lengths (and width) required on blueprint. Factory production provides the obvious advantages of reduced time, labor and training.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the hardened properties of a high-performance fibre-reinforced fine-aggregate <b>concrete</b> <b>extruded</b> through a 9 mm diameter nozzle to build layer-by-layer structural components in a printing pro- cess. The printing {{process is a}} digitally controlled additive method capable of manufacturing architectural and structural components without formwork, unlike conventional concrete construction methods. The effects of the layering process on density, compressive strength, flexural strength, tensile bond strength and drying shrinkage are presented together with the implication for mix proportions. A control concrete (mould-cast specimens) had a density of approximately 2250 kg/m 3, high strength (107 MPa in compression, 11 MPa in flexure) and 3 MPa in direct tension, together with a relatively low drying shrinkage of 175 μm (cured in water) and 855 μm (cured in a chamber at 20 °C and 60 % relative humidity) at 184 days. In contrast well printed concrete had a density of 2350 kg/m 3, compressive strength of 75 – 102 MPa, flexural strength of 6 – 17 MPa depending on testing direction, and tensile bond strength between layers varying from 2. 3 to 0. 7 MPa, reducing as the printing time gap between layers increased. The well printed concrete had signifi- cantly fewer voids greater than 0. 2 mm diameter (1. 0 %) {{when compared with the}} mould-cast control (3. 8 %), whilst samples of poorly printed material had more voids (4. 8 %) mainly formed in the interstices be- tween filaments. The additive extrusion process was thus shown to retain the intrinsic high performance of the material...|$|R
