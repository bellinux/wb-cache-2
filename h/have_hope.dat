25|$|Michael Douglas portrays Hank Pym in the Marvel Studios film Ant-Man. Dax Griffin {{stood in}} {{as a young}} version in a {{flashback}} sequence. In the film, Pym was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. until his wife Janet van Dyne shrunk to the Quantum Realm during one of their missions and discovered that the organization was trying to replicate his Pym Particle formula. After quitting, he builds his own company Pym Technologies, but is ousted as CEO by his former protege Darren Cross and his estranged daughter Hope van Dyne. Although they still {{kept an eye on}} Cross of any suspicious activity, Cross comes close to perfecting Pym's formula and plans to sell the Yellowjacket suit, Pym manipulated former thief Scott Lang into stealing the suit and eventually instructing Scott to be the new Ant-Man to stop Cross. He refused to <b>have</b> <b>Hope</b> in danger despite his daughter's superior experience, afraid that he'd lose Hope like Janet. After discovering that Ant-Man had returned from the Quantum Realm following his fight with Yellowjacket, Pym believed that Wasp is still alive there. In the mid-credits scene, Pym presents an updated Wasp costume to Hope, deciding to give it to his daughter.|$|E

He advanced important neighborhood issues at every opportunity. Milk used the same manic campaign tactics as in previous races: human billboards, hours of handshaking, and dozens of speeches calling on gay people to <b>have</b> <b>hope.</b> This time, even The San Francisco Chronicle endorsed him for supervisor. On election day, November 8, 1977, he won by 30% against sixteen other candidates, and after his victory became apparent, he arrived on Castro Street on the back of his campaign manager's motorcycle—escorted by Sheriff Richard Hongisto—to what a newspaper story described as a [...] "tumultuous and moving welcome".|$|E

2500|$|Other songs {{have more}} {{personal}} connections. [...] "I Prefer Your Love", the sixth track, is about Clark's mother, who was briefly ill.

The sentence from which the title is taken – [...] "He thinks of severed, crossed fingers found perfectly survived in the wreckage of a local plane crash last year", – is used by Clark to demonstrate the human heart's ability to <b>have</b> <b>hope,</b> even when none is present.

2500|$|In Estonia, {{environmental}} protests soon {{grew into}} a general revolt against Soviet rule: the [...] "Singing Revolution", which was led by Estonian intellectuals. Lennart Meri’s speech Do Estonians <b>Have</b> <b>Hope</b> focused on the existential problems {{of the nation and}} had strong repercussions abroad. In 1988, Meri became {{a founding member of the}} Estonian Popular Front, which cooperated with its counterparts in Latvia and Lithuania. After the first non-communist-style multi-party election in 1990, Meri was appointed to the post of Foreign Minister. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lennart Meri’s first task was to create the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He developed around him a group of well educated young people, many English speaking, in order to establish an open communication channel to the West, and at the same time to represent Estonia more widely on the international scene. He participated in the CSCE Conferences in Copenhagen, New York, Paris, Berlin and Moscow, and the foundation conference of the Council of the Baltic Sea Countries. He also had several meetings with American and European Heads of State and Foreign Ministers, and was the first Eastern European guest to give a presentation at NATO Headquarters in Brussels.|$|E

2500|$|The {{movie is}} based on Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone a chance to <b>have</b> <b>hope,</b> {{at a time when}} we all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge of what to do with the event since that is the thing everyone knows about, it was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|E
