40|$|Background Previously, we {{proposed}} a model for ordinal scale scoring in which individual thresholds for each item constitute a distribution by each item. This lead us to hypothesize that the boundary curves of each <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> score {{in the distribution of}} total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores follow a common mathematical model, which is expressed as the product of the frequency of the total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores and the probability of the cumulative distribution function of each item threshold. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the boundary curves of the distribution of total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores in a general population. Methods Data collected from 21, 040 subjects who had completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire as part of a national Japanese survey were analyzed. The CES-D consists of 20 items (16 negative items and four positive items). The boundary curves of adjacent item scores in the distribution of total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores for the 16 negative items were analyzed using log-normal scales and curve fitting. Results The boundary curves of adjacent item scores for a given symptom approximated a common linear pattern on a log normal scale. Curve fitting showed that an exponential fit had a markedly higher coefficient of determination than either linear or quadratic fits. With negative affect items, the gap between the total score curve and boundary curve continuously increased with increasing total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores on a log-normal scale, whereas the boundary curves of positive affect items, which are not considered manifest variables of the latent trait, did not exhibit such increases in this gap. Discussion The {{results of the present study}} support the hypothesis that the boundary curves of each <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> score in the distribution of total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores commonly follow the predicted mathematical model, which was verified to approximate an exponential mathematical pattern...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cross-sectional and {{retrospective}} {{studies have}} associated {{major depressive disorder}} with glial activation and injury as well as blood–brain barrier disruption, but these associations have not been assessed prospectively. Here, we aimed to determine the relationship between changes in <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and in blood levels of S- 100 calcium-binding protein B (S- 100 B), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin- 6 following an inflammatory challenge. Methods: Fifty unselected participants were recruited from a randomized, controlled trial comparing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures performed with versus without cardiopulmonary bypass for the risk of neurocognitive decline. <b>Depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity was measured at baseline, discharge, and six-month follow-up using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). The primary outcome of the present biomarker study was acute change in <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, defined as the intra-subject difference between baseline and discharge BDI-II scores.

Sample included 35 older (65 - 84) physical rehabilitation patients in a large metropolitan hospital. Statistical analysis included Pearson Product Moment correlations and multiple regression results. Perceived physical health, instrumental ADLs, life satisfaction, extraversion, and conscientiousness are inversely related to <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity; neuroticism is positively related to <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity.

40|$|ObjectivesThe primary aim was {{to examine}} the <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> {{structure}} of Mainland China adolescents using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). DesignExploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were simultaneously conducted to determine the structure of the CES-D in a large scale, representative adolescent samples recruited from Mainland China. Multigroup CFA (N= 5059, 48 % boys, mean= 16. 551. 06) was utilized to test the factorial invariance of the <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> structure, which was generated by EFA and confirmed by CFA across gender.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundEarly maladaptive schemas (EMSs) are {{hypothesized}} to be stable, trait-like, enduring beliefs underlying chronic and recurrent psychological disorders. We studied {{the relation of}} EMSs with <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and tested the stability of EMSs over a course of evidence-based outpatient treatment for depression in a naturalistic treatment setting. MethodsThe sample consisted of depressed outpatients (N= 132) treated at a specialized mood disorders treatment unit in The Netherlands. Participants completed measures of <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and maladaptive schemas before treatment and 16 -weeks after starting with treatment. ResultsSpecific maladaptive schemas (failure, emotional deprivation, abandonment/instability) were cross-sectionally related to <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity. Moreover, the schema domain impaired autonomy & performance at pre-treatment related positively to depression levels at the 16 -week follow-up assessment, whereas the schema domain overvigilance & inhibition at pre-treatment related negatively to depression levels at the follow-up assessment when controlling for pre-treatment depression severity. Finally, all EMSs demonstrated good relative stability {{over the course of}} treatment. ConclusionsOur results suggest that specific EMSs are related to <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity in clinically depressed patients, that specific schema domains predict treatment outcome, and that schemas are robust to change over time, even after evidence-based outpatient treatment for depression...|$|R

40|$|Patient {{reported}} outcomes (PROs) {{of quality}} of life (QoL), functioning, and <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity are important in assessing the burden of illness of major depressive disorder (MDD) and to evaluate the impact of treatment. We sought to provide {{a detailed analysis of}} PROs before and after treatment of MDD from the large Sequenced Treat-ment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. This analysis examines PROs before and after treatment in the second level of STAR*D. The complete data on QoL, functioning, and <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, were analyzed for each STAR*D level 2 treatment. PROs of QoL, functioning, and <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity showed substantial impairments after failing a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor trial using citalopram (level 1). The seven therapeu-tic options in level 2 had positive statistically (P values) and clinically (Cohen’s standardized differences [Cohen’s d]) significant impact on QoL, functioning, <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, and reduction in calculated burden of illness. There were no statistically significant differences between the interventions. However, a substantial proportion of pa-tients still suffered from patient-reported QoL and functioning impairment after treatment, an effect that was more pronounced in nonremitters.

40|$|Background: Given {{the growth}} in the number of older Chinese {{immigrants}} in the United States and the importance of family support in Chinese culture, this study examines how supportive and negative relationships with family members (children and spouse) influence <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity among this population. Methods: Using data from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago, we carried out multivariate negative binomial regression analysis using a sample of 3, 159 Chinese older immigrants. <b>Depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Intergenerational and marital relationships were characterized using self-reported measures of two supportive features (confiding and aiding) and two negative features (demanding and criticizing). Results: Confiding and aiding relationships with children (incident rate ratio [IRR] =. 70, confidence interval [CI]: 0. 57, 0. 85; IRR =. 70, CI: 0. 56, 0. 88, respectively) and spouses (IRR =. 61, CI: 0. 47, 0. 79; IRR =. 66, CI: 0. 52, 0. 83, respectively) were significantly associated with lower <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity among the older Chinese immigrants sampled. Demanding (IRR = 1. 39, CI: 1. 16, 1. 68) and criticizing (IRR = 1. 37, CI: 1. 17, 1. 60) intergenerational relationships significantly predicted higher <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, and spousal criticism (IRR = 1. 41, CI: 1. 24, 1. 59) was related to higher <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity. Aiding relationships with children appears to be more important for older women than men (IRR =. 69, CI: 0. 47, 1. 01). Conclusions: The findings reveal the importance of both positive and negative interactions with spouses and children in shaping mental well-being among older Chinese immigrants. Future geriatric practice and research should consider both supportive and negative features in examining and addressing interpersonal relationships and mental health.

We examined the association of community collective efficacy with <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity in Florida public health workers (n = 2249) exposed to the 2004 hurricane season using a multilevel approach. Cross-sectional anonymous questionnaires were distributed electronically to all Florida Department of Health (FDOH) personnel that assessed <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity and collective efficacy nine months after the 2004 hurricane season. Analyses were conducted at the individual level and community level using zip codes. The majority of participants were female (81. 9 %), and ages ranged from 20 to 78 years (median = 49 years). The majority of participants (73. 4 %) were European American, 12. 7 % were African American, and 9. 2 % were Hispanic.

GPS features were calculated over the entire study, for weekdays and weekends, and in 2 -week blocks. Results The results of this study replicated our previous findings that a number of GPS features, including location variance, entropy, and circadian movement, were significantly correlated with PHQ- 9 scores (r’s ranging from − 0. 43 to − 0. 46, p-values <. 05). We also found that these relationships were stronger when GPS features were calculated from weekend, compared to weekday, data. Although the correlation between baseline PHQ- 9 scores with 2 -week GPS features diminished as we moved further from baseline, correlations with the end-of-study scores remained significant regardless of the time point used to calculate the features. Discussion Our findings were consistent with past research demonstrating that GPS features may be an important and reliable predictor of <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity. The varying strength of these relationships on weekends and weekdays suggests the role of weekend/weekday as a moderating variable. The finding that GPS features predict <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> severity up to 10 weeks prior to assessment suggests that GPS features may have the potential as early warning signals of depression...|$|R
