5|$|Injuries to the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> occur fairly frequently, and {{can leave}} minor to major deformity. Injuries include: laceration, {{avulsion}} injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic {{damage to the}} ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary Transmission of Fistulae Auris. This journal article, {{published}} in Der Erbarzt (The Genetic Physician), focuses on fistula auris (an abnormal fissure on the <b>external</b> <b>ear)</b> as a hereditary trait. Mengele noted {{that individuals who}} have this trait also {{tend to have a}} dimple on their chin.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
50|$|Pinnae (<b>external</b> <b>ears)</b> {{are also}} a {{distinctive}} trait that is a therian exclusivity.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>External</b> <b>ears,</b> one of {{the major}} face components, show an {{interesting}} movement during craniofacial morphogenesis in human embryo. The present study was performed to see if movement of the <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> in a human embryo could be explained by differential growth. Methods: In all, 171 samples between Carnegie stage (CS) 17 and CS 23 were selected from MR image datasets of human embryos obtained from the Kyoto Collection of Human Embryos. The three-dimensional absolute positio...|$|R
50|$|Various {{clinical}} features {{have been associated}} with this disease including trigonocephaly, flattened occiput, prominent forehead, broad flat nasal bridge, anteverted nares, malformed <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> hypertelorism, and hypertonia.|$|R
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract into the body.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> is a {{thickened}} rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
50|$|Spalacids are mouse- to rat-sized rodents, {{adapted to}} {{burrowing}} and living underground. They have short limbs, wedge-shaped skulls, strong neck muscles, large incisor teeth, and small eyes and <b>external</b> <b>ears.</b> In the zokors, which dig primarily with their feet, {{rather than their}} teeth, the front claws are also massively enlarged. These features are least extreme in the bamboo rats, which spend {{at least some of}} their time above ground, foraging for food. They are most highly developed in the blind mole-rats, whose eyes are completely covered by skin, and entirely lack <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> or tails.|$|R
50|$|The <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> of felids {{are also}} large, and {{especially}} sensitive to high-frequency {{sounds in the}} smaller cats. This sensitivity allows them to locate small rodent prey; cats do not apparently produce such sounds.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} spalacids, which {{primarily}} use their incisors, zokors use their powerful front claws for digging. They have small eyes and no <b>external</b> <b>ears.</b> Zokors feed on plant matter such as tubers and seeds.|$|R
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and <b>external</b> <b>ear.</b> Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no <b>external</b> <b>ear,</b> but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (<b>external</b> <b>ear)</b> is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E
50|$|The head is rounded and {{slightly}} compressed dorso-ventrally. The snout is slightly protruding. Two pairs of cephalic shields are present. The nostrils open forward. <b>External</b> <b>ears</b> are absent. The skull is elongate {{compared to other}} Trogonophidae.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} 57 -year-old {{man who had}} low-grade fever and painful, swollen and {{erythematous}} ears. Gallium- 67 citrate scintigraphy (gallium scan) performed prior to the commencement of treatment showed increased gallium uptake in bilateral <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> neck, mediastinum and bilateral pulmonary hili. The results of ultrasonography of both ears were compatible with the diagnosis of chondritis. The patient's clinical condition and laboratory data improved after a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids. Gallium scan performed after treatment showed a diminished uptake in the <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> neck, and mediastinum. Gallium scintigraphy is a valuable tool for evaluating inflammatory activity and monitoring therapeutic response in patients with relapsing polychondritis...|$|R
50|$|They {{are usually}} black or pied, {{occasionally}} individuals will be gray or tan. Rams are horned and ewes are polled (hornless). Individuals often lack <b>external</b> <b>ears.</b> The rams are selected for size, horn size, and for fighting ability.|$|R
25|$|One {{disease that}} may be {{difficult}} to exclude in the differential diagnosis is involvement of the facial nerve in infections with the herpes zoster virus. The major differences in this condition are the presence of small blisters, or vesicles, on the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> and hearing disturbances, but these findings may occasionally be lacking (zoster sine herpete). Reactivation of existing herpes zoster infection leading to facial paralysis in a Bell's palsy type pattern is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.|$|E
25|$|The avian ear {{is adapted}} {{to pick up on}} slight and rapid changes of pitch found in bird song. General avian tympanic {{membrane}} form is ovular and slightly conical. Morphological differences in the middle ear are observed between species. Ossicles within green finches, blackbirds, song thrushes, and house sparrows are proportionately shorter to those found in pheasants, Mallard ducks, and sea birds. In song birds, a syrinx allows the respective possessors to create intricate melodies and tones. The middle avian ear is made up of three semicircular canals, each ending in an ampulla and joining to connect with the macula sacculus and lagena, of which the cochlea, a straight short tube to the <b>external</b> <b>ear,</b> branches from.|$|E
25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} {{tend to have}} good vision, well adapted to a life at sea. The turtles can see many colors, but are most {{sensitive}} to light from violet to yellow or wavelengths of 400 to 600 nanometers. They do not see many colors in the orange to red portion of the light spectrum. On land, however, the sea turtles are nearsighted because the lenses in the eyes are spherical and adjusted to refraction underwater. Sea turtles have no <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> and only one ear bone, called the columella. With one ear bone, the turtles can only hear low frequency sounds, from 200 to 700Hz. Sounds can also be detected through vibrations of the head, backbone, and shell. The nose of the turtle has two external openings and connects {{to the roof of}} the mouth through internal openings. The lower surface of the nasal passage has two sets of sensory cells called the Jacobson’s organ. The turtle can use this organ to smell by pumping water in and out of its nose.|$|E
5000|$|These toads have webbed toes {{on their}} hind legs, but lack {{expanded}} toe tips. [...] They lack <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> but do possess normal anuran inner ear features, {{with the exception}} of tympanic membranes and air-filled middle ear cavities.|$|R
25|$|Earmuffs cover a person's ears for thermal protection. Earmuffs {{consist of}} a {{thermoplastic}} or metal head-band, that fits {{over the top of}} the head, and a pad at each end, to cover the <b>external</b> <b>ears.</b> Earmuffs were invented by Chester Greenwood in 1873.|$|R
50|$|Abnormalities of the <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> (unusually {{large or}} small, unusually shaped, {{sometimes}} with {{sensorineural hearing loss}} or deafness due to lesions or dysfunctions of part of the internal ear or its nerve tracts and centers or conductive hearing loss from the <b>external</b> or middle <b>ear),</b> dysplastic ears, lop ear (over-folded ear helix), preauricular tags or pits (a rudimentary tag of ear tissue typically located {{just in front of}} the ear).|$|R
25|$|The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular {{branches}} {{leave the}} skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory {{information from the}} scalp and forehead, the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including {{the tip of the}} nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches—the lingual nerve—carries sensation from the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Superficially, they {{resemble}} the anteaters of South America and other spiny mammals such as hedgehogs and porcupines. They are usually black or brown in colour. There {{have been several}} reports of albino echidnas, their eyes pink and their spines white. They have elongated and slender snouts that function as both mouth and nose. Like the platypus, they are equipped with electrosensors, but while the platypus has 40,000 electroreceptors on its bill, the long-beaked echidna has only 2,000 electroreceptors, and the short-beaked echidna, which lives in a drier environment, has no more than 400 located {{at the tip of}} its snout. They have very short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. Echidnas have tiny mouths and toothless jaws. The echidna feeds by tearing open soft logs, anthills and the like, and using its long, sticky tongue, which protrudes from its snout, to collect prey. The echidnas' ears are slits on the sides of their heads that are usually unseen {{due to the fact that}} they are blanketed by their spines. The <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> is created by a large cartilaginous funnel, deep in the muscle.|$|E
500|$|Porpoises have a bulbous head, no <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> flaps, a non-flexible neck, a torpedo shaped body, limbs {{modified}} into flippers, and a tail fin. Their skull has small eye orbits, small, blunt snouts, {{and eyes}} {{placed on the}} sides of the head. Porpoises range in size from the [...] and [...] Vaquita to the [...] and [...] Dall's porpoise. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other cetaceans. Almost all species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males, although those physical differences are generally small; one exception is Dall's porpoise.|$|E
50|$|Primrose {{syndrome}} is a rare, slowly progressive genetic disorder that can vary symptomatically between individual cases, but is generally characterised by ossification of the <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> learning difficulties, and facial abnormalities. It was first described in 1982 in Scotland's Royal National Larbert Institution by Dr D.A.A. Primrose.|$|R
50|$|Red ear {{syndrome}} (RES) {{is a rare}} {{disorder of}} unknown etiology which was originally described in 1994. The defining symptom of red ear syndrome is redness of one or both <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> accompanied by a burning sensation. A variety of treatments have been tried with limited success.|$|R
50|$|The Creo are gray-skinned, {{with heavy}} muscles and thick brows, and no <b>external</b> <b>ears.</b> Males are {{completely}} hairless, females sport a white topknot {{that is often}} dyed. They appear to be well-suited for mining, and make their homes in extensive cave networks hollowed out of moons or asteroids.|$|R
500|$|The only {{predator}} {{known to}} target this species is the fossa, although the golden-crowned sifaka {{reacts to the}} presence of birds of prey with alarm calls. [...] A hematology and serum chemistry study published in 1995 revealed that 59% of the wild golden-crowned sifakas sampled were infected with a microfilarial parasite, a potentially unknown species of nematode in the genus Mansonella. [...] Healthy, infected individuals {{did not appear to be}} adversely affected by the infestation, but the overall effect on the dwindling population is unknown. [...] Also, no malarial or intestinal parasites were found, although 48% of the golden-crowned sifakas examined had <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> mites.|$|E
500|$|Phocids {{are known}} as true or [...] "earless" [...] seals. These animals lack <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> flaps and are {{incapable}} of turning their hind-flippers forward, which makes them more cumbersome on land. In water, true seals swim by moving their hind-flippers and lower body from side to side. Phocids have thickened mastoids, enlarged entotympanic bones, everted pelvic bones and massive ankle bones. They also lack supraorbital processes on the frontal and have underdeveloped calcaneal tubers. A 2006 molecular study supports the division of phocids into two monophyletic subfamilies: Monachinae, which consists of Mirounga, Monachini and Lobodontini; and Phocinae, which includes Pusa, Phoca, Halichoerus, Histriophoca, Pagophilus, Erignathus and Cystophora.|$|E
500|$|The California {{sea lion}} was {{described}} by René Primevère Lesson, a French naturalist, in 1828. It is grouped with other sea lions and fur seals in the family Otariidae. Otariids, also known as eared seals, differ from true seals in having <b>external</b> <b>ear</b> flaps, and proportionately larger foreflippers and pectoral muscles. Along with the Galapagos sea lion and the extinct Japanese sea lion, the California sea lion belongs to the genus Zalophus, which derives from the Greek words za, meaning [...] "intensive," [...] and lophus, meaning [...] "crest." [...] This refers to the protruding sagittal crest of the males, which distinguishes members of the genus.|$|E
50|$|Family Otariidae (eared seals, sea lions, fur seals) is {{distributed}} throughout the world's oceans {{with the exception of}} the North Atlantic. The 15 species (divided into seven genera) of otariids are distinguished from phocids by visible <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> (pinnae), more dog-like faces, and the ability to turn their rear flippers forward.|$|R
50|$|Pierced {{ears are}} earlobes or the {{cartilage}} {{portion of the}} <b>external</b> <b>ears</b> which have had one or more holes created in them for the wearing of earrings. The holes may be permanent or temporary. The holes become permanent when a fistula is created by scar tissue forming around the initial earring.|$|R
50|$|In moose, antlers may act {{as large}} hearing aids. Equipped with large, highly {{adjustable}} <b>external</b> <b>ears,</b> moose have highly sensitive hearing. Moose with antlers have more sensitive hearing than moose without, and {{a study of}} trophy antlers with an artificial ear confirmed that the large flattened (palmate) antler behaves like a parabolic reflector.|$|R
