5000|$|Various {{baseball}} analysts, including Bill James, Pete Palmer, Dick Cramer, and the Baseball Prospectus editors, {{have found}} so-called [...] "clutch hitting" [...] {{ability to be}} a myth. This {{is not to say}} that clutch hits, like those listed above, do not exist, but rather that some kind of innate ability for a player to perform above his true talent level in high-pressure situations is nothing but an illusion. In his 1984 Baseball Abstract, James framed the problem with clutch hitting this way: [...] "How is it that a player who possesses the reflexes and the batting stroke and the knowledge and the experience to be a [...]262 hitter in other circumstances magically becomes a [...]300 hitter when the game is on the line? How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen?</b> What is the process? What are the effects? Until we can answer those questions, I see little point in talking about clutch ability." ...|$|E

40|$|When {{looking at}} the history of technology, we can see that all inventions are not of equal importance. Only a few {{technologies}} have the potential to start a new branching series (specifically, by increasing diversity), have a lasting impact in human life and ultimately became turning points. Technological transitions correspond to times and places in the past when a large number of novel artefact forms or behaviours appeared together or in rapid succession. Why <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen?</b> Is technological change continuous and gradual or does it occur in sudden leaps and bounds? The evolution of information technology (IT) allows for a quantitative and theoretical approach to technological transitions. The value of information systems experiences sudden changes (i) when we learn how to use this technology, (ii) when we accumulate a large amount of information, and (iii) when communities of practice create and exchange free information. The coexistence between gradual improvements and discontinuous technological change is a consequence of the asymmetric relationship between complexity and hardware and software. Using a cultural evolution approach, we suggest that sudden changes in the organization of ITs depend on the high costs of maintaining and transmitting reliable information. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This brief piece {{responds}} to Carlos M. Vázquez 2 ̆ 6 Stephen I. Vladeck, State Law, the Westfall Act, and the Nature of the Bivens Question, 161 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 509 (2013). Vázquez and Vladeck 2 ̆ 7 s provocative article suggests that courts dismiss Bivens claims because judges believe that “extending” Bivens into any “new context” instantiates disfavored judicial lawmaking. Focusing on Bivens’s peculiar place in federalism and federal law, Vázquez and Vladeck {{demonstrate that the}} logic of courts’ own legal interpretations suggests expanding Bivens remedies, yet courts paradoxically choose to narrow them instead. Why, and how, <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen?</b> Courts claim to reject Bivens actions out of passive virtue and institutional competence concerns. Vázquez and Vladeck focus on the former. But neither justification fully explains the situation. Examining how courts justify their Bivens dismissals — through a results-oriented conflation of doctrines — reveals that the outcome drives the reasoning. That outcome is to insulate the Executive from those individuals it harms. Evaluating the relevant prudential concerns behind the goal of executive insulation — and their relation to institutional realities — may {{tell us more about}} Bivens than the Westfall Act can...|$|E
40|$|Motivation {{is the key}} to learning. The {{present study}} is about the {{relationship}} between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as they affect learning with regard to students who are learning EFL for the first time. Cape Verdean seventh grade students learning English for the first time are generally very enthusiastic about the language before they start learning it in the high school. However, that enthusiasm seems not to be maintained throughout the school year and oftentimes teachers hear them complain about the difficulties of mastering aspects of the language. It seems that for some reason their motivation is undermined. Why <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen?</b> Is it the students’ fault or the teacher’s? If it the teacher’s fault, which motivation strategies work best to cope with this problem: intrinsic or extrinsic? With this in mind I asked the question: What is the relationship between students’ needs, interests, goals and expectations to learn English as a foreign language and teachers’ roles as facilitators and motivators? There are many studies that have been carried out in the field of motivation, and up to now, {{there seems to be no}} consensus of which is the best. For the purposes of this paper, three main theories will be discussed that have prevailed in the field of motivational psychology: the behavioural, the cognitive and the humanistic theories. Within these theories sub-theories are discussed and their relationship is explained with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation regarding Cape Verdean students learning English for the first time...|$|E
