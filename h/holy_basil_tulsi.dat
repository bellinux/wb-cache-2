50|$|India is {{the second}} largest {{producer}} of tea in the world after China, including the famous Assam tea and Darjeeling tea. According to the Planning Commission Deputy Chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, there are plans to officially recognise tea as the “National Drink” in 2013. Tea is also the 'State Drink' of Assam.According to the ASSOCHAM report released in December, 2011, India, as the world’s largest consumer of tea uses nearly 30 percent of the global output. Despite the consumption, India is also the largest exporter of tea after China. The practice of Ayurveda {{has resulted in a}} long-standing tradition of herbal teas. Traditional Indian kitchens have long utilised the medicinal benefits offered by various plants and spices such as <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> (<b>Tulsi),</b> cardamom (Elaichi), pepper (Kali Mirch), liquorice (Mulethi), mint (Pudina), etc., and traditionally, teas made with these plant leaves or spices have been in use for centuries for maladies ranging from the serious to the trifling. Tea is also mixed with these traditional herbs. The taste of chai (sweet and milky) helps disguise the stronger and more bitter flavours of some of the medicinal additives, while other, more pleasant flavours such as cardamom and ginger add a pleasing flavour and aroma to the tea along with health benefits.|$|E

50|$|Most culinary and {{ornamental}} basils are cultivars of Ocimum basilicum {{and there}} are many hybrids between species. Thai basil (O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora) is a common ingredient in Thai cuisine, with a strong flavour similar to aniseed, used to flavour Thai curries and stir-fries. Amazonian basil (O. campechianum) is a South American variety often utilized in ayahuasca rituals for its smell which is said to help avoid bad visions. <b>Holy</b> <b>Basil</b> or <b>Tulsi</b> (O. tenuiflorum) is a sacred herb in India, used in teas, healing remedies, and cosmetics. The plant is worshipped as dear to Vishnu in some sects of Vaishnavism. It is also used in Thai cooking. Lemon Basil (Ocimum × citriodorum) is a hybrid between O. americanum and O. basilicum. It is noted for its lemon flavour and used in cooking. O. centraliafricanum is valued as an indicator species for the presence of copper deposits.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Various {{antibacterial}} and antiplaque {{agents are}} used in chemical plaque control but none are without their shortcomings. Chlorhexidine considered a gold standard, also has an array of side effects. To overcome these, numerous herbal extracts have been tried and tested and one among them is <b>holy</b> <b>basil.</b> The present study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> in vitro against some periodontopathogens and its antiplaque ef fect in vivo. Study Design: Thirty periodontally healthy volunteers were randomly divided into three groups and refrained from all mechanical oral hygiene measures for 4 days and used one of the randomly assigned mouthwash (1 - chlor - hexidine; 2 - holy basil; and 3 - sterile water [placebo]) twice daily. The Plaque Index (PI) was assessed at days 0 and 5. Aqueous extract of <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> was tested against Prevotella intermedia (P. intermedia) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Results: <b>Holy</b> <b>basil</b> extract showed inhibition of both the tested periodontopathogens (P. intermedia and F. nucleatum) at various concentrations. In all groups, the PI increased from baseline to day 5. There was {{a statistically significant difference}} (p <. 05) between the chlorhexidine and placebo rinse and the <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> and placebo rinse, but no statis - tically significant difference was found between the chlorhexidine and <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> rinse with respect to PI. Conclusions: These results indicate that the <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> mouthwash has an antiplaque effect and is efficacious against P. intermedia and F. nucleatum strains in vitro. Hence <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> mouthwash may have potential as an antiplaque mouthwash with prophylactic benefits...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{varieties}} of Ocimum basilicum, {{as well as}} several related species or species hybrids also called basil. The type used in Italian food is typically called sweet basil (or Genovese basil), as opposed to Thai basil (O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora), lemon basil (O. × citriodorum), and <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> (Ocimum tenuiflorum), which are used in Asia.

50|$|Three {{types of}} basil are {{commonly}} used in Thai cuisine. First, Thai basil, or horapha (โหระพา), is widely used throughout Southeast Asia and plays {{a prominent role in}} Vietnamese cuisine. It is also the cultivar most often used for Asian cooking in Western kitchens. Second, <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> (O. tenuiflorum), or kaphrao (กะเพรา), which has a spicy, peppery, clove-like taste, may be the basil Thai people love most. <b>Holy</b> <b>basil</b> is also known as Thai <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> or by its Indian name, tulasi or tulsi; it is widely used in India for culinary, medicinal, and religious purposes. Finally, lemon basil (O. × citriodorum), or maenglak (แมงลัก), as its name implies, has undertones of lemon in both scent and taste. Lemon basil is the least commonly used type of basil in Thailand. It is also known as Thai lemon basil, in contradistinction to Mrs. Burns lemon basil, another cultivar of basil.|$|R

Additionally, their total phenolic contents were analyzed by Folin-Ciocalteau micro method. The result showed that red <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> and red bird chili seemed to be better sources of antioxidant compounds, followed by green bird chili and red chili spur pepper, white <b>holy</b> <b>basil,</b> green chili spur pepper, garlic and pumpkin, respectively.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{capacity of}} white and red <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> leaves (Ocimum sanctum Linn., white and red varieties) from fresh markets in Chiang Mai was estimated by three different methods; ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, improved ABTS radical cation decolorization assay, and DPPH free radical scavenging activity; together with their total phenolic contents. Water and 95 % ethanol ratios of extraction solvents were also studied, and {{it was found that}} 57 and 76 % ethanol solvents were more suitable in this study. All three antioxidant capacity assays showed that red <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> was higher in antioxidant capacity than white <b>holy</b> <b>basil</b> (p< 0. 05). ABTS values were higher than FRAP and DPPH values, respectively, because of their different mechanisms, but their significant correlation (p< 0. 01) expressed their similar trends.
