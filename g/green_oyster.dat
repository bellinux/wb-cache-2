40|$|International audienceMarennine, {{the blue}} pigment {{produced}} by the diatom Haslea ostrearia, exists in two different forms, the intra- and extracellular forms. We investigated the antibacterial, antiviral, and antiproliferative properties of both of these forms. Both forms of marennine inhibited the development of marine bacteria, in particular the pathogenic organism Vibrio aesturianus, at concentrations as low as 1 μg/mL, {{but they did not}} display any effect {{on a wide range of}} pathogenic bacteria that are relevant for food safety. Both forms of the pigment produced by H. ostrearia also exhibited antiviral activity against the HSV 1 herpes virus, with intra- and extracellular marennine having EC(50) values of 24. 0 and 27. 0 μg/mL, respectively. These values are 2 orders of magnitude higher than the value for the reference drug, Zovirax. Moreover, both forms of marennine were effective in slowing or inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. This study confirms the potential of marennine as a biologically active organic molecule, which could have a protective effect on bivalves, which filter seawater and fix the pigment on their gills. Moreover, marennine could be used in food engineering and chemistry as a natural blue pigment.

Here, we report on a metal-contaminated estuary in Fujian Province, China, in which blue oysters (Crassostrea hongkongensis) and <b>green</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea angulata) were discovered to be contaminated with Cu and other metals. Extraordinarily high metal concentrations {{were found in the}} oysters collected from the estuary. Comparison with historical data suggests that the estuary has recently been contaminated with Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn. Metal concentrations in blue oysters were as high as 1. 4 and 2. 4 % of whole-body tissue dry wt for Cu and Zn, respectively. Cellular debris was the main subcellular fraction binding the metals, but metal-rich granules were important for Cr, Ni, and Pb. With increasing Cu accumulation, its partitioning into the cytosolic proteins decreased. In contrast, metallothionein-like proteins increased their importance in binding with Zn as tissue concentrations of Zn increased. In the most severely contaminated oysters, only a negligible fraction of their Cu and Zn was bound with the metal-sensitive fraction, which may explain the survival of oysters in such contaminated environments.

Incomplete {{knowledge of the}} ecological features of this marine diatom complicates its cultivation. More specifically, the ecology of bacteria surrounding H. ostrearia in ponds is what remains unknown. The structure of this bacterial community was previously analyzed by means of PCR-TTGE before and after isolating H. ostrearia cells recovered from 4 localities in order to distinguish the relative parts of the biotope and biocenose and to describe the temporal dynamics of the bacterial community structure at two time scales (2 weeks vs. 9 months). The bacterial structure of the phycosphere differed strongly from that of bulk sediment. The level of similarity between bacteria recovered from the biofilm and suspended bacteria did not exceed 10 %. On the other hand, similarities among the bacterial community structures in biofilms were above 90 % regardless of the geographic origin of the algal isolates, while the percentages were lower for suspended bacteria. The differences in bacterial structures of two H. ostrearia isolates (HO-R and HO-BM) resulted in specific metabolomic profiles. The nontargeted metabolomic investigation revealed more distinct profiles {{in the case of}} this bacteria-alga association than for the H. ostrearia monoculture. At the culture cycle scale under laboratory conditions, the bacterial community depended on the growth stage. When H. ostrearia was subcultured for 9 months, a shift in the bacterial structure was observed as of 3 months, with the bacterial structure stabilizing afterwards (70 %– 86 % similarities), in spite of the size reduction of the H. ostrearia frustule. Based on these results, an initial insight into the relationships between H. ostrearia and its surrounding bacteria could be drawn, leading {{to a better understanding of}} the ecological feature of this marine diatom...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAmong microalgae, {{the marine}} diatom Haslea ostrearia has the {{distinctive}} feature of synthesizing and releasing, {{into the surrounding}} environment, a blue-green polyphenolic pigment called marennine. The oyster-breeding industry commonly makes use of this natural phenomenon for the <b>greening</b> of <b>oysters</b> grown in the ponds of the French Atlantic coast. This article reports the in vitro antioxidant properties of pure marennine. Two kinds of evaluation systems were adopted to test the antioxidative activity of marennine: antioxidant capacity assays (β-carotene and thymidine protection assays and iron reducing power assay) and free radical scavenging assays (DPPH·, O 2 ·-, and HO·). In almost all cases, marennine exhibited significantly higher antioxidative and free radical scavenging activities than natural and synthetic antioxidants commonly used in food, as shown by comparing median effective concn. (EC 50) values, for each test independently. This medium mol. wt. polyphenol (around 10 kDa) from microalgae is thus a potentially useful natural antioxidant.

The marine pennate diatom Haslea ostrearia {{has long been}} known for producing, in addition to these generic pigments, a water-soluble blue pigment, marennine. This pigment, responsible for the <b>greening</b> of <b>oysters</b> in western France, presents different biological activities: allelopathic, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, and growth-inhibiting. A method to extract and purify marennine has been developed, but its chemical structure could hitherto not be resolved. For decades, H. ostrearia was the only organism known to produce marennine, and can be found worldwide. Our knowledge about H. ostrearia-like diatom biodiversity has recently been extended with the discovery of several new species of blue diatoms, the recently described H. karadagensis, H. silbo sp. inedit. and H. provincialis sp. inedit.

The production of these microbiotas was determined in the summer period. The structure of plankton communities revealed the following observations: (1) microphytoplanktonic cells were mostly diatoms and dinoflagellates, (2) microzooplank-tonic cells were mainly ciliates, and (3) nanoplanktonic cells were represented by pigmented (80 – 90 % of the nanoplankton biomass) and colorless nanoflagellates. Diatoms were dominated by Naviculiineae. Dinoflagellates were dominated by Peridiniales. Oligotrichida were predominant in the ciliate community. Protist biomass levels were nine times higher from April to August (summer period 1033 mg C L _ 1) than from September to March (winter period 114 mg C L _ 1). Whatever the season, nanoflagellates were dominant in the water column (66 and 53 % of the entire protist biomass in the summer and winter periods, respectively). Nanoflagellates represented the highest production of nano–microplanktonic communities (76 % of carbon protist production) in the coastal pond in summer and showed the shortest generation time (7. 1 h). Dinoflagellates came after nanoflagellates in production (19. 5 % of carbon protist production). Diatoms represented only a supplementary carbon resource available for higher trophic levels, whereas, until now, they were considered as the principal food of oysters in coastal ponds. Ciliates were a small source of carbon, but their growth rate was high. We suggest, first, that nanoflagellates represented the primary resource available in the pond and could constitute an important food resource for higher trophic levels, such as oysters, farmed in this type of pond. Overall, the system appeared to be more autotrophic than hetero-trophic. Because inorganic nutrients are quickly exhausted in a semiclosed pond, pigmented flagellates dominated the carbon biomass, production and biomass of bacteria were high (thus, the microbial food web appeared to be active in this pond), and mixotrophy seemed to be an important trophic mode there...|$|R

The oysters were depurated under laboratory conditions for 4 mo; the accumulated concentrations and the subcellular distribution of metals were measured at different time intervals. Results showed that the <b>green</b> color of <b>oysters</b> faded to light yellow (nearly normal) after 4 mo of depuration. Depuration of metals could be described by a first-order kinetic process. The calculated overall depuration rate constants of metals were in the range of 0. 008 d- 1 to 0. 024 d- 1, with a biological retention half-life of 30 d to 70 d. The depuration rates of green-colored contaminated oysters were significantly higher for Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni than the rates of oysters from a less contaminated site, whereas the depuration rates of Ag, Co, Pb, and Zn were comparable between the 2 populations. When corrected for the change of oyster tissue weight, the actual efflux rate constants of the metals (0. 0708 - 0. 1014 d- 1) were much higher than the overall depuration rate constants. Cellular debris and metallothionein-like proteins were the important fractions binding with the metals in the oysters. Significant changes in metal subcellular distribution were observed during the 4 -mo depuration for Ag, Cd, Cu, and Zn. Metallothionein-like protein became more important in sequestering the metals during the depuration period, with a concomitant decrease in metals associated with the cellular debris fraction. ? 2014 SETAC...|$|R

From the late 1860s until the 1910s, it was considered [...] "Army and Navy Headquarters" [...] {{because of the number}} of military personnel who lived there and the large number of veterans' meetings held there. In November 1889, Caleb Willard hired Henry C. Burch and Charles E. Gibbs (both veteran hotel managers in the city) to run Ebbitt House. Over the next two years, Burch and Gibbs completely refurnished all the rooms (adding new furniture and Belgian carpets), re-papered or added painted frescoes to the ceilings, and installed new furniture in the hallways. On the east side was the now-famous Red Parlor, a gentleman's lounge fitted with rich red and gold draperies, fabric wall coverings, and upholstered furniture. The restaurant, called [...] "cheerful and sunny" [...] by the Washington Post, fronted onto 14th Street NW, was lit with crystal chandeliers, and could seat up to 225 people.

500|$|With a {{telephone}} {{in every room}} and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater {{to the needs of}} socially prominent [...] "wealthy upper crust" [...] of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, [...] "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family". It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was [...] "the guest is always right", became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as [...] "Oscar of the Waldorf", maître d'hôtel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who [...] "composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees". In 1902 Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria.The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint <b>oysters,</b> <b>green</b> turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. One article that year claimed that at any one time the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1902 a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia, and in 1909 banquets, attended by hundreds, were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.|$|R
