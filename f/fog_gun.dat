The fog signal was essential in days before radar and radio. <b>Fog</b> <b>guns</b> situated at the cliff edge were fired every 10 minutes. These were replaced by explosive charges set {{from the top of the}} tower on an extending arm. Finally, a compressed air horn (hooter) blasted every 45 seconds during fog.|$|R

They were reported on an Adriatic island in 1824, at Franklinville, New York in 1896, and in northern Georgia. Lewis and Clark heard them on 4 July 1805.
