40|$|Quantitative fund {{management}} invariably involves portfolio performance being {{measured in}} terms of a quadratic objective function (due to the inclusion of variance terms as a measure of risk). Periodically, the constituents of the fund are adjusted to improve performance. This adjustment incurs a transaction cost which is a modulus function of the changes in holdings. Thus the fund manager wishes to minimise a combined quadratic and modulus function. This paper presents a new approach to deal with the minimisation of this hybrid function, using a well tried quadratic programming algorithm. The new algorithm is demonstrated using a tactical asset allocation problem and an equity <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>fund.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{a sample}} of 8 Asian {{countries}} to test whether the stock market volatility would be induced higher during national election periods. Our empirical findings show the country-specific component of variance in election periods can easily reach up to 43 % higher than the no election periods. It indicates that the investors are shocked with the election outcomes and investors’ sentiments {{are affected by the}} political events, no matter how well the preparation is made by investors. For further research on the magnitude of excessive volatility, the minority government can significantly enhance the degree of volatility while there is no political coalition hold {{more than half of the}} parliament seats. On the contrary, early election can reduce the level of volatility because early election can settle down the country-specific political strife and let the eligible voters choose the most suitable political coalition to manage the country. The investors who choose to invest in a country that is facing election event, the compensation for taking additional risk in the political event is negligible and the modest return may only suitable for those risk lover.

40|$|Islamic {{equity funds}} (IEFs) differ {{fundamentally}} from conventional equity funds since Muslims are prohibited {{to invest in}} certain companies/sectors and pay or receive interest. This paper analyzes the risk and return characteristics of a sample of 145 IEFs over the period 2000 to 2009. Our results show that IEFs are underperformers compared to Islamic {{as well as to}} conventional equity benchmarks. This underperformance seems to have increased during the recent financial crisis. We also find that IEF managers are bad market timers. They try to time the market, but in doing so, reduce the return rather than increasing it. An important implication of our results is that Muslim investors might improve their performance by investing in <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>funds</b> or ETFs rather than to invest in individual IEFs. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The 2017 <b>Index</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>funding</b> across 23 diverse issue areas, many {{of which}} overlap with other sectors, like climate, democracy-building, gender equality, and migration. The {{existence}} of peaceful, stable societies {{is critical to the}} success of other areas of work: children cannot be educated, health care clinics cannot provide services, and economic development projects will fail if people are experiencing violent conflict in their communities. In other words, peace and security funders are the "ground zero" of the philanthropic community: their work provides a foundation upon which other interventions can blossom and grow. It is this interconnectedness with other issues that makes peace and security grantmaking ever more important. We hope that foundations, policymakers, and civil society organizations will use the 2017 Index to advocate for increased attention to this fundamental work so we can continue to move towards a more peaceful, secure world for everyone...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} {{survey of the}} explanations—price pressure, downward-sloping demand curves, improved liquidity, improved operating performance, and increased investor awareness—for the increase in stock value associated with inclusion in the S&P 500 Index. We find that increased investor awareness is the primary factor behind the cross-section of abnormal announcement returns. We also find some evidence of temporary price pressure around the inclusion date. We find no evidence that long-run downward-sloping demand curves for stocks, anticipated improvements in operating performance, or increased liquidity {{are related to the}} cross-section of announcement or inclusion returns. On average, when stocks are added to the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index, they earn positive abnormal returns on both the announcement date and the date they are actually included. In an early study of this phenomenon, Shleifer (1986) presents evidence that stocks that are included in the S&P 500 Index (the “Index”) between 1976 and 1983 increase in value by nearly 3 %. He argues that inclusion in the Index is an information-free event, and this value increase reflects a rightward shift of the downward-sloping demand curve due to demand from <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>funds.</b> In this article, we examine S&P 500 Index inclusion effects by conducting an analytical survey o...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} the threshold accepting heuristic for the <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem. The <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> problem consists in minimizing the tracking error between a portfolio and a benchmark. The objective is to replicate the performance of a given index upon the condition that the number of stocks allowed in the portfolio is smaller than the number of stocks in the benchmark index. Transaction costs are incurred each time that the portfolio is rebalanced. We find the composition of a portfolio that tracks {{the performance of the}} benchmark during a given period in the past and compare it with the performance of the portfolio in a subsequent period. We report computational results in the cases where the benchmarks are market <b>indices</b> <b>tracked</b> by a small number of assets.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{existence}} of managerial ability, combined with the labor contract prevalent in the industry, implies that the closed-end fund discount should exhibit many of the primary features documented in the literature. We evaluate the model’s ability to match the quantitative features of the data, and find that it does well, although there is some observed behavior that remains to be explained. THE ROLE OF DELEGATED PORTFOLIO MANAGERS in financial markets has puzzled financial economists for some time. Their high level of remuneration suggests that they add considerable value. Yet, while their important role as providers of diversification services is widely recognized, economists have had difficulty finding evidence of any additional value that might justify their compensation levels. It is certainly not hard to find examples of funds that seem to add no value.

The redefinition of the MSCI world equity index in December 2000 provides an ideal natural experiment identifying exogenous capital flows of <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> equity <b>funds.</b> Currency speculators are shown to front-run international capital flows. Furthermore, they actively manage the portfolio risk of their speculative positions through hedging positions in correlated currencies. The exchange rate effect of separate risk hedging is economically significant {{and amounts to}} a return difference of 3. 6 percent over a 5 day event window between currencies with high and low risk hedging value.

40|$|Objectives The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to discover, whether exchange traded funds differ from mutual funds for which both employ passive replication strategies and to examine if mutual funds have incurred a decrease in monthly cash flows due to the emergence of exchange traded funds. Summary Exchange traded funds and mutual funds are similar investment vehicles. Due to the existence of passively managed funds of both types, the question arises, whether they provide similar returns with similar risk. The literature explains the differences of both fund types and finally the empirical analysis aims to discover whether there are significant differences in what they provide. Additionally, due to the proliferation of exchange traded funds all over the developed capital markets, one would think that due to their similarity with mutual funds, they would eventually replace them. Conclusions No statistical evidence of any differences in exchange traded fund and mutual fund returns, risk, risk-adjusted returns or <b>index</b> <b>tracking.</b> Mutual <b>funds</b> have not incurred lower cash flows on a cumulative basis. Exchange traded funds and mutual funds can possibly coexist because both have their own users depending on the investment horizon, tax structure or the monetary situation of the investor among other factors...|$|R

We find that, in our sample, oil is the best hedge against inflation, even though three in total are a good hedge—oil, gold and corn—with corn and oil being complete hedges, while gold is a partial hedge. Two assets have conflicting results depending on whether we examine the index or the ETF: the real estate index is a hedge, whereas real estate ETF is the opposite of a hedge. Similarly, the bond index is not related to inflation, whereas bond ETF is the opposite of a hedge. We find that stocks, soy and beef are not hedges against inflation...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Indices</b> that <b>track</b> hedge <b>fund</b> returns are, {{in order}} of development, called Non-investable, Investable and Clone. They play a central and {{unambiguous}} role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios. Equity and debt index fund products provide investable access to most developed markets in these asset classes. Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices {{on the other hand}} may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public. This may result in biased estimates of their returns. In an attempt to address this problem, clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data. [...] None of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns.|$|R
40|$|Using stocks {{from the}} Russell 1000 Index from 1974 to 2010, this thesis conducts three studies in {{relation}} to the indexation technique known as fundamental indexation (FI). The first study advances mispricing as an explanation for FI’s outperformance over alternative benchmark indexation techniques, namely, capitalization-weighted indexation (CWI), equally weighted indexation (EWI), and price-weighted indexation (PWI). The second study investigates the effectiveness of FI {{in relation to}} the benchmark indexation techniques as a function of portfolio size (number of stocks). The third study develops a market volatility-based rebalancing strategy. More specifically, in this study, our market volatility-based rebalancing strategy responds only when the market enters a volatile cycle, unlike rebalancing on a calendar basis. We compare returns, risk, and risk-adjusted returns both before and after consideration of transaction costs. The results of the first study reveal how FI is {{able to take advantage of}} stock mispricing to outperform the alternative benchmark indexation techniques considered in this thesis. Specifically, we find that FI outperforms the alternative benchmark portfolios (i) when the portfolio stocks are tilted toward small-cap stocks and (ii) when the market is volatile. We confirm a close linkage between FI portfolio returns and the Fama–French three-factor model. We demonstrate that FI relies on value stocks to generate higher returns and on large stocks to reduce portfolio risks. Finally, we provide evidence that book to market and small firm size effects can be attributed to mispricing. Thus, controversially, rather than argue that FI represents a repackaging of value and size factors, we argue that these factors are at least partly the outcome of stock mispricing. The results of the second study reveal how the benefits of diversification as a function of the number of stocks are differentiated across the various indexation approaches adopted. Specifically, our findings determine how significantly lower idiosyncratic risk and higher risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by increasing portfolio size. While the majority of diversification benefits are acquired 8 with fewer than 200 stocks for EWI portfolios, additional stocks are required for the alternative non-EWI portfolios. CWI, PWI, and FI portfolios require 600, 300, and 400 stocks, respectively, to extract similar diversification benefits as EWI portfolios with 200 stocks. The results of our third study reveal that a market volatility-based rebalancing strategy as developed in this thesis allows FI portfolios to continue to outperform, with significantly lower turnover and subsequently lower transaction costs. Specifically, when return, risk, and transaction costs are assessed in combination, our market volatility-based rebalancing strategy significantly outperforms alternative calendar-based rebalancing strategies, including monthly rebalancing, quarterly rebalancing, and annual rebalancing strategies. We conclude that a market volatility-based rebalancing strategy has the potential to improve portfolio performance from a practical (transaction cost) perspective. As a whole, this thesis provides new insights on how to construct and manage <b>index</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>funds</b> based on FI, as well as on alternative indexation techniques. The first study presents the underlying foundations for FI’s success, as well as informs the fund manager about the optimal application of FI in regard to both (i) optimal stock characteristics and (ii) optimal market conditions. The second study informs the fund manager about the optimal number of stocks in the risk–return relation. The third study provides fund managers an alternative to traditional calendar portfolio rebalancing that is effective in reducing transaction costs without compromising on returns and risks...|$|R

40|$|Index funds {{performance}} – Some insights Passive {{investment management}} {{has become an}} important component of the investment management industry. The responsibility of the index fund managers is to deliver risk and return same as the underlying index. Many factors impact investment performance. Some of these factors lie outside the sphere of influence of the fund manager. For a comprehensive assessment of fund performance and follow up, it has become necessary to identify the causes and attribute components of fund performance to these causes. Attribution analysis plays a crucial role in identifying factors controllable by the fund manager and in computing the part of fund performance arising out of managing these factors. Such analysis should form the basis of motivational systems for fund managers in a fund management company. While significant attention has been paid to performance attribution in equity and income funds, research relating to the same in the index fund domain is scarce. This paper suggests a few ideas to plug this gap. The findings indicate that significant contribution to <b>index</b> <b>fund</b> <b>tracking</b> error may arise from factors that are not under index fund manager’s control.
