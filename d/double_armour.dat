50|$|Armour-piercing {{discarding}} sabot (APDS) {{is a type}} of {{kinetic energy}} projectile fired from a rifled-barrel gun to attack armoured targets. APDS rounds are sabot rounds, firing a spin-stabilized armor penetrating sub-projectile, and were commonly used in large calibre tank guns, up until the early 1980s, but have now been superseded by armour-piercing, fin-stabilised, discarding sabot (APFSDS) projectiles used in smooth-bore guns, firing a fin-stabilized armor penetrating sub-projectile. However, APDS rounds are still commonly used in small or medium calibre weapon systems.

50|$|The Heavy Valiant was a {{substantially}} different vehicle, only using the turret and driver's compartment of the Valiant on a hull {{derived from the}} A33 Excelsior and its T1 suspension. This gave armour of 9 (hull front) and 10 inches (turret) thickness. Weight was now estimated at 42 tons, which is comparable with the original Excelsior despite almost <b>doubling</b> the <b>armour</b> thickness, and so {{this must have been}} a much smaller tank. Power was doubled to cope with the weight, using the new and compact 400 bhp Rolls Royce Meteorite engine (a cut-down V8 Meteor) and an improved transmission. The mistake of the Valentine was to be repeated, where the turret was up-gunned to the 95mm howitzer of the Centaur IV at the cost of forcing the commander to take over the loader's task in a two-man turret.

The first two prototypes had a frontal protection level equivalent to about 120 mm [...] "line-of-sight" [...] thickness in the horizontal plane. The type was thus not particularly heavily armoured for its time. The armour was intended to provide protection against high-velocity guns in general use at the end of the Second World War.

50|$|On 12 May the {{commander}} of III-2203 discovered that all trained crews had been moved to The Hague. Most of that day and the morning of 13 May were used to find a truck and fetch a replacement gunner and new munition from The Hague. In the afternoon the vehicle protected {{the headquarters of the}} 1st Infantry Division at Rijswijk. On 14 May the car supported an attempt to eliminate the largest remaining pocket of German airborne troops, that had gathered around Major-General Hans Graf von Sponeck at Overschie, together with a Landsverk M38 armoured car from 2e Eskadron Pantserwagens. During the advance the clutch of III-2203 malfunctioned and the car returned to Delft for repairs. Rejoining the fight in the afternoon, III-2003 first took a civilian, fled from the village, on board to point out the exact German positions. Shortly afterwards the attacking Dutch troops witnessed the devastating bombardment of Rotterdam, just south of Overschie. Continuing to advance nevertheless, the two armoured cars were suddenly hit by antitank rifle fire and returned to the Dutch lines. It transpired that the M39 had been penetrated twice low in the side hull armour, without the projectiles doing any damage or even being noticed; a third round had been stopped by the thin strip of reinforcing steel around the turret base that <b>doubled</b> the normal <b>armour</b> thickness. Rotterdam capitulating {{as a result of the}} carpet bombing, III-2203 was withdrawn to The Hague.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} formula {{developed by}} Van der Meer {{is used for}} the design of different kind of rock slopes. In the formula is among a number of other parameters also the permeability of the structure represented. A more permeable structure has the ability to dissipate more water and therefore more energy, this results into a lower required weight of the armour layer. This coefficient, described as the Notional Permeability P, has been determined for three different types of structures. A homogeneous structure, a structure with a permeable core and an impermeable structure. In practice structures are being build who deviate from these standard situations. Therefore there is a demand for values of P about structures other than the known standard situations. In this thesis P values are found by means of physical scale model tests.

40|$|Abstract: Studies on the {{stability}} of the amour layer (d’Angremond et. al. [1999] revealed the importance of density of placement. The current research focuses on the influence of the density of placement on {{the stability}} of cubes in a <b>double</b> <b>armour</b> layer and tetrapods and rocks in a single armour layer. The experiments were performed in the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at the Technical University Delft. A model of a breakwater was constructed in a wave flume. An increase in density of placement resulted in all cases in an increase of stability, except in the case of cubes. Cubes have the tendency to start behaving like a placed block revetment including the characteristic failure mechanisms like uplift and sliding. Tetrapods seem to be unsuitable for single layer armour layers {{due to the fact that}} the filter layer is easily attacked by the waves even when no tetrapod has been removed. Experiments on rock showed that vertically placed elements lead to a much more stable construction due to their self-repairing ability. Characteristic for rock is the piling up of elements under the waterline caused by the impact of collapsing waves. This lead to very low densities of placement higher on the slope. Existing damage criteria are not suitable for density of placement. In this research an effort has been done to create a damage criteria, which considers area of attack, density of placement and different failure mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Richards Bay Port, {{located in}} the East Coast of South Africa, was built during the 1970 s. Two rubble mound breakwaters were {{constructed}} to protect the deep-water entrance channel and create a sheltered area for the vessels. Since the completion of these breakwaters in 1976, they have withstood several major storms, including cyclones that have caused significant damage to the dolos armour layers. To restore their functionality, two major reparations were carried out in 1976 and 1996, respectively. In addition, a severe storm that occurred in March 2007 caused relevant damages to the breakwaters of Richards Bay Port. Their damage level was established after the survey conducted in May 2007. This survey concluded {{that most of the}} breakwaters sections had an intermediate damage, except from the South Breakwater’s roundhead, which was in failure and it required urgent repairs. Since then provisional measures have been adopted to avoid the spread of damage along the breakwater while new repair works are designed. The main objective of this thesis was to determine the most suitable design for the repair works that should be applied in the roundhead of the South breakwater at Richards Bay Port through a Quasi Three-Dimensional (3 D) model testing. This was achieved by reproducing the observed damage at the structure’s roundhead in one of CSIR’s hydraulic laboratory flumes and testing three repair alternatives. These repair alternatives consisted of covering the damaged structure with new armour units. Dolos, Core-Loc and antifer cubes were the armour units used in this research. The wave basin used to conduct this research had a length of 32 m, a width of 4 m and an available height of 1 m. A transitional slope of 1 : 15 that extends about 4. 5 m long was built inside the basin to connect the deep water with the shallower water close to Richards Bay Port. Thereafter, the seabed profile corresponding to the South East direction was constructed along the next 20 m of the basin. The structure was placed at a distance of 26 m from the wavemaker. Graded gravel was used to construct the core, underlayer and toe protection of the roundhead, with a nominal size of 4. 2 g, 4. 8 g and 12. 2 g, respectively. The existing armour layer was built using dolos of 68 g and gravel that represented the broken pieces. Above this damaged armour layer, the new armour units were placed with a nominal size of 82 g for the dolos, 102 g for the Core-Loc and 100 g for the antifer cubes. The new armour units were placed trying to replicate the placement conditions at the roundhead. A total of 8 to 9 tests were conducted per armour unit. Five wave conditions were tested with increasing significant wave heights varying from 7 cm to 18 cm. Two water levels were set up per wave condition (High Water and Low Water). The tested wave conditions were generated with a JONSWAP spectrum and a duration that corresponded to a 1000 waves approaching the structure. Prior to and after each test, pictures were taken from three fixed positions perpendicular to the roundhead. These images were visually compared with the Armour Track software developed by CSIR to identify and quantify the movement of the armour units. This software is based on the superposition technique and it is useful to determine the stability of the structure. For each test, the stability number and the measured damage within the reference area were estimated. Generally the movements of the units occurred along the water line. However for higher wave heights (return periods of 20, 50 and 100 years), the waves overtopped and the damage started to concentrate in an area located between the angles 120 and 150 degrees {{from the direction of the}} incident wave, until failing with the overload condition. From these experiments it followed that the Core-Loc repair alternative does not perform as good as the other two options. Although all the repair options have difficulties to achieve the placement requirements at the roundhead, this phenomenon has a larger impact in the Core-Loc armour layer because it consisted of a single layer and any unit displacement resulted in failure of the structure. Therefore repairs should be undertaken more frequently, which leads to larger maintenance costs. The remaining repair options had a similar performance, even though the resistance mechanism of dolos and antifer cubes is different. The first one resists by the interlocking between the units, whereas the antifer cubes resist by their mass. Both are placed as <b>double</b> <b>armour</b> layers and thus some damage is allowed before carrying new repair works. The main difference between them is the actual feasibility to construct the units. The antifer cubes do not have any size restriction. Therefore heavier units can be manufactured without changing the stability of the unit. However, dolos have a size limitation because of its slenderness, and right now dolos heavier than 30 -tonne cannot be built. Overall it could be concluded that the repair alternative consisting of antifer cubes is the one that should be applied at this particular location due to its performance and its construction feasibility.

5000|$|For 20 {{years after}} her {{commissioning}} in 1920, Hood was the largest and heaviest warship in the world. Combining eight massive BL 15 inch Mk I naval guns with a top speed greater than any battleship on the sea, Hood was the pride of Great Britains navy, and embodied the world dominance of British naval power. Despite this, Hood had one conspicuous flaw {{as compared to the}} super-dreadnought battleships she served alongside: as a battlecruiser, much of her bulk was dedicated to extra engine power instead of comprehensive armour coverage.This was in accordance with the prevailing theory originally propounded by First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher that [...] "speed is armour". While her 12-inch belt armour was considered sufficient against most capital ships she was likely to encounter, her 3 inches of deck armour was only rated against shell splinters, leaving her badly unprotected against plunging fire at long range. At the time of her commissioning in World War I, naval gunnery was severely inaccurate at the ranges necessary to produce plunging fire, and Hoods greater speed and maneuverability were rightly seen as an acceptable trade-off. However, as the accuracy of naval gunfire increased in the inter-war period, Hood was eventually scheduled to receive an upgrade in 1939 that would have <b>doubled</b> her deck <b>armour</b> to 6 inches, but the outbreak of World War II meant the upgrade never took place. She thus sortied to war at a marked disadvantage against the new capital ships of the Axis.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to assess the impact of}} different placement methods, with different packing densities, on the stability of <b>double</b> layered Antifer-block <b>armour</b> layers. This was done by experimental research in the wave-flume of the Fluid mechanics laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology. 17 experiments were performed with packing densities between 44. 8 and 61. 1 percent. For every experiment the under layer, toe and armour layer were rebuilt. The placed Antifer layer was tested with eight irregular wave series with increasing significant wave heights from 9 cm up to 20 cm. From these experiments followed that regular placement methods behave more stable than irregular placement methods with a similar packing density. Also the more irregular (less accurate) positioning of blocks within a regular placement method caused a decrease in stability. Higher packing densities for equal placement methods lead to higher stabilities and higher reflection coefficients. The resulting -values were between 4. 0 and 23. 7. If the reflection coefficients during the first wave series were high, this resulted in more overtopping during the latest wave series, which indicates that there is a positive correlation between the reflection and the overtopping. Overall it could be concluded that, when the under layer and the toe are smooth and the blocks can be placed accurately, the best performing placement methods are the closed pyramid placement method for packing densities around 45 % and 50 % and the double pyramid placement method for packing densities around 55 % and 60 %. The size of the openings to the under layer, of the double pyramid placement method, influenced the reflection coefficients. When the second layer was shifted half a nominal diameter upwards the reflection coefficients were minimal. It is recommended to investigate the possible negative influence of oblique incoming waves on the stability of the double pyramid placement method. The eventual choice of the placement method and packing density depends on the allowed reflection and/or overtopping and the construction costs. The construction costs can be divided into the production costs, the placement costs and the constant costs. For equal constant costs and equal or small differences in placement costs the placement with the higher packing density and accompanying stability value is cheaper for high design wave heights. When the placement costs decrease for both placements or only for the placement with the higher packing density, then the placement with the higher packing density becomes also cheaper for lower wave heights.
