5|$|Tsubasa {{explores the}} {{fragility}} of human relationships through Sakura losing all of her memories involving her love interest, Syaoran. Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> the will. At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E

So he told, <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> faith in three hundred and thirty millions of Hindu mythological gods, and in all the gods which foreigners have now and still have no faith in themselves, there will be no salvation.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike utilitarianism, which views utility as {{the sole}} moral good, [...] "the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist {{thinking}} are... order, material wealth, and increase in population". During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth {{was seen as a}} moral necessity for a harmonious society. The [...] "material wealth" [...] of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing, and the [...] "order" [...] of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability. Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison, in The Cambridge History of Ancient China, writes that the moral goods of Mohism [...] "are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically".|$|E
2500|$|Stone caused {{controversy}} at the 2007 BRIT Awards ceremony on 14 February 2007 while {{presenting the}} award for British Male Solo Artist (won by James Morrison). Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, {{who had been the}} target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse's hit [...] "Rehab"). In response to the British media's reaction, Stone responded, [...] "At the end of the day, I don't give a fuck <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a problem with my accent. That's all I can say about it. The words I say do not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you don't like it, don't listen. I'm not being a cruel person by sounding a different way. And I can't help it. I've been [...] since I was, like, 14." [...] Stone later claimed that her record label cancelled all her upcoming press appearances to publicise her upcoming third album {{as a result of the}} backlash.|$|E

60|$|A {{generic term}} is always liable to become thus {{limited to a}} single species, or even individual, <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{occasion}} to think and speak of that individual or species much oftener than of any thing else which is contained in the genus. Thus by cattle, a stage-coachman will understand horses; beasts, {{in the language of}} agriculturists, stands for oxen; and birds, with some sportsmen, for partridges only. The law of language which operates in these trivial instances is the very same in conformity to which the terms Θεός, Deus, and God, were adopted from Polytheism by Christianity, to express the single object of its own adoration. Almost all the terminology of the Christian Church is made up of words originally used in a much more general acceptation: Ecclesia, Assembly; Bishop, Episcopus, Overseer; Priest, Presbyter, Elder; Deacon, Diaconus, Administrator; Sacrament, a vow of allegiance; Evangelium, good tidings; and some words, as Minister, are still used both in the general and in the limited sense. It would be interesting to trace the progress by which author came, in its most familiar sense, to signify a writer, and ποίητης, or maker, a poet.|$|E

60|$|The {{snow-storm}} lasted another day; {{but what}} became of it afterwards, I cannot possibly imagine. At any rate, it entirely cleared away during the night; and when the sun arose the next morning, it shone brightly down on as bleak a tract of hill-country here in Berkshire, as could be seen anywhere in the world. The frost-work had so covered the window-panes that it was hardly possible {{to get a glimpse}} at the scenery outside. But, while waiting for breakfast, the small populace of Tanglewood had scratched peep-holes with their finger-nails, and saw with vast delight that--unless it were one or two bare patches on a precipitous hill-side, or the gray effect of the snow, intermingled with the black pine forest--all nature was as white as a sheet. How exceedingly pleasant! And, to make it all the better, it was cold enough to nip one's nose short off! <b>If</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> but life enough in them to bear it, there is nothing that so raises the spirits, and makes the blood ripple and dance so nimbly, like a brook down the slope of a hill, as a bright, hard frost.|$|E
60|$|How do I {{know all}} that? Because a fairy told it me; a fairy who lives up here upon the moor, and indeed {{in most places}} else, <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> but eyes to see her. What is her name? I cannot tell. The best name that I can give her (and I think it must be {{something}} like her real name, because she will always answer if you call her by it patiently and reverently) is Madam How. She will come in good time, if she is called, even by a little child. And she will let us see her at her work, and, what is more, teach us to copy her. But there is another fairy here likewise, whom we can hardly hope to see. Very thankful should we be if she lifted even the smallest corner of her veil, and showed us but for a moment if it were but her finger tip--so beautiful is she, and yet so awful too. But that sight, I believe, would not make us proud, {{as if we had}} had some great privilege. No, my dear child: it would make us feel smaller, and meaner, and more stupid and more ignorant than we had ever felt in our lives before; {{at the same time it}} would make us wiser than ever we were in our lives before--that one glimpse of the great glory of her whom we call Lady Why.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have already}} stated {{to you that}} the inquiry {{respecting}} the causes of the phenomena of organic nature resolves itself into two problems--the first being the question of the origination of living or organic beings; and the second being the totally distinct problem of the modification and perpetuation of organic beings when they have already come into existence. The first question Mr. Darwin does not touch; he does not deal with it at all; but he says--given the origin of organic matter--supposing its creation to have already taken place, my object is to show in consequence of what laws and what demonstrable properties of organic matter, and of its environments, such states of organic nature as those with which we are acquainted must have come about. This, you will observe, is a perfectly legitimate proposition; every person has a right to define the limits of the inquiry which he sets before himself; and yet it is a most singular thing that in all the multifarious, and, not unfrequently, ignorant attacks which have been made upon the 'Origin of Species', there is nothing which has been more speciously criticised than this particular limitation. <b>If</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> nothing else to urge against the book, they say--"Well, after all, you see, Mr. Darwin's explanation of the 'Origin of Species' is not good for much, because, in the long run, he admits that he does not know how organic matter began to exist. But if you admit any special creation for the first particle of organic matter you may just as well admit it for all the rest; five hundred or five thousand distinct creations are just as intelligible, and just as little difficult to understand, as one." [...] The answer to these cavils is two-fold. In the first place, all human inquiry must stop somewhere; all our knowledge and all our investigation cannot take us beyond the limits set by the finite and restricted character of our faculties, or destroy the endless unknown, which accompanies, like its shadow, the endless procession of phenomena. So far as I can venture to offer an opinion on such a matter, the purpose of our being in existence, the highest object that human beings can set before themselves, is not the pursuit of any such chimera as the annihilation of the unknown; but it is simply the unwearied endeavour to remove its boundaries a little further from our little sphere of action.|$|E

Even when I am feeling worst--when my chest aches, you know--I grow quite happy when I think of what the papers wrote about you: the Times and the Saturday Review, and the Spectator, {{and the rest of}} them.
