5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of water-borne illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>month,</b> schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E

[...] Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow, {{had begun}} {{an investigation of}} his own and discovered that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>month</b> Toft's husband, Joshua, had been buying young rabbits. [...] Convinced he had enough evidence to proceed, in a letter to physician Sir Hans Sloane he wrote that the affair had [...] "almost alarmed England" [...] and that he would soon publish his findings. [...] The same day, Thomas Howard, a porter at the bagnio, confessed to Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas Clarges that he had been bribed by Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret, to sneak a rabbit into Toft's chamber. [...] When arrested and questioned Mary denied the accusation, while Margaret, under Douglas's interrogation, claimed that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} in the ring of Roderick's voice, as he uttered these words, which sent them home with convincing force. He was not talking for effect, or the mere sensuous pleasure of extravagant and paradoxical utterance, as had often enough been the case ere this; he was not even talking viciously or ill-humoredly. He was talking passionately, desperately, and from an irresistible need to throw off the oppressive burden of his mother's confidence. His cruel eloquence brought the poor lady to her feet, and she stood there with clasped hands, petrified and voiceless. Mary Garland quickly left her place, came straight to Roderick, and laid her hand on his arm, looking at him with all her tormented heart in her eyes. He made no movement to disengage himself; he simply shook his head several times, in dogged negation of her healing powers. Rowland had been living <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>month</b> in such intolerable expectancy of disaster that now that the ice was broken, and the fatal plunge taken, his foremost feeling was almost elation; but in a moment his orderly instincts and his natural love of superficial smoothness overtook it.|$|E
