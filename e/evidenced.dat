30|$|Dempster–Shafer <b>evidence</b> {{theory is}} widely used in many fields of {{information}} fusion. However, the counter-intuitive results may be obtained when combining with highly conflicting <b>evidence.</b> To deal with such a problem, we put forward a new method based on the distance of <b>evidence</b> and the uncertainty measure. First, based on the distance of <b>evidence,</b> the <b>evidence</b> {{is divided into two}} parts, the credible <b>evidence</b> and the incredible <b>evidence.</b> Then, a novel belief entropy is applied to measure the information volume of the <b>evidence.</b> Finally, the weight of each <b>evidence</b> is obtained and used to modify the <b>evidence</b> before using the Dempster’s combination rule. Numerical examples show that the proposed method can effectively handle conflicting <b>evidence</b> with better convergence.|$|R
50|$|False <b>evidence,</b> {{fabricated}} <b>evidence,</b> forged <b>evidence</b> or tainted <b>evidence</b> {{is information}} created or obtained illegally, to sway the verdict {{in a court}} case. Falsified <b>evidence</b> could be created by either side in a case (including the police/prosecution in a criminal case), or by someone sympathetic to either side. Misleading by suppressing <b>evidence</b> {{can also be considered}} a form of false <b>evidence</b> (by omission), however, in some cases, suppressed <b>evidence</b> is excluded because it cannot be proved the accused was aware of the items found or of their location. The analysis of <b>evidence</b> (forensic <b>evidence)</b> may also be forged if the person doing the forensic work finds it easier to fabricate <b>evidence</b> and test results than to perform the actual work involved. Parallel construction is a form of false <b>evidence</b> in which the <b>evidence</b> is truthful but its origins are untruthfully described, at times in order to avoid <b>evidence</b> being excluded as inadmissible due to unlawful means of procurement such as an unlawful search.|$|R

40|$|How {{are reasons}} and <b>evidence</b> interrelated?

In this paper, I argue against these common views, and I defend the view that reasons and <b>evidence</b> are conjunctively related: <b>evidence</b> and reasons are distinguishable yet inseparable.

If the proponent of the <b>evidence</b> wants to have the <b>evidence</b> included in the official record of the case, the proponent will first ask for the <b>evidence</b> to be marked by the court for identification purposes. After the <b>evidence</b> is marked for identification, the proponent of the demonstrative <b>evidence</b> must lay a foundation. It is at this time that the relevancy of the demonstrative <b>evidence</b> is usually challenged. Laying of a foundation explains how the demonstrative <b>evidence</b> relates to {{the facts of the case}} and establishes the <b>evidence's</b> authenticity. Once the foundation is laid, the proponent may ask to officially move the piece of <b>evidence</b> into the record where it is marked as a full exhibit. If the <b>evidence</b> is marked as a full exhibit the jury may refer to the <b>evidence</b> during deliberations and in most jurisdictions the jury may examine the <b>evidence</b> during deliberations.
