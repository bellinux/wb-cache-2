5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. The <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E

5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building the <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E
5|$|In the Despotate of Epirus, the Church of the Parigoritissa (1282–9) is {{the most}} complex example, with a domed octagon core and domed ambulatory.

The upper level narthex and galleries have five domes, with the middle <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narthex an open lantern. This Greek-cross octagon design, similar to the earlier example at Daphni, is one of several among the various Byzantine principalities.

5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|Palestine was conquered by the Islamic Caliphate, {{beginning}} in 634 CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim {{conquest of the}} Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.|$|E

50|$|Andrea Vassallo (2 January 1856 - 28 January 1928) was {{an eclectic}} Maltese architect.

50|$|In 1867, Lockwood {{commissioned}} Albert Bierstadt's <b>The</b> <b>Domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yosemite, the artist's second great, monumental Yosemite work, for $25,000.

Lockwood hung the painting in <b>the</b> octagonal rotunda <b>of</b> his Norwalk, Connecticut, mansion. After Lockwood's death in 1872, the painting sold at auction for $5,100.

Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E
5|$|During the {{periodic}} renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed {{additions to the}} mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets and the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock as a church, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but the mosque remains under {{the administration of the}} Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.|$|E
25|$|Mosaic was a {{favourite}} form <b>of</b> decoration in <b>the</b> Byzantine {{period and}} richly decorated churches in this style {{can be seen}} throughout Greece, in Turkey, Italy, Sicily, Russia and other countries.

5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Creswell, while {{referring}} to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, al-Walid I, reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque {{over a period of}} six months to a year, using workers from Damascus. Most scholars agree that the mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713–14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from the <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material. The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
