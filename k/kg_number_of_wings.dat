50|$|As part of {{an overall}} effort to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> in Japan the wing's {{tactical}} squadrons were detached on 13 May 1964, and on 18 June 1964 all wing components except wing headquarters inactivated.|$|R
50|$|At various times, this wing sported {{the other}} Polish squadrons, {{such as the}} No. 303 Squadron RAF and No. 316 Squadron RAF. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> was also not constant, as it varied from at one to two.|$|R
50|$|With Profiles, constructions {{with varying}} levels of {{complexity}} can be designed: windows, doors, balcony doors, hanging facades, commercial shop fronts, constructions with unlimited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> sliding constructions, arches, trapezoids etc.At every stage of the working process, CCG Profiles allows change of the construction parameters: dimensions, roundings, bevels, beams position, width <b>of</b> the <b>wings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cuckoo genera {{differ in}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>wing</b> {{feathers}} as below.|$|R
50|$|Other radical {{approaches}} to wing design were also being tried. The Scottish-born inventor Alexander Graham Bell devised a cellular octahedral wing form which, like the multiplane, proved disappointingly inefficient. Other lacklustre performers included the Edwards Rhomboidal, the Lee-Richards annular <b>wing</b> and varying <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> {{one after the}} other in tandem.|$|R
5000|$|Stress {{and fatigue}} {{incurred}} in low-altitude operations {{led to a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> failures and crashes and an extensive refit program was begun in 1958 to strengthen the wing mountings. The program was known as [...] "Milk Bottle", named after the big connecting pins that were replaced in the wing roots.|$|R
5000|$|The wing {{was first}} {{activated}} as the 312th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico {{in the fall}} of 1954. [...] A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> had been activated at Clovis and trained there since it reopened in 1951. [...] The 312th was assigned to Ninth Air Force upon activation.|$|R
50|$|Breast ptosis, or sagging of the breasts, is {{a normal}} {{consequence}} of aging where the breast tissue droops lower on the chest and the nipple points downward. Researchers have found that ptosis is influenced by several key factors: greater age, higher body mass index, larger bra cup size, history of significant weight loss (>50 lbs or 25 <b>kg),</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pregnancies, and history of cigarette smoking. It is not caused, as commonly believed by many women and medical practitioners, by breastfeeding.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{situation}} occurs considering the homology of morphological structures. For example, many insects possess two pairs <b>of</b> flying <b>wings.</b> In beetles, the first pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> is hardened into elytra, wing covers with little role in flight, while in flies the second pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> is condensed into small halteres used for balance. If the two pairs <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> are considered as interchangeable, homologous structures, {{this may be}} described as a parallel reduction in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> but otherwise the two changes are each divergent changes in one pair <b>of</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In January 1960, the {{division}} became an operational headquarters only, when the 380th Bombardment Wing's 380th Combat Support Group again assumed support duties at Plattsburgh.

50|$|A {{hierarchy}} of angels {{is a belief}} or tradition found in the angelology of different religions, which holds that there are different levels or ranks of angels. Higher ranks may be asserted to have greater power or authority over lower ranks, and with different ranks having differences in appearance, such as varying <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> or faces.|$|R

5000|$|The {{researchers}} {{recorded the}} flight of hummingbirds and hawkmoths using 1,000 frame-per-second video cameras. The research expanded to four other kinds of flying insects, two species of birds and a bat which all use about the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> beats to complete a turn in mid-flight. The flying animals returned to regular flapping to resume a straight course of flight.|$|R

50|$|Inclusive {{within the}} air forces, {{commands}} and divisions were administrative headquarters called wings to control groups (operational units; see section below).

As part of the Air Service and Air Corps, wings had been composite organizations, that is, composed of groups with different types of missions.
