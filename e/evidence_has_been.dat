Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past <b>evidence</b> <b>has</b> <b>been,</b> or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E

5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams.

5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no <b>evidence</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E

5|$|It {{is still}} not certain how many people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as <b>evidence</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Objections to {{evolution}} {{have been}} raised since evolutionary ideas came to prominence in the 19th century. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, his theory of evolution (the idea that species arose through descent with modification from a single common ancestor in a process driven by natural selection) initially met opposition from scientists with different theories, but eventually came to receive overwhelming acceptance in the scientific community. The observation of evolutionary processes occurring (as well as the modern evolutionary synthesis explaining that <b>evidence)</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> uncontroversial among mainstream biologists since the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|The Ace Attorney {{games are}} visual novel {{adventure}} {{games in which}} the player controls defense attorneys and defends their clients in several different episodes.

Once enough <b>evidence</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> collected, the game moves on to a courtroom trial section.|$|E

5|$|Although no fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> dated {{within the}} last 1,000 years, the {{hippopotamus}} has been surprisingly common in the oral legends of the Malagasy. In 1648, Étienne de Flacourt became the French governor of Madagascar and {{he wrote in his}} Histoire de la grande isle de Madagascar about hearing stories from the Malagasy about an animal called the mangarsahoc which closely resembled the hippopotamus. In different regions of Madagascar, stories were recorded of the tsy-aomby-aomby, the omby-rano, and the laloumena, all animals that resembled hippopotami, but few other animals on the island. In 1902, a colonial administrator named Raybaud asserted that stories he heard in the highlands could only be about Malagasy hippos still living as late as 1878. The strength of these oral traditions led the IUCN to classify the Malagasy hippopotami as recent extinctions.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{material}} from the Bronze Age and earlier has been recovered and excavations have shown that there was unsustained late-Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity in the vicinity. The earliest known permanent settlement dates from the Iron Age and began where a track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. Although only sparse pottery <b>evidence</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found for the middle Iron Age period, 4,290 pellet mould fragments, likely used for minting and dated to 50BC–AD 50, have been uncovered south east of the modern town centre, south of a crossing of the River Slea and near Mareham Lane in Old Sleaford. The largest {{of its kind in}} Europe, the deposit has led archaeologists to consider that the site in Old Sleaford {{was probably one of the}} largest Corieltauvian settlements during this period and may have been a tribal centre.|$|E
