2500|$|United States – The US Department of State {{announced}} limited {{support for}} the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria. In March 2016, {{the day after the}} declaration of the Democratic Federation of Rojava - Northern Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Rojava YPG militia as having [...] "proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role." [...] The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces. During the Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016), US Special Operation Forces were widely reported and photographed taking part, wearing YPG and YPJ badges on their uniforms. When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of [...] "Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria". On 7 November 2016, when asked about the federalization of Syria, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said [...] "We don’t want to see any kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don’t want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> kind of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or – any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria". According to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army in an interview on 29 March 2017, the US does not recognize Rojava as a [...] "Kurdish state" [...] but instead sees it as a [...] "multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS." ...|$|E

But suppose you ended another sort of help--instead of the {{strength}} of arm, the strength of my pocket? That would be all and that's what they all say. But why do they say it. Because the robber gangs want all the suckers to be honest and respect money. If the suckers weren't honest and didn't respect money, where would the robbers be? Don't you see? The robbers don't deal in arm-holds; they deal in dollars. Therefore arm-holds are just common and ordinary, while dollars are sacred--so sacred that you didn't let me lend you a hand with a few.|$|E

Not so many feats can be found in American literature to surpass what he did there in those two or three weeks in that little room with those piled-up papers in a half-known tongue, piled clear up to the ceiling, and a small dog-eared dictionary, and a memory, and a determination <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right, and a gorgeous imagination to paint it when he got it.

5000|$|Home Cookin’ is a horn-based soul {{band that}} {{played in the}} Las Vegas local scene from 1989 to 2000. Described by drummer and video game {{composer}} Frank Klepacki as [...] "just a good-time, funky dance band", the band {{has been compared to}} Tower of Power and featured a five-man horn section. Robins recalled, [...] "We were together {{for a couple of years}} and wanted to do some serious recording. I was working at a pizza place, making nothing. Pretty soon I realized, wheres the money going to come from? If Im going to do anything seriously musically, Ive <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> money first - and some knowledge." [...] The band became active again around 1995 [...] Around the mid 1990s, the band grew to include ten members, including a five-man horn section and drums played by video game music composer Frank Klepacki. The group released their debut album in 1997, named Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, and featuring fourteen tracks. Track nine, Soul Space Express, appeared on Road Rash: Jailbreak and the television series Cupid, while X-Rated Superstar was a number one hit and received regular airplay on Vegass KXTE-FM Xtreme Disorder format. Playboy playmate Corinna Harney volunteered to appear on the albums cover. The success of this song sparked a racy music video, which was given airplay on MTV for a brief period. Home Cookin songs were regularly included on Las Vegas scene compilation albums.|$|E

You know he really has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his living <b>some</b> way or other. But don’t think I was deserted. On the contrary. People were coming and going, all sorts of people that Henry Allègre used to know—or had refused to know. I had a sensation of plotting and intriguing around me, all the time. I was feeling morally bruised, sore all over, when, one day, Don Rafael de Villarel sent in his card. A grandee. I didn’t know him, but, as you are aware, there was hardly a personality of mark or position that hasn’t been talked about in the Pavilion before me. Of him I had only heard that he was a very austere and pious person, always at Mass, and that sort of thing. I saw a frail little man with a long, yellow face and sunken fanatical eyes, an Inquisitor, an unfrocked monk. One missed a rosary from his thin fingers. He gazed at me terribly and I couldn’t imagine what he might want. I waited for him to pull out a crucifix and sentence me to the stake there and then. But no; he dropped his eyes and in a cold, righteous sort of voice informed me that he had called on behalf of the prince—he called him His Majesty. I was amazed by the change. I wondered now why he didn’t slip his hands into the sleeves of his coat, you know, as begging Friars do when they come for a subscription. He explained that the Prince asked for permission to call and offer me his condolences in person. We had seen a lot of him our last two months in Paris that year. Henry Allègre had taken a fancy to paint his portrait. He used to ride with us nearly every morning. Almost without thinking I said I should be pleased. Don Rafael was shocked at my want of formality, but bowed to me in silence, very much as a monk bows, from the waist. If he had only crossed his hands flat on his chest it would have been perfect. Then, I don’t know why, something moved me to make him a deep curtsy as he backed out of the room, leaving me suddenly impressed, not only with him but with myself too. I had my door closed to everybody else that afternoon and the Prince came with a very proper sorrowful face, but five minutes after he got into the room he was laughing as usual, made the whole little house ring with it. You know his big, irresistible laugh. [...] .” ...|$|R

I guess we {{tend to have a}} lot of confidence with him in there." [...] Cummings suffered a broken toe on his right foot and bruised shoulder and Milanovich returned to his starting role after his suspension. Cummings saw no action in Maryland's fifth game, a 31 - 3 loss to Georgia Tech, which knocked the team out of the Top 25 rankings. At Wake Forest, Cummings came off the bench in relief of Milanovich, who had struggled reading the blitz, and played the last 39 minutes. He completed 20 passes on 30 attempts for 222 yards. He led three drives that culminated in a field goal, touchdown, and a final series which used eight minutes of the game clock in the 9 - 6 victory. After the game, head coach Mark Duffner praised Cummings' play, but stopped shy of naming him the starter. Cummings started against Clemson and , but the offense struggled and Milanovich started the last three games, while Cummings nursed a sore shoulder. Duffner said of Cummings, [...] "One of our kids said he's a linebacker playing quarterback. On a scramble, when he can slide to get down, he'll try to run over a kid for extra yards. We've still <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of that out of him, but you've got to love that toughness."

Though they see their relationship as a friendship, everyone else sees a blossoming romance ("Certain Individuals"). Everyone leaves except for the spurned Itchy who watches Fay ride off on Muscles' shoulders. Itchy decides that he has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> new social ideas that will excite the girls. He decides to have a candlelight evening in the social hall. He figures that will be so romantic that all the girls will forget Muscles and his sports events. Unfortunately, his plan backfires when the Social Hall catches fire. Kandel is so mad at Itchy that he demotes him to Boat House Boy and puts Muscles {{in charge of all}} social events. The next day Chick takes Teddy out to Eagle Rock, yelling at Pinky to stay away from her. When Teddy asks what has come over him, Chick reveals that he loves Teddy. He proposes marriage, and imagines how his friends would react to their going out together to museums and cultural events ("They Won't Know Me"). Teddy tells Chick that not only is she already engaged, she meant to get married next week. Even though she, too, loves Chick she can't call off the wedding. Rather than talk anymore about it, they go back to the camp. Back at the boathouse, we find Itchy has been demoted to Boat Boy. Teddy and Chick return from Eagle Rock and Chick confronts Fay about Teddy's engagement. She confesses that she knew all along that Teddy was engaged and gives Teddy her ring back. The girls enter in their bathing suits - ready for the Miss Camp Karefree Contest. Gussie, one of the available girls rushes forward and shows Chick that she has no ring on her finger. He asks her out and plans on cheering for her in the contest. Teddy, hurt, decides that she too will enter the contest, in retaliation. Pinky is thrilled to have the chance to put the moves on Teddy ("Summer Afternoon"). Pinky naturally picks Teddy to win the contest. He shows her the gorgeous new dress. In return, she gives him a kiss, and in a jealous fit, Chick pushes Pinky into the pool. Kandel has Chick restrained and threatens to fire him. Pinky delights in watching this happen to Chick and laughs. Teddy, upset at seeing Chick humiliated, pushes Pinky into the pool. Nevertheless, Chick still leaves with Gussie and Teddy watches them go, crying.|$|E
