5000|$|Since {{the track}} grousers {{could not be}} stored on {{the rear of the}} turret anymore, <b>grouser</b> racks that could be {{attached}} to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early April 1943. The M10 initially lacked any provision for indirect fire. In May 1943, an azimuth indicator and gunner's quadrant were added to the M10. The <b>grouser</b> racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles. By late June 1943, it was realized that Fisher's initial counterweights were too heavy. Two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to 2,500 pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun. They resembled an upside-down [...] "duck bill" [...] shape when viewed from the side. To accommodate the new weights, the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical. In July 1943, the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production. The bosses on the glacis were retained. In late September 1943, a single M10 was tested with an Oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights, but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Grousers, {{sometimes}} called lugs, {{are recognized as}} a way to improve wheel performance and traction, but there have been, to date, no comprehensive guidelines for choosing <b>grouser</b> patterns. This work presents a quantitative expression for determining appropriate <b>grouser</b> spacing for rigid wheels. Past empirical studies have shown that increasing <b>grouser</b> height and number can improve performance, to a point. The newly proposed <b>grouser</b> spacing equation is based on observations that wheels with an inadequate number of grousers induce forward soil flow ahead of the wheel, and thus rolling resistance. The equation relates geometric wheel parameters (wheel radius, <b>grouser</b> height and spacing) and operating parameters (slip and sinkage), and predicts a maximum allowable <b>grouser</b> spacing (or, equivalently, a minimum number of grousers). Experiments with various <b>grouser</b> heights and numbers demonstrate good correspondence to the proposed equation, as increases in number of grousers beyond the predicted minimum number stop improving performance. A <b>grouser</b> spacing equation is particularly useful for designing efficient wheels. The proposed relation includes slip and sinkage, parameters that cannot be assumed constant or known a priori, but this work shows that wheels designed using the proposed equation are robust to changing operating scenarios even if they degrade beyond estimated nominal conditions.

40|$|Typical rovers with wheels {{equipped}} with conventional grousers {{are prone to}} getting stuck in unconsolidated sandy dune inclines as the wheels tend to sink into the sand. This phenomenon {{is caused by the}} motion of the <b>grouser</b> through the sand during {{the latter half of the}} rotation, in which the <b>grouser</b> pushes the sand from underneath the wheel upwards and towards the backside of the wheel. This creates a space that the wheel can sink into. To minimize sand movement and subsequent sinkage, we propose the concept of using an “assistive grouser”, which is attached to the side of a conventional rover wheel. The assistive <b>grouser</b> is designed to be able to autonomously maintain a uniform angle relative to the rover body independent of the rotation of the wheels. Rotating the wheel causes the assistive grousers to automatically penetrate into the sand slope surface at a constant angle of attack, thereby acting as an anchor and providing traction for the wheel. Maintaining a uniform <b>grouser</b> angle as opposed to a rotating motion also assists in extracting the <b>grouser</b> out of the sand without moving the sand towards the back of the wheel. Moreover, the angle of the assistive grousers is held constantly by a single dedicated motor, meaning that the angle of the assistive grousers can be optimized to provide the least amount of sinkage for each slope angle. The experimental results showed that for slope angles of 0 – 30 degrees, the rover {{equipped with}} the proposed assistive grousers experienced significantly less sinkage and consumed less current compared to the rover equipped with conventional grousers...|$|E

Precise information on their specific habitat requirements is needed if the coexistence of both species in exploited forests is to be maintained. We quantified winter habitat selection for both species in the upper part (1100 - 1600 m) of the Jura mountains (Switzerland). No preference for altitude or exposure could be detected. Capercaillie preferred open forests (including grazed forests) with a sparse canopy dominated by spruce (Picea abies) and fir (Abies alba), and avoided dense undercanopy and understorey, especially when dominated by spruce and beech (Fagus sylvatica). By contrast, hazel grouse preferred feeding sites with a dense understorey of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), willow (Salix sp.), beech and spruce.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>grouser</b> {{developed for the}} wheels of lunar exploration rovers to measure sinkage.

They display {{important}} morphological variation in their attachment apparatus and infect a broad host spectrum throughout a wide geographic range. Thus, they offer an interesting model to investigate {{to what extent}} the phenotypic variability of the attachment organ among congeners is related to host specificity, geographic/environmental components, or phylogeny. A geometric morphometric approach was carried out to analyse the shape variation of sclerotized structures of the attachment organ within 66 African species of the genus Cichlidogyrus. The interspecific shape comparison supports the presence of three main morphological configurations, each consisting of a given combination of particular sclerite shapes. Moreover, data emphasize strong coordination and integration (shape co-variation) among the different sclerites jointly forming the attachment organ. Although attachment apparatuses are usually considered {{to be the result of}} adaptative processes and must be adapted to the hosts and local environmental conditions, we found no relationship between these clusters and host specificity or geographical distribution. Nevertheless, <b>grous</b> are partially congruent with those obtained with the molecular phylogeny of a subset of species, suggesting a phylogenetic constraint rather than an adaptation to either hosts or environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{analyses of}} subsurface motions of soil beneath different traction devices and develops new explanations of traction processes of wheels operating in loose granular soil {{based on these}} observations. This dissertation shows how these findings are useful {{for the development of}} planetary rover mobility systems. Shear Interface Imaging Analysis (SIIA), is a new technique, developed as part of this thesis research. SIIA is employed for visualizing the effects of wheel operation on the soil beneath a rim, in richer detail than before possible. SIIA relies on high-speed imaging of sub-surface soil and on computer vision software to produce soil displacement fields, of high fidelity. The resulting data provides new insight and can reveal misconceptions about how wheels generate traction. Two comprehensive studies relying on SIIA are undertaken: the investigation of wheel <b>grouser</b> mechanics and the investigation of push-roll locomotion. Soil forward motion, at a wheel leading edge, is identified as a key behavior for the grousered wheels. As a result, an equation for <b>grouser</b> height/spacing relationship to achieve a higher performance <b>grouser</b> configuration is developed and validated. This expression relates <b>grouser</b> configuration to wheel parameters (wheel radius) and operational parameters (sinkage and slip). The soil mechanics behind Push-roll locomotion for high net traction and soft ground applications are presented. SIIA reveals that high thrust generated by push-roll locomotion is due to ground failure of the soil. Confirmation of the type of soil failure and of the application of operation in soft ground (where most vehicles would be embedded), brings forward the mobility gains of this non-typical locomotion mode and as a possible use for future planetary missions. Additionally, insight into fundamental traction processes such as thrust, sinkage and motion resistance, are discussed with experimental evidence from soil displacement fields. This research proves that accounting for soil motion is of the utmost importance for the understanding of traction in loose, granular soils. As a result of the specific technique utilized for directly studying soil motion, this research enables improved analysis and new design relevant to planetary rover mobility...|$|E

One hundred and thirty male students volunteered to be subjects in this study. Forty five students, however, were excluded because they were found to have eaten lunch an hour before the blood pressure measurement. Skinfold thickness at four places, biceps, triceps, subscapula, and iliac crest was measured. Percent body fat (%Fat), lean body mass (LBM), body weight, and Rohrer Index were determined as dependent variables concerning body composition. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and mean blood pressure were also determined as the variables on blood pressure. As a result of this study, the correlation coefficient between LBM and pulse pressure was found to be significant. Differences of systolic blood pressure between the below average and average groups and between the average and above average groups of %Fat were significant. Also, differences of pu 1 se pressure between the poor and below average <b>grous,</b> between the below average and the excellent groups, and between the average and the excellent groups of LBM were significant. Therefore, factors concerning body composition which influence blood pressure seem to be not only body weight and the amount of body fat but also LBM.

They were combined, if necessary, with non-adaptive neutral traits of the periphallic organs. These adaptive speciation traits are subtle and stable, they are more super than magic. We briefly review: (1) Are speciation traits really subtle? (2) Are speciation traits super or magic? (3) Why neutral traits are variable? (4) Why adaptive traits are stable? We survey the possible adaptive and neutral traits in the Nectopsyche genus. Our adaptive-neutral distinction has potential in character ranking to establish recent pass, contemporary and old historical divergences in coalescence. Applying the adaptive − neutral distinction, {{as well as the}} generality, locality and parsimony principles we have elaborated a character ranking sytem for the genus, for the species groups and for the species with a revised lineage structure in the Nectopsyche genus. Six species <b>grous</b> have been characterised and fourty four new species have been described and grouped in the four species groups. (1) N. candida species group: bonta, buzoga, dombora, flinti, garenoa, lenula, obla. (2) N. pavida species group: alma, bobita, capota, hasonla, kifela, kinilta, kurta, laposka, nemritka, nyaka, oliveri, poca, ritka, salka, silva, sima, terda, vagota, valla. (3) N. punctata species group: eka, kurtula, letra, padka, vezna. (4) N. gemma species group: bunka, eltera, flintorum, huzva, iva, kajla, nilta, pohoka, setfela, suta, taga, tarka, tomora. The species of N. argentata, N. cubana, N. gemmoides, N. jenseni, N. punctata and several unexamined taxa probably represent species complexes. An expected comprehensive revision of the entire genus is needed including forewing pattern with fine phenomics. Inevitable are the re-examination of the speciation traits of the old types and to scrutinise the species status of so called widely distributed species applying the fine phenomics of speciation traits...|$|R
30|$|Steam {{pretreatment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used physicochemical methods for pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass. Earlier, this method was known as steam explosion because of the belief that an explosive action on the biomass was required to prepare them for hydrolysis (Agbor et al. 2011). Due to the changes that occur during this process, this method is also called ‘auto hydrolysis.’ Steam pretreatment is typically a combination of mechanical forces (pressure drop) and chemical effects (autohydrolysis of acetyl groups of hemicellulose). In this process, biomass is subjected to high pressure (0.7 – 4.8  MPa) saturated steam at elevated temperatures (between 160 and 260  °C) for few seconds to minutes which causes hydrolysis and release of hemicellulose. The steam enters the biomass expanding the walls of fibers leading to partial hydrolysis and increasing the accessibility of enzymes for cellulose. After this the pressure is reduced to atmospheric condition (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka 2016). During this pretreatment, the hydrolysis of hemicellulose into glucose and xylose monomers is carried out by the acetic acid produced from the acetyl groups of hemicellulose; hence this process is also termed as autohydrolysis (Mosier et al. 2005). The factors that affect steam pretreatment are temperature, residence time, biomass size, and moisture content (Rabemanolontsoa and Saka 2016). Wright (1988) found low temperature and longer residence time (190  °C for 10  min) better as compared to high temperature and lower residence time (270  °C for 1  min) due to less fermentation inhibitory product formation in the earlier process. Several biomasses have shown positive effects on pretreatment with steam such as poplar wood (Populus tremuloides) (<b>Grous</b> et al. 1986), pine chips, French maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), rice straw, bagasse, olive stones, giant miscanthus (Miscanthus giganteus), and spent Shiitake mushroom media (Jacquet et al. 2012). The efficiency of steam pretreatment can be effectively enhanced in the presence of catalysts such as H 2 SO 4, CO 2 or SO 2. Out of these catalysts, acid catalyst has been found to most successful in terms of hemicellulose sugar recovery, decreased production of inhibitory compounds and improved enzymatic hydrolysis. Steam pretreatment is found to be effective for the pretreatment of hardwoods and agricultural residues, though acid catalyst is added in case of soft woods for effective pretreatment. Limited use of chemicals, low energy requirement, no recycling cost and environment friendly are some of the advantages of steam pretreatment method. On the other hand, the possibility of formation of fermentation inhibitors at high temperature, incomplete digestion of lignin-carbohydrate matrix and the need to wash the hydrolysate which decreases the sugar yield by 20 % are few disadvantages associated with steam pretreatment (Agbor et al. 2011).|$|R
