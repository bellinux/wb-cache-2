5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E
50|$|After {{their failure}} to break into federal {{parliament}} in 2001, Unity largely shifted <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> local government, running a number of candidates for local councils in largely non-white areas, primarily in suburban Sydney. It did not run any candidates in the 2004 federal election.|$|R

5|$|With an {{increasing}} Third World presence {{and the failure}} of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly shifted <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> its ostensibly secondary goals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic development was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire loomed, Brazil had to turn <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> its {{southern}} frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay which pitted its political parties against one another. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and the looting of their Uruguayan properties. Brazil's progressive cabinet decided to intervene and dispatched an army, which invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War. The dictator of nearby Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, took advantage of the Uruguayan situation in late 1864 by attempting to establish his nation as a regional power. In November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War, and then invaded Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The Germanic tribes, by contrast, {{remained}} {{more isolated}} and fractious. Germany lay {{farther from the}} Roman domain and was well-protected by the strong natural barriers of the Alps, the Rhine and Danube rivers, and the dense forests. Therefore, the expanding Roman Empire turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> Gaul first, culminating in Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul in 50 BC.|$|R

5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, the Relief Party turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 {{was seen by}} the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E
5|$|In early May, the HV {{launched}} a successful offensive, codenamed Operation Flash, against a RSK-held part of western Slavonia in Croatia. The move caused the VRS to reorient <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Orašje pocket, the only territory outside its control between the Derventa–Brčko {{road and the}} Sava River. The shift of VRS focus to Orašje {{may have been the}} result of a desire to retaliate for the defeat suffered by the RSK in western Slavonia, or meant as a quick land-grab before a peace settlement was accepted.|$|E
5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog {{had not previously}} shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
50|$|The {{paper was}} noted for <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> the {{activities}} of the powerful and wealthy, its interest in foreign affairs, and in literary and artistic events. It began regular printing of notices of plays, concerts, and operas in the early 20th century, and {{is said to have been}} the first daily paper in London to do this. Arthur Hervey (1855-1922) was the paper's music critic between 1892 and 1908.|$|R
50|$|After the Third War, the Legion {{tried to}} destroy the Frozen Throne and kill Ner'zhul to {{eliminate}} the Scourge threat due to the Lich King's defection from the Legion. After the failure of Illidan Stormrage to defeat the Lich King in The Frozen Throne, Illidan returned to Outland and no longer serves the Legion.

50|$|In 2000 {{the company}} {{changed its name}} to Circadence and turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> {{software}} that could speed up website performance, though it maintained an entertainment division that kept the name VR-1. Circadence sold off the division to Pacific Century CyberWorks Japan Co in February 2001 for a 5.3% stake in Pacific Century CyberWorks. Circadence also received an investment from a pool of investors to transition the company to alter its focus to WAN Optimization.|$|R
5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the development of the Little Boy, a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.|$|E
5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> detail and realism {{in the area}} of {{military}} tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Dinwiddie Court House {{occurred}} on March 31, {{and is considered}} a Confederate victory. The same Union force that was driven back earlier was again sent toward Five Forks. The remaining portion of Crook's 2nd Division met the Confederates further west at Chamberlain's Creek. During this time, infantry {{under the command of}} Union General Gouverneur Kemble Warren, located east of Sheridan's army, was driven back. The attacking Confederate force then turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Sheridan—Sheridan's cavalry had to face two enemy infantry divisions and a cavalry.|$|E

50|$|The 81st TFS {{moved to}} Zweibrucken Air Base, West Germany, on 12 June 1971. Though it {{remained}} assigned to 50th TFW, 81st TFS was {{detached from the}} wing's operational control and attached to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing. Following these changes, the wing settled into a more routine operations tempo and returned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> maintaining combat readiness. Within two years, USAFE redesignated 496th FIS as a tactical fighter squadron. The squadron converted to the F-4E Phantom, retiring its F-102s.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{the question of}} a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E
5|$|As Brazil {{had been}} pacified {{after the end}} of the last {{rebellion}} (the Praieira revolt), Brazil's government turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the growing tensions with its neighbor to the south, the Argentine Confederation. Paulino Soares, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to forge alliances with Uruguay and Paraguay, nations which also saw a threat in the ambitions of Juan Manuel de Rosas, dictator of the Argentine Confederation. An army commanded by Caxias crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. More than a year had passed since Honório Hermeto returned from Pernambuco, when he was named by Paulino Soares as special minister plenipotentiary in the Plata region. On 12 October 1851, Honório Hermeto and an Uruguayan envoy signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro setting the international border between Brazil and Uruguay. The agreement required Uruguay to abandon some claims to disputed areas in exchange for Brazilian aid in the war against Argentina.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> its {{southern}} frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory as a prelude to an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
50|$|St Brendans {{was founded}} in 1956, in the Old Botwell Paris Hall, in Middlesex, by Eugene Callaghan. Despite {{starting}} as a hurling and football club, by 1960, the club had turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> primarily <b>to</b> football.|$|R

5|$|Australian {{operations}} in Phuoc Tuy province continued throughout {{the remainder of}} 1967, and although they were largely successful at the tactical level, the Viet Cong continued {{to be able to}} enter most of the villages in the province, and were causing increasingly heavy Allied casualties with mines lifted from the controversial barrier minefield laid by the Australians. Operation Santa Fe, a further large-scale joint US-Australian operation, took place between October and November, but it too ended with only limited success in comparison to the resources committed. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian {{operations in}} the province which had increased the population's sense of security. As a result, 1 ATF now turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> expanding its area of operations.|$|E
5|$|From the Communist perspective, {{even though}} South Vietnam {{was plagued by}} {{political}} instability, it still had a strong army to resist the Viet Cong. So shortly after the Binh Gia campaign, North Vietnamese leaders reached a resolution to launch a summer offensive, to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military. During {{the early stages of}} the Communist summer campaign, Viet Cong forces in Quảng Ngãi Province successfully destroyed a South Vietnamese task force, led by the ARVN 51st Infantry Regiment, in the village of Ba Gia. Following their victory at Ba Gia, the National Liberation Front (known in America as Viet Cong) turned <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Mekong Delta region. To prepare for their next offensive, Major-General Le Trong Tan was given the task of directing Viet Cong military operations in the provinces of Phước Long, Bình Phước. For the first time, the newly created Viet Cong 273rd and 274th Regiments was ordered to join the 271st and 272nd Regiments on the battlefield; their objective was to destroy the regular units of the South Vietnamese military, and eliminate the strategic hamlets to enlarge what North Vietnam viewed as 'liberated zones'.|$|E
5|$|Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, {{now turned}} <b>its</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the Klaipėda Region, then held by Lithuania. In April 1938, Hitler stated that {{control of the}} Port of Klaipėda (German: Memel) and its {{surrounding}} area was Germany's second-most important issue, following {{the status of the}} Sudeten area. In the event of armed hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, German troops were to defend and occupy the Klaipėda region and significant portions of western Lithuania. The Polish ambassador to Nazi Germany, Józef Lipski, was informed of these plans. The Poles agreed to cooperate with German troops and to respect German interests in Klaipėda if such an armed conflict were to arise. However, in Hitler's assessment, an immediate bid for Klaipėda was impolitic; he wished {{to maintain the status quo}} until more time had passed after the Anschluss. The German suggestion was that Lithuania concede to the Polish demands.|$|E
50|$|Bomber Command {{commenced}} its concentrated {{offensive against}} Berlin in November 1943, in {{what became known}} as The Battle of Berlin. NJG 1 were heavily involved in the increasingly effective night fighter riposte to the massed deep penetration raids, and scored heavily up until late March 1944, when the RAF switched <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> short range, tactical targets ready for the forthcoming invasion. Hpt. Von Bonin of II./NJG 1 claimed 5 kills on the night of 25/26 November 1943, and Obfw. Vinke of IV. Gruppe based in Leeuwarden, scored 5 on 19/20 February 1944.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, the Black Sea Fleet was {{bringing}} in reinforcements {{in spite of}} the Luftwaffe. On 12 June the cruiser Molotov and destroyer Bditel'nyy brought in 2,314 soldiers, 190 tons of ammunition and 28 artillery pieces. The Luftwaffe turned <b>its</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> these convoys. On 13 June it sank the transports Gruzyia, TSch-27, patrol boat SKA-092, motor boat SP-40, five barges and a floating crane.
