25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found {{nothing wrong with the}} navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route <b>instruction</b> <b>book,</b> have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|E

500|$|Butterfield played Hohner harmonicas (and {{endorsed}} them). He {{preferred the}} diatonic ten-hole Marine Band model. He wrote a harmonica <b>instruction</b> <b>book,</b> Paul Butterfield Teaches Blues Harmonica Master Class, {{a few years}} before his death (it was not published until 1997). [...] In it, he explains various techniques, demonstrated on an accompanying CD. [...] Butterfield played mainly in cross-harp, or second position. He occasionally used a chromatic harmonica. Reportedly left-handed, he held the harmonica in a manner opposite that of a right-handed player, i.e., in his right hand, upside down (with the low notes to the right), using his left hand for muting effects.|$|E
500|$|In March 1536, Calvin {{published}} {{the first edition}} of his Institutio Christianae Religionis or Institutes of the Christian Religion. The work was an apologia or defense of his faith and a statement of the doctrinal position of the reformers. [...] He also intended it to serve as an elementary <b>instruction</b> <b>book</b> for anyone interested in the Christian faith. [...] The book was the first expression of his theology. Calvin updated the work and published new editions throughout his life. [...] Shortly after its publication, he left Basel for Ferrara, Italy, where he briefly served as secretary to Princess Renée of France. [...] By June he was back in Paris with his brother Antoine, who was resolving their father's affairs. Following the Edict of Coucy, which gave a limited six-month period for heretics to reconcile with the Catholic faith, Calvin decided that there was no future for him in France. In August he set off for Strasbourg, a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire and a refuge for reformers. [...] Due to military manoeuvres of imperial and French forces, he was forced to make a detour to the south, bringing him to Geneva.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} tour of India in 1933–34, Jardine became engaged and on [...] 1934, married Irene [...] "Isla" [...] Margaret Peat in London. She had met Jardine at {{shooting}} parties at her father's Norfolk home. According to Gerald Howat, Jardine's marriage was the probable reason for his giving up playing first-class cricket. Jardine's father-in-law was keen for him to pursue his law career but he instead continued as a bank clerk and began {{to work as a}} journalist. He reported on the 1934 Ashes for the Evening Standard. His writing for the press, and in a follow-up book on the series, was critical of selectors but less so of the players. In 1936, he penned Cricket: how to succeed, which was written as an <b>instruction</b> <b>book</b> for the National Union of Teachers. There was a possibility of his going to Australia as a journalist to cover the M.C.C. tour of 1936–37, to the dismay of Hore-Ruthven, but nothing came of this. With alterations to the law in 1935, changing the lbw law and preventing Bodyline bowling, Jardine became increasingly disillusioned with top-level cricket. He had grown uncomfortable with the nationalism stirred up by Tests, the greed of clubs and the large public following of individual players, particularly Bradman. At the same time, Jardine seemed to be ostracised by cricket writers and commentators, who simply ignored him. For example, Wisden made no mention of his retirement. Christopher Douglas believes that Jardine was used as a scapegoat for Bodyline once the M.C.C. stopped supporting the tactic and that a stigma was attached to him {{for the rest of his}} life and beyond.|$|E
