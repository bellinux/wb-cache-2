40|$|We {{have created}} a <b>flat</b> <b>piling</b> of disks in a {{numerical}} experiment using the Distinct Element Method (DEM) by depositing them under gravity. In the resulting pile, we then measured increments in stress and strain that were associated with a small decrease in gravity. We first describe the stress {{in terms of the}} strain using isotropic elasticity theory. Then, from a micro-mechanical view point, we calculate the relation between the stress and strain using the mean strain assumption. We compare the predicted values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio with those that were measured in the numerical experiment.

The sheets of paper will be separated by blowing air between them.|$|R

40|$|A {{small-scale}} {{physical modelling}} method {{was developed to}} study the movement of clay during pile installation. The clay was simulated using a mixture of amorphous silica and mineral oil, which becomes almost transparent when the refractive indices of the oil and the silica are well matched. After adding reflective particles and consolidating the mixture in a transparent container, cylindrical model piles were driven vertically at the centre. A vertical section aligned with the pile centreline was illuminated by a laser light sheet, and a sequence of digital images was recorded. These were analysed using particle image velocimetry, and the complete displacement distribution during the pile installation was obtained. Notwithstanding some discrepancies at shallow depths, the observed displacements generally showed fairly good agreement with the theoretical predictions of the shallow strain path method (SSPM) once the effect of some soil trapped beneath the <b>flat</b> <b>pile</b> tip was taken into account. Normalisation of the horizontal and vertical components of movement employing both the pile length and radius, based on SSPM theory, was shown to be valid.

50|$|The volcanoes of {{the western}} Wrangell Mountains are less than 5 million years old with the {{youngest}} lava flows are probably as young as 50,000 years ago.

50|$|Rugs exist {{which are}} known to be woven in European manufactories as early as the mid sixteenth century, imitating the {{technique}} and, to some extent, the designs of Oriental rugs. In Sweden, <b>flat</b> and <b>pile</b> woven rugs (called “rya”, or “rollakan”) became part of the folk art, and are still produced today, mostly in modern designs. In other countries, like Poland or Germany, the art of carpet weaving did not last long. In the United Kingdom, Axminster carpets were produced since the mid-eighteenth century. In France, the Savonnerie manufactory began weaving pile carpets by the mid-seventeenth centuries, but turned to European-style designs later on, which in turn influenced the Anatolian rug production during the “mecidi”, or “Turkish baroque” period. The Manchester-based company Ziegler & Co. maintained workshops in Tabriz and Sultanabad (now Arak) and supplied retailers such as Liberty & Company and Harvey Nichols. Their designs were modifications of the traditional Persian. A. C. Edwards was the manager of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers' operations in Persia from 1908 to 1924, and wrote one of the classical textbooks about the Persian carpet.|$|R

40|$|Quay {{walls are}} costly structures. The still growing sea {{transport}} market asks for more, {{bigger and more}} cost efficient quay walls. In this research, {{a new type of}} quay-wall is investigated: the ‘Tube-Cell Combi-Wall’. The Tube-Cell combi-wall consists of relative large diameter <b>piles</b> with <b>flat</b> sheet <b>piles</b> in between. The large diameter piles are the primary elements and are placed with relative large center-to-center distances. The <b>flat</b> sheet <b>piles</b> are the secondary elements and places in an arch shape, so that they will act as a kind of chain. The soil strength, in this research described by the ultimate lateral soil resistance (ULSR), is extensively considered. The Tube-Cell combi-wall is considered as a pile row, loaded in both lateral and axial direction. A new model that calculates the ULSR based on wedge failure of a pile row, subjected to both lateral and axial loads, is developed: the Rough wall Wedge Method for pile Rows (RWMR). In contrast to the current wedge models, this model includes an analytical approach to the influence of overlapping of wedges and vertical loading of the pile row. The model is validated using three dimensional finite element analyses. For computing the lateral soil resistance, the nodel interface stresses presented by Plaxis 3 D are integrated over the area of the pile-soil interface. Plaxis 3 D shows that the RWMR needs to be corrected due to occurrence of two phenomena: 1) curved slipsurfaces and 2) lateral shaft friction. It is observed that curved slipsurfaces occur, while straight are assumed by the RWMR. Further, the finite element analyses show that the ULSR is made up of two components: a normal- and a lateral shaft friction force. Therefore, increasing the vertical shaft friction will result in a decrease in lateral shaft friction capacity. On the end, it is observed that a vertical force will increase the ULSR of pile row, but not all shaft friction capacity can be used by the vertical component. The steel stresses are verified based on strains instead of stresses. It is concluded that the Tube-Cell combi-wall results in a reduction of the amount of steel of 7 % compared to a traditional combined wall. Based on this result, it is concluded that the Tube-Cell combi-wall has potential to compete with the traditional combined wall for the EMO quay-M 5. It needs to be noted that the production, transportation, installation and reliability of the Tube-Cell combi-wall is not considered. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

6000|$|... 4th December, 1854.--About {{dawn the}} caravan was loaded, and then {{proceeded}} along a tolerably level pathway through a thick growth of thorn trees towards a bluff hill. The steep was reached about 9 A.M., and the camels toiled up the ascent by a stony way, dropping their loads {{for want of}} ropes, and stumbling on their road. The summit, about 500 yards distant, was reached in an hour. At Yafir, {{on the crest of}} the mountains, the caravan halted two hours for refreshment. Lieutenant Speke describes the spot in the enthusiastic language of all travellers who have visited the Seaward Range of the Somali Hills. It appears, however, that it is destitute of water. About noon the camels were again loaded, and the caravan proceeded across the mountains by a winding road over level ground for four miles. This point commanded an extensive view of the Southern Plateau. In that direction the mountains drop in steps or terraces, and are almost bare; as in other parts rough and <b>flat</b> topped <b>piles</b> of stones, reminding the traveller of the Tartar Cairns, were observed. I remarked the same in the Northern Somali country; and in both places the people gave a similar account of them, namely, that they are the work of an earlier race, probably the Gallas. Some of them are certainly tombs, for human bones are turned up; in others empty chambers are discovered; and in a few are found earthern and large copper pots. Lieutenant Speke on one occasion saw an excavated mound propped up inside by pieces of timber, and apparently built without inlet. It was opened about six years ago by a Warsingali, in order to bury his wife, when a bar of metal (afterwards proved by an Arab to be gold) and a gold ring, similar to what is worn by women in the nose, were discovered. In other places the natives find, it is said, women's bracelets, beads, and similar articles still used by the Gallas.|$|R
