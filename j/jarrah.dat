5|$|In November 1999, <b>Jarrah</b> left Hamburg for Afghanistan, {{where he}} spent three months. While there, he met with al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in January 2000. <b>Jarrah</b> {{returned}} to Hamburg {{at the end of}} January and in February obtained a new passport containing no stamped records of his travels by reporting his passport as stolen.|$|E
5|$|The {{hijacking}} of Flight93 {{was led by}} Ziad <b>Jarrah,</b> {{a member}} of al-Qaeda. <b>Jarrah</b> was born in Lebanon to a wealthy family and had a secular upbringing. He intended to become a pilot and moved to Germany in 1996, enrolling at the University of Greifswald to study German. A year later, he moved to Hamburg and began studying aeronautical engineering at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. While living in Hamburg, <b>Jarrah</b> became a devout Muslim and associated with the radical Hamburg cell.|$|E
5|$|In May, <b>Jarrah</b> {{received}} a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons {{as well as}} training in hand-to-hand combat. <b>Jarrah</b> maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and {{with his family in}} Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks. This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if he backed out.|$|E
5|$|On Day 24, October 15, 2004, Boone {{sees that}} Shannon Rutherford's (Maggie Grace) {{relationship}} with Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews) {{is getting more}} personal. Boone tries to tell Sayid {{that he would be}} better off staying away from Shannon, but he is ignored.|$|E
5|$|The Hamburg cell in Germany {{included}} radical Islamists {{who eventually}} {{came to be}} key operatives in the 9/11 attacks. Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad <b>Jarrah,</b> Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Said Bahaji were all members of al-Qaeda's Hamburg cell.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and <b>Jarrah</b> Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (<b>jarrah)</b> in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea grows {{only in the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Geraldton Sandplains and <b>Jarrah</b> Forest biogeographic regions, inland {{from the}} coast but never east of the Darling Scarp. It occurs from Hill River near Badgingarra in the north, to Serpentine in the south. Most populations occur north of Moore River or south of Cannington, there being only a few {{scattered}} populations in between.|$|E
5|$|Charlie begins {{experiencing}} {{the effects of}} heroin withdrawal, while Jack becomes trapped in a cave. Meanwhile, Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) attempt to triangulate the signal of the French woman's broadcast. Charlie's involvement in his band Drive Shaft is featured in the episode's flashbacks.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few small}} populations of B.acanthopoda exist. Until 1999, it was thought to occur only in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region, in the {{vicinity}} of Woodanilling and Katanning; since then, a population has been found in the <b>Jarrah</b> Forest region, south of Darkan.|$|E
5|$|The western quoll or chuditch (D. geoffroii) is {{restricted}} to the <b>Jarrah</b> Forest and the central and southern Australian Wheatbelt. The western quoll {{is believed to have}} once occupied 70% of Australia, but because of cane toads, predators, habitat destruction, and poison baiting, it is now less abundant.|$|E
5|$|A badly wounded Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews) {{returns to}} camp {{and tells the}} others about Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), and that other people live on the island, besides the plane {{survivors}}. Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among <b>jarrah</b> woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in open woodland alongside such trees as <b>jarrah</b> (Eucalyptus marginata), candlestick banksia (Banksia attenuata), firewood banksia (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia (B. grandis).|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the time}} {{required}} to electrify the network the MTT continued to run horse trams until 1914. The cost of purchasing the tramways was funded by treasury bills and the act capped total construction costs at £12,000 per mile of track. £457,000 was let in contracts to March 1908 for construction of the tramways, trams, strengthening the Adelaide bridge over the River Torrens and associated works. The official ceremony starting track construction was in May 1908, with tracks originally laid on <b>Jarrah</b> sleepers.|$|E
5|$|Fox control {{programs}} have benefited the western quoll. The Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) monitors western quoll {{populations in the}} <b>Jarrah</b> Forest {{as part of its}} faunal management programs, as well as ongoing research into fox control, timber harvesting, and prescribed burning. The Perth Zoo has been monitoring a successful captive-breeding program since 1989. It has successfully bred more than 60 western quolls, most of which it transferred to Julimar Conservation Park, with proposals to translocate to Wheatbelt reserves and Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|Hurley finds {{beer in the}} van and a {{returned}} Sawyer outside. He learns from Sawyer that he and Kate escaped but Jack {{is still}} prisoner. Hurley is very {{optimistic about the future}} and volunteers Sawyer to help him fix the van. Meanwhile, Desmond refuses to tell Charlie when he will die. Kate informs Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews) of all she knows about the Others and then leaves, saying she's going to get help to rescue Jack, but she won't say from whom.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, a {{group of}} men from Hamburg, Germany arrived in Afghanistan, {{including}} Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad <b>Jarrah,</b> and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin Laden selected these men because they were educated, could speak English, and had experience living in the West. New recruits were routinely screened for special skills and al-Qaeda leaders consequently discovered that Hani Hanjour already had a commercial pilot's license. Mohammed later said that he helped the hijackers blend in by teaching them how to order food in restaurants and dress in Western clothing.|$|E
5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly {{continuous}} distribution there, often as the dominant species, and extends inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable sand in the narrow transition zone where tuart forest gives way to <b>jarrah</b> forest. With {{the exception of a}} population at Point Walter (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the Swan River.|$|E
5|$|Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) {{attempt to}} find where the French {{transmission}} is coming from, so they make a plan to turn on antennas at different points on the island {{in an attempt to}} triangulate the signal. At the caves, Charlie searches through Jack Shephard's (Matthew Fox) medicine supply for something to ease his heroin withdrawal. When Jack catches him, Charlie says he has a headache and wants aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Supply {{problems}} {{in the aftermath of}} the war meant that the concrete piers were founded on <b>jarrah</b> timber piles, rather than concrete. Additionally, a steel plate shortage forced the bridge's designers to avoid the use of steel to design the forms in the bridge's superstructure. Also, the cement that was used on the bridges had to be sourced from seven different sources, which led to different durability for different parts of the bridges.|$|E
5|$|The four hijackers {{checked in}} for the flight between 07:03 and 07:39Eastern Time. At 07:03, Ghamdi checked in without any luggage while Nami checked in two bags. At 07:24, Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07:39, <b>Jarrah</b> checked in without any luggage. Haznawi was the only hijacker {{selected}} for extra scrutiny by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint. None of the security checkpoint personnel reported anything unusual about the hijackers.|$|E
5|$|The hijackers {{stormed the}} aircraft's cockpit {{approximately}} 46 minutes after takeoff. The pilot and first officer took measures, such as de-activating the autopilot, to hinder the hijackers. However, Ziad <b>Jarrah,</b> who had {{trained as a}} pilot, {{took control of the}} aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh have claimed that the intended target was the Capitol Building.|$|E
5|$|The woodland's {{position}} on the transition zone between the wheatbelt and the <b>jarrah</b> forest determines amphibian populations, with several species existing at the eastern or western limits of their range. Herpetofauna includes the western marsh frog (or golden flecked burrowing frog, Heleioporus barycragus) which is generally restricted to the western Darling Range. There are at least 98 species of bird in the woodland, including the almost flightless malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{infertile}} {{areas of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of Eucalyptus marginata (<b>Jarrah)</b> with Corymbia calophylla (Marri) or Eucalyptus gomphocephala (Tuart), and an understorey of Banksia attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.menziesii (Firewood Banksia), B.grandis (Bull Banksia), Allocasuarina fraseriana (Western Sheoak) and Agonis flexuosa (Swan River Peppermint). The main shrub species would have been Jacksonia sternbergiana (Stinkwood), J.furcellata (Grey Stinkwood), Acacia cyclops (Coastal Wattle), Acacia saligna (Orange Wattle), Hibbertia species, Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Calothamnus quadrifidus (One-sided Bottlebrush) and Grevillea thelemanniana (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, Jacksonia sericea (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.|$|E
5|$|Before development, Hamersley was {{a remote}} {{district}} covered in <b>jarrah,</b> marri, banksia and other vegetation {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening and poultry farming. By 1974, six {{years after the first}} subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, a forerunner to today's Stirling Times. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.|$|E
5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and a Priority 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered <b>jarrah.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hanjour {{arrived in}} San Diego on December 8, 2000, joining Hazmi. They soon left for Arizona, where Hanjour took {{refresher}} training. Marwan al-Shehhi {{arrived at the}} end of May 2000, while Atta arrived on June 3, 2000, and <b>Jarrah</b> arrived on June 27, 2000. Bin al-Shibh applied several times for a visa to the United States, but as a Yemeni, he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa and remain as an illegal immigrant. Bin al-Shibh stayed in Hamburg, providing coordination between Atta and Mohammed. The three Hamburg cell members all took pilot training in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|Higgins {{performed}} at another concert {{in support of}} the Kimberley cause on 24 February 2013, with John Butler also appearing again, with the event held at The Esplanade in Fremantle, Western Australia. <b>Jarrah</b> Records, the record label that John Butler co-founded with The Waifs and Phil Stevens, worked in partnership with The Wilderness Society to stage the free event that also featured the band Ball Park Music and Dr Bob Brown, former leader of the Australian Greens Party. A march to protest the proposed gas refinery construction at James Price Point accompanied the free concert and campaign supporters were photographed with banners and placards.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} 4 {{days since the}} crash, September 25, 2004. Locke awakens from Oceanic Flight 815's crash and wiggles his toes, realizing that {{he is no longer}} paralyzed. Boars raid the body-filled fuselage, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the {{survivors}} discover that their food is exhausted, and wonder what to do. Locke reveals to hold many hunting knives, and suggests to go after the boar in the jungle. On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews) an antenna, which after being set will help triangulate the signal of the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or <b>jarrah.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Dr. Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) is {{featured in the}} episode's flashbacks, which reveal how Juliet got on the Island and why {{she went to the}} island in the first place. While on the island, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid <b>Jarrah</b> (Naveen Andrews) and Juliet trek back to the beach camp, and Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is struck by a mysterious illness. Andrew Divoff, William Mapother and Nestor Carbonell again reprise their recurring roles as Others; Mikhail Bakunin, Ethan Rom and Richard Alpert. The Island events in this episode take place between December 13 and December 15, 2004.|$|E
5|$|The grey currawong {{is found}} in wet and dry sclerophyll forests across its range, as well as mallee scrubland, and open areas such as parks or {{farmland}} near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies versicolor {{is more common in}} wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies arguta is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies melanoptera and intermedia are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies plumbea {{is found in}} various forests and woodlands, such as <b>jarrah</b> (Eucalyptus marginata), karri (E.diversicolor), tuart (E.gomphocephala) and wandoo (E.wandoo), as well as paperbark woodlands around swampy areas, and acacia shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle (Acacia rostellifera) and mulga (Acacia aneura) with Eremophila understory.|$|E
5|$|The species tolerates a {{range of}} soils, {{requiring}} only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels, although this species {{is also found in}} deep sand, sand over laterite, and sand over limestone. It also occurs in {{a range of}} vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of <b>Jarrah</b> forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling Scarp.|$|E
5|$|Under the Ayyubids, {{numerous}} Arab emirs {{held the}} post {{at any given}} time and were endowed with iqtaʿat. However, with the onset of Mamluk rule in Syria in 1260, it became a hereditary office consolidated by members of the Al Fadl dynasty, direct descendants of the Tayyid clan of Banu <b>Jarrah.</b> The office remained in the household of the Al Fadl emir, Isa ibn Muhanna, with occasional interruption, well into the early Ottoman era, during which Isa's descendants took over leadership of the Mawali tribe. Under the Ottomans, the role of the amir al-ʿarab appeared centered on providing camels to the state and guarding the Hajj pilgrim caravan in return for annual payments.|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii fruits singly or {{in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} grass or among leaf litter. It is {{typically}} found in eucalypt forest and subtropical rainforests. It has been recorded from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. In southwest Australia it is found in <b>jarrah</b> (Eucalyptus marginata) and karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) forests, where fruiting usually occurs in late autumn and early winter. The fungus appears to prefer disturbed ground, as it is often found at roadsides by forests, on lawns, grassy areas of parks, and among the slash of thinned karri regrowth forests. It is common in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) woodlands. M.clelandii also occurs in New Zealand, where it is found in mixed mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), kānuka (Kunzea ericoides), and kauri (Agathis) forest, and in conifer plantations. It is the smallest and most slender of the Macrolepiota species that occur there.|$|E
