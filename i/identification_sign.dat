5000|$|The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals {{divides the}} direction, position, or {{indication}} sign category into direction signs, which are only those giving distances or directions {{to a given}} location; road <b>identification</b> <b>signs</b> (also known as [...] "reassurance signs"), which repeat the name or number of the road, and place <b>identification</b> <b>signs,</b> which give {{the name of a}} landmark, such as a town, river or border. Unlike the other classes of sign, direction signs remain broadly undefined by the convention; the only restrictions given are that direction signs must be either a rectangle or an arrow shaped pentagon, and that they may not contain placenames in more than two languages. Additionally, direction signs on motorways must be blue or green, while temporary direction signs are yellow or orange.|$|R

25|$|Fire {{extinguisher}} <b>identification</b> <b>signs</b> {{are small}} signs {{designed to be}} mounted near a fire extinguisher, in order {{to draw attention to}} the extinguisher's location (e.g., if the extinguisher is on a large pole, the sign would generally be at the top of the pole so it can be seen from a distance). Such signs may be manufactured from a variety of materials, commonly self-adhesive vinyl, rigid PVC, and aluminum.|$|R

50|$|Signage {{systems are}} {{visually}} oriented information systems, consisting of signs, maps, arrows, color-codings systems, pictograms and different typographic elements. Signage systems differ from other methods of information presentation {{because they are}} typically used to guide people's passage through the physical world; road signs on a highway, station <b>identification</b> <b>signs</b> in a subway and overhead signs in an airport are all common examples of signage systems. The act of following a signage system is known as wayfinding, waysigning or signposting.|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the time}} when the ancients, {{including}} the Mongol nations have developed into relative groups, origins, and ethnic groups, the symbol and belief of a clan have emerged, and a custom to distinguish their origins and relatives have been established. Consequently, when labor distributions within clans began to develop and people started to manage an economy, various tamgas, drawings, notes and earmarks have been used as an <b>identification</b> <b>sign</b> for labor instruments and utilities as well as in domestication of animals. Every time the clan branched off due to internal clashes, the number of derivative tamghas been gradually developed into personal, family, lineage, khans, and state tamghas. Those new tamghas were created through adding new markings on the original tamgha, in order to conserve the tradition. In the Mongol Empire a Tamgha was a seal placed on taxed items, and by extension, a tax on commerce.(and see Eastern Europe below) ...|$|E

Questions of {{identification}} of the mortgage devices (MD) on tunnel diodes which are in a waiting mode or work for record in memory of a chip, by means of nonlinear radars are considered. Conditions of change of a ratio on opposite between levels of spectral components of a scattered signal when sounding by the nonlinear radar of the considered class of mortgage devices are investigated. Inverse change of this ratio significantly worsens reliability of an <b>identification</b> <b>sign</b> of nonlinear scatterers based on the ratio of levels of multiple harmonics of a response signal. It is shown that a N-like form of the volt-ampere characteristic (VAC) of the nonlinear devices which {{are a part of}} the scatterer, amplitude of the induced signal and shift of a working point to VAC are the reasons of inversion in the ratio of levels of harmonics of the reradiated signal. Influence of a VAC form of the tunnel diode on reliability {{of identification}} of the MD introduction of the approximating dimensionless coefficients in the way ? and ? is analyzed. It is offered to use new variables not only for the characteristic of a curve form, but also for an assessment of reliability of MD identification based on the ratio of harmonics levels of the unmasking signal in general. The analysis of an <b>identification</b> <b>sign</b> of scatterers based on the ratio of levels of multiple harmonicas by means of parameters also allows to minimize influence of unreliable operating modes of nonlinear radars on efficiency of carrying out search actions????????, ???
