2500|$|Mourners {{packed the}} Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church on January 2, 2007, to pay final respects. Monsignor Stanley Sliwiak officiated {{at the funeral}} mass. In a eulogy, Treviño's son, David Vidal Treviño, Sr. (born 1958), said that his father taught him that [...] "the only {{requirement}} in overcoming professional jealousy was in doing the very best {{you know how to}} do." [...] David Treviño added that his father [...] "made hard decisions and embodied the true spirit of leadership. His style pushed everyone to do more, to excel, and to do it better." [...] He went on to add that [...] "when someone had something unkind or false to say about Dad, I argued with him that he needed to respond because in the absence of truth, people might believe the lies that were being said about him. [...] But he chose to keep quiet and <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had lived his life in such a manner so that anyone who really knew him would not believe it." [...] About politics, David Treviño mentioned that his father [...] "didn’t regret political differences with those friends he respected, but he did regret that their philosophies sometimes kept them apart." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his motto was, Get {{good men}} and treat them well.|$|E
60|$|REGINALD [bitterly] She <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it {{was only}} that she had {{exhausted}} my conversation.|$|E
2500|$|While studying, Gaudron {{attempted}} to obtain articles of clerkship (then {{five years in}} duration), but was not successful. She later said, [...] "Many distinguished lawyers {{took a lot of}} trouble and effort <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it was not their policy to take on women as articled clerks." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were now}} riding through a vast wood, and Phineas found himself delightfully {{established}} {{by the side of}} Violet Effingham. [...] "Mr. Ratler has been <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he must have nineteen next session. Now, if I were you, Mr. Finn, I would decline to be counted up in that way as one of Mr. Ratler's sheep." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{a slight}} {{wave of his}} hand, as though <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he could not enter the old place, he turned away. As I looked after his figure, {{crossing}} the waste in the moonlight, I saw him turn his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea, and pass on, looking at it, until he was a shadow in the distance.|$|R
60|$|I met {{the ladies}} {{afterwards}} in Lausanne. They {{told me they}} had been condemned to a fine of forty francs apiece. They also <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they had not the slightest intention of paying it.|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. In {{that case}} I {{certainly}} won't {{tell you whether}} I agree with you or not. But I will put another question. You have <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> criticism is a creative art. What future has it? ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} room all by itself on the top floor. He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it had been his studio. At one time Harold used to do a bit of {{painting}} in an amateur way.|$|E
6000|$|We {{began by}} washing a certain patch of gravel and {{obtained}} results which seemed really astonishing. So remarkable were they that on publication the shares rose to 10s. premium. Jacob and Co. {{took advantage of}} this opportunity to sell quite half of their bonus holding <b>to</b> eager applicants, <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they did so not for personal profit, which they scorned, but [...] "to broaden {{the basis of the}} undertaking by admitting fresh blood." ...|$|R
60|$|Here Hans {{was stopped}} by guards, Billali <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he must await my return, an order which he obeyed unwillingly enough. Then I went on down the narrow passage, lined as before by guards who stood silent as statues, {{and came to the}} {{curtains}} at the end. Before these at a motion from Billali, who did not seem to dare to speak in this place, I stood still and waited.|$|R
6000|$|While we were waiting, Tom Lokins, who was harpooner of the boat, sat {{just behind}} me {{with all his}} irons ready. He took this {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> by a [...] "hundred-barrel fish" [...] is meant a fish that will yield a hundred-barrels of oil. He further informed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> such a fish was a big one, though {{he had seen a}} few in the North-west Seas that had produced upwards of two hundred-barrels.|$|R
60|$|And she <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> one of them—the {{long one}} {{on the top of}} the pile, on the table over there—seemed to contain ugly inferences {{directed}} at herself in a menacing way. She begged me to read it and see what I could make of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understood}} {{from our}} friend here," [...] said the Altrurian, nodding toward me, [...] "that you had broken {{only with the}} political tradition of Europe in your Revolution; and he has <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you do not hold all kinds of labor in equal esteem; but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I. The Augusta {{has just}} <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> as {{we seem to}} be such very good friends, and to talk {{together}} so much alone, doubtless, she supposed, upon matters of religion, there could be no person more suitable than such a good Christian as myself to fill that holy office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, papa. She told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Frederic Aylmer was to {{have all}} her property. She <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{everything}} <b>that</b> she meant to do, and I {{thought that she was}} right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I am a mate," [...] giggled Johnson, [...] "and {{you don't}} catch me {{shipping}} noways else. But I'll tell you what: I believe I {{can get you}} Arty Nares. You seen Arty; first-rate navigator, and {{a son of a}} gun for style." [...] And he proceeded <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Nares, who had the promise of a fine barque in six months, after things had quieted down, was in the meantime living very private, and would be pleased to have a change of air.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939 Mikhail Bulgakov {{organized}} a private reading of The Master and Margarita to his close circle of friends. Yelena Bulgakova remembered 30 years later, [...] "When he finally finished reading that night, he said: 'Well, tomorrow I am taking the novel to the publisher!' {{and everyone was}} silent", [...] "...Everyone sat paralyzed. Everything scared them. P. (P. A. Markov, {{in charge of the}} literature division of MAT) later at the door fearfully tried <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> trying <b>to</b> publish the novel would cause terrible things", she wrote in her diary (14 May 1939).|$|R
6000|$|... "Not there!" [...] said I. [...] "How {{about the}} consul's tariff, if they don't keep their {{part of the}} {{engagement}}?" [...] But Joseph <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> their part of the engagement really amounted to this,--that we should ride into their country without molestation, provided that such and such payments were made.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I {{in a fit}} {{state to}} {{encounter}} my fellow-beings?" [...] she asked. [...] "I forget which way it is--but they find black animals very rarely have coloured babies--it may be the other way round. I have had it so often <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is very stupid of me to have forgotten again." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{he remembered}} his twenty-franc piece. He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had that piece of French gold for {{something}} like three years. He used to carry it about with him {{as a sort of}} reserve in case of accident. Anybody is liable to have his pocket picked--a quite different thing from a brazen and insulting robbery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you shall}} be our interpreter," [...] said the Scarecrow, [...] "and <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> this Pumpkinhead all that I say, and also <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> all <b>that</b> he says. Is this {{arrangement}} satisfactory?" [...] he asked, turning toward his guest.|$|R
60|$|Now I understood. The Mahar who {{had been}} my {{involuntary}} companion upon my return to the outer world was Tu-al-sa. This {{was the first time}} that I had learned the lady's name. I thanked fate that I had not left her upon the sands of the Sahara--or put a bullet in her, as I had been tempted to do. I was surprised to discover that gratitude was a characteristic of the dominant race of Pellucidar. I could never think of them as aught but cold-blooded, brainless reptiles, though Perry had devoted much time in <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> owing <b>to</b> a strange freak of evolution among all the genera of the inner world, this species of the reptilia had advanced to a position quite analogous to that which man holds upon the outer crust.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said Miss Emmerson, with {{a little}} curiosity--"I wish you would try and <b>explain</b> this {{difference}} <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> I may comprehend the distinctions that you are fond of making." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{made one}} false arrest," [...] {{continued}} Tictocq. [...] "I was passing two finely dressed gentlemen on the street, {{when one of}} them remarked that he had 'stole his socks.' I handcuffed him and dragged him to a lighted store, when his companion <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was somewhat intoxicated and his tongue was not entirely manageable. He had been speaking of some business transaction, and what he intended to say was that he had 'sold his stocks.' ...|$|E
60|$|Powell <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{no sound}} did or perhaps could reach {{him from the}} saloon. The first sign--and we must {{remember}} that he was using his eyes for all they were worth--was an unaccountable movement of the curtain. It was wavy and very slight; just perceptible in fact to the sharpened faculties of a secret watcher; for it can't be denied that our wits are much more alert when engaged in wrong-doing (in which one mustn't be found out) than in a righteous occupation.|$|E
60|$|Kantos Kan <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{at the end}} of the day one {{of these}} prisoners would gain freedom and the others would lie dead about the arena. The winners in the various {{contests}} of the day would be pitted against each other until only two remained alive; the victor in the last encounter being set free, whether animal or man. The following morning the cages would be filled with a new consignment of victims, and so on throughout the ten days of the games.|$|E
6000|$|Tuesday, May 4th.--"How strange is {{this whole}} {{situation}} between you and me," [...] said Middleton, as they went up the winding pathway that led towards the house. [...] "Shall I ever understand it? Do you mean ever <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me?</b> <b>That</b> I should find you here with that old man,[2] so mysterious, apparently so poor, yet so powerful! What [is] his relation to you?" ...|$|R
60|$|What I {{observed}} myself, {{and what}} la bella Carolina told <b>me,</b> united <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> master had now set {{his mind on}} curing mistress of her fanciful terror. He was all kindness, but he was sensible and firm. He reasoned with her, that to encourage such fancies was to invite melancholy, if not madness. That it rested with herself to be herself. That if she once resisted her strange weakness, so successfully as to receive the Signor Dellombra as an English lady would receive any other guest, it was for ever conquered. To make an end, the signore came again, and mistress received him without marked distress (though with constraint and apprehension still), and the evening passed serenely. Master was so delighted with this change, and so anxious to confirm it, that the Signor Dellombra became a constant guest. He was accomplished in pictures, books, and music; and his society, in any grim palazzo, would have been welcome.|$|R
5000|$|On September 15, 2008 Monchy {{announced}} that the group would be breaking up. He attributed the decision to split solely to Alexandra saying [...] "The decision was Alexandra's. I still don't know the reasons why, only that when I was informed about this, the reasons were not <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and <b>that</b> this occurred while {{we were on a}} European tour, specifically, in Milan, Italy." [...] He disputed rumors that the split was over money.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't seem to {{have come}} across {{anything}} down here which--er--particularly attracts Mrs.--Mrs. Wenham Gardner," [...] Mr. Dowling went on, taking up a little sheaf of papers from the desk. [...] "I thought, perhaps, that the Bryanston Square house might have suited, {{but it seems that}} it is too small, far too small. Mrs. Gardner is used to entertaining, and has <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she has a great many friends always coming and going {{from the other side of}} the water. She requires, apparently, twelve bedrooms, besides servants' quarters." ...|$|E
60|$|They drifted {{towards the}} kitchen garden--it {{was the time}} of strawberries--and the {{remainder}} of the talk I lost. I noticed that for some days afterwards Veronica displayed a tendency to shutting herself up in the schoolroom with a copybook, and that lead pencils had a way of disappearing from my desk. One in particular that had suited me I determined if possible to recover. A subtle instinct guided me to Veronica's sanctum. I found her thoughtfully sucking it. She <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she was writing a little play.|$|E
60|$|But {{one other}} day had intervened when, {{early in the}} morning as we were going to breakfast, Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the astounding news that a terrible murder had been {{committed}} for which Mr. George had been apprehended and was in custody. When he told us that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the murderer's apprehension, I did not in my first consternation understand why; but a few more words <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the murdered person was Sir Leicester's lawyer, and immediately my mother's dread of him rushed into my remembrance.|$|E
6000|$|... "He tried <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how <b>that</b> quarrel had arisen, {{and he said}} that, so far as {{he could}} judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on England's part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly, and to beguile the time." ...|$|R
60|$|SIGSBY The arrangement, as he <b>explained</b> it <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> was <b>that</b> {{the whole}} thing was to end with the polling. It was to have been a mere joke, a mere ballon d'essai. The mistake he made was {{thinking}} he could depend on her.|$|R
40|$|In my PhD research, I {{study how}} elderly people {{deal with the}} ageing process in {{relation}} to everyday life. The participants in my study are between eighty and ninety years old and living in their ordinary homes in an urban environment in the southwest of Sweden. My research started as an interest in ageing, health and the ageing body. But in making my interviews and observations, the participants clearly {{did not think of}} ageing, nor health in relation to the body as much as I had expected. Certainly, they mentioned aching knees, stiff backs and failing eyesight, but moreover they talked about things; objects that were part of everyday life. They strived for and wanted to live life as usual, following their everyday routines that included everyday objects. The staircase The staircase offers a clear example of an object that could become problematic and therefore made aware and visible. A married couple is looking for a new flat. They <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> they are perfectly comfortable in their present home, but they live on the first floor, meaning they have a short staircase from the front door to their flat. “We are not getting any younger”, the wife tells me, “and we must think ahead, perhaps we won´t {{be able to use the}} stairs an...|$|R
