5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>turbine.</b> A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>turbine</b> (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{difference}} between the XF3-400 and the standard F3-30 is the inclusion of an afterburner.
