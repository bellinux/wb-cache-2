5|$|The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> (Uratelornis chimaera) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> family Brachypteraciidae, placed in the {{monotypic}} genus Uratelornis. Endemic to arid spiny forests near the coast in southwestern Madagascar, this <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> occurs at extremely low population densities throughout its habitat. This species requires shade and a deep layer of leaves on the ground, and it is absent from parts of the spiny forest lacking these features. It has no recognized subspecies, and its closest relative is the scaly <b>ground</b> <b>roller.</b> The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> is the only <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> to definitively display sexual dimorphism (differences in plumage or size between sexes). It is a medium-sized bird with a plump silhouette and a long tail. The upperparts are dark brown with black streaks while the underparts are light gray. The white throat is framed by black malar stripes and a black breastband, and a white stripe is present {{at the base of}} the bill. Sky-blue feathers are visible at the edge of the wings and the tail. Calls are rarely made outside the breeding season, though multiple courtship calls are made.|$|E
5|$|The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, {{it either}} freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground rollers are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground rollers. When calling, this <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> bobs its head and raises its tail. The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E
5|$|Classified as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN due to ongoing habitat destruction and {{a decline in}} the quality of the remaining habitat, the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> {{is believed to be the}} most threatened species of <b>ground</b> <b>roller.</b> Thirty percent of its already small habitat area was degraded between the mid-1970s and 2000. Slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, logging, and cattle grazing have all contributed to the loss of habitat. As of 2012, no reserves protect any portion of its habitat, and as a result its habitat has been described as the area of Madagascar most in need of conservation efforts. It is also threatened by both hunting and egg-collecting. In addition to humans, dogs hunt this species, and the introduced black rat is a nest predator. This <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> is capable of tolerating some habitat disturbance, but requires a suitable amount of shade and leaf litter to continue living in the area. Although it was fairly common at the beginning of the twentieth century, its population went into decline and it was considered rare by the 1960s. As of 2012, the estimated population of the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> is between 9,500 and 32,700 birds and declining.|$|E
5000|$|... mtDNA {{analyses}} {{confirmed the}} systematics {{of this group}} but indicated that merging Geobiastes into Brachypteracias, as was usually done since the 1960s, should be reversed at least until a more comprehensive review (e.g. supported by fossils) is possible (Kirchman et al., 2001). Also, 2000-year-old subfossil remains of <b>ground</b> <b>rollers</b> are known from the Holocene of Ampoza (Goodman, 2000); Eocene remains from Europe at first tentatively assigned to this family were later recognized as quite distinct (Mayr & Mourer-Chauviré 2000). Presently, {{there is no indication}} that <b>ground</b> <b>rollers</b> ever occurred anywhere outside Madagascar (Mayr & Mourer-Chauviré, 2001).|$|R
50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>rollers</b> are a {{small family}} of {{non-migratory}} near-passerine birds restricted to Madagascar. They {{are related to the}} kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers. They most resemble the latter group, and are sometimes considered a sub-family of the true rollers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>rollers</b> {{share the}} {{generally}} crow-like size and build {{of the true}} rollers, ranging from 25-49 centimetres in length, and also hunt reptiles and large insects. They are more terrestrial than the Coracidae species, and this is reflected in their longer legs and shorter, more rounded wings.|$|R
5|$|As the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> {{is remarkably}} silent and {{difficult}} to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E
5|$|Between October and January, and peaking in November, {{the species}} {{normally}} lays two smooth, white eggs, though sometimes it lays three or four. The incubation period and fledging {{time of this}} <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> is unknown. After the young fledge, {{they live in a}} family group of four to five birds until approximately February, at which point the family disperses.|$|E
5|$|These ground rollers feed {{primarily}} on invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, and worms, which they find by searching through deep leaf litter or by remaining still and watching attentively. The <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> primarily runs through its habitat on its strong legs, as its wings are relatively weak. It is a monogamous species, and it defends a territory during the breeding season of October to February. It digs a tunnel in the sand, {{at the end}} of which is a wider chamber where it makes its nest out of leaves and earthy pellets. Two to four eggs are laid. After the chicks fledge, the birds continue living in family groups until at least February before dispersing more widely across the scrubland.|$|E
50|$|Ranomafana National Park is in {{the southeastern}} part of Madagascar in Haute Matsiatra and Vatovavy-Fitovinany. With more than 41,600 {{hectares}} (161 square miles) of tropical rainforest, {{it is home to}} several rare species of flora and fauna including the golden bamboo lemur, the greater bamboo lemur, black and white ruffed lemur and Milne-Edwards sifaka, and over 130 species of frogs. Pitta like <b>ground</b> <b>rollers,</b> blue vangas, short-legged <b>ground</b> <b>rollers</b> and brown mesites can be seen. The park was established in 1991 with the purpose of conserving the unique biodiversity of the local ecosystem and reducing the human pressures on the protected area. It is part of the World Heritage Site Rainforests of the Atsinanana. Adjacent to the park is the Centre ValBio research station,http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/centre-valbio/ established in 2003 and managed by Stony Brook University with a focus on biodiversity research, community health and education, environmental arts and reforestation.|$|R
5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the ground, where it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and worms, and occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller's</b> poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies in midair.|$|R
50|$|A further {{development}} is the pelletron, where the rubber or fabric belt {{is replaced by a}} chain of short conductive rods connected by insulating links, and the air-ionizing electrodes are replaced by a <b>grounded</b> <b>roller</b> and inductive charging electrode. The chain can be operated at much greater velocity than a belt, and both the voltage and currents attainable are much greater than with a conventional Van de Graaff generator. The 14 UD Heavy Ion Accelerator at The Australian National University houses a 15-million-volt pelletron. Its chains are more than 20 meters long and can travel faster than 50 km/h.|$|R
500|$|British {{banker and}} naturalist Walter Rothschild first {{described}} the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> in 1895, {{giving it the}} scientific name Uratelornis chimaera; Rothschild published his description in Novitates Zoologicae, the periodical of his private museum. The adaptations required for the ancestral long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> to inhabit scrubland led Rothschild to create the monotypic genus Uratelornis for the species in his description. The genus name Uratelornis {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek word oura [...] "tail," [...] and atelornis in reference to another genus of <b>ground</b> <b>roller.</b> Atelornis comes from the Ancient Greek words ateles [...] "indeterminate or incomplete," [...] and ornis [...] "bird." [...] The specific name, chimaera, is a reference to the Ancient Greek mythological creature known as the chimera. The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> is placed in the <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> family, which gets its common name due to its similarity to the rollers and its largely terrestrial nature. Until recently the ground rollers, cuckoo roller, and rollers were all placed in a single family, Coraciidae, in which each of the three groups formed a subfamily. In 1971, Joel Cracraft proposed a separate family for the ground rollers based on significant differences in behavior, plumage, and post-cranial anatomy between the groups. This position is supported by DNA evidence. It has been suggested, but not widely accepted, that ground rollers are closely related to the puffbirds and jacamars. It has been speculated that the ancestor of the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> was an [...] roller that crossed over from Africa to Madagascar and developed a terrestrial lifestyle before moving from the rainforests into the long-tailed ground roller's arid scrubland. No fossils have been found for this genus, and genetic analysis suggests that this bird's closest relative is the scaly <b>ground</b> <b>roller.</b> The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> has no subspecies.|$|E
500|$|Endemic to {{the island}} nation of Madagascar, the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> inhabits a narrow strip of {{suitable}} habitat by the coast in the southwestern part of the island. This strip is bordered by the Mangoky River in the north, the Fiherenana River in the south, and lowland hills in the east. It totals about [...] in area; however, the species is extremely uncommon within its range and occurs at densities of about 0.8 to 10 per square kilometer (2.1 to 25 per square mile). This area ranges in elevation from sea level to [...] The long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> does not migrate, though it may disperse across a larger area outside the breeding season.|$|E
500|$|The long-tailed ground roller's {{silhouette}} {{is highly}} distinctive {{due to its}} long tail and plump silhouette. The bird is [...] long, although its tail can contribute up to [...] of the length, which makes it the longest tail {{of any of the}} ground rollers. This <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> has short wings and long, pinkish-brown legs. The male has a sandy buff crown and dark brown upperparts with black streaks. Its supercilium is a pale buff color, while the ear-coverts are brown. The eyes are brown, while the short and stout beak is black. Its tongue is long with a brush-like tip to help it collect insects. A white stripe is present {{at the base of the}} bill and is surrounded by brown and black malar stripes. These malar stripes and the black breastband frame a white throat. The tail has 15 to 20 dark brown bars marking it, while the outer rectrices are sky blue; this sky blue is also present on the wing-coverts. In flight, the bird's two black and white bands on the primaries and secondaries are conspicuous. The underparts are a light gray, and the breast white. The toes are zygodactylous, with the first and fourth toes turned outwards and the middle two toes turned inwards. The female resembles the male, but is smaller and has a narrower chestband and a shorter tail. Also, the female loses her tail while nesting. These differences make the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> the only <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> to definitively display sexual dimorphism. Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female, but have duller plumage, particularly in the black bands on the chest, neck, and eyes.|$|E

5000|$|The Parlor Roller is a {{breed of}} domesticated pigeon {{developed}} {{over many years}} of selective breeding. Parlor Rollers, along with other varieties of domesticated pigeons, are all descendants from the rock pigeon (Columba livia). [...] The breed {{is known for its}} unique, involuntary, performance of turning somersaults on the <b>ground.</b> Parlor <b>Rollers</b> are considered to be further development from the Parlor Tumbler.|$|R
500|$|This species' prime {{habitat is}} spiny forest, {{a mix of}} sub-arid thorn-scrub and {{deciduous}} woodland that only receives on average [...] of water a year and is covered in sandy soil. The dominant plants in these spiny forests belong to the cactus-like family Didiereaceae (especially Didierea madagascariensis) and more tree-like family Euphorbiaceae (especially Euphorbia stenoclada). Baobab trees are also prevalent. It was formerly believed that the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> preferred an undisturbed forest habitat, while tolerating small amounts of disturbance. Later studies have concluded that it actually prefers degraded habitat. Despite this, shade is necessary, and the species is not found in deforested habitat or on the shadeless dunes prevalent in its range.|$|E
500|$|Male {{and female}} long-tailed ground rollers use their bills and feet to {{excavate}} a burrow in consolidated, flat sand and construct their nest {{at the end}} of it. The burrow, always constructed away from grassy vegetation, is downward-sloping and is between [...] long with a diameter of [...] The end of the burrow widens into a [...] wide chamber with a shallow depression covered in dry leaves and earthy pellets. When digging its nest, the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> occasionally walks underneath a low branch, tilts its head upwards, and, while remaining motionless, releases a rising crescendo of its tu-tuc calls. At the height of the crescendo the bird breaks off its call and flies upwards onto the branch while producing a [...] "ripping and crackling sound" [...] with its wingbeats. From the perch the bird releases a stream of boo notes. This display is thought {{to be part of a}} courtship ritual. Each pair digs one to six nesting burrows during the breeding season; the extra burrows are known as speculative burrows.|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{generally}} a silent species, during the breeding season the vocalizations of the long-tailed <b>ground</b> <b>roller</b> include a [...] "hooting" [...] sound, a [...] "popping" [...] tu-tuc, and a soft boo sound. The low-pitched [...] "hooting" [...] is given by males from a perch [...] above the ground at dusk or at night. The sound carries for a distance of at least [...] and may either attract a mate or defend a territory. The bird pumps its tail while giving this call. One territorial call {{is a series of}} soft boo notes, typically coming in sets of six to ten and descending in volume near the end. Another call, given by both sexes, is a series of chuckling tu-tuc sounds lasting between 10 and 40seconds that occasionally ends in a loud snapping sound produced by the wings. This call is given when birds are close to each other either on the ground or on low perches, and it does not carry over long distances. The use of wing-snapping to produce a sound is a rare phenomenon in birds, and in the order Coraciiformes only one other family, the todies, is known to do it. Low gu notes are given by mates as they come in contact with each other.|$|E
500|$|The bee-eaters {{have been}} {{considered}} {{to be related to}} other families, such as the rollers, hoopoe and kingfishers, but [...] ancestors of those families diverged from the bee-eaters at least forty million years ago, so any relationship is not close. The scarcity of fossils is unhelpful. Bee-eater fossils from the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) have been found in Austria, and there are Holocene (from 11,700 years ago to present) specimens from Israel and Russia, but all have proved to be of the extant European bee-eater. Opinions vary as to the bee-eater's nearest relatives. In 2001, Fry considered the kingfishers to be the most likely, whereas a large study published in 2008 found that bee-eaters are sister to all other Coraciiformes (<b>rollers,</b> <b>ground</b> <b>rollers,</b> todies, motmots and kingfishers). A 2009 book supported Fry's contention, but then a later study in 2015 suggested that the bee-eaters are sister to the rollers. The 2008 and 2015 papers both linked the kingfishers to the New World motmots.|$|R
50|$|The cuckoo roller has a {{total length}} of 40 - 50 cm; the {{nominate}} subspecies is the largest, and L. d. gracilis the smallest. Unlike the true <b>rollers</b> and <b>ground</b> <b>rollers,</b> where the sexes have identical appearance, the cuckoo roller is sexually dichromatic. Males have a mostly velvety grey chest and head, changing gradually to {{white on the}} remaining underparts (the demarcation between grey and white is stronger in L. d. gracilis). The back, tail, and wing-coverts are dark iridescent green with a purplish tinge (especially on the wing-coverts), and the crown and eye-stripe are black. Females are mostly brown, with strongly dark-spotted pale underparts (less spotting in L. d. gracilis). Juveniles are generally reported as resembling a dull female, but at least juveniles of L. d. gracilis are sexually dimorphic, and this also possibly applies to the other subspecies. The bill is stout and the eyes are set far back in the face. The legs and feet are small, and the feet have an unusual structure which has confused many ornithologists, but is now thought to be zygodactylous (two toes forwards, two toes backwards).|$|R
50|$|The newest themed {{area of the}} park, the Boardwalk {{waterpark}} {{was officially}} opened in 2007 and featured five new waterpark attractions along with three already standing rides: Roller Soaker, Tidal Force, and Canyon River Rapids. Canyon River Rapids and Tidal Force were rezoned from Pioneer Frontier to the Boardwalk, with Tidal Force later being zoned as Midway America. In 2009, the Boardwalk received an expansion known as the Seaquel which replaced Canyon River Rapids with Intercoastal Waterway (a lazy river), the Shore (a wave pool) and cabanas.
