40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to recent efforts to ground evolutionary theory in economics in the principles of Universal Darwinism. The paper contrasts two views of evolution, based on the Ultra-Darwinian and Naturalist theory of biological evolution, both of which are consistent with Darwinian principles. It is argued that the specific characteristics of the Naturalist view make it the better starting point for developing an evolutionary theory of the firm. This claim is <b>substantiated</b> <b>empirically</b> by <b>analysing</b> a crucial episode in the history of the semiconductor firm Intel. The paper concludes that an evolutionary theory of the firm should steer clear of analogies based on mechanisms of biological reproduction such as ‘routines as genes’...|$|R

Relationships among the geological backgrounds of hydrothermal activities (e.g., tectonic settings, basement rock geochemistry, abundance of sediments, magmatic volatile inputs, and phase separation related to subseafloor hydrothermal processes), physical and chemical variations in hydrothermal fluids, and compositional diversity of potentially bioavailable energy for various vent-endemic chemolithotrophic metabolisms have been elucidated through thermodynamic modeling of redox states in hydrothermal mixing zone habitats.

This challenge has been advanced by Daniel Wegner as an implication of his model {{of the experience of}} conscious will. After showing that attempts to directly falsify Wegner's illusion thesis have failed and that a real falsification will not be easily available, the challenge is answered here by criticising Wegner's model: those parts of the model which should sustain the illusion thesis are not substantiated. The rest of the model, however, should enrich our self-reflexive dealing with our desires, intentions and actions...|$|R

Not only does sonic enhancement of interfaces permit more natural human-computer communication but it also allows users to employ an appropriate sense {{to solve a problem}} rather than having to rely solely on vision. Research shows that designers do not typically know how to use sound effectively; subsequently, their ad hoc use of sound often leads to audio feedback being considered an annoying distraction. Unlike the design of purely {{graphical user interfaces}} for which guidelines are common, the audio-enhancement of graphical user interfaces has (until now) been plagued by a lack of suitable guidance.

By examining the influence of unit-level employee satisfaction on financial performance in the presence of other theoretically (and organizationally) relevant intervening variables [...] employee responsiveness, retention, and customer satisfaction [...] a model was proposed that exhibited remarkably good fit to the data and indicated that the path from satisfaction to performance was indirect as opposed to mediated.

It is established that the subjective {{image of the}} history of nationality is not directly related to knowledge of history as that was officially explained and accepted. This subjective image looks stable over time and has similar characteristics among the representatives of one nationality or ethnic group even if they live in different localities.

Some questions of the further research on interrelation between subjectively estimated and officially accepted history of nationality are discussed as well...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} investigates the influence on cooperative behavior of accessibility experiences {{associated with the}} retrieval of fairness-relevant information from memory.

Supporting this hypothesis, it is shown that {{in the context of a}} bargaining experiment, participants' experiences of ease or difficulty in retrieving unfair aspects of the respective negotiation procedure strongly influence their cooperation behavior. In addition, we hypothesize and <b>empirically</b> <b>substantiate</b> that the influence of accessibility experiences on cooperation behavior occurs particularly in situations of certainty salience.

40|$|We take up {{a longstanding}} {{question}} {{within the field of}} European Union (EU) studies: What explains the variation in public support for European integration? There are two dominant explanations: The utilitarian self-interest and the national identity perspectives. The former viewpoint stresses that citizens are more likely to support European integration, if it results in a net benefit to their economy or pocketbook, while the latter perspective argues that identity considerations predominantly influence EU support. Drawing on the concept of double allegiance, we argue that these perspectives should be combined into one single explanatory framework rather than framed as alternatives. Using a multilevel model, we <b>empirically</b> <b>substantiate</b> the claim that interest- and identity-based explanations capture different sides of the same coin, as the more citizens perceive integration to threaten their (economic and social-psychological) security and well-being, the less likely they will support the EU...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which opposition parties engage in wedge-issue competition. The literature on wedge-issue competition has exclusively focused on the two-party system in the United States, arguing that wedge issues are the domain of opposition parties. This study argues that within multiparty systems opposition status is a necessary but not sufficient condition for wedge-issue competition. Since parties within multiparty systems compete in the wake of past and dawn of future coalition negotiations, parties that are regularly part of a coalition are not likely to exploit wedge issues as it could potentially jeopardize relationships with future coalition partners. Conversely, it is less risky for parties that have never been part of a government coalition to mobilize wedge issues. These theoretical propositions are <b>empirically</b> <b>substantiated</b> by examining the attention given to the European integration issue between 1984 and 2010 within 14 Western European countries, utilizing pooled time-series regressions...|$|R
40|$|Institutional change entails {{balancing}} multiple competing, inconsistent {{and often}} loosely coupled demands and concerns, often simultaneously. This article poses the following question: How are patterns of internationalisation of research among academic staff at universities balancing two worlds of change, that is, governance {{by the university}} leadership (H 1) as well as initiatives by the faculty members (H 2) ? This article argues and <b>empirically</b> <b>substantiates</b> that internationalisation of academic staff {{tend to be a}} balancing-act between these two worlds of change. Whereas most universities increasingly formulate strategies for internationalisation (H 1), the research behaviour of faculty members seems weakly associated with such strategies (H 2). Variation in international research collaboration among permanent academic staff at universities is best explained by their positional level (H 2). This article also suggests key conditions under which internationalisation of research results from collaboratory strategies between university leadership and faculty members. ...|$|R
40|$|Privacy {{concerns}} among Internet {{users are}} consistently {{found to be}} high. At the same time, these concerns {{do not appear to}} generate a corresponding wave of privacy protection behavior. A number of studies have addressed the apparent divergence between users’ privacy concerns and behavior, with results varying according to context. Previous research has examined user trust, lack of risk awareness and the privacy calculus as potential solutions to the “privacy paradox”. Complementing these perspectives, we propose that some users faced with seemingly overwhelming privacy threats develop an attitude of “privacy cynicism”, leading to a resigned neglect of protection behavior. Privacy cynicism serves as a cognitive coping mechanism, allowing users to rationalize taking advantage of online services despite serious privacy concerns. We conduct an interdisciplinary literature review to define the core concept, then <b>empirically</b> <b>substantiate</b> it based on qualitative data collected among German Internet users...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that beyond {{understanding}} nations as imagined communities, the metaphor of an ‘imagined family’ or ‘filial community’ is a more useful concept towards understanding links between gender and nationhood as family relations in four ways: (1) providing a clear, hierarchical structure; (2) prescribing social roles and responsibilities; (3) being linked to positive affective connotations; and (4) reifying social phenomena as biologically determined. In order to <b>empirically</b> <b>substantiate</b> our claim, we will explore the prevalence and use of family metaphors in a key symbol of nationhood discourses. Through a qualitative analysis of national anthems as ‘mnemonics of national identity’, we demonstrate the widespread presence of family metaphors, discussing how they reproduce ideas of family and gender. Finally, we discuss how the ‘imagined family’ as present in anthems {{and other forms of}} national representation could inform future studies of nationalism and national politics...|$|R

The narrative–discursive analysis of the in-depth interview material illustrates the interweavement of ethnicity with religion, along with the use of historical imagery and cultural signals of alleged similarity and difference. What becomes evident is the salience of ethno-cultural and religious identifications, operating as potent resources for self-making but also as vehicles for categorization and the potential exclusion of ‘others’.
