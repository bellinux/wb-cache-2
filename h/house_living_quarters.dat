50|$|Longview Farm {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places October 24, 1985. The listing {{includes}} the main residence, three staff residences, several farm outbuildings, ornamental monuments, and a chapel.

50|$|In March 1914, as {{a result}} of wind and fog, the Polish {{schooner}} Louise & Helene went aground at Hullenakke off the coast of Svaneke. The ship was broken up on the rocks and its crew of three all drowned. As a result, the city council provided a plot of land for a lighthouse on Hullenakke. The architect Otto Bertlesen was invited to design the building which was completed in 1919. The base of the rather unusual square-shaped building is in Nexø granite while the tower itself is built of sandstone, 15 m in height. In January 1920, a temporary light was placed on the platform and in August 1920 the final fixtures were added and the lighthouse came into full operation. As the lighthouse was also to provide fog warnings, a foghorn was installed which was operated by compressed air from an engine in the machine <b>house.</b> <b>Living</b> <b>quarters</b> for the lighthouse keeper and his family were also constructed on the site. In 2010, the lighthouse was taken out of commission and was sold into private ownership the following year after heritage protection had been denied.|$|E

5000|$|The Pollock Depot is a {{historic}} former railroad station on Avenue A in Pollock, South Dakota. It is a wood-frame structure with a gable roof, with two sections, one two stories, {{and the other a}} single story. The station was built in 1901 to Plan 3104, one of five plans used by the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (aka the [...] "Soo Line") for its stations. The establishment of the station at this location resulted in the founding of the town of Pollock, whose buildings were moved here from other area communities.

50|$|The Mikulich General Store is {{a two-story}} {{rectangular}} {{building with a}} flat roof. The front facade has a recessed central entrance with two large display windows on each side. The store likely had some form of wooden siding originally; it was covered with asphalt siding in the 1920s, and later with clapboards when the asphalt began to deteriorate.

5000|$|As {{with the}} main Maginot Line of the northeast, {{positions}} {{took the form of}} concrete-encased strongpoints linked by underground tunnels, which <b>housed</b> <b>living</b> <b>quarters,</b> magazines and utilities for the ouvrage. Larger ouvrages were provided with [...] narrow gauge rail lines to move materials and munitions, although unlike the northeastern positions, none were electrified. Because of the mountainous terrain and the vertical character of the sites chosen for fortification, individual blocks typically emerged from rock faces in a steep hillside or cliff with mined galleries within under rock cover. By comparison, most northeastern ouvrages were semi-submerged into the gently rolling soil with galleries deeply buried beneath earth cover. Many of the high-altitude petits ouvrages could only be built during the brief Alpine summer, leading to extended construction schedules, and causing many of these high outposts to be uncompleted at the outbreak of war in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The {{houses of}} the Multnomah, like the other Chinookan peoples, were largely longhouses made of Western Redcedar planks.

5000|$|The two-storey {{building}} was a plastered building [...] "in simple Hellenic style" [...] as {{a link between}} the modern and antique. The building laid out in cruciform plan-form and extended to the east with its longest arm. At the meeting point of the arms of the cross a rotating iron dome was placed with a diameter of 7.5 metres. It was the first observatory dome in Prussia {{in the form of a}} hemisphere with a slit opening and rotation mechanism. The foundations of the actual observatory were separate from the other buildings, to avoid transmission of vibrations. Under the dome was the library. In the upper storey were further observational spaces as well as scientific work areas. The long east wing <b>housed</b> the <b>living</b> <b>quarters</b> of the director on the ground floor and was adorned with a temple front, which as the main frontage showed the God of Light Apollo with a quadriga in relief on the gables. To the east of the building stood a small <b>house</b> with the <b>living</b> <b>quarters</b> of the castellan.|$|R

50|$|An {{architectural}} pattern {{typical for}} the village consists of a two-floor house: the top floor is fully walled and serves as the residential area for one or more families, whereas the ground floor is used for housing livestock (goats, sheep, swine). Less wealthy families, who cannot afford a two-floor <b>house</b> share <b>living</b> <b>quarters</b> with the livestock. There are plans to construct centralised plumbing facilities for the disposal of sewage in the near future, so as to replace the current practice of using septic tanks which drain in the nearby river Thyamis.|$|R

The word may also refer to the lane, alley or back street onto which such stables open. It is sometimes applied to rows or groups of garages or, more broadly, to a narrow passage or a confined place. Today most mews stables have been converted into dwellings.|$|R
5000|$|The Duke {{gave the}} house to his Flemish court {{sculptor}} Gabriël Grupello in 1708 {{and the name of}} the house is derived from this.

Originally, two female busts representing the Greek goddesses Artemis and Aphrodite presumed to be by Grupello were placed above the portal.

50|$|The 2550 temple complex had two 3.6 m Deepamalas, a rest <b>house</b> and <b>living</b> <b>quarters</b> for the caretaker. It had an {{adjoining}} lake 30 x 40 sq. m. in size {{on the eastern}} and southern side of the temple. The lake, dug by Nardulla in the early 19th century to counter the scarcity of water, was filled up in the later years and the land is now {{not part of the}} temple complex. Around 1952, a small Hanuman shrine was built in the temple complex for the Hanuman icon that was found during the road extension project of Sayani Road near Elphinstone Road. In the 1950s and 60s, the fame of the temple spread and a significant number of devotees began visiting. However, in the same period, the owner of the plot sold some of the temple land, reducing the complex area. After 1975, the number of devotees increased dramatically.|$|R
