40|$|The quickly {{rising trend}} of {{third-party}} funding in <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> {{is an extremely}} novel and complex challenge for the <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> community.

As domestic countries have taken hugely varying approaches to third-party funding in a litigation context, the <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> community has a wealth of choice available to it in deciding how to approach this trend. There are many outstanding issues in this area and there is much speculation as to how these issues will be resolved.

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>arbitration</b> has {{developed}} into a global system of adjudication, dealing with disputes arising {{from a variety of}} legal relationships: between states, between private commercial actors, and between private and public entities. It operates to a large extent according to its own rules and dynamics - a transnational justice system rather independent of domestic and international law. In response to its growing importance and use by disputing parties, <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> has become increasingly institutionalized, professionalized, and judicialized. At the same time, it has gained significance beyond specific disputes and indeed contributes to the shaping of law. Arbitrators have therefore become not only adjudicators, but transnational lawmakers. This has raised concerns over the legitimacy of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration.</b> Practising Virtue looks at <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> from the 'inside', with an emphasis on its transnational character. Instead of concentrating on the national and international law governing <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> it focuses on those who practise <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> in order to understand how it actually works, what its sources of authority are, and what demands of legitimacy it must meet. Putting those who practise arbitration into the centre of the system of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> allows us to appreciate {{the way in which they}} contribute to the development of the law they apply. This book invites eminent arbitrators to reflect on the actual practice of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> and its contribution to the transnational justice system...|$|R
