5|$|Britain {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.|$|E

5|$|These changes {{brought the}} {{customary}} rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.

The last bid to restore the reformed Commonwealth came with the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794.

5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} of the Soviet Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and <b>freedoms,</b> <b>and</b> by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction).

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} and persistent of problems in speculative philosophy is reconciling the relation between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> nature.

As I hope to show, the so-called problem of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> determinism lies precisely in this deterministic assumption. By reorienting the question in terms of the relation between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> nature, rather than <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> determinism, we can better see how the problem of their tension or ‘contradiction’ only arises if nature itself is defined and characterized in a very limited, purely deterministic way.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} how to achieve a balance between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control in public space. It analyses the relationship between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control to identify phenomena and offer users and policymakers instructions for achieving that balance. Public space, including privately owned public space, is important to urban living. People have both the right to use public space and the responsibility to protect it. Both <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control should exist in public space in an appropriate combination. It is impossible and inappropriate for us to ask for absolute freedom or endure unreasonable control. Design/methodology/approach – A case study of Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) reveals typical freedom/control relationships. Quantitative descriptions are given based on field observations. Findings – <b>Freedom</b> <b>and</b> control are primary factors affecting the quality of urban life and management of city space. They depend on and conflict with each other. The balance between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control is a balance between diverse spaces. The “freedom space” belonging to both citizens and authorities determines whether <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control are balanced. Ethics and strategies constitute control. Only when each authority and user obtains a proper freedom space can <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control achieve balance in public space. Research limitations/implications – <b>Freedom</b> <b>and</b> control differ across cities because they are both affected by culture, history and tradition. As each city has its own characteristics, the <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control in each open space are distinctive. Balancing <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control requires an understanding of a city’s background and the era. While this paper does not attempt to achieve this understanding, further studies could devote more attention to dimensions of time and location. Practical implications – The findings provide recommendations for users, policymakers and construction and management companies that will allow the management of harmonious and high-quality open spaces. Social implications – <b>Freedom</b> <b>and</b> control are two main factors affecting quality of life. The balance between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control may bring a harmony and stable society environment. It would benefit both the authority and the people a lot. Originality/value – This study provides a systematic analysis of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> control in public space and makes a valuable contribution to quality urban space policy, design and management.

5|$|After the May elections, the Grinius/Sleževičius {{government}} lifted martial law, {{still in}} effect in Kaunas and other localities, restored democratic <b>freedoms,</b> <b>and</b> granted broad amnesty to political prisoners. For the first time, Lithuania had become truly democratic. However, the change {{did not meet}} with universal approval. Many of the released prisoners were communists who quickly used the new freedoms of speech to organize a protest attended by approximately 400 people in Kaunas on 13 June. The protest was dispersed. The new government's opposition used this protest as the platform for a public attack on the government, alleging that it was allowing illegal organizations (the Communist Party of Lithuania was still outlawed) to continue their activities freely. Despite its local nature, the incident was presented as {{a major threat to}} Lithuania and its military; the government was said to be incapable of dealing with this threat.|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues.

In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order.

40|$|This study {{critically}} {{and systematically}} analyses the purported democratic values of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality {{with a view}} to clarifying the meaning of the concepts of democracy, <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality; and examining the nature of the relations between kinds of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> kinds of equality, their association with democracy, and assessing their reconcilability within the two broad schools of democratic theory, namely, Anglo American democratic theory and Continental democratic theory. Put slightly differently, the issue is whether <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality are mutually compatible or incompatible within democratic contexts. The analysis necessitates exploring the possible reason or reasons for the reconcilability or incompatibility of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality. Hence, the arguments in democratic literature relevant to the meanings of <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality, and the relations between them will be examined. The first set of arguments concern the question of whether kinds of freedom endanger kinds of equality, and conversely, whether kinds of equality erode or hamper kinds of freedom. The relation existing between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality, <b>and</b> equality <b>and</b> <b>freedom,</b> in both instances purport to demonstrate the tension existing between them in theory as well as in practice. The second set of arguments concern the question of whether kinds of freedom promote kinds of equality, and conversely, whether kinds of equality further kinds of freedom. The relation in both instances is deemed to demonstrate the affinity between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality, <b>and</b> equality <b>and</b> <b>freedom.</b> An attempt will thus be made {{to address the issue of}} the seemingly confusing array of meanings of democracy, <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality, and the potentially problematic relations between them, and particularly those between <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> equality as represented by the two sets of arguments within appropriate democratic contexts. The study will endeavour to examine the analytic and synthetic interplay of meanings and relations, their nature and compatibility or incompatibility, and the possible reasons for this state of affairs, in an attempt to identify and address the perceived misapprehensions concerning their meanings and relations in democratic literature.

5|$|During the High Middle Ages, Crompton was a {{collection}} of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, swamp and a single corn mill, occupied by a small and close community of families. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, High Crompton, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of land tenure, inheritance, and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak, and Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. This slowly facilitated comparative <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx of families from the neighbouring parish of Rochdale, including the Buckleys, Cleggs, Greaves and Milnes.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{conservative}} Polish nobility {{formed the}} Targowica Confederation {{to overthrow the}} Constitution, which they saw {{as a threat to}} the traditional <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> privileges they enjoyed. The confederates aligned themselves with Russia's Catherine the Great, and the Russian army entered Poland, marking the start of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. The Sejm voted to increase the Polish Army to 100,000 men, but due to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved. Poniatowski and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of the King's nephew Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, managed to defeat the Russians or fight them to a draw on several occasions. Following the victorious Battle of Zieleńce, in which Polish forces were commanded by his nephew, the king founded a new order, the Order of Virtuti Militari, to reward Poles for exceptional military leadership and courage in combat.|$|E
5|$|The Bill of Rights is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal <b>freedoms</b> <b>and</b> rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English Bill of Rights 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E
