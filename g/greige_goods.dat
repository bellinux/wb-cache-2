Her father Irving (1916-2005) was president of the <b>Greige</b> <b>goods</b> and commission finishing divisions of Reeves Brothers Inc., a textile and industrial products manufacturer. Her mother, Gloria (born 1927), is an artist and long-time member of The Art Students League of New York.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight opaque fabrics {{are very}} thin and light {{but not as}} {{transparent}} as sheer fabrics. The {{distinction between the two}} is not always pronounced. End uses include apparel and furnishings. Organdy (a sheer fabric), lawn, and batiste begin as the same <b>greige</b> <b>goods.</b> They differ from one another in the way they are finished. Lawn and batiste do not receive the acid finish and, thus, remain opaque. Better quality fabrics are made of combed yarns.|$|E

Fabric is first shaped using a variety of traditional stitch-resist shibori techniques on <b>greige</b> <b>goods</b> (untreated fabric) of Japanese Gunma silk, a special fabric with highly over-spun silk filaments. Next, fabric is scoured, causing it to shrink – an effect of the high-twist yarns. In unprotected areas, the textile is permanently pleated, whereas the remaining stitch-resisted and protected areas of the fabric become permanently textured. Texture can further be enhanced 0 through shibori dyeing. A major consideration in designing garments using the method described above {{is the fact that the}} scouring process leads to a sixty percent reduction in the total surface area of the textile. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate how and where this reduction will occur before scouring in order to ensure that the multiple textures and specific design features (i. e. cuffs, collars and waistline), appear at the appropriate and designated positions within the final piece. This technique, unlike that of traditional garment design, involves multiple textures within a continuous piece [...] no seams exist between the pleated and stitch-resisted areas. Collectively, the elasticity inherent in the final pieces, coupled with their seamless nature, results in extraordinary fluidity and new possibilities in design...|$|E
40|$|Shibori, a {{compression}} {{resist dyeing}} technique, has increasingly {{become part of}} our textile vocabulary and for over 25 years, I have explored these techniques in my own production of fabrics for clothing and interior wall pieces. The {{opportunity to work with}} silk <b>greige</b> <b>goods</b> (untreated fabric) and the possibilities with shibori - together, this combination expands the shibori vocabulary with exciting possibilities for the studio artist and designer. In my application, I use arashi shibori, itajime clamp resist, and nui-shibori stitch resist on the raw yardage. The cloth is simmered in a solution of 10 % (of dry weight of silk) soda ash. The resulting fabric emerges with patterned areas of soft silk where scoured, flat crisp areas where resisted. Through experimentation I have found that certain dyes take differently to scoured and non-scoured areas, thereby further enhancing this difference. Textural contrasts add to the dynamics of the finished cloth. While silk organza may be resist-scoured, the Japanese crepe from Gunma prefecture is the one fabric that has given the most subtle and complex results. The scoured crepe shrinks radically, the resisted areas remain flat, and as a result the fabric will pleat conforming to the resist method — it may be ironed flat but will re -pleat under water! I propose to share slides of my working process and finished fabrics and clothing, and to concisely describe my scouring and dyeing methods. Through this, I hope to share my experience and enthusiasm for this new approach to shibori and silk...|$|E
