50|$|The <b>efficiency</b> <b>requirement</b> in Popek and Goldberg's {{definition}} of a VMM concerns only the execution of non-privileged instructions, which must execute natively. This is what distinguishes a VMM from the more general class of hardware emulation software. Unfortunately, even on an architecture that meets Popek and Goldberg's requirements, {{the performance of a}} virtual machine can differ significantly from the actual hardware. Early experiments performed on the System/370 (which meets the formal requirements of Theorem 1) showed that performance of a virtual machine could be as low as 21% of the native machine in some benchmarks. The cost of trapping and emulating privileged instructions in the VMM can be significant. This led the IBM engineers to introduce a number of hardware assists, which roughly doubled the performance of the System/370 virtual machines. Assists were added in several stages. In the end, there were over 100 assists on the late models System/370.|$|E

40|$|No-signaling theories, {{which can}} contain nonlocal {{correlations}} stronger than classical correlations but {{limited by the}} no-signaling condition, have deepened {{our understanding of the}} quantum theory. In principle, the nonlocality of these theories can be verified via Bell tests. In practice, however, inefficient detectors may make Bell tests unreliable, which is called the detection efficiency loophole. In this work, we show almost tight lower and upper bounds of the detector <b>efficiency</b> <b>requirement</b> for demonstrating the nonlocality of no-signaling theories, by designing a general class of Bell tests. In particular, we show tight bounds for two scenarios: the bipartite case and the multipartite case with a large number of parties. To some extent, these tight efficiency bounds quantify the nonlocality of no-signaling theories. Furthermore, our result shows that the detector efficiency can be arbitrarily low even for Bell tests with two parties, by increasing the number of measurement settings. Our work also sheds light on the detector <b>efficiency</b> <b>requirement</b> for showing the nonlocality of the quantum theory. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
