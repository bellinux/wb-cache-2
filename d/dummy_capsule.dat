40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a current research project {{carried out in}} the Robert Gordon University for developing the prototype of the vibro-impact capsule robot for pipeline inspection. The project aims to address the technical bottlenecks which have been encountered by current pipeline technologies with a particular focus on oil industry. In order to verify the concept, a <b>dummy</b> <b>capsule</b> prototype with a diameter of 80 mm is designed and manufactured for testing in a 2. 5 meter long section of 140 mm nominal diameter clear PVCu pipe with a flow velocity up to 0. 3 m/s. By using the experimental test bed, the prototype of the capsule system can be tested at various flow rates, and the experimental results could be used for comparing with CFD simulation results for optimization...|$|E
40|$|Background Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) {{is characterized}} by chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction {{in the absence of}} detectable organic disease. The recently developed technique, video capsule endoscopy (CE), {{has been shown to be}} much more sensitive than traditional enterography in detecting mucosal changes in the small intestine. This study was performed to see if any earlier, not detectable by other standard methods, mucosal changes could be found in the small intestine in patients diagnosed as having IBS. Methods All consecutive women who, over the past five years, had received a well-founded diagnosis of IBS at the Department of Medicine were identified. Twenty-eight women, mean age 36 ± 12 years were willing to participate in the study. They underwent a CE after a pre-test with a <b>dummy</b> <b>capsule.</b> The actual IBS activity was estimated by the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB) Index questionnaires. Results The duration of the IBS symptoms was a mean of 10 years (range 3 – 25). Symptoms were present, according to the scores of the GSRS and the PGWB index, at the time the patients underwent the CE. In the majority, 24 of 27 IBS patients examined, no specific small intestinal lesions were seen on CE. In two patients, CE revealed multiple small intestinal lesions such as ulcerations and/or erosions, and in one patient a duodenal ulceration. Conclusion In the vast majority of patients who fulfil the symptom criteria of IBS, no pathological mucosal lesions can be found by CE explaining the symptomatology. However, a subgroup of these patients may benefit from investigation by CE to reconsider the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In a randomized, double-blind, {{double-dummy}} controlled study, 22 {{men with}} erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) received six capsules containing either 100 mg (group A, n 12) or 300 mg (group B, n 10) of thalidomide daily for one week. A six-week, four capsules per day taper followed, in which group A received 50 mg/day of thalidomide in weeks 2 and 3, then <b>dummy</b> <b>capsules</b> in weeks 4 through 7, while group B had gradual decrements every two weeks. Both regimens caused comparable improvement in 19 patients at day 7 (group A [12 of 12] versus group B [7 of 10]; P 0. 08), but slower tapering in group B showed less re-emergence of ENL through week 7 (P 0. 02, versus group A). Most patients developed new lesions soon after stopping treatment. Slower tapering from a higher initial thalidomide dose may improve clinical ENL responses, but high recurrence rates after discontinuation indicates further assessment {{is needed to}} identify better tapering regimens...|$|R
40|$|A {{decision}} was made to begin fabrication for the initial core loading of LAMPRE- 1 with capsules from the tantalum on hand. Fuel for the first loading will be the cast Fe [...] Pu alloy from LCX III capsules and will contain carbon and stabilizer. Certification and melt-freeze tests are continuing on LAMPRE type capsules. The filling of the reactor sodium system is described. The cover gas system operated satisfactorily during the sodium shakedown phase. Four of the 15 core thermocouples have operated improperly since the sodium system was filled. The capsule charges were operated to remove <b>dummy</b> <b>capsules</b> and insert tantalum capsules containing test coupons. The 2000 -kw Sodium Test Facility, including test steam generator, was operated continuously from Aug. 20 to Nov. 20, except for l 59 hr of shutdown required for maintenance of auxiliary steam system equipment. Mercury-water flow systems were set up and are being operated to study both lift and jet pumping. A second fuel pumping experiment using Co [...] Ce - -Pu fuel was set up and tried without success. The effects of various additives on the properties of Fe-Pu fuels are being studied. The fabrication of LAMPRE- 1 capsules by impact-extruding a rod-slug into a starting cup followed by six ironing stages is described. Materials that were corrosion tested as fabricated capsules include arcmelted and electron-beann-melted high-purity tantalum and Ta [...] 0. 1 wt. % W alloy. Corrosion tests are in progress on experimental deep-drawn capsules made from Ta [...] 0. 1 wt. % W [...] 0. 2 wt. % Y. An x-ray fluorescence spectrographic method was developed for determining hafnium in Ta [...] Hf and Ta [...] W- Hf alloys. Work is in progress on the development of a solvent extraction method for the recovery of plutonium residues from various pyrometallurgical processes. (For preceding period see LAMS- 2462.) (W. L.

40|$|The authors {{propose a}} {{magnetic}} actuator {{for use as}} a navigation system for capsule endoscopes. The actuator is composed of a <b>capsule</b> <b>dummy,</b> a permanent magnet inside the capsule, and an external spiral structure. The device rotates and propels wirelessly when exposed to an external rotational magnetic field. In this study we measured the effect of the spiral shape on the velocity and thrust force properties. According to our experimen-tal results, the actuator obtained a maximum velocity and thrust force when the spiral angle was set at 45 degrees, the number of spirals was set at 4, and the spiral-height was set at 1 -mmf. We also conducted a motion test in the large intestine of a pig placed on a 30 degrees slope. The actuator passed through a 700 mm length of the intestine in about 300 s. The device also managed to travel up and down the 30 degrees slope with no diffi-culty whatsoever. Our results demonstrate the great potential of this actuator {{for use as a}} navigation system for capsule endoscopes...|$|R
