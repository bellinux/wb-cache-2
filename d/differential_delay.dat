However, it creates <b>differential</b> <b>delay</b> whereby each path that is created, represented by a VT has a different propagational delay across the network. The difference in these delays is called [...] "differential delay" [...] (D). The major problem with <b>differential</b> <b>delay</b> is the requirement for high speed buffers at the receiving node to store incoming information while all paths converge. This buffer space, (B) can be equated to the bandwidth delay product such that B = n * D. Thus, each Virtually Concatenated connection requires B bits of buffer space. This need for buffer space eventually increases the network cost, so {{it is very important to}} select paths that minimize the <b>differential</b> <b>delay,</b> which is directly proportional to the buffer space required.|$|E

50|$|One {{of the key}} {{difficulties}} of implementing this technique is that the receiver must be properly synchronized to align the local clock {{with the beginning of}} each symbol. Therefore, it is often implemented differentially as differential pulse-position modulation, whereby each pulse position is encoded relative to the previous, such that the receiver must only measure the difference in the arrival time of successive pulses. It is possible to limit the propagation of errors to adjacent symbols, so that an error in measuring the <b>differential</b> <b>delay</b> of one pulse will affect only two symbols, instead of affecting all successive measurements.|$|E

For television purposes, a maximum frequency of 6 MHz might be chosen, which corresponds to a delay of 83ns. Again, many sections {{may be required to}} fully equalise. In general, much greater attention is paid to the routing and exact length of television cables because many more equaliser sections are required to remove the same delay difference as compared to audio.|$|E
50|$|A PMD {{compensation}} {{system is a}} device which uses a polarization controller to compensate for PMD in fibers.

Because the PMD effects are random and time-dependent, this requires an active device that responds to feedback over time. Such systems are therefore expensive and complex; combined with the fact that PMD is not yet the limiting factor in the lower data rates still in common use, this means that PMD-{{compensation system}}s have seen limited deployment in largescale telecommunications systems.|$|E
