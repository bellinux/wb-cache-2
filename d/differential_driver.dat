40|$|Advances in System-on-Chip (SoC) design have {{emphasized}} the need for driving long on-chip differential traces.

40|$|In recent years, 2. 5 D {{integration}} of ICs on Interposer is becoming popular for highly integrated miniaturized systems. To combine {{two or more}} chips together, {{there is a lot}} of communication between the chips and this needs either a very high number of slow channels or numerous high speed channels. To find an optimum number and speed of interposer channels is an important task. In conventional PCB data communication systems, very high speed serial data transmission circuits are used which take a lot of area and power. While in 2. 5 D systems, area-power are strict constraints and the interposer channel is drastically different from PCB channel in terms of its electrical properties. To enable high bandwidth chip-to-chip interposer communication with low area-power requirements, it is mandatory to co-design the interposer channel and IO circuit.

50|$|Buses can be {{parallel}} buses, which carry data {{words in}} parallel on multiple wires, or serial buses, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra {{power and control}} connections, <b>differential</b> <b>drivers,</b> and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in 1-Wire and UNI/O. As data rates increase, the problems of timing skew, power consumption, electromagnetic interference and crosstalk across parallel buses {{become more and more}} difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to double pump the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. USB, FireWire, and Serial ATA are examples of this. Multidrop connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use daisy-chain or hub designs.|$|R

Silicon photonics (Si-Photonic) {{is one of the}} most promising techniques to realize tightly integrated optical transceivers for next-generation high speed I/O standards. This dissertation focuses on the design techniques of Si-Photonic transceivers for a data rate of 25 Gb/s and beyond.

An AC-coupled <b>differential</b> <b>driver</b> is proposed to realize 4 ×VDD output swing as well as tunable DC-biasing. The proposed transmitter incorporates 2 -tap asymmetric pre-emphasis to effectively cancel the optical nonlinearity of the Microring modulator.

The part is designed for use in low voltage applications which require {{a large number of}} outputs to drive precisely aligned low skew signals to their destination. The two clock inputs are differential HSTL or LVPECL and they are selected by the CLK_SEL pin which is LVTTL. To avoid generation of a runt clock pulse when the device is enabled/disabled, the Output Enable (OE), which is LVTTL, is synchronous ensuring the outputs will only be enabled/disabled when they are already in LOW state (See Figure 7). The NB 100 EP 223 guarantees low output−to−output skew. The optimal design, layout, and processing minimize skew within a device and from lot to lot.
