50|$|The term dipole {{derives from}} the fact that the polar {{response}} consists of two , with equal radiation forwards and backwards, and none perpendicular to the axis. By comparison a monopole response consists of one lobe. This can be useful in reducing the stimulation of resonant room modes at low frequencies. It also results in high frequencies being reflected from any rear wall, which can enhance the naturalness of the sound in typical listening rooms by creating more diffuse reverberation, though in theory it could detract from stereo localization. For this reason dipole speakers are often used as surround channel speakers, where a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> is desired to create ambience.|$|E

There is also a 1400 sq ft rehearsal studio called Studio Beta, and 4 Artist-in-Residence studios (with one being permanently occupied by the Institute President, Dr. Shirley Jackson, as a private, part-time office). Studio 1 and Studio 2 are lined with acoustical panels to <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> using innovative paneling designed to simulate the characteristics of tree bark.

50|$|Perception of {{direction}} is greatly {{affected by the}} relative time that a sound arrives at each ear and any difference in the amplitude of a sound at each ear. It is possible to create a sound source having an output characteristic which is rapidly varying with direction and frequency of signal. These kinds of sources create sound fields which are rapidly variable around the listeners room. These are {{often referred to as}} diffuse sources, this is because their output resembles a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> field — a sound field where soundwaves are traveling in all directions with equal probability. In a diffuse field the sound at each of a listeners' ears is so completely different that it is impossible for the brain to work out where the sound has come from. A diffuse source located in front of the listener will be hard to localize and can be used to carry the surround signals.|$|E

To cut the cost of trial and error <b>diffuse</b> field <b>sound</b> absorption coefficient measurements, a prediction method was developed. Measurements were made in a two-microphone impedance tube of the complex specific acoustic impedances of the unperforated rigid panel materials and of the thin porous materials in front of a rigidly terminated air cavity.

Sound level meters meeting the USA American National Standards Institute (ANSI) {{specifications}} cannot usually meet the corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) specifications [...] at the same time, as the ANSI standard describes instruments that are calibrated to a randomly incident wave, i.e. a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> field, while internationally meters are calibrated to a free field wave, that is sound coming from a single direction. Further, USA dosimeters have an exchange rate of level against time where every 5 dB increase in level halves the permitted exposure time; whereas {{in the rest of}} the world a 3 dB increase in level halves the permitted exposure time. The 3 dB doubling method is called the [...] "equal energy" [...] rule and there is no possible way of converting data taken under one rule to be used under the other. Despite these differences, many developing countries refer to both USA and international specifications within one instrument in their national regulations. Because of this, many commercial PSEM have dual channels with 3 and 5 dB doubling, some even having 4 dB for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{recently}} proposed informed spatial filter, {{it is possible}} to effectively and robustly reduce reverberation from speech signals captured in noisy environments using multiple microphones.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} performance of passive or active panel structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities. A reverberant sending room, equipped {{with one or}} a number of independent sound sources, is used to generate a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> field excitation which acts as a disturbance source on the structure under investigation. The spatial correlation and coherence of such a synthesized non-ideal diffuse-sound-field excitation, however, might deviate significantly from the ideal case. This has consequences for the operation of an active feedforward control system which heavily relies on the acquisition of coherent disturbance source information. This work, therefore, evaluates the spatial correlation and coherence of ideal and non-ideal <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> fields and considers the implications {{on the performance of}} a feedforward control system. The system under consideration is an aircraft-typical double panel system, equipped with an active sidewall panel (lining), which is realized in a transmission loss facility. Experimental results for different numbers of sound sources in the reverberation room are compared to simulation results of a comparable generic double panel system excited by an ideal <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> field. It is shown that the number of statistically independent noise sources acting on the primary structure of the double panel system depends not only on the type of <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> field but also on the sample lengths of the processed signals.

This can be used to study the acoustic limitations imposed on local active sound control systems such as an active headrest when controlling broadband noise. Spatial-temporal correlation is first revised, after which derivations of the diffuse field zones of quiet in the near-field and the far-field of the secondary source are presented. The theoretical analysis is supported by simulation examples comparing the zones of quiet for diffuse fields excited by tonal and broadband signals.

A device was constructed with multiple outward facing loudspeakers arrayed around a single point. From an empirical standpoint it provides source point identification and emulates the emanation of sound from an acoustic instrument or human voice when deployed in a space used for acoustic musical performances and without recorded reverberation or post-production reverb effects added.

40|$|The sound {{transmission}} loss of lightweight structures {{can be increased}} by the application of facing formworks. In the aircraft industry this task is accomplished by means of sidewall panels (linings) mounted on the primary fuselage structure of an aircraft. At low frequencies (< 1000 Hz), however, the {{sound transmission}} loss {{is dominated by the}} so-called mass-law which prescribes an inverse relationship between mass and transmitted sound power. This behavior is worsened by the fact that around the so-called mass-air-mass-resonance-frequency the transmission loss of a double panel structure (e. g., an aircraft fuselage structure with linings) falls below that of a single panel (of equal mass). Furthermore, the effectiveness of passive damping methods is limited due to constraints on mass and volume. On the other hand, the interior acoustics in the aircraft cabin is an important issue regarding passenger comfort, which raises the demand for alternative solutions. Active structural acoustic control (ASAC) provides a lightweight-compliant {{solution to the problem of}} low-frequency sound transmission through single or double panel structures. Prior to wind-tunnel or flight tests, the acoustic performance of active lightweight structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities.

Although it is well-known that the statistical properties of such a non-ideal <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> field will deviate from the ideal case, potential implications on the performance of active feedforward control systems have not been discussed so far.
