5|$|As the <b>Director-General</b> was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the <b>Director-General</b> could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the <b>Director-General</b> to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, <b>director-general</b> of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham.

Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E

Due largely to the inexperience of his co-pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive.
