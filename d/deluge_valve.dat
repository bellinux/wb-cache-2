50|$|Because {{the heat}} sensing {{elements}} {{present in the}} automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinklers), the <b>deluge</b> <b>valve</b> must be opened as signaled by a fire alarm system. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g.pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the <b>deluge</b> <b>valve</b> to open. Activation can also be manual, depending on the system goals. Manual activation is usually via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm pull station, which signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the <b>deluge</b> <b>valve</b> to open.|$|E
50|$|Operation - Activation of a {{fire alarm}} {{initiating}} device, or a manual pull station, signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the <b>deluge</b> <b>valve</b> to open, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flows from all sprinklers simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of single interlock systems {{are similar to}} dry systems except that these systems require that a “preceding” fire detection event, typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector, takes place prior to the “action” of water introduction into the system’s piping by opening the pre-action valve, which is a mechanically latched valve (i.e. similar to a <b>deluge</b> <b>valve).</b> In this way, the system is essentially converted from a dry system into a wet system. The intent {{is to reduce the}} undesirable time delay of water delivery to sprinklers that is inherent in dry systems. Prior to fire detection, if the sprinkler operates, or the piping system develops a leak, loss of air pressure in the piping will activate a trouble alarm. In this case, the pre-action valve will not open due to loss of supervisory pressure, and water will not enter the piping.|$|E

40|$|The {{background}} for this thesis {{is a change}} in the guidelines provided by the Norwegian petroleum industry regarding design of active and passive fire protection at offshore platforms. Now, it is possible to take into account that deluge systems have a cooling effect for process piping/equipment {{in the event of a}} fire. A deluge system is similar to a sprinkler system, except that the nozzles are open and dry upstream because a valve separates the water filled ring main from the nozzles. This allows high velocity suppression of fire water. By including the effect of deluge, passive fire protection may be designed taking into account that the deluge will reduce the heat load during a fire. In order to consider the cooling effect of deluge, proper documentation of the effect of deluge as well as on the reliability of the fire water supply system must be presented. This thesis intends to develop guidelines for how to document the reliability of such systems. A case study of the fire water system at an offshore platform (made anonymous and called Alfa) is performed to demonstrate the reliability analysis method. The analysis of the Alfa platform reveals an availability of the deluge system of 98. 92 %. OLF 070 states that the fire water supply system shall be in compliance with a SIL 2 demand. Hence, the probability of failure on demand shall fulfill 0. 001 &# 8804;PFD&# 8804; 0. 01. The analysis results show that the PFD is on the upper limit of this demand. However, it is expected that the real PFD is higher than this estimate because failures of blocking of nozzles are not considered due to lack of data sources. The analysis of the Alfa platform involves a fault tree analysis with both qualitative and quantitative interpretation. The quantitative approach consists of minimal cut set analysis, importance analysis and sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that the fire water systems unavailability is most dependent on the reliability of the <b>deluge</b> <b>valves.</b> The <b>deluge</b> <b>valves</b> constitute 95. 5 % of the total unavailability. A study to improve the reliability of the valves may be appropriate to improve the system reliability. In addition, it is shown that by designing fire areas that depends on one <b>deluge</b> <b>valves</b> instead of two decreases the system unavailability to about 50 % of the original unavailability. A data dossier is developed for the quantitative analysis of the Alfa fire water system. The work revealed lack of reliable generic data sources as well as reliable test data. The main challenges was to estimate reliability parameters for the <b>deluge</b> <b>valves,</b> the logic nodes, hydraulic systems in addition to blocking of nozzles due to corrosion and marine fouling. According to the operator, there are problems with the interpretation of test data due to problems with test routines. Since it is important that the fire water system is available on demand at all times, it is necessary to perform active maintenance immediately if a failure occurs. Hence, it happens that operators repair the failures and do not register this as a failure in the maintenance database. This implies that the number of failures in the test data is below the real values. The demand for reliable data sources on fire water systems is expected to increase due to the new regulations. This report suggests that a follow-up project should focus on developing a fire water system data dossier that can be used in similar reliability analyses. The ambition should be to quality assure the available data and to use the test data from companies operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf to develop estimates to the components mentioned above where there are no available estimates. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{corrective}} action decision document identifies and rationalizes the US Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's {{selection of a}} recommended {{corrective action}} alternative (CAA) appropriate to facilitate the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 135, Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Located on the Nevada Test Site (NTS), CAU 135 consists of three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : 25 - 02 - 01, Underground Storage Tanks, {{referred to as the}} Engine, Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly Waste Holdup Tanks and Vault; 25 - 02 - 03, Underground Electrical Vault, referred to as the <b>Deluge</b> <b>Valve</b> Pit at the Test Cell A Facility; and 25 - 02 - 10, Underground Storage Tank, referred to as the former location of an aboveground storage tank for demineralized water at the Test Cell A Facility. Two of these CASs (25 - 02 - 03 and 25 - 02 - 10) were originally considered as underground storage tanks, but were found to be misidentified. Further, radio logical surveys conducted by Bechtel Nevada in January 1999 found no radiological contamination detected above background levels for these two sites; therefore, the closure report for CAU 135 will recommend no further action at these two sites. A corrective action investigation for the one remaining CAS (25 - 02 - 01) was conducted in June 1999, and analytes detected during this investigation were evaluated against preliminary action levels. It was determined that contaminants of potential concern included polychlorinated biphenyls, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics, and radionuclides. Two corrective action objectives were identified for this CAS (i. e., prevention and mitigation of human exposure to sediments and surrounding areas), and subsequently two CAAs developed for consideration based on a review of existing data, future use, and current operations at the NTS. These CAAs were: Alternative 1 - No Further Action, and Alternative 2 - Unrestricted Release Decontamination and Verification Survey. Alternative 2 was chosen as the preferred CAA, after evaluation of technical merit which focused on performance, reliability, feasibility, and safety. This alternative was judged to meet all applicable state and federal regulations for closure of the site and reduces the potential future exposure pathways to the contaminated surfaces at this site...|$|E
40|$|Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 135, Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, {{was closed}} in {{accordance}} with the approved Corrective Action Plan (DOE/NV, 2000). CAU 135 consists of three Corrective Action Sites (CAS). Two of these CAS's were identified in the Corrective Action Investigation Data Quality Objective meeting as being improperly identified as underground storage tanks. CAS 25 - 02 - 03 identified as the <b>Deluge</b> <b>Valve</b> Pit was actually an underground electrical vault and CAS 25 - 02 - 10 identified as an Underground Storage Tank was actually a former above ground storage tank filled with demineralized water. Both of these CAS's are recommended for a no further action closure. CAS 25 - 02 - 01 the Underground Storage Tanks commonly referred to as the Engine Maintenance Assembly and Disassembly Waste Holdup Tanks and Vault was closed by decontaminating the vault structure and conducting a radiological verification survey to document compliance with the Nevada Test Site unrestricted use release criteria. The Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, (CAS 25 - 02 - 01), referred to as the Engine Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly (E-MAD) Waste Holdup Tanks and Vault, were used to receive liquid waste from all of the radioactive and cell service area drains at the E-MAD Facility. Based on the results of the Corrective Action Investigation conducted in June 1999, discussed in ''The Corrective Action Investigation Plan for Corrective Action Unit 135 : Area 25 Underground Storage Tanks, Nevada Test Site, Nevada'' (DOE/NV, 199 a), one sample from the radiological survey of the concrete vault interior exceeded radionuclide preliminary action levels. The analytes from the sediment samples exceeded the preliminary action levels for polychlorinated biphenyls, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics, and radionuclides. The CAU 135 closure activities consisted of scabbling radiological ''hot spots'' from the concrete vault, and the drilling removal of the cement-lined vault sump. Field activities began on November 28, 2000, and ended on December 4, 2000. After verification samples were collected, the vault was repaired with cement. The concrete vault sump, soil excavated beneath the sump, and compactable hot line trash were disposed at the Area 23 Sanitary Landfill. The vault interior was field surveyed following the removal of waste to verify that unrestricted release criteria had been achieved. Since the site is closed by unrestricted release decontamination and verification, post-closure care is not required...|$|E
