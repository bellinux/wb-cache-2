40|$|Federal States, when {{negotiating}} a treaty, sometimes {{insist on the}} inclusion of a <b>federal</b> <b>clause.</b> Usually, non-federal States do not easily agree on its inclusion and wording. Both positions can be eloquently advocated. It is to be appreciated that the request for the clause is ultimately a straightforward bona fide behaviour in negotiating the treaty, since it points out prospective difficulties in the implementation of treaty obligations. On the other hand, it is also true that, under the <b>federal</b> <b>clause,</b> the extent of the legal effects produced by the treaty could in part depend on the domestic laws of federal States and, due to the great variety of federal systems, the multilateral treaty concerned would have as much variation in scope as the number of federal States which ratified it. Provisions requiring from federal States the necessary information concerning the law and practice of the federation and its constituent units with regard to the provisions of the treaty may be a solution of the problem of legal certainty, but do not address the issue of the necessary safeguard of the object and purpose of the treaty. Recently, the negotiations of the UNESCO Convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions have seen renewed attention on this issue, reaching an interesting conclusion that is precisely directed at excluding any vagueness in the content of the obligations really assumed by federal States, refusing to simply reiterate a wording of the clause that had already been accepted in three other conventions concluded at UNESCO. This result shows that the ‘internationalization’ of a domestic issue through inclusion of a <b>federal</b> <b>clause</b> in a treaty is still problematic — in spite of the almost total indifference that accompanied {{the inclusion of a}}n extremely disputable <b>federal</b> <b>clause</b> in other UNESCO conventions — and that such a concession’, though not pre-emptively excluded, must be carefully considered. The central issue at stake is the real effect and scope of application of the clause, which is commented in this work from the international law point of view, taking into consideration several different features included in different federal clauses...|$|E
40|$|The World Heritage Convention (WHC) is {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} and widely ratified among UNESCO treaties on the protection of cultural and natural heritage. The Convention establishes a system of identification, presentation, and registration in an international List of cultural properties and natural sites of outstanding universal value. Throughout the years the WHC has progressively attained almost universal recognition by the international community, and even the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has recently considered sites inscribed in the World Heritage List as "values especially protection by the international community. " Besides, the WHC {{has been used as}} a model for other legal instruments dealing with cultural heritage, like the recently adopted (2003) Convention on the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. During its more than 30 years of life, the Convention has undergone extensive interpretation and evolution in its scope of application. Operational Guidelines, which are the implementing rules governing the operation of the Convention, have been extensively revised. New institutions such as the World Heritage Centre, have been established. New links, with the World Bank and the United Nations, have developed to take into account the economic and political dimension of world heritage conservation and management. However, many legal issues remain to be clarified. For example, what is the meaning of "outstanding universal value" in the context of cultural and natural heritage? How far can we construe "universal value" in terms of representivity between the concept of "World Heritage" and the sovereignty of the territorial state? Should World Heritage reflect a reasonable balance between cultural properties and natural sites? Is consent of the territorial state required for the inscription of a World Heritage property in the List of World Heritage in Danger? What is the role of the World Heritage Centre in the management of the WHC? No comprehensive work has been produced so far to deal with these and many other issues that have arisen in the interpretation and application of the WHC. This Commentary is intended to fill this gap by providing article by article analysis, in the light of the practice of the World Heritage Committee, other relevant treaty bodies, as well as of State parties and in the hope that it may be of use to academics, lawyers, diplomats and officials involved in the management and conservation of cultural and natural heritage of international significance.

Note that the United States abandoned its original confederal structure because it was unworkable. In 1789, a federal constitution was established containing a clear <b>federal</b> supremacy <b>clause.</b> The Supreme Court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot (77% of population) and Turkish Cypriot judges (18% of population), plus three foreign judges; thus foreign actors would cast deciding votes.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Constitution {{has survived}} {{for over two}} centuries, despite the Civil War and {{numerous}} other crises. In contrast, most national constitutions last less than two decades. Why has the Constitution sustained a largely stable democratic system while so many others have failed? A self-stabilizing constitution creates incentives for all relevant actors {{to abide by the}} rules. Drawing on earlier work, we argue that, to be self- stabilizing, a constitution must (1) lower stakes in politics for both ordinary citizens and powerful elite groups; (2) create focal points that facilitate citizen coordination against transgressions by government officials; and (3) enable adaptation over time. But {{what is the role of}} constitutional text in creating such stability? Drawing on the example of the <b>federal</b> Takings <b>Clause,</b> we argue that in addition to their explicit roles in defining rights and powers of government, constitutional clauses often serve a deeper structural purpose: providing the foundations for long-term constitutional stability. In this Article we examine the role of the <b>federal</b> Takings <b>Clause</b> in helping to create a self-stabilizing constitution in the United States. We argue that the text of the Takings Clause was designed to work together with other provisions of the proposed Constitution to lower the stakes in politics for political stakeholders by protecting individual property rights— including, notably, property rights in slaves. This clause was also designed to create a focal point to facilitate coordination against government invasions of property rights, especially at a time when few state constitutions provided similar protections...|$|R

5000|$|The {{topic of}} debate for each night was {{selected}} {{a month in}} advance. Some nights, the topic {{was related to the}} district of Kentucky's relationship to Virginia; other nights it was national in scope. For several consecutive meetings, the members debated the <b>federal</b> constitution, <b>clause</b> by clause, and suggested amendments. The resulting document was found in Thomas Speed's desk under the title [...] "The Constitution of the United States as Amended and Approved by the Political Club." [...] Perhaps the most remarkable suggestion was offered by George Muter on February 23, 1788: [...] "The Federal Constitution ought to be preceded by a Declaration of Rights!"

5000|$|The United States {{legal system}} {{includes}} [...] "uniformity clauses" [...] found in individual State Constitutions {{as well as}} the federal Constitution. Broadly speaking, these clauses require taxation to be applied evenly or uniformly within a jurisdiction. However, the exact wording and meaning of these clauses differs from constitution to constitution. Although the <b>federal</b> Uniformity <b>Clause</b> has never been an issue, the wording and interpretation of many state constitutions has created issues peculiar to each state. For example in 1898, the Maryland Court of Appeals (the highest state appellate court) ruled that the use of land value taxation in Hyattsville was unconstitutional. Shortly thereafter, an amendment to the Maryland Declaration of Rights specifically allowed for land value taxation where authorized by the State Legislature. [...] However, the uniformity clause in Pennsylvania has been broadly construed, and land value taxation has been used since 1913.|$|R

40|$|The {{education}} clauses {{of state}} constitutions require states to support schools {{that not only}} educate children adequately and equitably, but that are 2 ̆ 2 public 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 common. 2 ̆ 2 This Article argues that state-supported school choice can be consistent with these latter requirements. Individual choices, about where to live and whether to educate children privately, have long shaped traditional 2 ̆ 2 public 2 ̆ 2 schooling arrangements. The more direct role choice plays in school voucher and charter programs {{is also consistent with}} the requirement that schools be 2 ̆ 2 public. 2 ̆ 2 Such programs must ensure, however, that parents 2 ̆ 7 choices among schools are 2 ̆ 2 genuine and independent. 2 ̆ 2 This criterion, developed by the U. S. Supreme Court to test the constitutionality of school vouchers under the <b>Federal</b> Establishment <b>Clause,</b> also guarantees publicness. It does so by requiring that parents 2 ̆ 7 options in the educational marketplace be determined by market demand, minimally biased by government preferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{enforceability}} of forum-selection clauses {{is one of}} {{the most}} litigated jurisdictional issues in federal district courts. In a globalized society, forum-selection clauses reduce uncertainty. However, they present unique problems and, although they are liberally enforced by state and <b>federal</b> courts, forum-selection <b>clauses</b> are not always enforced by the forum court. Enforcement of forum-selection clauses is especially complex in diversity actions in <b>federal</b> court. Forum-selection <b>clauses</b> appear substantive and often have substantive effects; however, they operate procedurally. Federal courts unanimously hold that the validity of a forum-selection clause is a procedural question and therefore the question of validity is decided by federal law. However, federal courts were not always unanimous on this issue, and a minority once held that the validity of a forum-selection clause should be decided by state law because it is a contracts issue. This note argues that the former minority view reached the correct conclusion, but for the wrong reasons. In support of this argument, the note provides a background on the applicable law and the development of the Erie doctrine, the evolution of forum-selection clauses and their treatment in federal diversity cases, and the controversy over Erie 2 ̆ 7 s application to forum-selection clauses which are the result of flawed legal conclusions by courts and legal scholars at almost every state in the analysis. The note concludes that adherence to the Erie doctrine requires that state rather than federal law should determine the enforceability of forum-selection clauses, despite being an issue of procedure because of their special relationship to the substantive rights inherent in contracts...|$|R

This compact surrendered Virginia's claim to the area that eventually became the state of Kentucky, but imposed restrictions on Kentucky's ability to upset title to land sold or otherwise granted by the state of Virginia {{at the time of the}} compact.

30|$|The {{judicial}} {{power of}} the Federation resides in courts constituted under Article 121. Clause (1) of that Article mentions two High Courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction and status, that is, one in the states of Malaya known as the High Court in Malaya, {{and one in the}} states of Sabah and Sarawak known as the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak, together with lower courts as may be provided by <b>federal</b> law. <b>Clause</b> (1 A) states that the court referred to in clause (1) shall have no jurisdiction in respect of any matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Courts. The effect of Article 121 (1 A) has been judicially considered in a number of cases whose decisions serve to further reinforce the fact that the role played by Islamic law within the system is limited, and is circumscribed by such powers and jurisdiction as may be conferred upon the Syariah Court and its officials under the various State enactments (Ahmad 1999). In a way, it confirms the establishment of two court systems, one related to Syariah matters and the other non-Syariah cases.|$|R

40|$|The {{judicial}} system {{is struggling to}} accommodate {{the special needs of}} a rapidly growing number of child witnesses in its courtrooms. An increasingly popular approach to obtaining children 2 ̆ 7 s testimony is the use of 2 ̆ 2 shielding methods, 2 ̆ 2 which allow child witnesses to testify outside the presence of the defendant. When courts use these methods, the {{judicial system}} 2 ̆ 7 s obligation to protect children arguably conflicts with its duty to ensure criminal defendants 2 ̆ 7 right to confront their accusers as mandated by the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause. This Note examines the most recent development in child witness shielding, the Uniform Child Witness Testimony by Alternative Methods Act, drafted in 2002 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. This Note argues that states should not enact the proposed Act for several reasons. The Act violates the <b>Federal</b> Confrontation <b>Clause</b> as well as many state constitutions. Additionally, empirical evidence reveals harmful effects of shielded testimony not only on criminal defendants, but. also on the child witnesses themselves and on the judicial system as a whole. This Note concludes that pretrial education and counseling would better serve child witnesses without sacrificing defendants 2 ̆ 7 constitutional rights...|$|R

Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{claims to}} the contrary, the Federal {{government}} is severely limited in {{what it can do}} to regulate unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). States, on the other hand, as governments of general jurisdiction, have expansive powers that they are already using to grapple with the questions posed by UAS related to privacy, crime, and public safety. This chapter outlines the evolution of federal measures, noting their limitations, before delving into three categories of state law, related to law enforcement, criminal measures, and regulatory regimes. The chapter then turns to the history of state sovereignty, looking at states’ jurisdiction over persons and land within their bounds, before turning to the limits of federal inter-state commerce authorities. With river navigation and aviation serving as the forerunners of federal power, the chapter distinguishes the types of questions that accompany UAS, arguing that it is in relation to adjacent airspace and non-economic activities where the federal government is at its weakest in any effort to regulate the states. Up to 500 feet above the ground, states have sovereignty, with authority over roads, land, and waterways. Within this domain, <b>Federal</b> Commerce <b>Clause</b> powers only occupy a narrow area, leaving state police powers the dominant framework for UAS. The chapter concludes by highlighting the advantages of having states take the lead for UAS, focusing on the risk to rights of allowing the federal government to move into this realm and underscoring the importance {{in the role of the}} states as incubators of innovation...|$|R
40|$|In America’s Struggle for Same-Sex Marriage, Daniel Pinello {{explores the}} social and {{political}} underpinnings of the controversy surrounding so-called “gay” marriage.

This Book Review argues the importance to policy formation of a force Pinello tends to underemphasize: the counter-majoritarian influence of constitutional law and judicial review. The significance of this factor is considered primarily in relation to state constitutional amendments that purport to “define” marriage as being strictly between one man and one woman. This Book Review concludes that such amendments, by their nature, violate the <b>Federal</b> Equal Protection <b>Clause.</b> Separate consideration is given to the particular illegitimacy and vulnerability of such an amendment in Massachusetts, where state constitutional jurisprudence requires equal marriage rights for same-sex couples...|$|R
