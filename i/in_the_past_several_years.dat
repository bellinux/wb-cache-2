2500|$|There {{has long}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} originally recognized numbers of a [...] path over 3.5 hours was one continuous tornado or a tornado family. The sparse quality of tornado data because of the distance in the past and the lack of other tornadoes approaching the Tri-State Tornado path length and duration raised doubts. Furthermore, meteorological theory on tornado and supercell morphology and dynamics suggests such duration is highly improbable. In fact, several other historically very long track (VLT) tornadoes were subsequently found to be tornado families (notably the Woodward, Oklahoma tornado family of April 1947 and the Charleston-Mattoon, Illinois tornado family of May 1917). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>years</b> some VLT tornadoes and supercells did occur with 12 tornadoes exceeding [...] path lengths from 1980-2012 (and 60 since 1950).

2500|$|Revenues, by law, must {{go toward}} {{improving}} reservation communities. [...] The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requires that revenues go toward: [...] tribal government operations, {{promotion of the}} welfare of the tribe and its citizens, economic development, support of charitable organizations, and compensation to local non-Native governments for support of services provided by those governments. [...] Tribes have boosted their socioeconomic status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>years</b> by improving their infrastructure, but {{due to the lack of}} federal and state funding, have only been able to do so as a result of gaming enterprises. [...] For instance, tribes often build casino-related facilities that draw visitors such as hotels, conference centers, entertainment venues, golf courses, and RV parks. [...] Once a reservation has established a strong economic foundation, it can draw in businesses that are unrelated to gaming. [...] A common trend is that casinos stimulate the economy, and other business sustain it. [...] For instance, the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians built in a water bottling plant on the reservation and, along with three other tribes, invested in a hotel in Washington, D.C. [...] The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska are involved in a number of [...] businesses; some of which are Internet media, home manufacturing, used autos, and gas stations. [...] The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, a small band in California, has opened a Shell station, A drive-in, Coco's Restaurant, a water bottling plant, and a fruit orchard operation. [...] In addition to involvement in private corporations, Native nations have enough sustainability to bolster government programs. [...] Some of these projects include, but are not limited to: [...] providing law enforcement, fire fighters, schools, translators for emergency response, college scholarships, assistance with mortgage down payments, protection for endangered species, monitorship for water quality, care for elders, police cars, foster-care improvements, and health clinics.|$|E
