5|$|The {{identity}} of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the body into monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E

His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he {{had fallen out of}} favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E

Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E

30|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} avoid Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI) it is {{important}} to improve ventilation homogeneity. Homogeneous ventilation reduces lung stress and strain diminishing lung damage. To open up atelectatic tissue recruitment maneuvers can be performed.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba also {{condemned}} distinction {{based on}} religion or caste. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> {{if he was}} a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to you.|$|E

5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|E
5|$|The second theory {{posits that}} either {{increased}} {{blood flow to}} the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many patients with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> why this might be the case.|$|E

5|$|His {{greatest}} {{and most}} famous wartime contribution was the Seventh Symphony. The composer {{wrote the first}} three movements in Leningrad and completed the work in Kuibyshev (now Samara) {{where he and his}} family had been evacuated. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether Shostakovich really conceived the idea of the symphony with the siege of Leningrad in mind, it was officially claimed as a representation of the people of Leningrad’s brave resistance to the German invaders and an authentic piece of patriotic art at a time when morale needed boosting. The symphony was first premiered by the Bolshoi Theatre orchestra in Kuibyshev and was soon performed abroad in London and the United States. The most compelling performance was the Leningrad premiere by the Radio Orchestra in the besieged city. The orchestra had only fourteen musicians left, so the conductor Karl Eliasberg had to recruit anyone who could play a musical instrument to perform the symphony.|$|E
5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
5|$|The new peace {{would only}} last for two years; war recommenced in the {{aftermath}} of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.|$|E

5|$|Those {{in favour}} of viewing the objects as the {{personal}} hoard of Athanaric suggest that the gold was buried {{in an attempt to}} hide it from the Huns, who had defeated the Gothic Greuthungi north of the Black Sea and began moving down into Thervingian Dacia around 375. However, <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> why the gold would have remained buried, as Athanaric's treaty with Theodosius I (380) enabled him to bring his tribesmen under the protection of Roman rule prior to his death in 381. Other researchers have suggested that the hoard was that of an Ostrogothic king, with Rusu (1984) specifically identifying Gainnas, a Gothic general in the Roman army who was killed by the Huns around 400, as the owner of the hoard. Although this would help explain why the hoard remained buried, it fails to account for the conspicuous ring-barrow having been chosen as the site to hide such a large and valuable treasure.|$|E
5|$|In 324BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had {{entrusted}} huge treasures, absconded {{and sought}} refuge in Athens. The Assembly had initially {{refused to accept}} him, following Demosthenes's advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite the dissent of Hypereides, an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided {{to take control of}} Harpalus's money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.* I. Apostolidis, notes 1219, 1226 & 1229 in J. G. Droysen, History of Alexander the Great, 717–726; K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 303–309; D. Whitehead, Hypereides, 359–360; I. Worthington, Harpalus Affair, passim. <b>It</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.* K.

5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{government in}} ancient Macedonia was their monarchy, which lasted until 167 BC {{when it was}} abolished by the Romans. Written evidence about Macedonian governmental institutions made before Philip II of Macedon's reign is both rare and non-Macedonian in origin. The main sources of early Macedonian historiography are the works of Herodotus, Thucydides, Diodorus Siculus, and Justin. Contemporary accounts given by those such as Demosthenes were often hostile and unreliable; even Aristotle, who lived in Macedonia, provides us with terse accounts of its governing institutions. Polybius was a contemporary historian who wrote about Macedonia, while later historians include Livy, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Plutarch, and Arrian. The works of these historians affirm the hereditary monarchy of Macedonia and basic institutions, yet <b>it</b> <b>remains</b> <b>unclear</b> {{if there was an}} established constitution for Macedonian government. The main textual primary sources for the organization of Macedonia's military as it existed under Alexander the Great include Arrian, Quintus Curtius, Diodorus, and Plutarch, while modern historians rely mostly on Polybius and Livy for understanding detailed aspects of the Antigonid-period military.|$|E
