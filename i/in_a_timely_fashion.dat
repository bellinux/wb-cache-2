5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>fashion,</b> and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted {{by a lack of}} {{resources}} and funds. He instead had to enlist historians based outside of the AWM for some of the volumes, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill—author of the volumes on the Australian Army—caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan , dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timely</b> <b>fashion</b> and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012; two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{collapse}} of the junk bond market in the early 1990 s as a natural experiment to examine the effect of asymmetric timely loss recognition (ATLR) on speculative-grade (SPG) firms 2 ̆ 7 access to private debt markets and underinvestment. For a sample of 450 firm-years over the period 1988 - 1991, I find that SPG firms that recognize economic losses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>timelier</b> <b>fashion</b> experience <b>a</b> smaller reduction <b>in</b> debt financing and investment from the pre- to post-collapse period relative to SPG firms that recognize economic losses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less <b>timely</b> <b>fashion.</b> I also document that the effect of ATLR on debt financing and investment is more pronounced for SPG firms that lack collateral and are not followed by sell-side equity analysts. These findings support the notion that ATLR improves a firm 2 ̆ 7 s ability to access private debt markets, thereby attenuating underinvestment. They also suggest that both collateral and sell-side equity analysts serve as substitutes for ATLR to facilitate SPG firms 2 ̆ 7 access to private debt markets. Further analyses reveal that ATLR increases for SPG firms from the pre- to post-collapse period and this increase is more pronounced for SPG firms with net issuance of debt. This evidence suggests that firms adjust ATLR to obtain debt financing in response to private lenders 2 ̆ 7 demand for it...|$|R
