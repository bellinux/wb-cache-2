If we had had Davidson to bowl today it would have made a big difference to the whole outlook.|$|E
25|$|How {{distressing}} {{it is to}} {{be unable}} to send missionaries to Virginia, where there are five hundred thousand Negroes! It is indubitable that <b>had</b> <b>we</b> missionaries and funds to support them, prodigies would be effected in this vast and untilled field. In Maryland blacks are converted every day, {{and many of them are}} good Catholics and excellent Christians. At Baltimore many are frequent communicants, and three hundred or four hundred receive the Blessed Sacrament the first Sunday of every month. It is the same throughout Maryland, where there are a great many Catholics among the Negroes.|$|E

25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what <b>had</b> <b>we</b> hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to have worked {{for the destruction of}} the Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, <b>had</b> <b>we</b> done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E

500|$|On {{the day of}} the primary, Adjutant General Denhardt took National Guard {{troops into}} Harlan County, which was known for its history of {{election}} violence. The troops questioned voters, examined ballot boxes, and made several arrests. These actions were in direct violation of a restraining order issued by circuit court judge James M. Gilbert, but Denhardt claimed to be acting on orders from Laffoon. Denhardt later reported that [...] "We stopped the most stupendous, well-planned election steal ever attempted in Kentucky. Chandler would have gotten 15,000 votes <b>had</b> <b>we</b> not been here." [...] Denhardt was later arrested and charged with contempt of court for violating the restraining order.|$|E
500|$|We {{should not}} have condescended to notice the {{senseless}} and wicked sophistry of this writer [...] <b>had</b> <b>we</b> not considered {{him as one of}} the representatives of a class of men by whom literature is more than at any former period disgraced [...] it might not be unprofitable to show how small a portion of talent and literature was necessary for carrying on the trade of sedition. [...] The few specimens which we have selected of his ethics and his criticism are more than sufficient to prove that Mr. Hazlitt's knowledge of Shakespeare and the English language is exactly {{on a par with the}} purity of his morals and the depth of his understanding.|$|E
500|$|Bill Drummond {{summed up}} The JAMs' {{approach}} to composition {{in the first}} [...] "KLF Information Sheet", sent out in October 1987: [...] "We made [...] not giving a shit for soul boy snob values or any other values, we just went in and made the noise we wanted to hear and the stuff {{that came out of}} our mouths.... Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we <b>had.</b> <b>We</b> pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E

500|$|... tall, slim boy, {{straight}} as an arrow. His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, <b>had</b> <b>we</b> not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We can look back now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
500|$|The 1988 {{season was}} marred by {{injuries}} to the Browns' quarterbacks. Kosar was injured in the opener against Kansas City Chiefs and two backups were subsequently injured, leaving Don Strock, who the Browns signed as an emergency fill-in, to start before Kosar's return. Kosar came back but was hurt again {{at the end of}} the regular season. Despite the rotating cast of quarterbacks, Cleveland managed to finish with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs as a wild-card team. Cleveland met the Houston Oilers in the wild-card playoff round at home, but lost the game 24–23. Four days after the Oilers loss, Schottenheimer and Modell announced that the coach would leave the team by mutual consent. Modell felt hiring an offensive coordinator was necessary to keep pace with the Oilers and the Bengals, a pair of divisional opponents then on the rise, but Schottenheimer said it [...] "became evident that some of the differences we <b>had,</b> <b>we</b> weren't going to be able to resolve." [...] Modell named Bud Carson as his replacement.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{his more}} stridently [...] "non-interventionist" [...] father, Paul concedes {{a role for}} American armed forces abroad, {{including}} permanent foreign military bases. He {{has said that he}} blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014, and that the Iraq War [...] "emboldened" [...] Iran. Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry have responded by calling Paul an isolationist, but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position. Paul stated: [...] "I personally believe that this group [...] would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful <b>had</b> <b>we</b> not been supplying their allies in the war [...]" [...] Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate. Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands. In 2015, Paul called for a defense budget of $697 billion in 2016. In 2011, shortly after being elected, he proposed a budget which specified $542 billion in defense spending.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 2.5 out of 4, saying [...] "This isn't a great heist movie {{for a lot}} of reasons, {{beginning}} with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line," [...] but appreciated that the comedy did not [...] "go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words", calling it [...] "funny in an innocent screwball kind of way." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other {{to the rest of the}} cast." [...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might have been a bit more tense <b>had</b> <b>we</b> been able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
500|$|Maxwell {{bought the}} Mirror Group in 1986 and floated it in May 1991, {{appointing}} Clark {{to the board}} of directors. Maxwell claimed that the offer he made Clark would appeal to even a [...] "one-eyed Bulgarian peasant". Clark claimed that he tried to make Maxwell follow conventional business practices and remained convinced that [...] "until quite close to the end, he never did anything I asked him not to do". It was only after Maxwell's unusual death on 5 November 1991 that financial mismanagement of the Mirror Group came to light. There was evidence of 29 unusual payments of £230 million from Mirror to other Maxwell companies within one year in a fraud that eventually cost the company, and its pension fund, £492 million. Clark claimed that there had been no evidence for the directors to act on against Maxwell, telling the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) that [...] "No system of internal control, however elaborate, can stop fraudulent collusion by a group of individuals holding authority and trust. None of us [...] would have taken on the job <b>had</b> <b>we</b> thought Maxwell was a crook. How many can stand up and say: 'We said he was a crook a year ago'?" [...] Clark's position was disputed by the Department of Trade and Industry, which determined that the two non-executive directors, Clark and Alan Clements, should have questioned the payments. At the EGM Clark almost lost his usual polite nature when he was accused of being a Maxwell [...] "crony" [...] by Rupert Allason and had to rule a no-confidence vote as out of order.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the character has been mixed. BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, he felt her [...] "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her {{to a combination of}} Catwoman and [...] "the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from Angel". However, he later admitted Bela was [...] "a great comic foil". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] with the [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be [...] "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel [...] "even a tiny bit sorry for [...] " [...] during her death scene. Writing that [...] "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing <b>had</b> <b>we</b> glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently"not either annoying or downright contemptible"and deemed her [...] "a wasted opportunity to give us an interesting female foil for the boys". Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale [...] "No Rest For The Wicked" [...] that Bela [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a [...] "decent traveling [...] ". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them [...] "look ridiculous", she [...] "really liked" [...] the character. Overall, she felt Cohan [...] "did one hell of a job".|$|E
