5|$|The race {{started at}} 4:48p.m.; Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was black-flagged by NASCAR because debris was <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left on the track. On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to drive down the track. He also made contact with Jamie McMurray, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first caution flag {{and the appearance of}} the pace car. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained on the track.|$|E
25|$|Rob's father, Francis Wilco is {{a retired}} {{firefighter}} and {{former member of the}} United States Marine Corps (1969–1974) who presumably saw time in Vietnam. He reluctantly pet-sits Bucky and Satchel from time to time, has thinning hair, and is usually pictured with a cigarette <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth.|$|E
25|$|Beth (Kate Winslet) is {{a single}} businesswoman who goes {{on a blind date}} with Davis (Hugh Jackman), the city's most {{eligible}} bachelor. When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck. Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that nobody seems to be surprised by it. When two friends of Davis (Roy Jenkins and Katie Finneran) come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.|$|E
60|$|At last a link parted {{beneath my}} efforts, {{and a moment}} later Tardos Mors was free, though a few inches of {{trailing}} chain still <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> ankle.|$|R
60|$|Toby, {{followed}} by the other proprietors, rushed out at this alarming bit of news, and, sure enough, there was the monkey dancing around {{on the top of}} the tent like a crazy person, while the rope with which he had been tied <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{dropped the}} lapels of the coat and, {{plunging}} {{his hand into}} his breast, jerked feverishly at something under his shirt. At last he produced a small square pocket of soft leather, which must have been hanging like a scapulary <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck by the tape whose broken ends <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> fist.|$|R
500|$|A [...] New York Times profile {{said that}} [...] "his life story reads {{more like the}} script of an Errol Flynn adventure", though the stories he told about himself were often dubious. He was once {{described}} as [...] "a feisty little man who always had a cigarette <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lips and {{looked more like a}} bartender than a choreographer." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags {{of money in}} each hand and a grin on his face. [...] Another shows only Hanna's hand and wrist—and McKinley <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> fob chain. [...] One that {{is intended to be}} funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna's skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote is for sale. [...] Another shows Hanna wearing a Napoleon hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising a mask of McKinley's face to his own.|$|E
2500|$|The slang term [...] "bogarting" [...] {{refers to}} taking an unfairly long {{time with a}} shared {{marijuana}} joint. Allegedly, it derives from Bogart's style of cigarette smoking, leaving his cigarette <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth between puffs.|$|E
60|$|The man at {{the rear}} of the guardhouse moved silently along the side of the {{structure}} until he stood within a few feet of the unsuspecting sentinel, hidden from him by the corner of the building. A heavy revolver <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> right hand. He held it loosely by the barrel, and waited.|$|R
60|$|The horse {{seemed to}} {{recognize}} Dave, for {{he gave a}} low whinny and rubbed his cold nose on the youth's jacket sleeve. A broken halter <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck, but he possessed neither saddle nor bridle. He {{was covered with a}} cold moisture, showing that he had run considerably after having broken away.|$|R
60|$|Let me be calm. That portrait, - {{smiling as}} once he smiled on me; that cane, - {{dangling}} as I {{have seen it}} <b>dangle</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand I know not how oft; those legs that have glided through my nightly dreams and never stopped to speak; the perfectly gentlemanly, though false original, - can I be mistaken? O no, no.|$|R
60|$|Less {{than five}} minutes brought up Oak again, running at the same pace, with two halters <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "There goes an officer," [...] whispered Fred, as a tall youth went {{by with a}} sword <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belt. [...] "Look at {{the gold}} braid, will you? Isn't it swell?" [...] he added, in deep admiration.|$|E
60|$|His wife sewed {{on as if}} she had {{not heard}} him; his {{daughter}} noisily turned over a leaf and continued to read, as if she were pleasantly interested and had known no interruption. Siegmund waited, with his slipper <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand, looking from one to another.|$|E
6000|$|CURWEN, {{pulling a}} light yellow glove <b>from</b> <b>his</b> pocket: [...] "Oh!" [...] He {{staggers}} {{away from the}} grating and stays himself against the wall, the mistaken glove <b>dangling</b> limply <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
50|$|He has a {{long neck}} {{that looks like a}} very thick vacuum cleaner tube. His head is a tall metal {{canister}} with a handle that forms his nose, a large mouth at the bottom, a pair of eyes farther up and a hairbrush on top. Several cables <b>dangle</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head down to the heap of machinery below him. A computer monitor forms his chest, while farther down a reel of film from a film projector {{on one side and a}} mechanical arm on the other side protrude from the heap.|$|R
50|$|The Deception {{template}} {{was maintained}} for the 2011 reboot with minor differences. Ermac's outfit was more form-fitting with the mask neater in presentation and conformed {{to the shape}} of his head, but emphasis was placed on black with the red palette a darker carmine and reduced to trimming on the tabard and on the underarm and outer thigh sections of the suit. A new cosmetic addition was two long straps, similar to the ones that extended from the back of <b>his</b> mask, that <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forearms, and the green gems and their placement remained unchanged, with the forehead mount smaller in size.|$|R
60|$|There came a tap at the door. He {{sprang up}} eagerly, {{thinking}} that the ecclesiastic might have arrived. It was, however, only his personal attendant, to say that Louvois would crave an interview. Close at his heels came the minister himself, high-nosed and heavy-chinned. Two leather bags were <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, naibours! Be ye {{rich men}} or be ye poor men, that ye must needs {{come to the}} world's end at this time o' night?' exclaimed a voice at this instant; and, turning their heads, they saw a rickety {{individual}} shambling round from the back door with a horn lantern <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here comes {{one of my}} scouts," [...] said Curtis, as a young Tetong galloped up to the gate, {{threw himself}} from his reeking pony, and strode into the hall-way without knocking, his spurs clattering, his quirt <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wrist. As he stood before his chief, {{delivering}} his message with shadowy silence and swiftness, Elsie thrilled with the dramatic significance of the scene. The stern, almost haughty face {{of the young man}} was in keeping with his duties.|$|E
60|$|A tall young Tetong slipped <b>from</b> <b>his</b> tired {{horse and}} {{approached}} the Captain. In his extended hand lay an envelope, which gleamed in the firelight. As Curtis took this letter the messenger, squatting before him, began to roll a cigarette. His lean and powerful face was shadowed by a limp sombrero {{and his eyes were}} hidden, but his lips were grave and calm. A quirt <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> right wrist, and in the two braids of his hair green eagle-plumes were twisted. The star on the lapel of his embroidered vest showed him to be a police-officer. From the intensity of his attitude it was plain he was studying his agent's face in order to read thereon the character of the message he had brought.|$|R
5000|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{man wearing}} a leather jerkin, lace collar and cuffs, and a floppy hat tipped at an angle. He is gesturing with his right hand and holding a glass of white wine in his left hand. He seems caught in a moment of discussion with the viewer. A medallion <b>dangles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck chain, which Hofstede de Groot claimed was a likeness of Prince Maurice of Orange. [...] Various experts have claimed the painting represents the sense of taste. In old Dutch inventories, the theme of a [...] "merry drinker" [...] or [...] "jolly toper" [...] occurs often, and this was probably not a portrait but meant as a genre piece.|$|R
5000|$|Interior: A {{reclining}} male figure, draped {{from the}} waist down, leans against a doubled-over bolster. With the forefinger of his outstretched right hand, he holds a kylix by the handle. A wreath, now so worn as to be all but invisible, <b>dangles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> left hand. Hanging on the wall at his feet is a flute case of spotted animal skin. The figure is a participant in a Greek symposium (drinking party) and is shown playing the popular game of kottabos, in which contestants attempted to hit various types of targets with wine dregs flung {{from the bottom of}} a kylix. A kalos inscription reading [...] "HO PAIS KALOS" [...] ("the boy is beautiful") appears above the head and knee of the symposiast.|$|R
60|$|The {{conclusion}} of this affecting narrative {{brought them to the}} house. In the passage they encountered Mr Mould the undertaker; a little elderly gentleman, bald, and in a suit of black; with a notebook in his hand, a massive gold watch-chain <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> fob, and a face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of satisfaction; so that he looked as a man might, who, in the very act of smacking his lips over choice old wine, tried to make believe it was physic.|$|E
60|$|Shortly afterward, Gomez {{entered the}} lounge and saw {{only one person}} there, but this individual's {{appearance}} surprised him. As the light was not good, he strolled toward the drowsy gentleman who lay negligently in a big chair with a newspaper <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand. He wore a soft hat, pulled down upon his forehead as if to shade his eyes, and a loose dark cloak hung over his shoulder. He looked like a Cuban and although Gomez noticed that his nails were short and broken, this might {{be accounted for by}} his having something to do with sugar-making machinery.|$|E
60|$|On {{the plain}} below Tommy Dodd was lecturing on the beauties of a cavalry charge by night, and Tallantire, bowed on his saddle, was gasping hysterically {{because there was}} a sword <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wrist flecked with the blood of the Khusru Kheyl, the tribe that Orde had kept in leash so well. When a Rajpoot trooper pointed out that the skewbald's right ear had been taken off at the root by some blind slash of its unskilled rider, Tallantire broke down altogether, and laughed and sobbed till Tommy Dodd made him lie down and rest.|$|E
60|$|The charmer sat motionless, and {{the woman}} in the dim {{background}} ceased her weird rubbing of the drum. Haddo seized the snake and opened its mouth. Immediately it fastened on his hand, and the reptile teeth went deep into his flesh. Arthur watched him for signs of pain, but he did not wince. The writhing snake <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand. He repeated a sentence in Arabic, and, with the peculiar suddenness of a drop of water falling from a roof, the snake fell to the ground. The blood flowed freely. Haddo spat upon the bleeding place three times, muttering words they could not hear, and three times he rubbed the wound with his fingers. The bleeding stopped. He stretched out his hand for Arthur to look at.|$|R
500|$|Jeff {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "cartoon-like, diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in Australia with the Marlboro Man". Similarly, Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to [...] "bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'". Alicia Lu of Bustle wrote: Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice for branding, but he's a cowboy. Look at his regal cowboy hat, his spiffy red cowboy boots, and the way that cigarette nonchalantly <b>dangles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lips – doesn't Jeff remind you of a figure from days of yore? If you squint, I swear you'll see the Marlboro Man.|$|R
50|$|Kuba Kowalski (Gustaw Holoubek) is an {{alcoholic}} who {{spends most of}} his day in his room with a bottle of vodka for company and a noose <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> the ceiling. <b>His</b> ruminations are periodically interrupted by his girlfriend Krystyna (Aleksandra Slaska) banging on the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay—Ay—Ay," [...] was the shout, [...] "turn him—turn him!" [...] We set off full pelt. The bewildered little brute, scared by Leslie's wild {{running and}} crying, turned from its course, and dodged across the hill, {{threading}} its terrified course {{through the maze}} of lying sheaves, spurting on in a painful zigzag, now bounding over an untied bundle of corn, now swerving from the sound of a shout. The little wretch was hard pressed; George rushed upon it. It darted into some fallen corn, but he had seen it, and had fallen on it. In an instant he was up again, and the little creature was <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|The man slid swiftly {{down the}} last thirty feet, and then {{balanced}} himself on a cross-bar while {{he looked at the}} little group in the lift. As he stood there, clad in a leather suit, with his pliers and other tools <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brown belt, he was a figure to please the eye of an artist. The man was very tall and gaunt, with great straggling limbs and every appearance of giant strength. His face was a remarkable one, noble and yet sinister, with dark eyes and hair, a prominent hooked nose, and a beard which flowed over his chest. He steadied himself with one knotted hand, while the other held a steel hammer dangling by his knee.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was past}} ten when Mr. Polly found himself riding back towards Easewood {{in a broad}} {{moonlight}} with a little Japanese lantern <b>dangling</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> handle bar and making a fiery circle of pinkish light on and round about his front wheel. He was mightily pleased with himself and the day. There had been four-ale to drink at supper mixed with gingerbeer, very free and jolly in a jug. No shadow fell upon the agreeable excitement of his mind until he faced the anxious and reproachful face of Johnson, who had been sitting up for him, smoking and trying to read the odd volume of [...] "Purchas his Pilgrimes,"--about the monk who went into Sarmatia and saw the Tartar carts.|$|E
5000|$|When {{they are}} finally over London, Alex realizes {{that there is}} not much time left before noon. He spots several parachutes and uses one to jump off the plane. Mr. Grin turns the plane around hoping to ram into Alex. Alex pulls out the Game Boy Color and {{activates}} a cartridge disguised as a game called [...] "Bomber Boy", which activates a smoke bomb. Unable to see, Mr. Grin loses control of the plane and fatally crashes into a dock near the River Thames. Alex crashes through the roof of the Science Museum and <b>dangles</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parachute which had gotten caught on a beam. Alex draws the gun he took from a guard back at Sayle's mansion and fires blindly at the Stormbreaker computer, one accidentally hitting the Prime Minister and Sayle himself being struck by two more, though he inexplicably vanishes. Mrs. Jones saves Alex's life by ordering security not to open fire on him. MI6 immediately recalls all the computers, citing [...] "safety issues".|$|R
60|$|The knight errant, whose {{mind had}} been filled {{by the thought of}} the maiden whom he had left behind at St. Jean--the same whose glove <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> helmet--had {{observed}} nothing that had occurred. Hence, all that met his eyes was a noble yellow horse, which was tethered by the track, and a small young man, who appeared to be a lunatic since he had undressed hastily {{in the heart of the}} forest, and stood now with an eager anxious face clad in his underlinen amid the scattered debris of his garments. Of such a person the high Lord of Pons could take no notice, and so he pursued his inexorable way, his arrogant eyes looking out into the distance and his thoughts set intently upon the maiden of St. Jean. He was dimly aware that the little crazy man in the undershirt ran a long way beside him in his stockings, begging, imploring and arguing.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Conant is {{difficult}} to describe because he was like dozens of men one meets every day, at least in outward appearance. He was neither tall nor short, lean nor fat, handsome nor ugly, attractive nor repulsive. Yet Peter Conant must {{not be considered a}} nonentity because he was commonplace in person, for he possessed mannerisms that were peculiar. He would open his eyes very wide and stare at one steadily until the person became confused and turned away. The gaze was not especially shrewd, but it was disconcerting because steadfast. When he talked he would chop off his words, one by one, with a distinct pause between each, and that often made it hard to tell whether he had ended his speech or still had more to say. When very earnest or interested he would play with a locket that <b>dangled</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> watch chain; otherwise he usually stood with his hands clasped behind his back.|$|R
