It has been found in the present study that the effect of fluid viscoelasticity on spinning stability can be classified into two diametrically different kinds: for extension-thickening fluids an increase in viscoelasticity increases tension, decreases tension sensitivity and, thus, stabilizes the spinning, whereas it decreases tension, increases tension sensitivity and, thus, destabilizes the spinning of extension-thinning fluids...|$|E

Proper scaling reveals the aspect ratio, i. e. the ratio of the initial film half-width to the film length, together with the fluidity and the inlet velocity as independent, dimensionless control parameters. Moreover, we introduce the local Trouton ratio as a measure for the type of elongational deformation, which can be uniaxial, planar, or a combination of both. In the case of purely uniaxial or planar deformations, a one-dimensional model is sufficient. The influence of the control parameters on the <b>draw</b> <b>resonance</b> instability, including a threshold to unconditional stability, is visualized by several stability maps. Special cases of viscous-gravity and viscous-inertia models are analyzed separately due to their practical importance. Gravity appears to influence the aspect ratio at which the critical draw ratio is maximum and amplifies the stabilizing effect of the neck-in. Inertia increases the stabilization due to neck-in, eventually leading to a window of unconditional stability within the analyzed region of aspect ratios. The mechanism underlying the complete suppression of <b>draw</b> <b>resonance</b> is presented, using exclusively steady state analysis. Additionally, the stabilizing mechanisms of gravity and neck-in are revealed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of viscosity and inlet velocity on the <b>draw</b> <b>resonance</b> instability of film casting processes is quantitatively analysed. By linear stability {{analysis of a}} Newtonian model including inertia and gravity effects, stability curves for different control parameter values are calculated numerically. For this purpose, we propose a scaling law which separates the fluidity, i. e. the reciprocal viscosity and the inlet velocity into two independent dimensionless parameters. This new scaling evidences a minimum of stability, separating two regimes of opposite behaviour: one for which increasing the inlet flow rate has a destabilizing effect due to viscosity and one for which increasing the inlet flow rate has a stabilizing effect due to gravity and inertia; increasing the fluidity has always a stabilizing effect. By fitting the stability curves with an appropriate postulated function, {{we are able to}} construct correlations between the critical draw ratio, the fluidity and the inlet velocity. For the first time regimes of negligible inertia or negligible gravity effects are revealed as well as a regime of unconditional stability.

40|$|We {{study the}} drawing of a Newtonian viscous sheet under the {{influence}} of cooling with temperature dependence of the viscosity. Classically this problem has an instability called <b>draw</b> <b>resonance,</b> when the draw ratio Dr, which is the ratio of the outlet velocity relative to the inlet velocity, is beyond a critical value Drc. The heat transfer from the surface compared to the bulk energy advection is conveniently measured by the Stanton number St. Usual descriptions of the problem are one-dimensional and rigorously apply for St > 1. The transition between those two regimes occurs at St = O(1) where the stabilizing effect due to cooling is most efficient, and for which we propose a mechanism for stabilization, based on phase shifts between the tension and axial-averaged flow quantities. Away from this transition, the sheet is always shown to be unstable at smaller draw ratios. Additionally, in the limit of St → ∞, the heat exchange is such that the temperature of the fluid obtains the far-field temperature, which hence corresponds to a ‘prescribed temperature’ regime. This dynamical situation is comparable to the isothermal regime {{in the sense that the}} temperature perturbation has no effect on the stability properties.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a process of}} fiber spinning, where a viscous (but not necessarily Newtonian) fluid is being pushed through a narrow "spinning hole" and, upon exit, is being stretched, the latter step {{in order to obtain}} an acceptable alignment of the (polymeric) molecules in the fluid. This alignment is necessary for the final mechanical properties of the fiber. After leaving the spinning hole, the fluid passes through a layer of air (the "air gap") and enters a bath, in which it solidifies almost instantaneously. Somewhere inside this bath, the fiber is being drawn by a wheel, which delivers the force, necessary for the stretching process. When the speed of the drawing wheel is set to high, it is impossible to obtain a uniform fiber: one clearly observes variations in the fiber diameter. This phenomenon is called <b>draw</b> <b>resonance.</b> Experimental evidence suggests that the draw ratio, that is, the ratio between the speeds at the wheel and at the exit of the spinning hole, is the unique parameter to steer the onset of <b>draw</b> <b>resonance,</b> and for Newtonian fluids this is known to be true. In the Newtonian case, the onset of <b>draw</b> <b>resonance</b> can be shown to be a Hopf bifurcation. The question, asked to the Study Group, was to extend the results on Newtonian fluids to fluids with more general rheologies, with power law fluids as a first choice. What came out of the Study Group was not yet a final solution to this problem, but rather an attempt to come to an easier formulation of the model equations. At the workshop, we thought that we had succeeded, but afterwards we found that there was a hidden mistake, which we could not easily correct. This mistake in itself is worth mentioning, because the approach we tried may be successful in other cases, and this mistake may easily slip into the considerations there. In this note, we restrict ourselves to the Newtonian case, because it is easy to describe the mistake in this setting, and the power law setting would not add anything. As a final remark, we note that the "power law case" has been solved now, by using similar methods as we did in the Newtonian case. (A publication is in preparation. ...|$|E

Linear stability analysis combined with the Laplace transformation of the resulting linear system is applied to find parameters that determine mathematical and thus process instability.

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes two {{hierarchical}} {{schemes for}} learning, one for clustering {{and the other}} for classification problems. Both schemes can be implemented on a fuzzy lattice neural network (FLNN) architecture, to be introduced herein. The corresponding two learning models <b>draw</b> on adaptive <b>resonance</b> theory (ART) and min–max neurocomputing principles but their application domain is a mathematical lattice. Therefore they can handle more general types of data in addition to N-dimensional vectors. The FLNN neural model stems from a cross-fertilization of lattice theory and fuzzy set theory. Hence a novel theoretical foundation is introduced in this paper, that is the framework of fuzzy lattices or FL-framework, based on the concepts fuzzy lattice and inclusion measure. Sufficient conditions for the existence of an inclusion measure in a mathematical lattice are shown. The performance of the two FLNN schemes, that is for clustering and for classification, compares quite well with other methods and it is demonstrated by examples on various data sets including several benchmark data sets.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the present paper is a {{simplified}} model for a symmetric bistable system with memory or delay, the reference model, which {{in the presence of}} noise exhibits a phenomenon similar to what is known as stochastic resonance. The reference model is given by a one dimensional parametrized stochastic differential equation with point delay, basic properties whereof we check. With a view to capturing the effective dynamics and, in particular, the resonance-like behaviour of the reference model we construct a simplified or reduced model, the two state model, first in discrete time, then in the limit of discrete time tending to continuous time. The main advantage of the reduced model is that it enables us to explicitly calculate the distribution of residence times which in turn can be used to characterize the phenomenon of noise-induced <b>resonance.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on what has been proposed in the physics literature, we outline a heuristic method for establishing the link between the two state model and the reference model. The resonance characteristics developed for the reduced model can thus be applied to the original model. logit model, utility maximization nested logit, non-normalized nested logit, simulation study...|$|R
40|$|The LHC is {{actively}} searching for narrow dijet resonances corresponding to physics beyond the Standard Model. Among the many resonances {{that have been}} postulated (e. g., colored vectors, scalars, and fermions) one {{that would have a}} particularly large production rate at the LHC would be a scalar diquark produced in the s-channel via fusion of two valence quarks. In previous work, we introduced a color discriminant variable that distinguishes among various dijet <b>resonances,</b> <b>drawing</b> on measurements of the dijet resonance mass, total decay width and production cross-section. Here, we show that this model-independent method applies well to color-triplet and color-sextet scalar diquarks, distinguishing them clearly from other candidate resonances. We also introduce a more transparent theoretical formulation of the color discriminant variable that highlights its relationship to the branching ratios of the resonance into incoming and outgoing partons and to the properties of those partons. While the original description of the color discriminant variable remains convenient for phenomenological use upon discovery of a new resonance, the new formulation makes it easier to predict the value of the variable for a given class of resonance.
