The latest “Hartz IV” reform in labour market policy gave <b>job</b> <b>centers</b> new options for the support of unemployed with addictions and led to new cooperation needs between addiction counselling services and <b>job</b> <b>centers.</b> Within the new Social Law SGB II <b>job</b> <b>centers</b> have the opportunity to impose financial sanctions for long term unemployed with addictions who are not willing to see addiction counselling services. Two online-surveys were conducted in which 323 of existing 439 <b>job</b> <b>centers</b> took part and 80 of 135 addiction counselling services, who were named by the participating <b>job</b> <b>centers</b> as cooperating partners. Results show a large heterogeneity in the level of implementation as regards the organisational setting (number of unemployed per placement officer, level of addiction specific qualification, specific concepts for working with addicted unemployed) and the practice with addicted unemployed. This involves the recognition of addictions, the cooperation with addiction counselling services and drug rehabilitation, the imposition of sanctions and specific job placement programmes. Job integration of long term social security recipients with addictions is for the most part not successful. Progress can be made by an intensified cooperation with the addiction counselling and support system, a better placement officer/unemployed relation, addiction specific qualifications for placement officers, consideration of addiction specific needs in job placement programmes and – as practice is in many cases not in accordance with the law - information on data protection and professional secrecy...|$|R
40|$|Polycentrism {{in cities}} is studied {{with the help}} of an {{agent-based}} model grounded in the Alonso, Muth, Mills (AMM) framework, using microeconomic interactions between heterogeneous agents. This model is shown to reproduce the standard urban equilibrium with two income groups. Two <b>job</b> <b>centers</b> at various distances from each other are introduced, and the economic, social and environmental outcomes of these various polycentric spatial structures are presented. Then we introduce two-worker households whose partners may work in different <b>job</b> <b>centers.</b> If all households are "split", i. e. the two partners work in different <b>job</b> <b>centers,</b> polycentrism is shown to be undesirable. When various two-worker households are mixed we find that polycentrism is desirable, as long as centers are not moved too far apart from each other. The environmental outcome is also positive for small values of this distance, but this positive effect is mitigated by the fact that housing surfaces increase. urban economics; location choice; polycentric city; two-worker households; agent-based model...|$|R
