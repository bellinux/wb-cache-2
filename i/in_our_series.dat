We {{have thus}} seen how the nutritive {{material}} is {{taken into the}} animal's system and distributed over its body, and incidentally, we have noted how the resultant products of the creature's activity are removed. The essence of the whole process, as we have already stated, is the decomposition and partial oxydation of certain complex chemical compounds to water, carbon dioxide, a low nitrogenous body, which finally {{takes the form of}} urea, and other substances. We may now go on to a more detailed study, the microscopic study, or histology, of the tissues in which metaboly and kataboly occur, but before we do this it will be convenient to glance for a moment at another of our animal types-- the Amoeba, the lowest as the rabbit is the highest, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is well said, {{in every}} sense, that a man's {{religion}} {{is the chief}} fact with regard to him. A man's, or a nation of men's. By religion I do not mean here the church-creed which he professes, the articles of faith which he will sign and, in words or otherwise, assert; not this wholly, in many cases not this at all. We see men {{of all kinds of}} professed creeds attain to almost all degrees of worth or worthlessness under each or any of them. This is not what I call religion, this profession and assertion; which is often only a profession and assertion from the outworks of the man, from the mere argumentative region of him, if even so deep as that. But the thing a man does practically believe (and this is often enough without asserting it even to himself, much less to others); the thing a man does practically lay to heart, and know for certain, concerning his vital relations to this mysterious Universe, and his duty and destiny there, that is in all cases the primary thing for him, and creatively determines all the rest. That is his religion; or, it may be, his mere scepticism and no-religion: the manner it is in which he feels himself to be spiritually related to the Unseen World or No-World; and I say, if you tell me what that is, you tell me to a very great extent what the man is, what the kind of things he will do is. Of a man or of a nation we inquire, therefore, first of all, What religion they had? Was it Heathenism,--plurality of gods, mere sensuous representation of this Mystery of Life, and for chief recognized element therein Physical Force? Was it Christianism; faith in an Invisible, not as real only, but as the only reality; Time, through every meanest moment of it, resting on Eternity; Pagan empire of Force displaced by a nobler supremacy, that of Holiness? Was it Scepticism, uncertainty and inquiry whether there was an Unseen World, any Mystery of Life except a mad one;--doubt as to all this, or perhaps unbelief and flat denial? Answering of this question is giving us the soul {{of the history of the}} man or nation. The thoughts they had were the parents of the actions they did; their feelings were parents of their thoughts: it was the unseen and spiritual in them that determined the outward and actual;--their religion, as I say, was the great fact about them. In these Discourses, limited as we are, it will be good to direct our survey chiefly to that religious phasis of the matter. That once known well, all is known. We have chosen as the first Hero <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> Odin the central figure of Scandinavian Paganism; an emblem to us of a most extensive province of things. Let us look for a little at the Hero as Divinity, the oldest primary form of Heroism.|$|E

5000|$|For some {{functions}} (such as {{one that}} computes the series for [...] ) {{there is not an}} obvious base case implied by the input data; for these one may add a parameter (such as the number of terms to be added, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> example) to provide a 'stopping criterion' that establishes the base case. Such an example is more naturally treated by co-recursion, where successive terms in the output are the partial sums; this can be converted to a recursion by using the indexing parameter to say [...] "compute the nth term (nth partial sum)".|$|E
5000|$|Beyond {{the creator}} rights struggle, {{the film is}} also {{important}} for allowing one of its guest-stars to graduate to the regular cast. In Girl on the Run, Edd Byrnes played a vicious killer, Kevin Smiley, who compulsively combed his hair. When the youth audience reacted favorably to his performance, {{he was given a}} new, recurring character to play in the series proper. In 77 Sunset Strip, Byrnes became [...] "Kookie", a comically hep carhop—who also compulsively combed his hair. Because of the narrative improbability of a killer becoming a trusted ally of Stu Bailey, Byrne's appearance in Girl on the Run was addressed directly in the series. At the beginning of the episode which followed Girl on the Run, Zimbalist broke the fourth wall with the announcement: [...] We previewed this show, and because Edd Byrnes was such a hit, we decided that Kookie and his comb had to be <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series.</b> So this week, we'll just forget that in the pilot he went off to prison to be executed. from the pre-credit sequence for the episode [...] "Lovely Lady, Pity Me" ...|$|E

30|$|Among {{patients}} undergoing parathyroidectomy, {{the incidence}} of cystic change in parathyroid lesions was more common (6.4  %) in our setting compared to that described in the literature, which ranged from 3 - 4  % [7, 14]. All the cystic lesions described <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> were functional parathyroid lesions. A male predominance and predilection for left inferior parathyroid lesions described in the literature among patients with functional parathyroid cysts was not seen <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> [14 – 17]. Histologically all cystic lesions <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> were adenomas with cystic degeneration. There were no pure parathyroid cysts with epithelial lining. The cystic change {{appears to be a}} finding seen in larger lesions and was not related to the duration of illness. Larger lesions have more tendencies to undergo haemorrhage and cystic degeneration—the cause of cystic change—perhaps because these large lesions outgrow their vascular supply. The higher incidence of cystic change seen <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> {{may be related to the}} larger lesions in our patients. There were no patients with multiple cystic lesions <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>series.</b> Tc- 99 m sestamibi scintigraphy and SPECT are frequently non-diagnostic in cystic parathyroid lesions, with previous studies showing 30 - 68  % accuracy [6, 14]. However the accuracy of preoperative localisation improved to 79  % when Tc- 99 m sestamibi SPECT was interpreted along with ultrasound findings [6]. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>series</b> only one cystic parathyroid lesion was not localised on Tc- 99 m sestamibi scintigraphy and SPECT.|$|E
