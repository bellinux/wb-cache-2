The Maderas Rainforest Conservancy is in the process of obtaining and protecting these forests around the Maderas volcano on Ometepe. The area is home to an extremely biodiverse population of fauna. Of prime interest to the project are the capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus) and howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata). Both capuchin monkeys and howler monkeys are seed <b>germinators</b> and seed disperses [...] What has occurred in the area is agricultural deforestation cutting through corridors that these species use to traverse across the forest. Because of this, large pockets of the forest are left without these species and the seed dispersal they provide the forest. The conservancy is currently mapping out and taking a census of the population and a survey of where these primate species are traveling. This will enable the Maderas Rainforest Conservancy to strategically acquire deforested land for a reforestation project of primate corridors.|$|R

Where mixed-planting techniques, gravel mulch toppings and non-selective maintenance techniques such as mowing are used, prairie plantings are considered to be cost-effective alternative design concepts for public green space management. In this study, we investigated the establishment success of different mixtures of prairie species plantings on two sites with different soil conditions: topsoil and topsoil with graywacke gravel topping. We documented significantly higher average mortality rates on gravel mulch sites in the first year after establishment. Further development of mortality was not significantly different between sites. Weed species were always more numerous on topsoil sites and had an obvious effect on the visual impact of the plantings. The mulch created an effective barrier for wind-dispersed <b>germinators.</b> Soil temperatures down to 30 cm were significantly higher on gravel mulch sites throughout the year, stimulating more vital plant growth and a prolonged growing season.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} methodology for seed processing and X-ray analysis and to study imbibition pattern in seeds of candeia (Eremanthus incanus). Seeds were gathered in 2001 and 2002 in Morro do Pilar and Lavras respectively, processed and stored in a cold chamber (5 ºC/ 60 %RH) until the start of experiments. In order to identify unfilled seeds, a protocol was developed for X-ray use combining radiation energy (Kv) and exposure time (seconds). For elimination of unfilled seeds, an experiment was conducted using a South Dakota seed blower whereby different opening settings and ventilation times were combined. Original seed lots and categorized lots following radiograph viewing were tested by germination tests, with seeds being cleansed in sodium hypochlorite and scattered over blotting paper in ‘gerboxes’ and then taken to <b>germinators</b> with alternating temperatures of 20 º- 30 ºC and 10 hours of light, for up to 15 days.

An important instrument for this type of research is the accurate quantification of germination; however gathering cumulative germination data is a very laborious task which is often prohibitive to the execution of large experiments. In this paper we present the <b>Germinator</b> package: a simple, highly cost efficient and flexible procedure for high-throughput automatic scoring and evaluation of germination that can be implemented without the use of complex robotics. The <b>Germinator</b> package contains three modules; 1) design of experimental setup with various options to replicate and randomize samples; 2) automatic scoring of germination based on the color contrast between the protruding radicle and seed coat on a single image; 3) curve fitting of cumulative germination data and the extraction, recap and visualization of the various germination parameters. The curve fitting module enables analysis of general cumulative germination data and can be used for all plant species.

40|$|Problem statement: There is no {{general theory}} {{analyzing}} how the time-varying cash flows of venture capitalist financing affect {{the likelihood of}} success of a new venture. This research addressed that lacuna in the literature. Approach: Research {{in the area of}} venture capital financing was needed because of the importance of new ventures as <b>germinators</b> of technological innovation. The research in this study developed a general economic theory quantifying the risk of venture failure associated with time-varying cash flows of financing. Each occasion when an entrepreneur made an overture to a venture capitalist to elicit a financing commitment was defined to be a distinct solicitation event. The series of financial commitments elicited from venture capitalists were assumed to have the characteristics of independently distributed random variables. It was assumed that the entrepreneur must secure a minimal aggregate commitment in order to ensure development of the project; failure to secure that amount caused the venture to be aborted. The theory of stochastic processes was applied to derive the practical implications as regards the risk of abortion. Results: It was shown that the aggregate financing commitment secured by an entrepreneur in a finite time had stochastic properties corresponding to those of a statistical renewal process. The research derived limiting conditions on the probability that entrepreneurs venture will be aborted because of his failure to secure the minimal aggregate commitment. The main result was that if the number of solicitations by the entrepreneur is large and the financial commitments were independently distributed random variables with finite means and variances, the probability distribution governing venture survival is the Normal distribution. Conclusion: The study derived four analytical propositions quantifying the trade-offs between the risk and the expected return associated with venture capital financing. The policy implications of the results imply the benefits of mitigating information asymmetry. Some of the risk faced by the entrepreneurs could be attenuated if information about the risk/return preferences of venture capitalists were known to the entrepreneurs prior to solicitation. Some of the risks faced by the venture capitalists could be attenuated if information about the risk/return characteristics of the proposed investment project could be accurately and transparently communicated to the venture capitalist during the solicitation event. If either or both of these information deficits were palliated, the market for venture capital would operate more efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Bacterial spores are {{extremely}} robust survival vehicles {{that are highly}} resistant towards environmental stress conditions including heat, UV radiation and other stresses commonly applied during food production and preservation. Spores, {{including those of the}} toxin-producing food-borne human pathogen Bacillus cereus, are ubiquitously present {{in a wide range of}} environmental niches such as soil, plant rhizosphere, intestinal tract of insects and animals, and it is virtually impossible to prevent contamination at the primary production level. Heat treatments are conventionally applied in food processing to reduce the microbial load of food products, however, to comply with consumer desire for products with higher sensory and nutritional values, the treatment intensity may become milder. Consequently, subpopulations of spores may emerge that are sublethally damaged rather than inactivated conceivably causing quality and safety issues following repair and outgrowth. In this thesis, a functional genomics approach was used in combination with subpopulation and single spore analysis to identify factors involved in recovery of heat damaged spores, and to link B. cereus genotypes to nutrient-induced germination capacity and carbohydrate utilisation capacity. Using comparative analysis of B. cereus ATCC 14579 wild type and targeted mutants, putative damage repair factors were identified such as putative transcriptional regulator CdnL, that supported recovery of spores in a range of conditions including model foods. The majority of identified genes encoding putative damage repair factors appeared to be unique for B. cereus group members. This novel information on spore recovery adds to further insights in versatility of survival strategies of B. cereus. Different types of foods may contain different types and levels of nutrients including amino acids and carbohydrates, that can affect spore germination capacity and subsequent outgrowth performance of vegetative B. cereus cells. Nutrient germinants present in food products can trigger specific germinant receptors (GRs) located in the spore inner membrane leading to spore germination, a critical step before growth resumes. Combined analysis of genotypes and nutrient-induced germination phenotypes using high throughput flow cytometry analysis at the level of individual spores, revealed substantial diversity in germination capacity with a subset of strains showing a very weak germination response even in nutrient-rich media containing high levels of amino acids. Phylogenetically, these B. cereus strains grouped in subgroup IIIA encompassing strains containing pseudogenes or variants of some of the Ger clusters and two strains containing the recently identified SpoVA 2 mob transposon, that induced heat resistance with concomitant reduced germination response in Bacillus subtilis spores. The same B. cereus isolates were also used to link genotypes with carbohydrate utilisation clusters present on the genomes, and this revealed representatives of subgroup IIIA to lack specific carbohydrate utilisation clusters (starch, glycogen, aryl beta-glucosides; salicin, arbutin and esculin) suggesting a reduced capacity to utilise plant-associated carbohydrates for growth. Since these B. cereus subgroup IIIA representatives contain host-associated carbohydrate utilisation gene clusters and a subset of unique Ger clusters, their qualification as poor <b>germinators</b> may require revision following assessment of spore germination efficacy using host-derived compounds as germinants. The research described in this thesis has added novel insights in B. cereus capacity to cope with spore damage and provided novel overviews of the distribution and putative functionality of (sub) clusters of GRs and carbohydrate utilisation clusters. Knowledge on spore damage repair, germination and metabolism capacity adds to further understanding of B. cereus ecology including niche occupation and transmission capacity...|$|R

These studies were initiated to obtain information on the earliest safe planting date to obtain adequate plant populations and maximum yield. Specific objectives were to determine: 1. The effects of high temperature, light and reduced oxygen on induction of secondary dormancy. 2. The effects of soil moisture and temperature on seed germination and seedling emergence. 3. The effects of planting date, depth of planting and soil temperature on stand establishment. 4. The effects of planting dates on yield. Imbibed seeds of dormant and non-dormant lots 'Mermaid' meadowfoam were subjected to high temperature, light and reduced oxygen treatments for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days. Following treatment, the seeds were removed to optimum germination conditions to assess the degree of dormancy induced by the various environmental factors. The effect of soil moisture on seed germination was determined at four alternating temperatures in seed <b>germinators</b> to simulate field conditions during August, September, October and November. Field plantings were made on several dates in 1984 and 1985 and soil temperatures were recorded during the emergence period. Yield trials with three lots of Mermaid meadowfoam were planted on six dates in 1985. Exposure of imbibed seeds to 25 °C was the most effective means of inducing dormancy, with significant increases in dormancy occurring in both lots after 3 days' exposure. Germination of the non-dormant lot decreased from over 90 % to less than 30 % after 15 days of warm temperature. Exposure to continuous light was in inducing dormancy after 6 days' treatment. effective Imbibition in an atmosphere of 2 % oxygen decreased germination after 9 days' treatment. Reduction in germination by light and reduced oxygen was only moderate, but a greater degree of dormancy would be expected with longer exposure. Optimum conditions for seedling emergence under simulated field conditions were a soil moisture content of 70 % of field capacity and an alternating temperature of 10 - 15 o C. In field trials, maximum seedling emergence occurred in the 24 September 1984 and 26 September 1985 plantings. Emergence was negatively and significantly correlated with the average minimum temperature for the 7 and 14 -day periods after planting. There was less association with average maximum and daily temperatures. Seed yield increased from 665 kg ha⁻¹ from the 29 August planting to 1276 kg ha⁻¹ from the 10 October planting. The low yield from the earliest planting was largely due to lower plant density. These experiments affirmed that exposure of meadowfoam seeds to factors that inhibit germination will induce secondary dormancy after a minimum exposure period. In the field, induction of dormancy and reduced seedling emergence would be expected if soils are warm or poorly aerated. While light would not be a factor in field emergence, it should be avoided to obtain maximum germination in laboratory germination tests. These studies support advancing the recommended early planting date to 1 October if irrigation is available or soil moisture is adequate. Planting depths between 1. 0 and 2. 5 cm are equally satisfactory. Seed dormancy at this time is not a problem when planting 3 -month-old seed from the current years' harvest...|$|R

Muito se discute sobre os efeitos da passagem das sementes no trato digestivo dos morcegos sobre a taxa e velocidade de germinação. O objetivo deste trabalho foi examinar a dieta das espécies de morcegos frugívoros na Estação Experimental de Itirapina para descobrir quais utilizam significativamente os frutos de Cecropia pachystachya. Foi testada a importância dos quirópteros na dispersão e germinação desta espécie de planta. Para isso, os morcegos foram capturados no período de agosto de 2005 a julho de 2006, suas fezes foram recolhidas e as sementes de C. pachystachya separadas. Os testes de germinação foram feitos para duas espécies de morcegos, Artibeus liuratus e Platyrrhinus lineatus, e suas taxas de germinação comparadas com amostras de sementes coletadas da planta (controle). Foram feitos cinco repetições com 30 sementes em cada gerbox para cada teste. Os testes foram realizados em câmaras germinadoras " Mangelsdorf", com temperatura de 25 °C, luminosidade e umidade constante por 40 dias. Houve uma alta porcentagem de germinação das sementes encontradas em A. lituratus (79, 3 %) e não diferiu estatisticamente das sementes controle (76 %). Esses resultados foram superiores a P. lineatus (52 %). Em relação ao Índice de Velocidade de Germinação (IVG), esse resultado foi semelhante, sendo 2, 73 para A. lituratus, 2, 66 para o controle e 1, 80 para P. lineatus. Com esse resultado, tem-se que a passagem das sementes de C. pachystachya pelos morcegos não aumentou a porcentagem, nem a velocidade de germinação delas, quando comparado com o controle, sendo até menor para P. lineatus. Com os resultados obtidos, conclui-se que, o efeito da passagem do trato digestivo dos morcegos na germinação pode sofrer influências que ainda precisam ser estudadas, mas não há como negar o beneficio da dispersão das sementes de C. pachystachya promovida por quatro espécies de morcegos {{no local}} estudado. Frugivorous bats are {{fundamental}} {{components in the}} maintenance and regeneration of tropical forests since they promote the mobility of the fruit seeds. There are controversies {{about the effects of}} the seed passage through the bat gut in the germination tax and speed. The goal of this work was to investigate the diet of frugivorous bat species at Estação Experimental de Itirapina to find out which species significantly use the fruits of the pioneer plants species Cecropia pachystachya. It was tested the importance of bats on the spread and germination of seeds from this plant species. For that, the bats were captured in the period from August 2005 to July 2006, their feces were collected and the seeds of C. pachystachya separated. The germination tests were made for two bat species, Artibeus liuratus and Platyrrhinus lineatus, and were compared with seeds collected directly from the plant (control). Five repetitions were made with 30 seeds in each gerbox for each test. The tests were conducted in " Mangelsdorf" <b>germinators</b> chambers, with temperature of 25 °C, luminosity and constant humidity for 40 days. There was a high germination percentage of the seeds found in A. lituratus (79, 3 %), and it did not differ statistically from the seeds control (76 %). These results were superior from P. lineatus (52 %). Regarding the Germination Speed Index (IVG), the results were similar, being 2, 73 for A. lituratus, 2, 66 for the control seeds and 1, 80 for P. lineatus. It was concluded that the passage of the seeds of C. pachystachya through the bats gut did not increase the percentage or the speed of germination, when compared with the control seeds, being smaller for P. lineatus. With the results obtained, it was concluded that the effects of the bats’ gut passage in the germination still needs further studies but the benefits of seed dispersion of C. pachystachya promoted by four bat species in the studied place cannot be refused...|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} an {{increasingly}} severe conservation problem that can dramatically alter native plant communities. Although ecologists have proposed many mechanisms for {{the dominance of}} invasive species, superior competitive ability {{is one of the}} longest standing hypotheses. In winter annual plant communities, germination timing affects competition among plants. I hypothesized that grass invasion has changed {{the costs and benefits of}} early and late germination, and that species with flexible germination timing would compete better with invasives. Experiments at the Bernard Field Station in Claremont, CA and <b>germinator</b> trials in a controlled environment were used to examine the survivorship and germination rate of three native forbs in the presence or absence of invasive grass competition. <b>Germinator</b> trials revealed that most Clarkia purpurea seeds germinated in fall conditions, though newer seeds had higher proportions germinate under winter conditions. Older seeds had a lower germination success, indicating a potential decrease in seed viability. In the field experiment, November germinants had higher survival rates than October germinants for Amsinckia menziesii and Phacelia distans, and both species had similar numbers of new germinants at each census. Removal of invasive grasses did not significantly affect the survival of either species, though a trend towards increased survivorship was observed in removal plots of November germinants. Taken together, these results show evidence for variation in germination timing and responses to environmental cues among native annual seeds, and also support the idea that germination timing has important consequences for survivorship, and potentially competitive interactions, with invasive grasses...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScConsEcol(Conservation Ecology and Entomology) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Riparian {{areas are}} highly complex systems with {{varying levels of}} {{disturbance}} that are highly susceptible to invasion by alien plants. Once invaded, riparian areas {{play a major role}} in the dispersal and spread of invasive alien plants (IAPs) through the river system and, in some cases, to neighbouring landscapes. Riparian areas have therefore been prioritized by many alien clearing initiatives in South Africa. Current practice for the restoration of cleared areas is minimal and relies mainly on the un-aided recovery of native species from residual individuals and soil stored seed banks. Little research, however, has been done on the effectiveness of this approach or the extent to which riparian seed banks contribute towards community restoration. This study is part of a national research initiative (Targets for Ecosystem Repair in Riparian Ecosystems in Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna Biomes) funded by Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, in collaboration with Working for Water, The Centre for Invasion Biology and the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Rhodes and Witwatersrand. The initiative undertook to investigate different restoration techniques on various invaded sites for their cost-effectiveness, efficiency, practicality and conservation integrity. This study has three aims. The first is to determine the composition of seed banks in un-invaded riparian areas within the fynbos biome to be used as a benchmark for future research, restoration grading and other management requirements. The second aim is to determine the composition of seed banks in heavily invaded riparian areas, and thus to assess the impact of invasion on the integrity of the seed banks. The third aim is to evaluate the restoration potential of riparian seed banks following the clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs). Study sites were selected within four river systems in the south-western part of the Western Cape Province in South Africa: the Berg, Eerste, Molenaars and Wit Rivers. Plots were selected in both invaded (> 75 % IAP canopy cover; considered “closed” alien stands) and un-invaded (also termed reference, with < 25 % IAP canopy cover) sections of the river. Replicate plots were established along varying gradients of elevation (mountain stream and foothill) and moisture regimes (dry, wet and transitional bank zones). Soil samples were collected together with above-ground vegetation surveys and comparisons were made. Results from this study confirm those of previous studies that seed banks offer little reference to current aboveground vegetation, but rather offer insight into past vegetation history as well as future vegetation assemblages. Worldwide, many of the species that characteristically form seed banks are early successional species. A community study was done for the seed bank based on the species that germinated and were identifiable at termination of the project (6 months after initiation). Three clusters of species could be identified. One group comprised 32 generalist species that occurred in both reference and invaded sections of the rivers. A second group comprised 39 species associated with invaded sites, and a third group of 40 species that was associated with reference sites. A few sub-community groups were found within both the “reference” and “invaded” community groups which were assumed to be habitat specific. Most species were “pioneer” or relatively-short lived, early-successional species which play a vital role in the initial post-disturbance vegetation cover, and facilitate establishment of later successional species. Seed banks are notoriously variable over space and time, and floristic representation is often biased as a result of differences among species in seed production, dispersal and longevity in the soil. The general consensus is that seeds have an irregular, clustered spatial distribution that is dictated by both biological and environmental factors. Within river systems, the irregular clustering can be exceptionally skewed with the influence of pockets of high sediment deposition along the bank. Environmental factors that were found to significantly skew germination results were the presence of fire, as well as the extent and intensity of invasion (duration and cover). The high level of diversity and abundance in reference Berg River mountain stream seed banks was perceived to be a direct result of a moderate fire frequency (between 8 - 15 years) and the relatively natural state of the vegetation (i. e. very little invasion). Also, diversity and richness of indigenous species from the Wit and Molenaars Rivers were substantially higher in the invaded samples than the reference samples, probably because both river systems have a long history of invasion and other anthropogenic disturbances which would have an effect on the samples from “reference” sections (i. e. even a 25 % presence of IAPs seems adequate enough to alter the composition of the seed bank). Correspondence analyses showed that species had clear affinities towards different levels of “key” riparian environmental variables (fire, invasion and anthropogenic disturbance). Most species were associated with moderate levels of fire frequency, invasion history, and anthropogenic disturbance. Comparisons of seed bank species assemblages between the lateral and longitudinal variables of the rivers offered insights into the habitat requirements of certain fynbos and riparian species. Most significant were the results from bank zone comparisons which showed distinct species groupings along the different moisture bands. As could be expected, riparian species were best represented within the wet bank zones and fynbos species within the dry bank zone, while species characteristic of both zones occurred in the transitional zone, making this seed bank zone the richest in species. Mountain stream sections were richer and more diverse than foothill sections over both invaded and reference samples. This is hypothesised to be linked to lower levels of anthropogenic disturbance experienced in the mountain stream sections. The impact of invasion on the riparian seed bank was most clearly shown through the correspondence analyses for the 20 most frequently occurring species. The seed bank assembly patterns were clearly defined by the state of the river (reference or invaded). Interestingly, this pattern was evident at all three spatial scales; landscape (rivers), reach (mountain stream and foothill sections) and habitat (dry, wet and transitional zones). The reference seed bank assemblage was more tightly grouped, implying that the species were more closely associated with each other and less variable than those of the invaded seed bank assemblages. The species groupings within the invaded seed banks were influenced by variables such as reach and zone, whereas the reference seed bank assemblages seem relatively unaffected by these variables. This implies that the presence of invasive alien plants creates additional variation within the seed bank which alters the natural groupings. At a broad scale, the invaded seed banks were less species rich. This means that not only will the resulting seedling community be harder to predict, but it will also have fewer species. However although generally lower in species richness, the seed banks from almost all invaded rivers interestingly showed a higher diversity of indigenous species than their reference counterparts. This is very promising in terms of rehabilitation of post-cleared riparian sites, but more information is needed to understand the seed bank composition and determine how sustainable the seed banks are for rehabilitation in the long-term. All invaded sections had fewer herbaceous perennial species but more herbaceous annual species. Graminoids made up 50 % or more of the seed bank regardless of state (reference or invaded), while woody species (shrubs/shrublets) were generally more prevalent in the reference samples. These results imply that following the removal of invasive alien plants, the vegetation to regenerate from the seed bank is likely to comprise of short-lived, herbaceous species that are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the indigenous riparian community. It is however important to note that this study investigated only the species that were able to germinate over the study period (6 month germination period). Many riparian species may not have been represented because they are either late <b>germinators</b> or may not be present in the soil seed bank at all. In order to gain a holistic understanding of riparian community recruitment, it is recommended that seed bank studies such as this one be included in a more broad scale, long term investigation which takes into account various reproductive strategies used by riparian species. Research of this nature is in its infancy worldwide and there are many challenges involved in measuring diversity and change in these systems. However, within the scope of this study, I suggest that these results shed light on previously unanswered and important questions regarding the ecology of seed banks in the riparian ecosystems of the Western Cape...|$|R
