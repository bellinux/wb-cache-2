5|$|George Mackey {{had asked}} whether Born's rule <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> {{consequence}} of {{a particular set of}} axioms for quantum mechanics, and more specifically whether every measure on the lattice of projections of a Hilbert space can be defined by a positive operator with unit trace. Though Richard Kadison proved this was false for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces, Gleason's theorem (published 1957) shows it to be true for higher dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} the {{implication}} graph, two literals {{belong to the same}} strongly connected component whenever there exist chains of implications from one literal to the other and vice versa. Therefore, the two literals must have the same value in any satisfying assignment to the given 2-satisfiability instance. In particular, if a variable and its negation both belong to the same strongly connected component, the instance cannot be satisfied, because it is impossible to assign both of these literals the same value. As Aspvall et al. showed, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> and sufficient condition: a 2-CNF formula is satisfiable if and only if there is no variable that belongs to the same strongly connected component as its negation.|$|E

5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes.

5|$|People in the Vanni districts {{considered}} themselves separate from Tamils of the Jaffna peninsula {{but the two}} groups did intermarry. Most of these married couples moved into the Vanni districts where land was available. Vanni consists {{of a number of}} highland settlements within forested lands using irrigation tank-based cultivation. An 1890 census listed 711 such tanks in this area. Hunting and raising livestock such as water buffalo and cattle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> adjunct to the agriculture. The Tamil-inhabited Vanni consists of the Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, and eastern Mannar districts. Historically, the Vanni area has been in contact with what is now South India, including during the medieval period (see Vanniar). Northern Tamils follow customary laws called Thesavalamai, codified during the Dutch colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{considered}} a product of creolization, combining the African magical perspective of Macandal with the Catholic realism of Henri Christophe. A key aspect {{of the novel is}} that the main character is of interest not because of his skin colour, but rather for his human attributes that allow universal reflection beyond the realm of race. In this sense, magic realism <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> tool of expression and the technique serves to confront the novel's hero, better develop his purpose as a man, and advance a simultaneously profound and straightforward understanding of the human experience.|$|E

5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try {{to determine whether it}} properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions. The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the , which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities. The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and {{that there had been a}} failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held. A Section 740 inquiry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> step before a Council can be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> {{step in the}} maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E

5|$|Felix {{is finally}} able to explain to Isaac why Alchemy's release <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> thing for everyone, and that Saturos and Menardi were aiming for this goal merely {{for the sake of}} the {{survival}} of their home colony of Prox to the far north, located near the Mars Lighthouse. He also reveals that his parents and Isaac's father are alive and currently being held hostage in Prox in order to coerce Felix's initial cooperation. Isaac and his company agree to aid Felix, and the group sets out north to activate the Mars Lighthouse. The group discovers that Karst and Agatio have been transformed into mindless dragons and are forced to defeat them - they return the Mars Star before succumbing to their wounds. When they reach the tower's top, the Wise One, the entity responsible for originally tasking Isaac to prevent the breaking of Alchemy's seal, confronts them. He warns them that mankind could very well destroy Weyard themselves if they had possession of such a power, and when Isaac insists on breaking the seal regardless the Wise One summons a giant, three-headed dragon for the party to battle in the final struggle. After slaying the dragon, the party of Adepts finish their objective and activate Mars Lighthouse; with all four towers across Weyard lit, the process that heralds the return of the force of Alchemy to Weyard ensues at the mountain sanctum Mt. Aleph. Alex is there, however; he took advantage of everyone else's quests so that he would gain immense power for himself from the light of the Golden Sun, a manifestation of Alchemy itself. However, he discovers that the Wise One had taken steps to prevent this and is left to die as the mountain collapses and sinks into the ground with him still on it.|$|E
5|$|Potash is {{primarily}} a mixture of potassium salts because plants {{have little or no}} sodium content, and the rest of a plant's major mineral content consists of calcium salts of relatively low solubility in water. While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence that led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702, and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736. The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did not include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789. For a long time the only significant applications for potash were the production of glass, bleach, soap and gunpowder as potassium nitrate. Potassium soaps from animal fats and vegetable oils were especially prized because they tend to be more water-soluble and of softer texture, and are therefore known as soft soaps. The discovery by Justus Liebig in 1840 that potassium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessary</b> element for plants and that most types of soil lack potassium caused a steep rise in demand for potassium salts. Wood-ash from fir trees was initially used as a potassium salt source for fertilizer, but, with the discovery in 1868 of mineral deposits containing potassium chloride near Staßfurt, Germany, the production of potassium-containing fertilizers began at an industrial scale. Other potash deposits were discovered, and by the 1960s Canada became the dominant producer.|$|E
