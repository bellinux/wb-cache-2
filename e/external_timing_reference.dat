30|$|Network {{synchronization}} in cellular {{systems is}} commonly {{performed in a}} master-slave manner: BSs synchronize to an <b>external</b> <b>timing</b> <b>reference,</b> known as the primary reference clock, and transfer this timing to UTs. This reference clock can be acquired through the global positioning system (GPS) or through the backbone connection. The first method requires the installation of a GPS receiver at each BS, which increases costs and, more importantly, does not work in environments where GPS signals cannot be received. For high accuracy, the second method requires precise delay compensation, and the accuracy severely decreases when clocks are chained [1].|$|E
30|$|Over-the-air {{decentralized}} intercell slot synchronization that {{avoids the}} need for an <b>external</b> <b>timing</b> <b>reference</b> was pioneered in [2], and further elaborated in [3, 4]. Its basic principle is summarized as follows: a BS emits a pulse indicating its own timing reference and is receptive to pulses from surrounding BSs; internal timing references are adjusted based on the power-weighted average of received pulses. Conditions for convergence were derived in [5], which reveals that convergence and stability are tightly linked to the intersite propagation delays between neighboring BSs. This is a critical issue, as inter-BS propagation delays are not known a priori. Furthermore, in [2], direct communication between BSs is required, and for the exchange of synchronization pulses, a separate frequency band is assumed to be available.|$|E

40|$|Massive {{co-located}} devices require new paradigms {{to allow}} proper network connectivity. Internet of things (IoT) is the paradigm {{that offers a}} solution for the inter-connectivity of devices, but in dense IoT networks time synchronization is a critical aspect. Further, the scalability is another crucial aspect. This paper focuses on synchronization for uncoordinated dense networks without any <b>external</b> <b>timing</b> <b>reference.</b> Two synchronization methods are proposed and compared: i) conventional synchronization that copes with the high density of nodes by frame collision-avoidance methods (e. g., CSMA/CA) to avoid the superimposition (or collision) of synchronization signals; and ii) distributed synchronization that exploits the frames' collision to drive the network to a global synchronization. The distributed synchronization algorithm allows the network to reach a timing synchronization status based on a common beacon with the same signature broadcasted by every device. The superimposition of beacons {{from all the other}} devices enables the network synchronization, rather than preventing it. Numerical analysis evaluates the synchronization performance based on the convergence time and synchronization dispersion, both on collision and non-collision scenario, by investigating the scalability of the network. Results prove that in dense network the ensemble of signatures provides remarkable improvements of synchronization performance compared to conventional master-slave reference.

30|$|The {{proposed}} cellular firefly synchronization (CelFSync) algorithm adapts the PCO {{model to}} account for constraints of cellular networks. CelFSync operates over-the-air, in a decentralized manner; no constraints are imposed {{on the availability of}} an <b>external</b> <b>timing</b> <b>reference.</b> As BSs and UTs typically transmit on successive downlink and uplink frames, two groups need to be distinguished; the BS group transmitting on the downlink and the UT group transmitting on the uplink. To facilitate the formation of two groups, two synchronization words are specified, one associated to BSs and the other to UTs. UTs transmit an uplink sync word based on their internal timing reference, which is received by BSs to update their own timing; in return UTs adjust their timing reference upon reception of downlink sync words from neighboring BSs. Thus, unlike [2], no separate frequency band is required as sync words are transmitted in-band with data. Moreover direct communication among BSs is not mandatory as synchronization is performed by hopping over UTs. As the downlink sync word is mandatory for conventional cellular systems to align the timing of UTs with the BS, the only overhead for inter-BS synchronization is the insertion of the uplink sync word. Thanks to the proposed strategy, the network is able to synchronize starting from an arbitrary misalignment, and propagation delays only affect the achieved accuracy but do not compromise the convergence to synchrony.|$|E

30|$|The {{proposed}} cellular firefly synchronization (CelFSync) scheme {{takes into}} account these fundamental constraints, by resorting to an out-of-phase synchronization regime, introduced in Section 3.1. CelFSync relies on two synchronization sequences, one transmitted by BSs to adjust <b>timing</b> <b>references</b> of UTs, and a second one transmitted by UTs to adjust <b>timing</b> <b>references</b> of BSs, based on rules that are established in Section 3.2. The detection of the two distinct synchronization sequences in an asynchronous environment is discussed in Section 3.3. For ease of explanation, propagation delays are neglected in this section and are treated specifically in Section 4.|$|R

40|$|TDC) {{electronics}} {{based on}} the HPTDC [1] with on-board DAQ functionality has been developed. The main usage will be the RPC-detector upgrade of the HADES-detector (2600 channels) with a needed time resolution of < 100 ps and the required possibility to measure {{the time of the}} rising and falling edge of the signal to make a Time-over-Threshold (TOT) measurement for a walk-correction of the RPC-detector. Additionally, it will be used for the Forward-Wall and Pion-Hodoscope upgrades (640 channels). The readout-electronics is on board and the data is transported via 100 MBit Ethernet and Internet-Protocol. The Time to Digital Conversion of the 128 channels is done in 4 HPTDC chips (as shown in Fig. 1). The Figure 1 : TDC Readout Board block diagram. TDC-Readout-Board (TRB) has 4 input connectors (80 pins, high density), where each has 31 LVDS timing input signals and several I/O-signals for general purpose. The 32 nd channel of each HPTC is connected to an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> <b>timing</b> signal (LVDS). The HPTDC ASICs are highly confi gurable [1] and allow to choose the TDC binwidth in the range of 780 ps and 25 ps (at 25 ps one only has 1 / 4 of the channels available), detect rising and falling edge of the timing-signal and allow to defi ne a matchingwindow, so that delay cables are not necessary anymore. An external trigger signal starts the selection of data in the HPTDCs and the board-controller FPGA initiates the readout. This data is then fi rst stored in a FIFO (128 kB) where it is waiting for an external LVL 2 trigger decision, which decides if the data can be discarded or has to be transported to mass storage (the LVL 2 trigger is needed for the HADES DAQ but optional).

40|$|An 18 -channel {{time-of-flight}} (TOF) grade time-to-digit converter (TDC) {{has been}} implemented {{in a low}} cost FPGA device. The TDC has the following unique features. (1) The time recording structures of the TDC {{is based on the}} 'wave union TDC' we developed in our previous work. A leading edge of the input hit launches a bit pattern, or wave union into the delay chain-register array structure which yields two usable measurements. The two measurements effectively sub-divide timing bins for each other especially the 'ultra-wide bins' caused by the FPGA logic array block (LAB) structure and improves measurement precision both in terms of maximum bin width and RMS resolution. A coarser measurement on input signal trailing edge is also provided for time-over-threshold (TOT) applications.
