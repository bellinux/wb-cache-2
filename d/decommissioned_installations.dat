40|$|Key Points: Indo-Pacific {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} exploration and exploitation activity is expanding massively in economically and strategically important, environmentally sensitive areas. The risks of {{offshore oil}} and gas safety and security incidents that could have regional economic, environmental, human, food, and energy consequences are rising. In addition to man-­‐induced incidents, the often crowded waters of the Indo-­‐Pacific are particularly prone to natural hazards like extreme weather events and seismic activity. The possibility of armed conflict at sea, law and order issues, increasing maritime user intensity, <b>decommissioned</b> <b>installations,</b> and jurisdictional uncertainty add to concerns. Measures to deal with large scale offshore oil and gas safety and security events are often not well developed. Vulnerabilities arise from the lack of capacity and the lack of regional coordination regimes to prevent, respond to and recover from incidents. Some regional states are not parties to relevant international regimes; collective and cooperative maritime safety and security arrangements are lacking. Collaboration between states and other actors: regional entities and industry, is necessary and presents mutually beneficial opportunities; progress should be a high priority. Realistic and uncomfortable expectations must be faced. Sovereignty issues combined with greed for energy resources and commercial benefit may well continue to dominate. The likelihood of offshore oil and gas safety and security disasters in the Indo-Pacific, with major regional consequences, will continue to rise...|$|E

40|$|Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the topic of {{localization}} inside buildings. The first part {{deals with the}} technologies and systems used for localization, while explaining the basic princi-ples and problems of implementation of these systems, their benefits and disadvantages. This section explains the functionality of each technology and the purpose {{for which it is}} best suited. The next part deals with the actual implementation of the localization system Redpin within the campus of the University of Economics in Prague. This section summarizes basic information about the project Redpin, then there is dismantled architecture of the system and its functionality. The remaining part is devoted to the direct implementation of this system. There are specified used technologies, <b>decommissioned</b> <b>installation</b> process and eventually re-evaluated results of its testing...|$|R

50|$|Today, {{the company}} {{is one of the}} largest {{providers}} of energy efficiency and renewable energy production. In 2013, Offshore was established as a separate business area, after several projects in the years before. The Offshore commitment was extended with maintenance and modification, as well as marine and rig services, and new contracts in the North Sea resulted in Environmental Base at Vats, a modern reception facility for <b>decommissioned</b> offshore <b>installations.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fort Monroe (also {{known as}} the Fort Monroe National Monument) is a <b>decommissioned</b> {{military}} <b>installation</b> in Hampton, Virginia—at Old Point Comfort, {{the southern tip of}} the Virginia Peninsula. Along with Fort Wool, Fort Monroe guarded the navigation channel between the Chesapeake Bay and Hampton Roads—the natural roadstead at the confluence of the Elizabeth, the Nansemond and the James rivers. Surrounded by a moat, the seven-sided star fort is the largest stone fort ever built in the United States.|$|R

The film places the queer bodies of today in the places of Plymouth's past, contrasting the transient materiality {{of the human body}} in motion with the ephemeral nature of the elemental forces of wind and sea, in the histories of this place. Made in collaboration with members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans communities in Plymouth, whose personal narratives of longing and loss are told through a series of encounters in the liminal, waterfront spaces of the city's border with the sea: the <b>decommissioned</b> military <b>installations</b> of Devil's Point, the crumbling recreational structures of Plymouth Hoe, including the iconic Lion's Den - which was once the (in) famous nude men's bathing area - and the brutal beauty of the 1950 s-built Bretonside bus station, soon to be demolished to make way for yet another 'leisure' development.
