25|$|The {{telescope}}s amateur telescope makers build {{range from}} backyard variety to sophisticated instruments that make meaningful {{contributions to the}} field of astronomy. Instruments built by amateurs have been employed in planetary study, astrometry, photometry, comet and asteroid discovery to name just a few. Even the “hobbyist” end of the field can break down into several distinct categories such as: observing deep sky objects, observing the planets, solar observing, lunar observation, and astrophotography of all those classes of objects. Therefore, the <b>design,</b> <b>size,</b> and construction of the telescopes vary as well. Some amateur telescope makers build instruments that, while looking crude, are wholly suited to the purpose they are designed for. Others may strive for a more aesthetic look with high levels of mechanical “finish”. Since some amateur telescope makers {{do not have access to}} high-precision machining equipment, many elegant designs such as the Poncet Platform, Crayford focuser, and the Dobsonian telescope have evolved, which achieve functionality and stability without requiring precision machining.|$|E

2500|$|The {{range of}} {{frequencies}} in {{the electromagnetic spectrum}} that makes up the radio spectrum is very large. This means that the types of antennas that are used as radio telescopes vary widely in <b>design,</b> <b>size,</b> and configuration. At wavelengths of 30 meters to 3 meters (10MHz - 100MHz), they are generally either directional antenna arrays similar to [...] "TV antennas" [...] or large stationary reflectors with moveable focal points. Since the wavelengths being observed with these types of antennas are so long, the [...] "reflector" [...] surfaces can be constructed from coarse wire mesh such as chicken wire. At shorter wavelengths parabolic [...] "dish" [...] antennas predominate. The angular resolution of a dish antenna {{is determined by the}} ratio of the diameter of the dish to the wavelength of the radio waves being observed. This dictates the dish size a radio telescope needs for a useful resolution. Radio telescopes that operate at wavelengths of 3 meters to 30cm (100MHz to 1GHz) are usually well over 100 meters in diameter. Telescopes working at wavelengths shorter than 30cm (above 1GHz) range in size from 3 to 90 meters in diameter.|$|E
