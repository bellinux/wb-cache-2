40|$|Composite tubes {{outperform}} traditional pipe {{materials in}} applications requiring low weight, corrosion resistance and high strength. However, {{the lack of}} simple and reliable end fittings have limited their use. A new end <b>fitting</b> <b>design</b> for composite tubes have been designed, produced and tested. The end fitting consist of two main parts, a bolted connection with radially placed bolts and a custom made composite tube. The tube is reinforced in the ends with fiber mats to achieve a layup suitable for a bolted connection. In addition a production method involving filament winding and fiber mats has successfully been developed. Two tests of the produced tube were performed: an internal pressure test and a tensile test. During the pressure test, the tube leaked at a low pressure {{and the quality of}} the end fitting could not be determined. Axial strength was tested with a tensile test and a very good result was obtained. The linear load limit was found to be 67, 2 kN and the maximum axial load was 96, 2 kN.

Support is provided by an 8. 9 -kg (19. 5 -lbm) truss assembly consisting of beryllium tubes adhesively bonded to magnesium end fittings. Beryllium was selected for the tubular struts in the truss because of its exceptionally high stiffness-to-weight ratio. Adhesive bonding, rather than riveting, was utilized to join the struts to the end fittings because of the low toughness (high notch sensitivity) of beryllium.

40|$|A {{new design}} of safety vests was {{developed}} for patients with uncontrollable behaviour or altered conscious level in this study. A comprehensive approach for designing functional textile and apparel products was adopted. The design request and exploration of the design situation and problem were identified. The settings in the general and psychiatric wards and the traditional ways {{of the use of}} safety vests on patients were examined. Problems of the traditional safety vests were identified, such as loose <b>fitting</b> <b>design</b> and large armholes, tight neckline which may result in unexpected accidents such as strangulation, difficulty of wearing, limited mobility, and obsolete functional design. A new set of design criteria and specifications were then developed. An interaction matrix of design specification for safety vests was formulated since some of the design specifications are in conflict with each other. For instance, a tight fit design could optimize the level of restraint, but it may result in patients’ psychological and physiological discomfort due to limited mobility. Supported by the evaluation of fabric materials and fastening systems, a new design of safety vests was then developed and evaluated. Institute of Textiles and ClothingSchool of Nursin...|$|E

Outcome of first questionnaire. Seventeen questionnaires were returned in the first round, of which 12 were from nurses. The results to the first question gave a 70 % correct response rate. The response to the second gave a correct response of 41 %. Only six out of 17 would give atropine in a vaso-vagal attack. Intervention. The results were discussed at an audit meeting and most staff said that they wanted further training. This was linked with the Leeds Community and Mental Health Trust training for resuscitation. By linking to this training programme it saved time and resources for the family planning service. Outcome of second questionnaire. Twenty-one staff returned questionnaires, of which 12 were nurses. The results to the first question gave an 87 % correct response rate. The response to the second showed a correct response of 71 %. Fourteen out of the 21 replying would give atropine. Conclusion.

40|$|Delaying stall {{is always}} an {{attractive}} option in the aerospace industry. The major benefit of delaying stall is increased lift during takeoff and landings as well as during high angle of attack situations. Devices, such as fluidic oscillators, can be integrated into wing flaps to help delay the occurrence of stall by adding energized air to the airflow on the upper surface of the wing flap. The energized air from the oscillator allows the airflow to remain attached to the upper surface of the wing flap. The fluidic oscillator being integrated in this thesis is an active flow control device (AFC). One common method for integrating any device into a wing flap is to remove {{a section of the}} flap and mechanically secure the device. A current trend in the aerospace industry is the increased use of fiber-reinforced composites to replace traditional metal components on aircraft. The traditional methods of device integration cause additional complications when applied to composite components as compared to metal components. This thesis proposes an alternative method for integration of the AFC devices, which occurs before the fabrication of wing flaps is completed and they are attached to the aircraft wing. Seven design concepts are created to reduce the complications from using current methods of integration on composite wing flaps. The concepts are based on four design requirements: aerodynamics, manufacturing, maintenance, and structure. Four of the design concepts created are external designs, which place the AFC on the exterior surface of the wing flap in two types of grooved channels. The other three designs place the AFC inside the wing flap skin and are categorized as internal designs. In order for the air exiting the AFC to reach the upper surface of the wing flap, slots are created in the wing flap skin for the internal designs. Within each of the seven design concepts two design variants are created based on foam or ribbed core types. Prototypes were created for all of the external design AFC devices and the side inserted AFC and retaining pieces. Wing flap prototypes were created for the rounded groove straight AFC design, the semi-circular groove with straight AFC, and the side inserted AFC designs. The wing flaps were created using the VARTM process with a vertical layup for the external designs. The rounded groove and semi-circular groove prototypes each went through three generations of prototypes until an acceptable wing flap was created. The side inserted design utilized the lessons learned through each generation of the external design prototypes eliminating the need for multiple generations. The lessons learned through the prototyping process helped refine the designs and determine the ease of manufacturing {{to be used in the}} design evaluation. The evaluation of the designs is based on the four design requirements stated above. The assessment of the designs uses two levels of evaluation matrices to determine the most <b>fitting</b> <b>design</b> concept. As a result of the evaluation, all four of the external designs and one of the internal designs are eliminated. The two remaining internal designs' foam core and ribbed variants are compared to establish the final design selection. The vertically inserted AFC foam core design is the most <b>fitting</b> <b>design</b> concept for the integration of an AFC device into a composite wing flap.

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the {{creation}} of an Android app for location based push commercials, which henceforth will be called an offers app. The idea of the app is the following: Users are allowed to chose which ac- tors they want to subscribe to, and they only receive offers from that actor when entering one of their physical stores. Actor meaning any business with a storefront in this setting. The hypothesis was that if you let users chose who they get ads from, and only get them when entering a physical store, they would give users such a good user experience that {{they would be willing to}} download and use an app which only purpose is to give offers. To achieve this the author has usability tested prototypes of the of- fers app and interviewed subjects about it. After doing this and landing on a <b>fitting</b> <b>design</b> a questionnaire was given to acquaintances of the author through social media in order to collect some measurement on how people perceive the app. Google Locationing Application Programming Interface (API) was field tested in order to determine if it was suited for tracking and triggering ads when users enters a storefront of an subscribed actor. Other tracking technologies were also looked at in order to find a tracking technology that fit the purpose of the app. From the usability testing, interviewing and questionnaire we have found a solution people are willing to try, and seemingly have a quite positive feeling about. From field testing we have found that Google Locationing API is not suited for detecting when the user enters an actors storefront. The research of alternative tracking technologies and solutions suggests that Ibeacons using Bluetooth Low Energy would be a fitting technology for tracking when users enter stores. </p...|$|E
