In an April 2006 interview, however, {{she said}} she had {{recently}} begun eating fish again because she found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> enough protein while on the road; which would make her a pescetarian rather than a vegetarian; nevertheless in 2008 she described herself as vegetarian.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} to single-man operation meant {{that about half}} of the company's workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24p.m. on Sunday to 9:49a.m. on Monday. There was a company union, although it hadn't done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, St. Paul Mayor William Mahoney and the National Recovery Administration, among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the Amalgamated Transit Union.|$|E

25|$|In {{his last}} years Ford was dogged by declining health, largely {{the result of}} decades of heavy {{drinking}} and smoking, and exacerbated by the wounds he suffered during the Battle of Midway. His vision in particular began to deteriorate rapidly {{and at one point}} he briefly lost his sight entirely; his prodigious memory also began to falter, making it necessary to rely more and more on assistants. His work was also restricted by the new regime in Hollywood, and he found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> many projects made. By the 1960s he had been pigeonholed as a Western director and complained that he now found it almost impossible to get backing for projects in other genres.|$|E

Finding <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his {{foot in the door}} of on-air reporting, Cooper decided to enlist the help of a friend in making a fake press pass. At the time, Cooper was working as a fact checker for the small news agency Channel One, which produces a youth-oriented news program that is broadcast to many junior high and high schools in the United States. Cooper then entered Myanmar on his own with his forged press pass and met with students fighting the Burmese government. He was ultimately able to sell his home-made news segments to Channel One.|$|E
25|$|Government TVETs are {{particularly}} concerned with occupations requiring investment in {{machinery and equipment}} and with increasing provision in remote areas. Workshop provision varies in quality. Some TVETs have good provision but many others have a shortage of workshops or old dilapidated workshops that lack safety features, basic sanitary facilities and essential equipment. Classrooms, stores and libraries may be in poor condition or non-existent. Instructors may lack competence since, in 2012, only 53% of those assessed met the assessment criteria. Even when TVETs have machinery and equipment, {{there are too many}} students for the few resources available. Students cannot meet the 70% to 80% requirement for practice and training remains theory based. Consequently, students have difficulty in meeting the assessment criteria with only 23% of students being found competent in 2012. Students who do graduate may still find <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> work. The Amhara TVET promotion bureau found only about 40% of TVET graduates managed to obtain employment.|$|E

[...] Ta, knowing that Chinese-Americans with college degrees find <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a job befitting their education, {{plans to go to}} law school, postponing the likely career struggle by three years. [...] The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. [...] She agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage. [...] Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is immediately attracted to him ("I Am Going to Like It Here"), though Ta is unimpressed. [...] That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress ("Like a God").|$|E
500|$|The {{failure to}} find a {{suitable}} leader caused the Germans to alter their plans from a widespread insurrection in Morocco to smaller-scale support of the existing resistance movement. [...] German support included the supply of military advisers and Foreign Legion deserters to the tribes as well as cash, arms and ammunition. [...] Money (in both pesetas and francs) was smuggled into Morocco from the German embassy at Madrid. [...] The money was transferred to Tétouan or Melilla by boat or wired through the telegraph before being smuggled to the tribes, who each received up to 600,000 pesetas per month. [...] Weapons arrived through long-established routes from Spanish Larache or else purchased directly from French gun runners or corrupt Spanish Army troops. [...] The Germans found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> resources to the Zaians in the Middle Atlas due to the distances involved and most of what did get through went to Said's forces. [...] German attempts to distribute supplies inland were frustrated when many tribes hoarded the best resources. [...] Ammunition remained scarce in the Middle Atlas, and many were forced to rely on locally manufactured gunpowder and cartridges.|$|E
500|$|Death Is Birth {{received}} positive reception {{from music}} critics. British publication Kerrang! gave the album a [...] "Excellent" [...] {{four out of}} five [...] "K"s describing the EP as [...] "The snarling rebirth of the UKs best punk band." [...] Vincent Danger when writing for Thrash Hits gave the album a 5 out of 6 stars giving the album a positive review praising their choice of front man to replace Carter. [...] "there’s only so much one can say about 459 seconds of music. There’s enough here to prove that Lags Barnard’s songwriting skills aren’t on the wane and that Wade MacNeil is a more than able replacement for Carter." [...] Alternative Press writer Jason Pettigrew appreciated the album's short but violent writing in his 4 out of 5 star review; saying [...] "the EP is steeped in impenetrable, relentless nihilism and thrashing madness that’s one part noise weapon (“True Colours”), one part circle-pit centrifuge (“Hate Hate Hate”) and two parts hateful hardcore (“Mondo Chaos” and the title track)." [...] Dan Issitt, a writer for Alter The Press! gave the album a score of 4/5 in an otherwise positive review did see fault in the change of front man. [...] "Some fans will undoubtedly find <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past the fact that he isn’t Frank Carter, but a little scratch at the surface will reveal the same aggression and similar bile-filled lyrics you’d expect from one of Britain’s most hateful bands." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} critics who viewed the episode when it aired were equally taken with [...] "Asian F". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it Glee [...] "best ever", while others, {{including}} Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly {{said it was}} the best one of the new third season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "This week's episode stands out {{as one of the most}} cohesive and well acted in the series's pantheon", though he wondered what had happened to the show's humorous side, something also noted by Futterman, who found it to be a significant problem: [...] "Glee's own identity crisis of not knowing whether or not it's a sitcom has made <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> deeply invested in its characters." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the producers hit every note (emotional, musical, character, plot) as squarely as Rachel Berry auditioning for a coveted role", and the episode [...] "had emotional truth, character growth, new revelations and really good musical numbers: the kind that seem to emerge organically from the plot and deepen and advance it." [...] AOLTV Crystal Bell said the episode delivered on the setup in the previous [...] "I Am Unicorn" [...] outing, and said [...] "it definitely seems to echo the glory days" [...] of the first season. TV Guide later included [...] "Asian F" [...] in its list of 2011's Top TV Episodes.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's first {{competitive}} {{run in the}} Quattro in Monte Carlo ended {{before it}} had even begun. She withdrew from the event before the start due to apparent engine problems. The team later discovered that dirt had got into the fuel system. At the Rally Portugal, she started her long partnership with the Italian co-driver Fabrizia Pons. Mouton won seven stages and took a career-best fourth place, despite suffering from electronic problems. This ended criticism of Audi for signing a female driver. After a retirement due to a broken camshaft in the Tour de Corse, Mouton set several fastest times at the Acropolis Rally in Greece. While Mikkola was leading and Mouton fifth, the stewards excluded the Quattros citing homologation infractions. Although Audi protested, the stewards upheld the decision. In her debut in the high-speed 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, Mouton found <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to the rhythm changes. She recorded a few top-ten stage times and finished 13th. She was satisfied with her performance, and the local newspaper Keskisuomalainen described her debut as successful. At the Rallye Sanremo in Italy, a mixed surface event with tarmac and gravel, Mouton took the lead when the local star Michele Cinotto crashed and held off Henri Toivonen and Ari Vatanen to take the victory. This {{marked the first time}} a female driver had won a world championship event in rallying. Mouton's male rivals were left speechless. Earlier during the weekend, Vatanen had been confident: [...] "Never can nor will I lose to a woman." [...] Mouton recalled her debut win in a 2008 interview for RallySport Magazine: ...|$|E

2500|$|Setting {{up sound}} {{reinforcement}} for live music clubs and dance events often poses unique challenges, {{because there is}} such a large variety of venues which are used as clubs, ranging from former warehouses or music theaters to small restaurants or basement pubs with concrete walls.
