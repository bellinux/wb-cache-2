40|$|Placing {{wave energy}} devices within close {{proximity}} to each other can be beneficial as the costs of deployment, maintenance and infrastructure are reduced significantly compared to if the devices are deployed in isolation. A mathematical model is presented in this thesis which combines linear wave theory {{with a series of}} linear driven harmonic oscillators to model an array (group) of floating wave energy devices which move predominantly in heave (vertically) in a train of incident regular waves. Whilst similar mathematical models have been used previously to investigate interactions between fluids and groups of structures, much of the published work does not address array configurations or device constraints that are relevant to designers of structure-supported array devices. The suitability of linear theory for application to closely spaced arrays is assessed in this thesis through comparison to small-scale experimental data and by evaluation of the magnitude of second-order hydrodynamic forces. Values of mechanical damping and mass are determined for each element of an array in order to achieve the maximum power from an array of floats without requiring the knowledge of the motion of every float within the array in order to apply the forces to any one float. Further to this, the analysis of floats of varying geometry is performed in order to assess the possibility of array optimisation through the variation of float geometries within a closely spaced array. It is shown in this thesis that linear theory provides a reasonable prediction of the response of floats that are sufficiently close together to interact for most wave frequencies to which the arrays are likely to be subjected. Under the assumption of easily implementable mechanical damping, it is determined that the power output from an array of floats of equal geometry can be increased by specifying different magnitudes of mechanical damping on each <b>float</b> <b>independently</b> of the radiation damping. Variations in submerged float geometries for the purpose of manipulating array characteristics according to the incident wave frequency are best applied through the variation in draft of a single geometry. Variations in submerged float geometry which occur close to the free surface are found to be of the greatest significance. Where the float is uniform in cross-section, the most appropriate method to select float drafts within an array is found {{to be based on the}} evaluation of the total damping on each float.

40|$|The {{flotation}} {{response of}} chalcopyrite {{has been characterized}} {{as a function of}} particle size and advancing contact angle. The advancing contact angle of individual size fractions was manipulated to different values, measured using the Washburn technique. A flotation feed sample was constituted from the individual size fractions. Parameters such as frother concentration, impeller rotational speed, and superficial gas velocity were the same in each flotation test. The chalcopyrite sample, {{in the absence of any}} steps to intentionally manipulate the contact angle, displayed advancing contact angles which varied with particle size fraction. In the presence of a standard thiol collector, the advancing contact angle was also particle size dependent, with the - 20 micron fraction displaying the lowest contact angle. Flotation tests showed that the chalcopyrite size fractions above 20 microns <b>floated</b> <b>independently</b> of each other, and that the flotation response was the same for the same particle contact angle and size fraction across different flotation tests. The flotation response was characterized by the maximum recovery at infinite flotation time and the distributed rate constant, assuming a single floatable fraction existed within each size fraction. When the distributed and undistributed rate constants were compared, the latter gave a greater dependency on contact angle as it took into account the non-floating fraction. The two rate constants converged at high advancing contact angles as the non-floating fraction approached zero. Further work on mineral floatability characterization will lead to the development of calibration curves of rate constant against particle size and contact angle, a tool that could be used to benchmark flotation response.

500|$|The Type 94 pistol is {{operated}} by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James [...] D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising-block type which <b>floats</b> <b>independently</b> between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of {{to the rear of}} the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. [...] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, are more comfortable for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the [...] pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame.

The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.|$|R

40|$|The {{flotation}} recovery by {{particle size}} of single mineral chalcopyrite and galena was studied in a Denver flotation cell, using sodium dicresylthiophosphate (DTP) and sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX) as collectors and polypropylene glycol (PPG) as a frother. The study {{was extended to}} very coarse particle size (up to 1 · 6 mm). Froth stability was also measured in parallel to the batch flotation tests, in a specifically designed froth stability column, following the Bikerman approach. It is shown that particles up to 850 μm can be floated successfully, provided they are liberated and hydrophobic. However, the recovery of both chalcopyrite and galena was strongly influenced by the overall particle size distribution, decreasing sharply as the fraction of fines (− 106 μm) in the feed also decreased. Rheology measurements showed negligible differences in pulp viscosity, and therefore in the collection zone hydrodynamics, between the different conditions tested. Froth stability, on the contrary, decreased as the feed particle size distribution became coarser. Correlation {{was found between the}} amount of fines in the pulp, froth stability and flotation recovery. The recovery of mineral particles is critically dependent on froth stability, which in turn is highly influenced by the overall particle size distribution of the feed material. For these reasons, the study also suggests that it is not possible in batch flotation to determine the rate and recovery of the coarse particle size fractions <b>floating</b> them <b>independently</b> from the fine size fractions. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{transmission}} pattern of inflation in Africa is investigated in several contexts. Specifically, {{the results of}} the decomposition of variance are analysed, which are obtained by estimating an error correction model comprising 11 countries: seven major African countries and four industrialized countries, i. e., the USA, UK, France, and Japan. The major empirical findings are as follows. First, a surprisingly large fraction of domestic inflation in Africa is attributable to inflation shocks originating in foreign countries. Second, the USA is found to be the leading producer of inter-continental inflation in Africa. Third, although the Ivory Coast does seem to be the marginal leader, geographical proximity does not seem to {{play a significant role in}} intra-continental inflation transmission. Fourth, Friedman (Essays in Positive Economics, University of Chicago, 1953) 's argument for the flexible exchange regime is found to be marginally valid for Sub-Saharan African countries: African countries adopting the <b>independently</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate system tend to be less influenced by foreign inflation innovations. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monetary exchange rate model with imperfect capital mobility, slow adjustment of goods {{prices in the}} short-term and currency substitution. As in Dornbusch’s model (1976), it is demonstrated that an exogenous monetary shock can lead to an initial overshooting of the exchange rate. In our model, this phenomenon derives from the presence of currency substitution. This model is illustrated with reference to three developing countries, Ghana, Paraguay and Uruguay, using quarterly data covering the period of <b>independently</b> <b>floating</b> exchange rate regime for each of them. At least one co-integrating vector between the exchange rate and its determinants is identified, lending support to {{the interpretation of the}} monetary exchange rate model as describing a long-run phenomenon.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} macroeconomic policies and foreign shocks on the stability of a small open economy, in which equity investment is more crucial than debt investment. The key assumption of our model is that stocks and bonds are imperfect substitutes. Accordingly, financial market equilibrium in our model is achieved only when both money and stock markets are simultaneously in equilibrium. In contrast to the Mundell-Fleming model, fiscal policy is relatively effective under the flexible exchange rate regime, while monetary policy is relatively effective under the fixed exchange rate regime. In the case of foreign shocks such as hike of world interest rates, the flexible exchange rate regime appears more effective in stabilizing the economy because the flexible exchange rate functions as a shock absorber. The empirical evidence from the Korean economy during 1998 : 4 - 2000 : 11 supports these findings. After the 1997 currency crisis, the Korean monetary authorities adopted the <b>independently</b> <b>floating</b> exchange regime and fully liberalized the capital account. Using a vector autoregressive model consisting of money stock, interest rate, balance of payments and exchange rate, we analyze the effect of an expansionary monetary policy. An {{increase in money supply}} decreases the domestic interest rates but the balance of payments turns into surplus. This result confirms that the higher rates of return on equity results in net capital inflows, in spite of lower domestic interest rates, and thus appreciates the domestic currency...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{reviewed}} four major {{developments in the}} last 30 years: {{the collapse of the}} Bretton Woods arrangements; deepening of economic integration worldwide; the frequency and severity of the crises that affected not only developing economies but developed economies as well; and the formation of the Euroland. Against this background was the increasing intra-regional trade and investment in East Asia. Existing empirical studies generally show that East Asia has satisfied the economic criteria for an optimum currency area. This implies that East Asia will benefit from having a common monetary arrangement. However, this requires a strong political commitment, which admittedly is absent in East Asia at the moment. Should East Asia be able muster enough political will to go ahead with deeper economic integration, then it must also prepare itself for monetary integration. The paper then went on to review and assess {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} five possible common monetary arrangements for East Asia that can contribute to the stability of the financial system in the region and support the deepening of economic integration in the region. The best arrangement for a more integrated East Asian region is the East Asian common currency union, with the regional currency <b>independently</b> <b>floating</b> vis- 0 -vis other currencies in the world. However, given the present economic and political realities in East Asia, this arrangement should be considered as a long-term goal that should be accomplished over 2 or 3 decades. In the interim, it is better for East Asia to agree on a regional currency basket system consisting of the yen, the euro and the US dollar. During this transition period, East Asian economies should strive to work on the following pre-conditions: strengthening central bank independence, enhancing wage and price flexibility, strengthening the financial sector, and harmonizing monetary policy. The emerging arrangements under the CMI and the expanded ASEAN Surveillance Process are a constructive sign that East Asian economies can work together to advance their common interests. Success in these arrangements will eventually lead to greater monetary cooperation in the region...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of four essays, where the unifying theme is how different exchange rate regimes have affected developing countries’ economic performance in different respects. In particular, we analyse the consequences on developing countries’ exports, but also, to some extent, the effects on their economic growth. Chapter 1 serves as an introductory chapter and provides a background to the dissertation. Furthermore, it outlines the main results of the study. Chapter 2 analyses the effects of exchange rate risk on exports in a theoretical framework. The implications of fixed versus variable costs of production are explored and contrasted between exporting firms in developing countries and industrialised countries. We argue that exporting firms in developing countries generally have short-run variable costs to greater extent than exporting firms in industrialised countries, and that these differences imply that exporting firms in developing countries are more likely to reduce their export quantity as a consequence of exchange rate risk. Chapter 3 examines the effects of exchange rate volatility on the export supply of some South East Asian developing countries and on developed countries’ demand for their exports, using quarterly data from 1979 to 1989. Since the developing countries of the study have ‘managed’ their exchange rates one way or the other, a proxy variable for realignment expectations is included in their export supply functions. Exchange rate volatility measures are estimated in a univariate GARCH model, and the parallel to official exchange rate ratio is used as a proxy for realignment expectations. The results indicate that exchange rate volatility vis-à-vis the U. S. dollar has hampered the export supply of the developing countries, while no such effects are found on the developed countries’ demand for exports. As for realignment expectations, no effects are found on the developing countries’ export supply. Chapter 4 analyses the effects of different exchange rate regimes on developing countries’ exports. Previous studies have often focused on the export effects of exchange rate volatility and exchange rate misalignments separately. Our approach differs since we concentrate on the net effects of exchange rate regimes on exports, thereby accounting for the export effects of both exchange rate volatility and exchange rate misalignments. During our study period, 1983 - 1992, countries pegging to a single currency have experienced the weakest export performance, while countries with an <b>independently</b> <b>floating</b> currency have experienced the strongest export performance. Our results may be interpreted as an indication that exchange rate misalignments have affected the developing countries’ export performance to a relatively greater extent than exchange rate volatility. Chapter 5 brings out some empirical evidence on the determinants of nine Asian developing countries’ real effective exchange rates (REER), covering the period 1966 to 1992. We derive measures of REER misalignments and analyse if such misalignments have affected the real GDP per capita growth rates by affecting total factor productivity and factor accumulation. A first finding is that REER misalignments have differed largely across countries, ranging from slight undervaluations to large overvaluations. A second finding is that the more overvalued the REER has been, the lower has investments as a share of GDP been. Since we also find that the investment share is positively related to the real GDP per capita growth rate, we have a link between REER misalignments and growth. The more overvalued the REER, the lower the rate of factor accumulation, and the lower the real GDP per capita growth rate. No effects are, however, found of REER misalignments on the real GDP per capita growth rate through effects on total factor productivity...|$|R
