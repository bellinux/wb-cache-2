The effects of this parameter on engine performance and pollutant emissions have been studied using various EGR and split injection schemes on a DI diesel engine. In this study, twelve different injection strategies for which two injection pulses with different fuel amount for each pulse (up to 30 % for the second pulse) and different separation between two pulses (up to 30 ?? CA) were evaluated using CFD modeling. Results show the higher <b>Homogeneity</b> <b>Factor</b> will result in higher rate of air-fuel mixing and more complete combustion process. It was found when the dwell delay between injection pulses becomes longer, as it leaves more time for the air-fuel mixing during the late compression stroke, the maximum amount of <b>Homogeneity</b> <b>Factor</b> will be obtained at a later stage of combustion process and it can caused a reduction of NOx formation.

In the literature, it has been concluded that properly interconnected and continuous pores with their spatial distribution could contribute to perform diverse mechanical, biological and chemical functions of a scaffold. Thus, there has been a need for reproducible and fabricatable scaffold design with controllable and functional gradient porosity. Improvements in Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes for tissue engineering and their design methodologies have enabled the development of controlled and interconnected scaffold structures. However homogeneous scaffolds with uniform porosity do not capture the intricate spatial internal micro architecture of the replaced tissue and thus are not capable of capturing the design.

First, layers are generated along the optimum build direction considering the heterogeneous micro structure of tissue.

Known-groups validity was studied by category of severity, based on Hoehn and Yahr staging (HY), CISI-PD, and disease duration. ResultsThree hundred thirty-one Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with usable data participated (mean age 64. 7 years; 42. 3 % female; mean PD duration 8. 5 years; HY, 1 to 5).

Embracing a theoretical and regression analysis, this thesis sets out to unravel the causes of African corruption, its implications, and its effects upon the economic standards of a number of selected countries. The findings reveal that corruption, amid all time-periods analyzed, discloses a strong deleterious impact upon GNI per capita primarily by damaging and undermining the African insti-tutional framework, which in turn is unable to function optimally.

New classification methods no longer work with pixels, but with regions derived from the previously segmented image [TRIAS 2006], [BENCHERIF 2009]. The first step consists in image segmentation based on several criteria, a scale parameter and an <b>homogeneity</b> <b>factor</b> made up of two complementary factors: shape and radiometry. 2 segmentations have been computed: one at very large scale (no more than 20 regions) in order to establish a manually made classification with only 2 classes: forest and no forest (this latter will not be classified).

The airfuel mixing quality is critical for controlling ignition timing and combustion duration.

The present investigation {{is focused on the}} effects of advanced fuel injections and air path strategies as well as the effects of piston geometry and fuel spray angle on air-fuel homogeneity, combustion process and their impacts on the performance and emission of the engine. A Ricardo Hydra single-cylinder engine in combination with AVL Fire CFD software was used in this investigation. An experimental analysis was conducted to assess the combustion characteristics and emissions formation of the engine under various injection strategies such as different injection timing, quantity, ratio, dwell angles between injections with various exhaust valve opening times and exhaust back pressures.

The investigation concludes that multiple injection strategies have the potential to reduce diesel emissions while maintaining meaningful fuel economy. Split injection can be used to improve the air-fuel mixture locally and control temperature generation during the start of combustion. Increased air-fuel homogeneity results in fewer fuel-rich areas within the cylinder and contributes to the reduction of soot emission.

The effects of swirl ratio, EGR rate and boost pressure are evaluated for improving the mixing and combustion of PPCI. The <b>Homogeneity</b> <b>Factor</b> (HF) was proposed for {{evaluating the quality of}} mixing and for quantitatively investigating the effects of injection parameters and in-cylinder air motion on mixture formation. Relationships between the quality of mixing and combustion performance and emissions were discussed using this factor. The results showed that HF had well revealed overall quality of mixture and the effects of operating parameters explicitly. Different EGR compositions with varied fractions of CO 2 or H 2 O were applied in PPCI combustion in order to evaluate the effects of EGR constituents on the combustion performance and emissions. Moreover, the parametric study was conducted under a sweep of the 2 nd injection timing and EGR rate, for the understanding of the effects of CO 2 and water vapour in EGR at different operating modes. The speed range and load range for the PPCI diesel combustion using split injection was investigated. The results showed that the high level of EGR rate limited the implementation of PPCI combustion at high engine load, while the engine speed was limited by increased CO emissions. The application of high level cooled EGR had the potential for extending operating limits. The proposed Premixed Rate (PR) has revealed the correlations between the degree of premixed combustion and ignition delay, together with overall equivalence ratio.

It essentially seems to capture {{the fact that the}} less-educated group is not always perfectly aligned with the other two groups in terms of internal <b>homogeneity.</b> With the <b>factor</b> loadings for the less-educated and the higher-educated groups going in opposite directions, it {{can be thought of as}} capturing the internal heterogeneity of the former relative to the latter.|$|R

Long-term adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is low among patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The potential role of “habit ” in sustaining adherence to CPAP use has not been studied. This study aimed to establish the relevance of habit to CPAP adherence, via validation of an adaptation of the Self-Report Habit Index (the CPAP Habit Index- 5; CHI- 5). Analyses focused on the <b>homogeneity,</b> reliability, and <b>factor</b> structure of the CHI- 5 and, in line with theoretical predictions, its utility {{as a predictor of}} long-term CPAP adherence in middle-aged patients with OSA. A prospective longitudinal design was used...|$|R
