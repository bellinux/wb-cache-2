Authors utilized a Mono-Q anion exchange column {{to remove the}} small quantity of proteinaceous materials and unwanted DNA prior to the crystallization step. Once M.HhaI was successfully purified, the sample was then grown using a method that mixes the solution containing the complex at a temperature of 16°C and the hanging-drop vapor <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> to obtain the crystals. Authors were then able to collect the x-ray data according to a technique used by Cheng and colleagues in 1993. This technique involved the measurement of the diffraction intensities on a FAST detector, where the exposure times for 0.1° rotation were 5 or 10 seconds. For the structure determination and refinement, Klimasaukas and colleagues used the molecular replacement of the refined apo structure described by Cheng and colleagues in 1993 where the search models [...] X-PLOR, MERLOT, and TRNSUM were used to solve the rotation and translation functions. This {{part of the study}} involves the use of a variety of software and computer algorithms to solve the structures and characteristics of the crystal of interest.|$|E

30|$|Just like {{in every}} {{communication}} among entities, {{the reliability of}} information exchange between nanomachines depends {{on the characteristics of}} the communication medium. The ability to integrate the knowledge of the medium characteristics into the design and analysis of the nanomachines is dependent on the appropriateness of the model that is used to mimic the propagation behavior. Popular molecular propagation mechanisms include the use of molecular motors [17 – 19], bacteria [20, 21], and molecular diffusion [22, 23]. The focus of this paper is on the molecular <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> for information exchange among nanomachines.
