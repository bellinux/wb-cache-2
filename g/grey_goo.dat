5|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{terrorist}} attack on Chicago by the Knights Templar; a nanite bomb turns the entire city into <b>grey</b> <b>goo,</b> with the staff and trainees of the city's Tarsus Academy facility barely escaping in time. After relocating to Tarsus' Seattle facility, the city's own Tarsus facility is attacked by soldiers of the Order. Alex, discovering with Billie's help that Tarsus has been observing their trainees in secret {{under the guidance of}} Nassif, escapes the facility and is subsequently offered missions by Tarsus, the Order, the WTO, and the Omar. During these missions, Alex learns that their biomods were created by ApostleCorp, and follows Nassif from Seattle to Cairo, which is being disrupted by fighting between the factions. Alex's fellow students follow different paths during the narrative; Billie initially allies with the Order before joining the Knights Templar, Klara joins the WTO, while Leo becomes involved with the Omar and can become an unwilling convert.|$|E
500|$|Drexler {{compared}} the nanotechnology debate's importance {{to that of}} discussions of spaceflight before Sputnik or to theoretical work on nuclear chemistry before the Manhattan Project. He disputed Smalley's arguments that the fear of a <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> scenario would hinder continued funding of nanotechnology research, arguing that the potential for long-term risks made research even more important. His conclusion stated, [...] "your misdirected arguments have needlessly confused public discussion of genuine long-term security concerns." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{referenced}} {{the idea}} of a molecular assembler, a nanorobot capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of {{how long it would take}} such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material, but self-replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> scenario, or, referring to Bill Joy's previous article [...] "Why the future doesn't need us", that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> {{is another}} catastrophic scenario, which was {{proposed}} by Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation, has been analyzed by Freitas in [...] "Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations" [...] {{and has been}} a theme in mainstream media and fiction. This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks. [...] Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to [...] Chris Phoenix a [...] "So-called <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident". With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called green goo has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological organisms engineered through nanotechnology.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering's 2004 {{report on}} the {{implications}} of nanoscience and nanotechnologies was inspired by Prince Charles' concerns about nanotechnology, including molecular manufacturing. However, the report spent almost no time on molecular manufacturing. [...] In fact, the word [...] "Drexler" [...] appears only once {{in the body of}} the report (in passing), and [...] "molecular manufacturing" [...] or [...] "molecular nanotechnology" [...] not at all. [...] The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology. [...] It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields. The report contains an annex (appendix) on <b>grey</b> <b>goo,</b> which cites a weaker variation of Richard Smalley's contested argument against molecular manufacturing. It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, self replicating nanomachines will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.|$|E
2500|$|The Involved {{are also}} contrasted with hegemonising swarms (a term used {{in several of}} Banks' Culture novels). [...] These are {{entities}} that exist to convert {{as much of the}} universe as possible into more of themselves; most typically these are technological in nature, resembling more sophisticated forms of <b>grey</b> <b>goo,</b> but the term can be applied to cultures that are sufficiently single-minded in their devotion to mass conquest, control, and colonisation. [...] Both the Culture and the author (in his Notes on the Culture) find this behavior quixotic and ridiculous. [...] Most often, societies categorized as hegemonising swarms consist of species or groups newly arrived in the galactic community with highly expansionary and exploitative goals. [...] The usage of the term [...] "hegemonising swarm" [...] in this context is considered derisive in the Culture and among other Involved and is used to indicate their low regard for those with these ambitions by comparing their behavior to that of mindless self-replicating technology. [...] The Culture's central moral dilemma regarding intervention in other societies can be construed as a conflict between the desire to help others and the desire to avoid becoming a hegemonising swarm themselves.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to get to the size specified by the level. This is done by eating entities that are smaller than the <b>Grey</b> <b>Goo,</b> and avoiding those that would harm it, such as dinosaurs, bacteria and samurai. However, touching a damaging item only removes a small bit of matter for the <b>grey</b> <b>goo,</b> and there's a limit on how much is removed, so on Casual mode, it's impossible to lose the game. Also, {{the vast majority of the}} harmful object ignore the <b>grey</b> <b>goo,</b> and only a few, like the bambiraptor, actively pursue it, and nothing in the game can move faster than the <b>grey</b> <b>goo.</b> The level is complete when the <b>Grey</b> <b>Goo</b> has reached the required size or otherwise fulfilled the stage requirements (such as, perhaps, eating a set number of eggs or mummies). On the timed levels, players can also try to achieve the [...] "Medals" [...] for each level by completing the level under a certain time limit, which can be found on the level select menu by mousing over the chosen level.

50|$|The <b>Grey</b> <b>Goo</b> starts small {{again in}} the late Cretaceous period, {{consuming}} the plants and animals of the area, before consuming a volcano and {{being hit by a}} meteor, which prevents the dinosaurs from going extinct. In the present, the scientist and the assistant experience changes in the timeline as they happen in the past. After being hit by the meteor, the <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> travels through time again, but each time it travels through time it reverts to a small size. It then travels to Egypt, and consumes snakes, mummies, cats, people, buildings, and the pyramids. Next it travels to Ancient Rome, where it consumes a feast, people, then buildings and destroys the city, forcing the Romans to pull together and prevent the fall of the empire. Next it travels to Feudal Japan, where it eats rice, ninjas, and buildings, but also consumes Monsterzilla (Godzilla), removing the world's protection from giant monsters and allowing them to ravage the present. The scientist by this point has figured out that the <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> has only one jump left, this time to their future, and they must be prepared for it, so he and his assistant preserve their brains so they can survive until the <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> appears. When it does, far in the future, it is microscopic instead of a few centimeters in diameter as when it usually jumps, but the scientist has prepared tiny robots to destroy the <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> while it is still small. However, it evades the bots and grows larger, necessitating the scientist's second line of defense: energy weapons grafted onto ants, rats, and cats. It evades those too, growing large enough to consume the scientist and his assistants' brains. Giant humanoid tanks armed with powerful lasers are dispatched to destroy the goo, now several meters in diameter, but it evades the blasts, consumes future technology, people, and cars, and destroys the tanks too, destroying the city. Next, it launches into space, grows on space rocks, destroys humanity's last line of defense - large circular spacecraft that measure roughly 150 kilometers in diameter - then moves on to destroy the moon, inner planets, and the gas giants. Next the <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> consumes small stars around the sun, then the sun itself, working up to larger stars, gas giants, nebulae, a black hole, star clusters, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Ripping through the fabric of time, it eats said fabric, and discovers that the fabric of time is resting {{on the back of a}} turtle, which is on the back of a slightly larger turtle, and that it's turtles all the way down. It then eats the turtles until they are gone, but since the turtles are never ending, the goo feasts forever, then the game is over.|$|E
50|$|In part {{to resolve}} this and related {{questions}} {{about the dangers of}} industrial accidents and popular fears of runaway events equivalent to Chernobyl and Bhopal disasters, and the more remote issue of ecophagy, <b>grey</b> <b>goo</b> and green goo (various potential disasters arising from runaway replicators, which could be built using mechanosynthesis) the UK Royal Society and UK Royal Academy of Engineering in 2003 commissioned a study to deal with these issues and larger social and ecological implications, led by mechanical engineering professor Ann Dowling. This was anticipated by some to take a strong position on these problems and potentials —- and suggest any development path to a general theory of so-called mechanosynthesis.
