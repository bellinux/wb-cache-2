Its popularity was such that established glam metal groups, including Guns N' Roses and Mötley Crüe, began to <b>dabble</b> in the style. Figures from the hip hop scene also began to seek out collaborations with and remixes from industrial metal musicians.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to <b>dabble</b> in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a human cell in 1955.|$|E

50|$|At {{one point}} Painter had three {{companion}} applications: a vector-based natural media twin called Expression; a scaled-down version of Painter developed for beginners called <b>Dabbler</b> (later renamed Art <b>Dabbler</b> after the MetaCreations merger); and a grayscale-only clone called Sketcher. After the Corel acquisition, Art <b>Dabbler</b> 2 was reintroduced as Corel Painter Essentials, {{now in its}} fourth incarnation.|$|R

50|$|The bronze-winged duck (Speculanas specularis) {{also known}} as the spectacled duck, is a <b>dabbling</b> duck and the sole member of its genus Speculanas. It is often placed in Anas with most other <b>dabbling</b> ducks, but its closest {{relative}} is either the crested duck or the Brazilian duck, which likewise form monotypic genera. Together they belong to a South American lineage which diverged early from the other <b>dabbling</b> ducks and may include the steamer ducks.|$|R
25|$|After {{leaving for}} Britain in 1869, Blackwell diversified her interests, and was active both in social reform and authorship. She co-founded the National Health Society in 1871. She {{perceived}} {{herself as a}} wealthy gentlewoman who had the leisure to <b>dabble</b> in reform and in intellectual activities– the income from her American investments supported her. She was rather occupied with her social status, and her friend, Barbara Bodichon helped introduce Blackwell into her circles. She travelled across Europe many times during these years, in England, France, Wales, Switzerland and Italy.|$|E
25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} <b>dabble</b> with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E
25|$|Moshe Chaim Luzzatto {{was born}} in 1707 in the Jewish Ghetto of Padua, Italy. The son of Jacob Vita and Diamente Luzzatto, he {{received}} classical Jewish and Italian education, showing a predilection for literature {{at a very early}} age. He may have attended the University of Padua and certainly associated with a group of students there, known to <b>dabble</b> in mysticism and alchemy. With his vast knowledge in religious lore, the arts, and science, he quickly became the dominant figure in that group. His writings demonstrate mastery of the Tanakh, the Talmud, and the rabbinical commentaries and codes of Jewish law.|$|E

The math puzzles consist of multiple choice questions, formulas, arithmetics, estimates, ratios, negative numbers, BODMAS, decimals and algebraic equations. Every math puzzle activity has three different difficulty levels to choose from. By the near {{end of the}} game, the player has to win an arcade-style platformer level by throwing goo at Dr. <b>Dabble's</b> critters.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate about the <b>dabbling</b> ducks' systematical status and which ducks belong to the Anatinae. As {{understood}} here, the subfamily contains only the <b>dabbling</b> ducks and their close relatives, the extinct moa-nalos. Alternatively, the Anatinae are considered to include most [...] "ducks", and the <b>dabbling</b> ducks form a tribe Anatini within these. The classification as presented here more appropriately reflects the remaining uncertainty about the interrelationships of the major lineages of Anatidae (waterfowl).|$|R
25|$|During the Curragh Mutiny (March 1914) Haig urged caution on {{his chief}} of staff John Gough, whose brother Hubert Gough (then a cavalry brigadier, later GOC Fifth Army in WW1) was {{threatening}} to resign rather than coerce Ulstermen into a semi-independent Ireland. Haig stressed that the army's duty was to keep the peace and urged his officers not to <b>dabble</b> in politics. Sir John French was forced to resign as CIGS, after having made the error of putting in writing a promise that officers would not be required to coerce Ulster; Haig respected Hubert Gough's principled stand but felt French had allowed himself {{to be used as a}} political tool by H. H. Asquith.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} is also {{seen in the}} third tier Camping World Truck Series, particularly by Kyle Busch, who currently operates his own truck team Kyle Busch Motorsports, and Kevin Harvick who formerly operated Kevin Harvick Incorporated from 2002 to 2012. Busch's #51 truck won the owner's championship in 2013, with Busch running 11 of the 22 races and scoring 5 wins, and again in 2014, where Busch won 7 out of the 10 races he participated in. Cup drivers occasionally <b>dabble</b> in NASCAR's regional series, such as Ryan Newman running select Whelen Modified Tour events for Kevin Manion and Mike Curb, the sister ARCA Racing Series, and local dirt and short track events.|$|E
25|$|Mobutu found {{discipline}} in army life, {{as well as}} a father figure in Sergeant Louis Bobozo. Mobutu kept up his studies by borrowing European newspapers from the Belgian officers and books from wherever he could find them, reading them on sentry duty and whenever he had a spare moment. His favorites were the writings of French President Charles de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli. After passing a course in accounting, he began to <b>dabble</b> professionally in journalism. Still angry after his clashes with the school priests, he did not marry in a church. His contribution to the wedding festivities was a crate of beer, all his army salary could afford.|$|E

25|$|The play {{begins with}} the {{marriage}} of King Henry VI of England to the young Margaret of Anjou. Margaret is the protégée and lover of William de la Pole, 4th Earl of Suffolk, who aims to influence the king through her. The major obstacle to Suffolk and Margaret's plan is the Lord Protector; Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who is extremely popular with the common people and deeply trusted by the King. Gloucester's wife, however, has designs on the throne, and has been led by an agent of Suffolk to <b>dabble</b> in necromancy. She summons a spirit and demands it reveal the future to her, but its prophecies are vague and before the ritual is finished, she is interrupted and arrested. At court she is then banished, greatly to the embarrassment of Gloucester. Suffolk then conspires with Cardinal Beaufort and the Duke of Somerset to bring about Gloucester's ruin. Suffolk accuses Gloucester of treason and has him imprisoned, but before Gloucester can be tried, Suffolk sends two assassins to kill him. Meanwhile, Richard, 3rd Duke of York, reveals his claim to the throne to the Earls of Salisbury and Warwick, who pledge to support him.|$|E

50|$|The Anatinae are a {{subfamily}} of {{the family}} Anatidae (swans, geese and ducks). Its surviving members are the <b>dabbling</b> ducks, which feed mainly at the surface rather than by diving. The {{other members of the}} Anatinae are the extinct moa-nalo, a young but highly apomorphic lineage derived from the <b>dabbling</b> ducks.|$|R
5000|$|The genus {{belongs to}} the family Anatidae in the {{waterfowl}} order Anseriformes. They were formerly placed in the [...] "perching ducks", a paraphyletic group somewhat intermediate between shelducks and <b>dabbling</b> ducks, {{and it is not}} quite clear whether they should be placed in the Anatinae (<b>dabbling</b> duck) or Tadorninae (shelduck) subfamily.|$|R
500|$|During {{his year}} at Cape Flora Bruce {{collected}} around 700 zoological specimens, in often very disagreeable conditions. According to Jackson: [...] "It is no pleasant job to <b>dabble</b> in icy-cold water, with the thermometer some degrees below zero, or to plod {{in the summer}} through snow, slush and mud many miles in search of animal life, as I have known Mr Bruce frequently to do". Jackson named Cape Bruce after him, on {{the northern edge of}} Northbrook Island, at 80°55′N. Jackson was less pleased with Bruce's proprietarial attitude to his personal specimens, which he refused to entrust to the British Museum with the expedition's other finds. This [...] "tendency towards scientific conceit", and lack of tact in interpersonal dealings, were early demonstrations of character flaws that in later life would be held against him.|$|E
500|$|... "Murder" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with many}} complimenting {{the fact that}} the show was able to <b>dabble</b> in a ridiculous situation with over-the-top characters while, in the end, still having a point. Dan Phillips of IGN said that the episode was a [...] "major step up" [...] from the [...] "disappointing" [...] last two episodes, [...] "Koi Pond" [...] and [...] "Double Date". Phillips stated that the episode [...] "struck a nice balance between unbound silliness and grounded drama, even if the silliness dominated at times." [...] Phillips praised the way that, when Michael stood up to Jim and argued that the office members needed the game to remain sane, [...] "the character I love had returned after playing the part of moronic jerk for too much of this season." [...] Ultimately, he gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10 score, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E

500|$|Ernest, {{like his}} brother, {{was in favor}} of a German unified, federal state. To best realize this goal, Ernest liked to <b>dabble</b> in {{whatever}} political system promised the most success. He subsequently watched the growth of liberalism in Germany with much interest and tried to build links with the movement's leaders. During Albert's lifetime, Ernest took a close interest in the movement for reform, and was perceived as a progressive within Germany. His favorable view of liberalism caused his duchy to become an asylum for political refugees from other German states. In 1863, he attended the liberal Frankfurt Conference, which was openly avoided by more conservative Prussia. Though his attendance made him no friends in Prussia, he developed such strong contacts in Austria that many looked to him as a potential leader in the mounting conflict between the northern and southern powers. He grew tired of the advice he received from Albert on the subject however; as Ernest [...] "was by no means inclined to consent to an energetic rule such as I adopted immediately afterwards for the perfection of the constitutional system", according to Albert's letters.|$|E

Tsar Paul I of Russia sent, among other rewards, a gold box studded with diamonds, and similar gifts in silver arrived from other European rulers. On his return to Naples, Nelson was greeted with a triumphal procession led by King Ferdinand IV and Sir William Hamilton and was introduced for only the third time to Sir William's wife Emma, Lady Hamilton, who fainted violently at the meeting, and apparently took several weeks to recover from her injuries. Lauded as a hero by the Neapolitan court, Nelson was later to <b>dabble</b> in Neapolitan politics and become the Duke of Bronté, actions {{for which he was}} criticised by his superiors and his reputation suffered.
