40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{property}} transfer of servile real estates in the Estate of Melnik during the 17 century. As the main resource material was used the collection of Melnik Books of Land Ownership founded during the 80 s of the 16 century. After the Thirty Years' War these books were restored in connection with the afterwar reconstruction of the Estate of Melnik and were published in a new edition until the turn of the 17 and 18 century. Besides these Books of Land Ownership we also studied other kinds of resources such as land and duties registers, land-registries, inventories and estimations which originated in the 17 century with respect to this Estate. In the end of the 17 century was formed a uniquely preserved register of serfs which enables us not only to have better knowledge of the structure of settled farmers themselves but also create the first picture of general structure of servile population in the Estate. In the introduction I tried to place the Estate of Melnik in the structure of Early Modern Times country estates.
