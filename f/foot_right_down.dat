60|$|Their road wound onward {{among the}} hills, which rose steep and lofty from the scanty level space that lay between them. They {{continually}} thrust their great bulks before the wayfarers, as if grimly resolute to forbid their passage, or closed abruptly behind them, when they still dared to proceed. A gigantic hill would set its <b>foot</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> before them, and {{only at the}} last moment would grudgingly withdraw it, just far enough to let them creep towards another obstacle. Adown these rough heights were visible the dry tracks of many a mountain torrent that had lived a life too fierce and passionate to be a long one. Or, perhaps, a stream was yet hurrying shyly along the edge of a far wider bed of pebbles and shelving rock than it seemed to need, though not too wide for the swollen rage of which this shy rivulet was capable. A stone bridge bestrode it, the ponderous arches of which were upheld and rendered indestructible by the weight of the very stones that threatened to crush them down. Old Roman toil was perceptible in the foundations of that massive bridge; the first weight that it ever bore was that of an army of the Republic.|$|E

60|$|From {{the sea to}} {{the shrine}} of this god, the fine valley of Monlova ascends with a gentle gradation, hardly perceptible; but upon turning round toward the water, one is {{surprised}} to find himself high elevated above its surface. Pass on, and the same silent ascent deceives you; and the valley contracts; and on both sides the cliffs advance; till at last {{you come to a}} narrow space, shouldered by buttresses of rock. Beyond, through this cleft, all is blue sky. If the Trades blow high, and you came unawares upon the spot, you would think Keevi himself pushing you forward with all his hands; so powerful is the current of air rushing through this elevated defile. But expostulate not with the tornado that blows you along; sail on; but soft; look down; the land breaks off in one sheer descent of a thousand <b>feet,</b> <b>right</b> <b>down</b> to the wide plain below. So sudden and profound this precipice, that you seem to look off from one world to another. In a dreamy, sunny day, the spangled plain beneath assumes an uncertain fleeting aspect. Had you a deep-sea-lead you would almost be tempted to sound the ocean-haze at your feet.|$|R
50|$|In korfball, either foot {{can be used}} as pivot, {{no matter}} which foot touches the ground first. This means that in practice, one can take 2.5 steps, e.g. landing on the <b>right</b> <b>foot,</b> putting <b>down</b> the left and {{displacing}} the <b>right.</b> The left <b>foot</b> is the pivot in this case. The left foot can then be lifted, but may not be repositioned.|$|R

5000|$|Truckin: Truckin is a shuffle step {{variation}} popularized after the vaudeville era. The right hand is held up (as in a right turn signal) with {{the index finger}} extended and wagging. In Harlem Truckin the shoulder is set back. Feet are parallel at all times. With both feet together and facing slight left the <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> scoopes <b>down</b> and brushes the floor, the left foot is then gathered at the right ankle and the right heel twists (this should cause forward movement as the foot scoopes past the other foot). The action is repeated creating a [...] "hearts in the snow" [...] effect from the overlapping steps. At {{the same time the}} left hand is placed over the stomach (like a waiter holding a towel) and never really moves. The stomach twistes with the feet therefore, the [...] "stomach rubs the hand". If truckin is being done around a circle the outside hand is always up.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1930s Ruellan {{developed}} a style which was social-realist with modernist and abstract elements. Her sympathy for her subjects and {{her ability to}} convey a warmth in them is similar to Edward Hopper's or Howard Cook's. See, for example, her undated drawing, Coal Delivery, which appears to come from this period. Drawn with ink and wash on paper, it shows an African-American man carrying a heavy bag of coal on his back. He is leaning forward as he places his <b>right</b> <b>foot</b> <b>down</b> and begins to raise the left one. He holds the coal bag {{with his right hand}} and leaves his left arm hanging free. The sketch suggests a patient endurance. The composition gives contrasts of diagonal—from left foot to cap—and vertical—the right leg and left arm, the whole showing both the pull of gravity and the energy of forward motion. In work such as this, Ruellan was seen to present social criticism with artistic frankness and little covering up of social facts, but also with empathy and awareness of the value of each person as a specific individual and not simply a generic [...] "type".|$|R
