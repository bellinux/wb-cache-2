5000|$|A pop pop boat {{is powered}} by a very simple heat engine. This engine {{consists}} of a small boiler, which is connected to an exhaust tube. When heat is applied to the boiler, water in the boiler flashes into steam. The expanding steam pushes out the bottom of the boiler with a sound 'pop' and pushes some of the water in the exhaust tube, propelling the boat forward. Then the boiler is dry, no generating steam pressure, because no water inside the boiler. The column of water in the exhaust tube is no longer being pushed, but the momentum of the water keeps it going outward. This creates a lower-than-atmospheric pressure inside the boiler. The bottom of the boiler bulge inward (concave), making a sound 'pop' and normal atmospheric pressure is pushing the water back in. The cooled water that is brought back into the boiler is then heated and flashed into steam, and the cycle repeats. This constant flashing and cooling cycle of the engine creates the distinctive [...] "pop pop" [...] noise for which the boat is named. This noise is more pronounced when a <b>diaphragm-type</b> boiler is used (coil-type boilers are much quieter). The presence of air in the boiler acts as a spring and gives a better oscillation of the water level, but if too much air enters the boiler then the oscillation ceases. Since water contains some dissolved air, in operation air tends to build up in the engine. Therefore, engines must [...] "burp" [...] out air periodically in order to run for a long time.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{model of}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of a <b>diaphragm-type</b> chlorine/caustic cell is presented. The model is based upon measurable diaphragm properties and the mass transfer of hydroxyl ion through the diaphragm. The anolyte is modeled simply as a region in which the OH- ion concentration is fixed, the diaphragm is modeled as a plug-flow reac-tor with an electrochemical reaction occurring at the catholyte/diaphragm interface where the cathode is placed, and the catholyte is modeled as a completely stirred flow reactor. Analytical integration of the governing equations for these models yields two mathematical expressions: one for the concentration distribution of hydroxyl ion within the dia-phragm {{and one for the}} effluent concentration.

Pulsatile perfusion was generated with an air-driven, <b>diaphragm-type</b> blood pump, and nonpulsatile perfusion was generated with a centrifugal pump. Renal sympathetic nerve activity and the blood flow of the descending aorta were then recorded during pulsatile and nonpulsatile systemic perfusion. Other variables, such as mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, left atrial pressure, and blood gas levels, were kept constant. At the same mean arterial pressure, renal sympathetic nerve activity during pulsatile perfusion decreased significantly to 80 % of renal sympathetic nerve activity during nonpulsatile perfusion (26. 8 ± 2. 4 vs 33. 4 ± 2. 9 spikes/sec, p < 0. 01).

This research work encompasses design, microfabrication, and experimental evaluation of these microvalves in three distinct areas compliant micromechanism, microfluidics, and electromagnetic actuation. The microvalve {{consists of a}} suspended gate that rotates in {{the plane of the}} chip to regulate flow through the orifices. The gate is suspended by a novel fully-compliant in-plane rotary bistable micromechanism (IPRBM) that advantageously constraints the gate in all other degrees of freedom. Multiple inlet/outlet orifices provide flexibility of operating the microvalve in three different flow/port configurations. The suspended gate is made of a soft magnetic material and is electromagnetically actuated like a rotor in a variable-reluctance stepper motor. Therefore, an external electromagnetic (EM) actuation at the integrated set of posts (stator) causes the gate mass to switch from its default angular position to a second angular position. The microvalve chip is fabricated by electroplating a soft magnetic material, Permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) in a sacrificial photoresist mold on a Silicon substrate. The inlet/outlet orifices are then etched into the Silicon substrate from the back-side using deep-reactive ion etch process. Finally, the gate structure is released by stripping the PR and seed layers.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 46) The Automated Regulator Test Machine (ARTM) is {{an electronic}} test machine {{developed for the}} Southern California Gas Company to monitor the performance of self-operated <b>diaphragm-type</b> natural gas service regulators. The ARTM was initially designed to serve in a capacity {{similar to that of}} an existing pneumatic system and was incorporated into Southern California Gas Company quality control procedures in 1989. Up until 1994, the ARTM was the primary inspection apparatus for all standard service regulators delivering 8 inches water column (w. c.) pressure. Problems were later encountered with data entry and the existing Honeywell controller. These issues were caused by increasing digits in regulator purchase order numbers and system memory failure evident in the existing controller setup. Other problems, related to system piping, inoperable solenoid valves, and noticeable pressure losses delayed the initial repairs greatly. The objective of this project is to resolve these problems by introducing an entirely new programmable controller, human-machine interface, and software program that will allow the ARTM to perform its function seamlessly and efficiently. The ARTM system consists of various solenoid control valves, differential pressure switches, control piping, ram operators, pressure transmitters, an electronic mass flow meter, and a PC workstation. The goal is to incorporate existing components where possible, perform a complete functionality check, and finally, implement the newly installed software and hardware to perform a series of pressure regulator tests in sequential fashion. In addition to the software and hardware integration, overall system improvements are presented. These include various upgrades in system components, including the installation of new pressure transmitters, new solenoid control valves, a new volume bottle accumulator, and the results of a comprehensive leak assessment to eliminate pressure losses in the ARTM system. The SCADAPack 32 installation, TelePACE Ladder Logic programming, and system improvements presented are then put to the test by a series of validation tests. The regulator performance results of the ARTM are compared to those obtained by American Meter, a well known pressure regulator manufacturing company, and to the pneumatic regulator test machine (PRTM). Finally, a conclusion is presented based on the validation tests, overall perfomlance of the AR TM, and a net time savings assessment related to quality control test procedures...|$|E
40|$|Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) are {{mechanical}} pumps {{connected to}} the human circulatory system in order to assist the left ventricle of diseased hearts in pumping blood to the body. Currently, both pulsatile and non-pulsatile VAD are used, primarily as a bridge to heart transplantation, with new generation devices under development to become alternatives to transplantation. Negative interactions between the biological components of the flow and the mechanical system, such as poor washout, recirculation, thrombosis and hemolysis need to be minimized {{in order to improve}} performance and longevity of both the device and the patient. The present research is an experimental study of flow in a highly idealized, <b>diaphragm-type,</b> pulsatile-flow VAD. Its objective is to document in detail the motions of the fluid and the diaphragm {{so that they can be}} used for the validation of ongoing numerical simulations of flows in such devices, and more generally to assist in validation of computational methods involving fluid-structure interaction. Measurements of the flow field were collected using both Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The PIV system was used to measure the instantaneous velocity variation along each of six different planes at several different times during the cycle, whereas the two component LDV system was used to measure the time-dependent velocity at several points of interest over the entire cycle. The images recorded by the PIV system camera have also been used to determine the instantaneous shape and position of the diaphragm at different times during the cycle. Representative and averaged PIV images showed that the inlet jet created a core vortex in the VAD that is the primary means of mixing. The development and motion of this vortex over the VAD operational cycle was documented for use in future modelling. A previously unobserved vortex was also documented. This vortex appeared in the vertical plane, beneath the inlet jet at peak injection, and moved along the path of the jet during the injection phase. It is believed that this vortex is created by the interaction of the inlet jet and the diaphragm in motion during injection and represents a region of recirculation in the flow, as well as possible flow separation. Other regions of recirculation were identified in the area directly adjacent to the outlet jet during ejection of the flow, and along the surface of the VAD directly opposite of the outlet tube just prior to the beginning of the ejection cycle. Areas of stagnant flow were also observed, particularly in the inlet and outlet tubes in periods of inactivity. The flow during ejection was localized in the region of the VAD directly adjacent to the outlet tube. The ejection has a longer period and a lower peak velocity than the injection. The motion of the VAD diaphragm was also studied and it was found that the diaphragm deformation was influenced by the inlet jet. The diaphragm shape was nearly axisymmetric during some parts of the cycle, but highly skewed during other parts. Small-scale motions were also present in the diaphragm, and fluctuated from one cycle to another, adding to irregularities in the flow. Dimensional analysis of the flow strongly suggested that the unsteady nature of the flow was the dominant feature of the flowfield. Recommendations for future experimental work include the addition of valves and a mock circulatory loop, as well as the use of different settings for the LDV and PIV systems for different parts of the VAD and different parts of the cycle...|$|E
