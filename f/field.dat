5|$|A third airfield, Alamo <b>Field,</b> was {{established}} in 1942 by aviator George Crockett {{south of the city}} of Las Vegas, at the present location of McCarran Airport. As the Army sought to open a local base at the site of McCarran <b>Field,</b> Clark County purchased Alamo <b>Field</b> from Crockett in order to relocate commercial air traffic. Alamo <b>Field</b> became the new McCarran <b>Field</b> on December 19, 1948. The opening of this new airfield broke Western Air Express' monopoly on flights to Las Vegas, allowing other airlines to serve the market. Meanwhile, the Army reopened its base at the original McCarran <b>Field</b> in 1949 and named it Nellis Air Force Base in 1950.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} <b>field</b> generally {{varies in}} space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric <b>field</b> disturbing the main <b>field</b> and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric <b>field</b> is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric <b>field</b> is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector <b>field.</b>|$|E

25|$|From {{a general}} point of view, the various <b>fields</b> in (3-dimensional) vector {{calculus}} are uniformly {{seen as being}} k-vector fields: scalar <b>fields</b> are 0-vector <b>fields,</b> vector <b>fields</b> are 1-vector <b>fields,</b> pseudovector <b>fields</b> are 2-vector <b>fields,</b> and pseudoscalar <b>fields</b> are 3-vector <b>fields.</b> In higher dimensions there are additional types of <b>fields</b> (scalar/vector/pseudovector/pseudoscalar corresponding to 0/1/n1/n dimensions, which is exhaustive in dimension 3), so one cannot only work with (pseudo)scalars and (pseudo)vectors.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>fields</b> are Witt {{equivalent}} {{if their}} Witt rings of symmetric bilinear forms are isomorphic. Witt equivalent <b>fields</b> {{can be understood}} to be <b>fields</b> having the same quadratic form theory. The behavior of finite <b>fields,</b> local <b>fields,</b> global <b>fields,</b> as well as function <b>fields</b> of curves defined over archimedean local <b>fields</b> under Witt equivalence is well-understood. Numbers of classes of Witt equivalent <b>fields</b> with finite numbers of square classes are also known in some cases. Witt equivalence of general function <b>fields</b> over global <b>fields</b> was studied in the earlier work [13] by the authors, and applied to study Witt equivalence of function <b>fields</b> of curves over global <b>fields.</b> In this paper we extend these results to local case, i. e. we discuss Witt equivalence of function <b>fields</b> of curves over local <b>fields.</b> As an application, we show that, modulo some additional assumptions, Witt equivalence of two such function <b>fields</b> implies Witt equivalence of underlying local <b>fields.</b> Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1502. 0083...|$|R

5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} toroidal magnetic <b>field</b> {{to the external}} poloidal <b>field,</b> and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal <b>field</b> is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal <b>field</b> is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal <b>field,</b> but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|Faraday's and Ampère's work {{showed that}} a {{time-varying}} magnetic <b>field</b> acted {{as a source of}} an electric <b>field,</b> and a time-varying electric <b>field</b> was a source of a magnetic <b>field.</b> Thus, when either <b>field</b> is changing in time, then a <b>field</b> of the other is necessarily induced. Such a phenomenon has the properties of a wave, and is naturally referred to as an electromagnetic wave. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864. Maxwell developed a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric <b>field,</b> magnetic <b>field,</b> electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the speed of light, and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell's Laws, which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic <b>field.</b> Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic <b>field</b> near Ganymede.

The <b>field</b> strength of the induced <b>field</b> at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian <b>field.</b> The induced magnetic <b>field</b> of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{electric}} <b>field</b> was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric <b>field</b> is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the <b>field.</b> The electric <b>field</b> acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to the way that the gravitational <b>field</b> acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric <b>field</b> can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric <b>field</b> at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|E
