500|$|Ukiyo-e {{reached a}} {{peak in the}} late 18th century {{with the advent of}} full-colour prints, {{developed}} after Edo returned to prosperity under Tanuma Okitsugu following a long depression. [...] These popular colour prints came to be called nishiki-e, or [...] "brocade pictures", as their brilliant colours seemed to bear resemblance to imported Chinese Shuchiang brocades, known in Japanese as Shokkō nishiki. [...] The first to emerge were expensive calendar prints, printed with multiple blocks on very <b>fine</b> <b>paper</b> with heavy, opaque inks. [...] These prints had the number of days for each month hidden in the design, and were sent at the New Year as personalized greetings, bearing the name of the patron rather than the artist. [...] The blocks for these prints were later re-used for commercial production, obliterating the patron's name and replacing it with that of the artist.|$|E

[...] Kanae, Hakutei, and a former art-school classmate of Kanae's, , founded the monthly magazine Hōsun. whose first issue appeared 15 May 1907. [...] It was patterned on such European magazines as Cocorico, Jugend, Simplicissimus. [...] The contents were primarily literature, criticism, and art cartoons, and its publishers paid fine attention to details of graphic design. [...] They printed the magazine on <b>fine</b> <b>paper</b> at an unusually large size and mixed colour reproduction with black-and-white. [...] Kanae's contributions included his own prints, haiku poetry, and the carving of printing blocks for the designs of others. [...] Kanae's former engraving teacher Sakurai Torakichi furnished the photographic printing plates. [...] The first issue was eight pages and included a supplementary print of Shiba Park by Kanae. [...] The young artists distributed the issue themselves to bookstores. [...] It sold well, and the circle of contributors grew, as did the page count, which expanded to sixteen.|$|E

While both papers had the support of at least 6 members, a majority of the CJLS found that both papers represented so extensive a change that they could not be accepted as a mere changes of Jewish law, but each should be regarded as a takkanah that would uproot a Torah prohibition if passed. [...] Under the CJLS rules, once a majority of the committee found a responsum to be a takkanah, accepting it would require a majority of the Committee (13 of 25 votes), while an ordinary responsum could be accepted as a valid alternative with as few as 6 of 25 votes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset rubber blankets (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic <b>papers</b> (<b>fine</b> art <b>paper</b> gloss, <b>fine</b> art <b>paper</b> mat, offset paper, calendered offset paper and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest dot gains in the following order: offset paper, recycled paper, calendered offset <b>paper,</b> <b>fine</b> art <b>paper</b> mat and <b>fine</b> art <b>paper</b> gloss. Such results are completely in accordance with the original roughness of paper. Key words: offset, offset cylinder, deviation of the printe...|$|R

40|$|There have {{in recent}} years been {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} print achieved using large format inkjet printers with stable pigmented ink sets on <b>fine</b> art inkjet <b>papers</b> coated with an ink receptive layer. Increasingly professional photographers, graphic artists, printmakers and artists from all disciplines are using inkjet technology to produce prints. Existing uncoated <b>fine</b> art <b>papers</b> can also offer a rich variety of substrates for inkjet printing. An identified problem is the colour variation between prints produced on coated and uncoated papers. This however can be remedied through correct linearisation and profiling.
