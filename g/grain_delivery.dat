The rural economy diversified far beyond its exclusively agricultural base, with service employment in education and medicine important, as well as small-scale factories. Better highways, along with cell phones and internet coverage encouraged a concentration in fewer, larger centers, which drew customers and clients from a wide radius. Most rural communities declined continuously over the second half of the 20th century, but some grew in population, expanded their economic base, and experienced an increase in their market areas for a limited range of goods and services. These communities also became centers of employment for their own and surrounding (farm and nonfarm) population.|$|E

These aspects are compulsory <b>grain</b> <b>delivery,</b> rationing in manufactured consumer goods, and rationing in modern farn inputs. The model involves two main innovations with the agricultural household modelling framework. First, a new procedure of analysing the impact of the policy of forced grain procurement is introduced. The procedure enables us to directly characterize the effects of that policy on farm households‚Äô welfare, as well as the production and consumption choices they make. Second, it pulls together various strands of te relevant literature in a simple manner. In particular, it provides a more direct way of determining the welfare effects of rationing, compulsory <b>grain</b> <b>delivery,</b> prices and incomes. Both individual and joint effects can be handled this way. The comparative static properties of the model directly show that forced grain procurement by the state reduces the welfare of farm households and distorts their production choices. The results also indicate that shortages (rationing) in manufactures consumer goods and modern inputs make commodity demands, input demands, and output supplies less price responsive. ...|$|E
