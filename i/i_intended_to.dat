5|$|In autumn 968, {{battles between}} the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire {{commenced}} in the Principality of Capua, in the Duchy of Benevento and Apulia, and hostilities continued until 970. Both {{sides of the}} conflict made many attempts to find a diplomatic solution. Otto <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> receive recognition of his title in Byzantium, and to clarify the borders of Western and Eastern allegiances in southern Italy. He wanted this agreement to be ratified by the marriage of his son, Otto II, {{to a member of}} the Byzantine imperial family. Anna, daughter of the deceased Emperor Romanos II, was considered a possible bride. However, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was unwilling to marry off a purple-born princess (i.e. a child born to a reigning emperor). After tough negotiations with Nikephoros II Phokas' successor John I Tzimiskes, Archbishop of Cologne Gero secured the marriage of Otto II with Theophanu, a member of the Byzantine imperial family who was not, however, born to the purple.|$|E
5|$|The French {{submarine}} Mariotte (Q74) was {{a submarine}} {{built for the}} French Navy prior to World War <b>I.</b> <b>Intended</b> <b>to</b> accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with her performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.|$|E

According to the tomb texts of Ahmose, son of Ebana, Amenhotep later sought to expand Egypt's border southward into Nubia and he led an invasion force which defeated the Nubian army. The tomb biography of Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet says he also fought in a campaign in Kush, however {{it is quite possible}} that it refers to the same campaign as Ahmose, son of Ebana. Amenhotep built a temple at Saï, showing that he had established Egyptian settlements almost as far as the third cataract.|$|E

Somerset Maugham's novel, earned Davis her first major critical acclaim. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters, and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her co-star, Leslie Howard, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed, his attitude changed and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. The director, John Cromwell, allowed her relative freedom, and commented, [...] "I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts." [...] She insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, [...] "the last stages of consumption, poverty, and neglect are not pretty and <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> be convincing-looking." ...|$|E
