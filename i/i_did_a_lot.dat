She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life?

2500|$|Haddon added, in the {{conversation}} with Terry Gross, [...] "I have to say honestly that I did more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, {{where some of the}} novel takes place, than I did about Asperger's syndrome. I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society.

[...] Rose gradually received the film's screenplay [...] "in pieces". During her first recording session, Rose read through and recorded the entire script in eight hours, describing the experience as [...] "exhausting, but wonderful." [...] She and co-star Bruno Campos, who provided the voice of Prince Naveen, recorded the majority of their dialogue separately.|$|E

2500|$|On August 9, 2005, it was {{announced}} that British director Anand Tucker would take over from Weitz. Tucker felt the film would thematically be about Lyra [...] "looking for a family", and Pullman agreed: [...] "He has plenty of very good ideas, and he isn't daunted by the technical challenges. But the best thing {{from the point of view}} of all who care about the story is his awareness that it isn't about computer graphics; it isn't about fantastic adventures in amazing-looking worlds; it's about Lyra." [...] Tucker resigned on May 8, 2006, citing creative disagreements with New Line, and Weitz returned to direct. Weitz said [...] "I'm both the first and third director on the film..but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of growing in the interim." ...|$|E
2500|$|She would {{contribute}} coloring across the company's line, including its war comics and its celebrated but notoriously graphic horror comics, and also {{worked on the}} comics' production end, as well as [...] "doing little touch ups and stuff" [...] on the art. When EC ceased publication {{in the wake of}} the U.S. Senate hearings on the effects of comic books on children and the establishment of the Comics Code, Severin worked briefly for Marvel Comics' 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics. [...] After an industry downturn circa 1957, she left and found work with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. She recalled in 2001, [...] "I did a little bit of everything for them — I did television graphics on economics [...] <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of drawing.

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at The Jazz Workshop in San Francisco before an appreciative standing room only crowd.

2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish I could say that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was {{sit on the couch}} and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E

I'd love to do more and more Gspel projects". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, [...] "I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought {{that it would be a}} perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that. They go Gospel when they don't have anything else to do anymore, you know? I chose to do this while I can reach people." ...|$|E

The rant contained [...] "blunt and emotional comments critical of feminism, homosexual behavior, and 'sensitive emasculated' men", {{and called for}} [...] "real men" [...] to rise up {{in the spirit of}} Scottish warrior William Wallace as depicted in the film Braveheart. Mars Hill Church had long since deleted their unmoderated [...] "Midrash" [...] discussion board where the forum postings occurred. Driscoll referenced the incident in his 2006 book Confessions of Reformission Rev, where he confirmed and expressed regret that, though he believed his intentions were [...] "good", he had personally written the rant. He wrote in 2006, [...] "I had a good mission, but some of my tactics were born out of anger and burnout, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of harm and damage while attracting a lot of attention."

She may have played more minutes elsewhere (she averaged 22 minutes over her career), but she wouldn't have enjoyed the same amount of success.

2500|$|Although she is {{credited}} on the sleeve, the album does not feature Velvet Underground stalwart drummer Maureen Tucker, {{as she was}} pregnant at the time. Drumming duties were performed mainly by bassist Doug Yule, recording engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanero and Doug Yule's brother Billy. Lou Reed commented that [...] "Loaded didn't have Maureen on it, and that's a lot of people's favorite Velvet Underground record, so we can't get too lost in the mystique of the Velvet Underground... It's still called a Velvet Underground record. But {{what it really is}} is something else." [...] Sterling Morrison had strong feelings about Yule's increased presence on Loaded, saying: [...] "The album came out okay, as far as production it's the best, {{but it would have been}} better if it had real good Lou vocals on all the tracks." [...] While Morrison contributed guitar tracks to the album, he was also attending City College of New York and juggling his time between the sessions and classes, leaving most of the creative input to Reed and Yule. Doug Yule claimed that [...] "Lou leaned on me a lot in terms of musical support and vocal arrangements. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> on Loaded. It sort of devolved down to the Lou and Yule recreational recording". Of the ten songs that make up Loaded, Yule's lead vocals were featured on four songs: [...] "Who Loves the Sun", which opens the album, [...] "New Age", [...] "Lonesome Cowboy Bill", and [...] "Oh! Sweet Nuthin'". In addition to his lead vocal parts, Yule handled all of the bass, piano and organ duties, and also recorded several lead guitar tracks. The guitar solos on [...] "Rock and Roll", [...] "Cool it Down", [...] "Head Held High" [...] and [...] "Oh! Sweet Nuthin'" [...] were all played by Yule.|$|E

If I jumped forward with a yell, as I had done before under different circumstances, would he not rush at me savagely, as all wild creatures do when cornered? No, the time for that had passed with the first instant of our meeting. The bluff would now be too apparent; it must be done without hesitation, or not at all. On the other hand, if I turned back he would follow me {{to the end of the}} ledge, growing bolder as he came on; and beyond that it was dangerous walking, where he had all the advantage and all the knowledge of his ground.
