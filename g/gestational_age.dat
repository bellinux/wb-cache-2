40|$|Abstract Background Neonatal {{mortality}} rates among black infants {{are lower than}} neonatal {{mortality rates}} among white infants at birth weights Methods We used data on births in the United States in 1997 after excluding those with a birth weight Results Perinatal mortality rates (calculated per convention) were lower among blacks than whites at lower birth weights and at preterm <b>gestational</b> <b>ages,</b> while blacks had higher mortality rates at higher birth weights and later <b>gestational</b> <b>ages.</b> With the fetuses-at-risk approach, mortality curves did not intersect; blacks had higher mortality rates at all <b>gestational</b> <b>ages.</b> Increases in birth rates and (especially) growth-restriction rates presaged gestational age-dependent increases in perinatal mortality. Similar findings were obtained in comparisons of smokers versus nonsmokers. Conclusions Formulating perinatal risk based on the fetuses-at-risk approach solves the intersecting perinatal mortality curves paradox; blacks have higher perinatal mortality rates than whites and smokers have higher perinatal mortality rates than nonsmokers at all <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> and birth weights. </p...|$|R

25|$|Adding the {{estimated}} <b>gestational</b> <b>age</b> at childbirth {{to the above}} time point. Childbirth on average occurs at a <b>gestational</b> <b>age</b> of 280 days (40 weeks), which is therefore often used as a standard estimation for individual pregnancies.

25|$|Naegele's rule is a {{standard}} way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a <b>gestational</b> <b>age</b> of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of <b>gestational</b> <b>age.</b> Alternatively there are mobile apps, which essentially always give consistent estimations compared {{to each other and}} correct for leap year, while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year.|$|E

40|$|Intestinal {{alkaline}} sphingomyelinase (Alk-SMase) {{and neutral}} ceramidase may catalyze the hydrolysis of endogenous sphin-gomyelin (SM) and milk SM in human-milk fed infants. The enzymes generate sphingolipid metabolites {{that may influence}} gut maturation. Alk-SMase also inactivates platelet-activating factor (PAF) that {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We examined whether the two enzymes are expressed in both preterm and term infants and analyzed Alk-SMase, neutral ceramidase, SM, and sphingolipid metabolites in meconium. Meconium was collected from 46 preterm (<b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> 23 - 36 wk) and 38 term infants (<b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> 37 - 42 wk) and analyzed for Alk-SMase using C- 14 -choline-labeled SM and for neutral ceramidase using C- 14 -octanoyl-sphingosine as substrates. Molecular species of SM, ceramide, and sphingosine were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. Meconium contained significant levels of Alk-SMase and ceramidase at all <b>gestational</b> <b>ages.</b> It also contained 16 - 24 carbon molecular species of SM, palmitoyl-and stearoyl-sphingosine, and sphingosine. There were positive correlations between levels of SM and ceramide and between ceramide and sphingosine levels. In conclusion, Alk-SMase and ceramidase are expressed in the gut of both preterm and term newborn infants and may generate bioactive sphingolipid messengers...|$|R
40|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) is {{a disorder}} {{of the developing}} retinal blood vessels of the preterm infant. New recommendations for screening and treatment of ROP {{have been published in}} the past few years. Current evidence suggests that screening infants with <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> of 30 6 / 7 weeks or less (regardless of birth weight) and birth weights of 1250 g or less is a strategy with a very small likelihood that an unscreened baby would have treatable ROP. Individual centres may choose to extend birth weight screening criteria to 1500 g. Initial screening should be performed at 31 weeks’ postmenstrual age in infants with <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> of 26 6 / 7 weeks or less at birth, and at four weeks’ chronological age in infants with <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> of 27 weeks or more at birth by an ophthalmologist skilled in the detection of ROP. Follow-up examinations are conducted according to the ophthalmologist’s recommendation. Infants with high-risk prethreshold ROP and threshold ROP are referred for retinal ablative therapy. Developing processes for ROP screening, documenting results and communicating results to parents as well as health professionals involved in the infant’s care are important responsibilities for all nurseries providing care for preterm infants...|$|R

40|$|The {{statistical}} procedure for discriminating between a Down syndrome or neural tube defect (NTD) fetus and a normal fetus relies, {{to a great}} extent, on the reporting of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), hCG, and uE 3 results {{in the form of}} multiples of the median (MoMs). Further, threshold MoMs values for MSAFP, such as 2. 5 MoMs, are often used to define a reference range to identify an NTD fetus. We show that a constant threshold-MoMs cutoff for MSAFP values actually refers to different percentiles of MSAFP levels at different <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> and that the combining of MoMs values between centers and <b>gestational</b> <b>ages,</b> such as suggested by Wald et al. for deriving a patient-specific risk index, is highly questionable.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. We {{assessed}} physician {{preferences and}} physician prognostic abilities regarding delivery room management of exceedingly low birth weight/short gestation infants. METHODS. We surveyed US neonatologists {{to assess their}} behavior {{in the delivery room}} when confronted with infants with <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> of 22 to 26 weeks. We identified 102 infants in our NICU with birth weights/gestational ages of 400 g/ 23 weeks to 750 g/ 26 weeks, whose follow-up care was ensured because of their participation in ongoing clinical trials. We determined 4 proxy measures for "how the infant looked" in the delivery room (Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and heart rates at 1 and 5 minutes) and assessed the predictive value of each marker for subsequent death or neurologic morbidity. RESULTS. For infants with birth weights of 600 g and <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> of 25 weeks, > 90 % of neonatologists considered resuscitation obligatory. For infants with birth weights of 500 to 600 g and <b>gestational</b> <b>ages</b> of 23 to 24 weeks, only one third of neonatologists responded that parental preference would determine whether they resuscitated the infant in the delivery room. The majority wanted "to see what the infant looked like. " For 102 infants with birth weights of 750 g, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and heart rates at 1 and 5 minutes were neither sensitive nor predictive for death before discharge, survival with a neurologic abnormality, or intact neurologic survival...|$|R
