5|$|As {{a market}} town, Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly {{located in the}} town centre. The only {{shopping}} centre, Swansgate, previously known as the Arndale Centre, {{was built in the}} 1970s. Since 2009 the Borough Council has been looking at rebuilding the centre and major stores want bigger floor-spaces. The Britannica Fund, which owns Swansgate shopping centre is currently in administration, and decision {{on the future of the}} centre <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> early 2013. Supplementing the town centre shops are several out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets including a Sainsbury's, four Tesco stores, an Aldi store and a Morrisons store in the town centre. The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> cases of {{trespass}} to goods; while trespass {{to the person}} requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> California {{due to a}} more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño {{portion of}} ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|In Dorchester, {{a damaged}} cargo ship from China washes ashore; {{all of the}} crew members seem to be {{infected}} with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate {{in the presence of}} a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> two days. In the lab, Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his white blood cell count and making him suddenly feel better.|$|E

5|$|More recently, habitat {{destruction}} and degradation {{have become the}} principal dangers, and a further reduction of 50% <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>in</b> giant otter numbers within the 20 years after 2004 (about the span of three generations of giant otters). Typically, loggers first move into rainforest, clearing the vegetation along riverbanks. Farmers follow, creating depleted soil and disrupted habitats. As human activity expands, giant otter home ranges become increasingly isolated. Subadults leaving in search of new territory find it impossible to set up family groups. Specific threats from human industry include unsustainable mahogany logging {{in parts of the}} giant otter range, and concentrations of mercury in its diet of fish, a byproduct of gold mining. Water pollution from mining, fossil fuel extraction, and agriculture is a serious danger; concentrations of pesticides and other chemicals are magnified at each step in the food chain, and can poison top predators such as the giant otter.|$|E
