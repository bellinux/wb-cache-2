5|$|Smith enlisted as {{a private}} in the Indiana Army National Guard in 1911. In 1917, during World War I, he was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant. He {{was wounded in the}} Aisne-Marne Offensive in 1918. After World War I, he was a staff officer and instructor at the U.S. Army Infantry School. In 1941, he became Secretary of the General Staff, and in 1942 he became the Secretary to the Combined Chiefs of Staff.

5|$|At Harwell, Pontecorvo {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} reactor design projects. As a member of the Power Steering Committee (PSC), he was involved <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the production and use of fissile materials, and of the materials used in construction of reactors. In 1949, other Via Panisperna boys, particularly Emilio Segrè, began to press their claim over patents relating to the behaviour of slow neutrons, which were at the heart of nuclear reactor—and nuclear weapon—design. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) therefore began looking into their backgrounds. It noted, from its 1943 Manhattan Project files, that Pontecorvo's siblings Guiliana, Laura and Gillo were communists, and that Pontecorvo and Marianne were probably communists too, and reported this to MI5 in Britain, and MI6's Kim Philby in Washington, D.C.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with English, Spanish has an official body that governs linguistic rules, orthography among them: the Royal Spanish Academy, which makes periodic changes to orthography.

25|$|Kipling {{is often}} quoted <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> {{contemporary}} {{political and social}} issues.

25|$|In social choice theory, Arrow's im{{possibility}} theorem, {{the general}} possibility theorem or Arrow's paradox is an impossibility theorem stating that when voters {{have three or}} more distinct alternatives (options), no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting a specified set of criteria: unrestricted domain, non-dictatorship, Pareto efficiency and independence of irrelevant alternatives. The theorem is often cited <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> voting theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem.|$|E

25|$|Haloalkanes {{can also}} be {{classified}} according {{to the type of}} halogen on group 7 responding to a specific halogenoalkane. Haloalkanes containing carbon bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine results in organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine and organoiodine compounds, respectively. Compounds containing more than one kind of halogen are also possible. Several classes of widely used haloalkanes are classified in this way chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These abbreviations are particularly common <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the environmental impact of haloalkanes.|$|E
25|$|He {{fell from}} favour {{during the last}} part of the reign of Nicholas II, as Empress Alexandra disliked him for his liberal views.

After the fall of the monarchy, he was exiled to Vologda. He was later imprisoned by the Bolsheviks in Petrograd and shot outside the St Peter and St Paul Fortress along with his brother Grand Duke George Mikhailovich and his cousins Grand Duke Dimitri Konstantinovich and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich.|$|E

Poets and writers also participated. The group {{came to be}} known as the Puteaux Group, or the Section d'Or. Uninterested in the Cubists' seriousness or in their focus on visual matters, Duchamp did not join <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> Cubist theory, and gained a reputation of being shy. However, that same year he painted in a Cubist style, and added an impression of motion by using repetitive imagery.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} criteria {{throughout history}} are that great powers should have enough influence {{to be included}} <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> political and diplomatic questions of the day, and have influence on the final outcome and resolution. Historically, when major political questions were addressed, several great powers met to discuss them. Before the era of groups like the United Nations, participants of such meetings were not officially named, but were decided based on their great power status. These were conferences which settled important questions based on major historical events. This might mean deciding the political resolution of various geographical and nationalist claims following a major conflict, or other contexts.|$|E
25|$|Another {{measure to}} enforce the trade laws was the Vice Admiralty Court Act of 1768. Although often {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> the Townshend Acts, this act was initiated by the Cabinet when Townshend was not present, and was not passed until after his death. Before this act, {{there was just one}} vice admiralty court in North America, located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Established in 1764, this court proved to be too remote to serve all of the colonies, and so the 1768 Vice Admiralty Court Act created four district courts, which were located at Halifax, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston. One purpose of the vice admiralty courts, which did not have juries, was to help customs officials prosecute smugglers, since colonial juries were reluctant to convict persons for violating unpopular trade regulations.|$|E
