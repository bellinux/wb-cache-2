2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> that's it. I went to her one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very good at that, in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
6000|$|I {{named one}} state, Harris named another. We agreed upon one thing, however--that {{the young girl}} with the party was very beautiful, and very tastefully dressed.

The dispute between us waxed warm, and <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> with a pretense of being in earnest: ...|$|E

6000|$|Then we {{sat down}} to polish off the {{perspiration}} and arrange about {{what we would do}} with him when we got him. Harris was for contributing him to the British Museum; but I was for mailing him to his widow. That is the difference between Harris and me: Harris is all for display, I am all for the simple right, even though I lose money by it. Harris argued in favor of his proposition against mine, I argued in favor of mine and against his. The discussion warmed into a dispute; the dispute warmed into a quarrel. <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> very decidedly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me that--" [...] "Do not {{interrupt}} me, please. After breakfast we elected a man by the name of Walker, from Detroit, for supper. He was very good. I wrote his wife so afterward. He was worthy of all praise. I shall always remember Walker. He was a little rare, but very good. And then the next morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to--handsome, educated, refined, spoke several languages fluently--a perfect gentleman--he was a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy. For supper we had that Oregon patriarch, and he was a fraud, there is no question about it--old, scraggy, tough, nobody can picture the reality. <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> gentlemen, you can do as you like, but I will wait for another election. And Grimes of Illinois said, 'Gentlemen, I will wait also. When you elect a man that has something to recommend him, I shall be glad to join you again.' It soon became evident that there was general dissatisfaction with Davis of Oregon, and so, to preserve the good will that had prevailed so pleasantly since we had had Harris, an election was called, and the result of it was that Baker of Georgia was chosen. He was splendid! Well, well--after that we had Doolittle, and Hawkins, and McElroy (there was some complaint about McElroy, because he was uncommonly short and thin), and Penrod, and two Smiths, and Bailey (Bailey had a wooden leg, which was clear loss, but he was otherwise good), and an Indian boy, and an organ-grinder, and a gentleman by the name of Buckminster--a poor stick of a vagabond that wasn't any good for company and no account for breakfast. We were glad we got him elected before relief came." ...|$|E

If that is ever in doubt, morale would tumble. That was my major consideration. So I took it on myself. I didn't ask anybody for permission. I just said, [...] "Go do it!" ...|$|R

5000|$|For my part, {{the moment}} I {{sat down with}} Stein (with Mathis there) {{and he asked me}} that {{question}} about firing people for expressing dissenting views a dozen times, I realized that I was being manipulated to give certain answers they were looking for me to give. I asked them both, several times, if they had anything else to ask me about evolutionary theory or Intelligent Design.

In an interview with queermusicheritage.com, Goss said [...] "You know, it's interesting, I think that 2013, {{or the end of}} 2012-2013 has been about doing things that I wanted to do, and not really thinking as much about how people are going to perceive it. And I think that's been really freeing.

5000|$|Cage himself {{acknowledged}} that the film was [...] "absurd". He remarked in 2010: [...] "There is a mischievous mind at work on The Wicker Man, you know? You know what I mean? And <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> kind of <b>said,</b> 'I might have known that the movie {{was meant to be}} absurd.' But saying that now after the fact is OK, but to say it before the fact is not, because you have to let the movie have its own life." [...] In February 2012, Cage gave a live webchat with fans to promote Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. When asked what roles from his career he would most like to revisit, Cage responded, [...] "I would like to hook up with one of the great Japanese filmmakers, like the master that made Ringu, and I would like to take The Wicker Man to Japan, except this time he's a ghost.|$|R

It has a certain energy and I think it works.” adding “A lot of these songs were not necessarily that easy to put into an acoustic form, some of them are there because I do them every night and I love them forever, some are on there because they’re important songs in my career. I’m just hoping I did justice to them all.” ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Sayonara Memories" [...] is a J-pop {{song with}} {{instrumentation}} from electric and bass guitars, drums, piano and violin. According {{to a book}} of sheet music published by Yamaha Corporation, it is set in common time, and moves at a quick tempo of 160 beats per minute in the B major key throughout the song. The introduction starts with only piano accompanying Yanagi's vocals, and uses a bridge with added guitar, drums and violin to transition into the first verse. The song continues with {{the second and third}} verses, which also serves as the chorus melody, before employing another bridge. The musical structure used in the first three verses is repeated for the next three with different lyrics. After a short seventh verse, a break is employed, followed by the eighth verse. After a short instrumental outro, the song ends with Yanagi singing [...] "Aa, yatto ieta" [...] ("Ah <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> it"), referring to a love confession {{at the end of the}} eighth verse.|$|E

Whatever the word may be, it doesn't really matter. Just turn to Spencer Tracy on the bench whenever you feel the need, and ad lib something. It will be all right because it will convey the confusion in your character's mind." [...] He seemed to calm down after this.

Originally, Arnold agreed to the spin-off on the condition that Vigoda continued to play his Fish character on the show in half of the episodes of the third season, as well as future seasons. However, Vigoda persisted on quitting Barney Miller and staying on just Fish, wanting to be the star of his own series. [...] "I found myself with a very unhappy actor on my hands.
