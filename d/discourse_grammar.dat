Functions are therefore taken to have left their mark on the structure and organisation of language at all levels, which is said to be achieved via metafunctions. The term metafunction is particular to systemic functional linguistics. The organisation of the functional framework around systems, i.e., choices, is a significant difference from other [...] "functional" [...] approaches, such as, for example, Dik's functional grammar (FG, or as now often termed, functional <b>discourse</b> <b>grammar)</b> and lexical functional grammar. Thus, it is important to use the full designation—systemic functional linguistics—rather than just functional grammar or functional linguistics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTree-Adjoining Grammars (TAG) {{have been}} used both for {{syntactic}} parsing, with sentential <b>grammars,</b> and for <b>discourse</b> parsing, with <b>discourse</b> <b>grammars.</b> But the modeling of discourse connectives (coordinate conjunctions, subordinate conjunctions, adverbs [...] .) in TAG-based formalisms for discourse differ from their modeling in sentential grammars. Because of this mismatch, an intermediate, not TAG-related, processing step is required between the sentential and the discourse processes, both in parsing and in generation. We present a method to smoothly interface sentential and <b>discourse</b> TAG <b>grammars,</b> without using such an intermediate processing step. This method is based on Abstract Categorial Grammars (ACG) and relies on the modularity of the latter.

40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the current issues and techniques for the modelling of dialogues using a computer. A dialogue management system can manage a dialogue between two or more agents, be they human or computer. Recently, increasingly complex dialogues are being modelled which allow a range of discourse phenomena including ellipsis and anaphoric reference. Such dialogues are thought to be similar to those between two humans, and accurate modelling of these phenomena leads to "pleasant", i. e. easy to talk to, and natural human-computer dialogues. Dialogue management can be classified into three often overlapping approaches: <b>discourse</b> <b>grammars,</b> plan-based and collaborative approaches. The design of a system often begins by eliciting the language used initially between two humans and later by Wizard of Oz experiments. Special issues relating to dialogue management systems are discussed including recovery strategies from different types of errors and the coding of dialogue in corpora. Lastly, approaches to evaluation are briefly discussed from the qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, recognising the importance and size of this sub-field...|$|R

50|$|Sasse was {{concerned}} with grammatical relations and lexical categories, language universals, <b>discourse,</b> and <b>grammar,</b> historical linguistics and reconstruction. He also conducted research on language contact and language death, {{as well as the}} lexicon. Among the languages and language families on which he conducted research were languages of the Balkans (especially Modern Greek and Albanian), Afro-asiatic languages (especially Semitic languages and Cushitic languages - particularly the Burji language), and Native American languages (especially Iroquoian languages). His work was based on numerous fieldwork studies.|$|R
50|$|Work on <b>Discourse</b> <b>Grammar</b> (DG) {{has been}} {{inspired}} {{by a number of}} different works, in particular by Simon C.

On the other hand, it has benefitted greatly from research on the nature of parenthetical categories and the concept of supplements.|$|E
50|$|From 1978 to 2004 Heine {{held the}} chair for African Studies at the University of Cologne, Germany.

50|$|Thetical grammar forms {{one of the}} two {{domains of}} <b>discourse</b> <b>grammar,</b> the other domain being {{sentence}} grammar. The building blocks of thetical grammar are theticals, that is, linguistic expressions which are interpolated in, or juxtaposed to, clauses or sentences but syntactically, semantically and, typically, prosodically independent from theses structures. The two domains are associated with contrasting principles of designing texts: Whereas sentence grammar is essentially restricted to the structure of sentences in a propositional format, thetical grammar concerns the overall contours of discourse beyond the sentence, thereby being responsible for a higher level of discourse production.|$|E
50|$|Functional grammar (FG) is a {{model of}} grammar {{motivated}} by functions. The model was originally developed by Simon C. Dik at the University of Amsterdam in the 1970s, and has undergone several revisions since then. The latest standard version under the original name is laid out in the 1997 edition, published shortly after Dik's death. The latest version features the expansion of the model with a pragmatic/interpersonal module by Kees Hengeveld and Lachlan Mackenzie. This has led to a renaming of the theory to functional <b>discourse</b> <b>grammar.</b> This type of grammar is quite distinct from systemic functional grammar as developed by Michael Halliday and many other linguists since the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|So far, Heine {{has been}} invited to speak at 33 {{international}} conferences. His life's work comprises 33 books and about 120 periodical articles in the special fields of linguistics, socio-linguistics, historical linguistics and grammaticalisation theory. He is co-editor and/or member of the advisory boards of 17 magazines or series of books. Since 2014 his main interest has been, jointly with Gunther Kaltenböck und Tania Kuteva, the analysis of linguistic discourse. In the framework of <b>Discourse</b> <b>Grammar</b> developed by these authors, two components of discourse planning are distinguished, where one, Sentence Grammar, is centrally concerned {{with the construction of}} sentences while the other, Thetical Grammar, is dedicated to the relationship between speaker, hearer, and the text.|$|E

Matthiessen's 1,000-page Lexicogrammatical Cartography offers [...] "the best account of the S.F. description of English based on Halliday's work."

50|$|His {{desire to}} make his theory on {{language}} accessible to everyone manifested itself in his book Le Français Déchiffré, Clé du Langage et des Langues, {{which was published in}} 1991.

40|$|Writing about argumentation is a {{daunting}} task {{for at least one}} main reason. Argumentation occupies an interdisciplinary domain in which logic and rhetoric merge with discourse linguistics and pragmatics; therefore, discussing this broad field of study from a linguistic perspective imposes a dividing line between two or more areas that naturally converge. Moreover, argumentation belongs not solely to the realm of logic and discourse pragmatics but is inherent in language as a whole, in that all texts, both spoken and written, exhibit a degree of ‘reasonableness’ that is realised {{in a number of ways}} and at all levels of the language system. In light of this conviction, we propose to organise the following foray into studies on argumentation into the two areas of <b>discourse</b> and <b>grammar,</b> in order to show how these two language levels can function jointly when a speaker/writer advances a particular claim. In so doing, we provide a discussion that takes into account both the macro-level of discourse beyond the sentence and the micro-level of grammar within the sentence. As an illustration of argumentation at each of these two levels, we use two relatively long texts, one from television news, in which a particular idea is put forth by multiple speakers, and the other a political speech with a sole orator. We hope that our reflection on argumentation from these two perspectives of <b>discourse</b> and <b>grammar</b> with the support of authentic texts provides some useful insights into this complex field of interdisciplinary research...|$|R
