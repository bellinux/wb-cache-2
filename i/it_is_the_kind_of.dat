[...] Writing for The Guardian, Alex Petridis observed [...] "There's clearly something a little self-aggrandising about the BBC getting a raft of stars to sing an unambiguous song of undying devotion apparently to the corporation itself. ... perhaps we should forgive them three minutes of self-congratulation, particularly when it’s raising money for charity."

2500|$|To Judge Rich, {{even though}} section 101 says [...] "whoever invents or discovers," [...] {{there is no}} basis for {{importing}} into the analysis any inquiry {{into the nature of}} what it is that the patent applicants purports to have invented, and whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing that can be patented as an invention. Thus, when the Flook Court says that Flook's process {{is not the kind of}} process that the patent law permits to be patented, even though it is a process in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, Judge Rich finds the inquiry impermissible because [...] "§ 101 was never intended to be a 'standard of patentability'; the standards, or conditions as the statute calls them, are in § 102 and § 103." [...] The only legitimate question, he says, is whether the claimed subject matter is [...] "new, useful, and unobvious." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{law which}} is {{applicable}} {{to this case}} is section 101 of the Patent Act.

The Court decided that the patent claim under review was instead a claim to a [...] "principle" [...] or a [...] "law of nature" [...] and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case. The principle of that case, as explained in O’Reilly v. Morse, is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was in the prior art). Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent [...] "because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."

[...] "Nay," [...] but it {{is still}} answered, [...] "this is because we have not yet brought our {{knowledge}} into right use, but have been seeking to accumulate it, rather than to apply it wisely to the ends of art. Let us now do this, and we may achieve all that was done by that elder ignorant art, and infinitely more." [...] No, not so; for as soon as we try to put our knowledge to good use, we shall find that we have much more than we can use, and that what more we have is an encumbrance. All our errors in this respect arise from a gross misconception as to the true nature of knowledge itself. We talk of learned and ignorant men, as if there were a certain quantity of knowledge, which to possess was to be learned, and which not to possess was to be ignorant; instead of considering that knowledge is infinite, and that the man most learned in human estimation is just as far from knowing anything as he ought to know it, as the unlettered peasant. Men are merely on a lower or higher stage of an eminence, whose summit is God's throne, infinitely above all; and there is just as much reason for the wisest as for the simplest man being discontented with his position, as respects the real quantity of knowledge he possesses. And, for both of them, the only true reasons for contentment with the sum of knowledge they possess are these: that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> knowledge they need for their duty and happiness in life; that all they have is tested and certain, so far as it is in their power; that all they have is well in order, and within reach when they need it; that it has not cost too much time in the getting; that none of it, once got, has been lost; and that there is not too much to be easily taken care of.|$|E
6000|$|And {{this brings}} us back to that {{debatable}} thing--the pathos of Dickens--from which one has been withdrawn by the attractions of his boys. Little Dombey is a prize example of his pathos. Little Nell is another. Jeffrey, of the Edinburgh Review, who criticised [...] "Marmion" [...] and the [...] "Lady of the Lake" [...] so vindictively, shed tears over Little Nell. It is a matter of taste, or, as Science might say, of the lachrymal glands as developed in each individual. But the lachrymal glands of this amateur are not developed in that direction. Little Dombey and Little Nell leave me with a pair of dry eyes. I do not [...] "melt visibly" [...] over Little Dombey, like the weak-eyed young man who took out his books and trunk to the coach. The poor little chap was feeble and feverish, and had dreams of trying to stop a river with his childish hands, or to choke it with sand. It may be very good pathology, but I cannot see that it is at all right pathos. One does not like copy to be made out of the sufferings of children or of animals. One's heart hardens: the object is too manifest, the trick is too easy. Conceive a child of Dombey's age remarking, with his latest breath, [...] "Tell them that the picture on the stairs at school is not Divine enough!" [...] That is not the delirium of infancy, that is art-criticism: it is the Athenaeum on Mr. Holman Hunt. It is not true to nature; it is not good in art: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing that appears in Sunday-school books about the virtuous little boy who died.

[...] So much can age enfeeble the intellect, that he who had known Scott, and yet nibbled at his fame, descended to admiring the feeblest of false sentiment.

6000|$|I confess, Gentlemen, {{that this}} appears to me as bad in the principle, and far worse in its consequence, than an {{universal}} suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act; and the limiting qualification, instead of taking out the sting, does in my humble opinion sharpen and envenom it to a greater degree. Liberty, if I understand it at all, is a general principle, and the clear right of all the subjects within the realm, or of none. Partial freedom {{seems to me a}} most invidious mode of slavery. But, unfortunately, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> slavery the most easily admitted in times of civil discord: for parties are but too apt to forget their own future safety in their desire of sacrificing their enemies. People without much difficulty admit the entrance of that injustice of which they are not to be the immediate victims. In times of high proceeding it is never the faction of the predominant power that is in danger: for no tyranny chastises its own instruments. It is the obnoxious and the suspected who want the protection of law; and there is nothing to bridle the partial violence of state factions but this,--"that, whenever an act is made for a cessation of law and justice, the whole people should be universally subjected to the same suspension of their franchises." [...] The alarm of such a proceeding would then be universal. It would operate as a sort of call of the nation. It would become every man's immediate and instant concern to be made very sensible of the absolute necessity of this total eclipse of liberty. They would more carefully advert to every renewal, and more powerfully resist it. These great determined measures are not commonly so dangerous to freedom. They are marked with too strong lines to slide into use. No plea, nor pretence, of inconvenience or evil example (which must in their nature be daily and ordinary incidents) can be admitted as a reason for such mighty operations. But the true danger is when liberty is nibbled away, for expedients, and by parts. The Habeas Corpus Act supposes, contrary to the genius of most other laws, that the lawful magistrate may see particular men with a malignant eye, and it provides for that identical case. But when men, in particular descriptions, marked out by the magistrate himself, are delivered over by Parliament to this possible malignity, it is not the Habeas Corpus that is occasionally suspended, but its spirit that is mistaken, and its principle that is subverted. Indeed, nothing is security to any individual but the common interest of all.|$|E
