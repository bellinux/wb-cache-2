However, on August 2 the Commission ruled that Wolf's 23% ownership of the company did create a conflict because Cape Air had ongoing contracts with the Massachusetts Port Authority (MassPort); Wolf was instructed he would either need to resign from the Senate and discontinue his campaign from Governor, divest his stake in Cape Air, or cancel all contracts between Cape Air and MassPort.

Boeing's complaint stated that the CS100 was being sold at US$19.6 million each, below the US$33.2 million production cost. A final decision on the tariff {{will be made by}} the U.S. by spring 2018.

2500|$|Supporters of the {{amendment}} said that DFW Airport is the economic engine of the metroplex area, and did not wish for a competing airport to either take traffic from DFW or drive the prices down there, although they did concede that American's fares are often higher than from other airports. What's more, DFW Airport recently completed construction of a $2.5-billion people mover system to transport passengers between terminal buildings. The DFW Airport Authority stated concerns that the financial burdens caused by {{such things as the}} people mover project and the recent pull down of Delta Air Lines' hub would hamper airport profitability and sustainability if a direct competitor to DFW were introduced into the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. A primary concern of many in the DFW area was that American is the largest employer in the North Texas area and many people associated with DFW and American Airlines were reluctant to put any <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> especially when considering the chronic financial difficulties that modern airlines, other than Southwest, face.

40|$|Abstract__ This paper studies how {{firms can}} {{efficiently}} incentivize supervisors to truthfully report employee performance. To this end, I develop a dynamic principal-supervisor-agent model. The supervisor is either selfish or altruistic towards the agent, which is observable to the agent {{but not to}} the principal. The analysis yields two key results. First, supervisor altruism sometimes provides a net incentive to report performance truthfully, rather than to bias evaluations upward. The intuition is that an altruistic supervisor values his job because of his good relationship with the agent, and puts his <b>job</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> by overrating the agent's performance. Second, I show that by screening for one supervisor type, firms can incentivize the supervisor to truthfully report performance at the lowest possible costs. For this reason, screening may be optimal, even though it reduces the probability that vacancies are filled...|$|R
