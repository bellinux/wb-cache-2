25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

Levine said the use of auto-tune was [...] "fun" [...] and described Dr. Luke's backing track as [...] "bouncy" [...] and [...] "bubblegummy". The review highlighted the song's chorus with Levine calling it [...] "stonking great" [...] and [...] "completely trashy in the best possible way." [...] David Jeffries of Allmusic called the track [...] "fun", listing it as one of the album's best tracks. David Renshaw of Drowned in Sound felt that the song was effective in what it was trying to do, writing: [...] "Trashy and rambunctious, it’s a brash summer anthem about getting drunk and partying hard. World rocking it might not be, but as a piece of disposable pop it captures a moment and boasts a huge hook which, really, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> need to rule the radio, TV and ringtone airwaves." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly listed the song as the recommended download off of Animal, writing that [...] "her Valley Girl sneer with electro-glam arrangements that make brushing one's teeth 'with a bottle of Jack' sound like an awesome way to kill the morning-after blues." ...|$|E

500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family. Additionally, when Clair is at work, Cliff willingly assumes traditionally female household responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Both Clair's professional and personal lives operate alongside each other rather smoothly with little conflict. However, despite being a full-time lawyer, she is seldom shown {{at work in the}} courtroom; audiences see the character at home more often than anywhere else. According to Women Watching Television: Gender, Class, and Generation in the American Television Experience author Andrea L. Press, Clair's role demonstrates [...] "the hegemonic view that families need not change to accommodate working wives and mothers", believing that the show mostly depicts Clair at home to avoid exploring the everyday conflicts working women endure in their daily lives. One of the series' more political moments, Clair refuses to be exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer. When Clair learns that her all-white male co-panelists only want to hear opinions {{from the perspective of a}} black woman, Clair delivers a speech that reads, [...] "I am also a human being, who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable about history ... But when you look at me, this <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> see in me, a black woman?" ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Markman of MTV News {{wrote that}} the singers [...] "display good {{chemistry}} on the song". The Washington Posts Sarah Godfrey classified [...] "Love a Woman" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album adding that [...] "The ballad, with its cheesy, delightful... R production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige." [...] Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song [...] "clearly knows how to love a woman right". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé [...] "showcase their powerful pipes" [...] as they tell their men what they want from a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television {{wrote that the}} song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a [...] "breathtaking duet". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as [...] "a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed [...] "the soaring nature of the song", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a [...] "lesson in love". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an [...] "inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I half expected Keith Sweat to jump in". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, [...] "'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats. Forget Dr. Phil, MJB and Ms. B <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> need to help you maintain a loving relationship with your partner." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize {{when it comes to this}} set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E

[...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou just get the feeling that if those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better." [...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie viewed the album as [...] "inconsequential stuff and as with all Kylie's albums the quality is disappointingly uneven. But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this is a much better record than most critics would like to admit." [...] Select praised the album, stating that [...] "apart from the foul Lloyd-Webber-esque ballad 'Bittersweet Goodbye', it's an unrelenting hoot" [...] and that [...] "it's all contrived to within an inch of its life, heaving with potential singles and brazenly derivative. That is her job and she does it well." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour manager}} Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk joined {{the team with}} three of his daughters and {{announced}} [...] "You may dance with my daughters. You may take them out and wine them and dine them, but that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> may do", though years later Cowdrey would marry the eldest, Lady Anne. Cowdrey had a poor start to the tour and made three successive ducks, which Jack Fingleton blamed on his fondness for golf. However, Cowdrey made the highest score of his career against South Australia on Christmas Eve (his birthday). He caressed his way to 307 in 369 minutes and beat Frank Woolley's 305 not out against Tasmania in 1911–12 as the highest score by a tourist in Australia {{and it was the}} highest first-class score in Australia for 18 years. Cowdrey added 103 runs with David Sheppard (81), 98 with Ken Barrington, then stroked 344 runs with fellow stylist Tom Graveney (122 not out), striking 4 sixes and 29 fours, until he was out and Dexter declared on 586/5. Fresh from his triumph at Adelaide Cowdrey made his only century of the series in the Second Test at Melbourne after joining Dexter at 19/2. They withstood Alan Davidson's burst of speed, but the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Dexter was out for 93, but the stand had made 175 runs and Cowdrey made 113, his third and highest century in Australia, but the celebrations were short lived as he hooked into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie. In the second innings he took 30 minutes to score after being dropped off his first ball, but made 52 not out and hit the winning runs to give England a 1–0 lead.|$|E
2500|$|The MCC {{team were}} the first not to travel to Australia entirely by ship. Instead they flew to Aden and boarded the luxury liner Canberra on its maiden voyage to Australia, which became an 11-day {{cocktail}} party, with Tom Graveney {{in charge of the}} bar and Graveney, Ted Dexter, Ken Barrington, Colin Cowdrey, Ray Illingworth and Fred Trueman forming the Marylebone Calypso Club, much to the amusement of the other passengers. Dexter found that the British Olympic long distance runner Gordon Pirie was on board (the Commonwealth Games were being held in Perth, Western Australia in November 1962) and got him to arrange keep fit classes for the team and runs around the deck in return for a first class berth. Trueman first avoided these by dodging down a corridor as short-cut and when was discovered threatening to throw Pirie overboard. He complained to the assistant-manager Alec Bedser that he had just bowled a thousand overs for Yorkshire, was the best fast-bowler in the world and did not need extra training, Bedser agreed and Trueman was excused. The team also needed to sign autographs for an hour each day, but Trueman's occasionally fell out of a porthole. The Canberra docked at Colombo for a one-day game, where David Sheppard made 73 and Ray Illingworth took 5/59. The Duke of Norfolk joined them here with three of his daughters [...] "You may dance with my daughters. You may take them out and wine them and dine them, but that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> may do", though Colin Cowdrey later married Lady Anne Elizabeth Fitzalan-Howard. The team arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia on 9 October, where they met Brian Statham, who had flown in the day before. Pirie wrote a press article to the effect that the England team were lazy, unfit and overweight; Dexter wrote an article in response, announcing that he hoped that his team would make 60 runs an hour and bowl 15 overs an hour on the tour, an ambitious target and one that he would fail to meet, though the England run rate of 39 runs per 100 balls was the highest since the war (Australia managed 41 per 100 balls). Dexter donated the fee from his article to a team kitty, to be shared amongst the players. Trueman's inflammatory remarks to The Sydney Morning Herald (he wondered if they would be playing under Jockey Club rules - referring to the Duke of Norfolk's interest in horse-racing - or going on a Church Mission - because the Reverend David Sheppard was on the tour) went down badly with the MCC. As the most colourful of the England players Trueman was offered eight times his tour fee of £250 to give after-dinner speeches and endorse products. On being told that if he did he would have to give the money to the kitty, he turned down the offer, annoyed by the fact that Susan Dexter was supposedly earning more from her modelling work than any of the cricketers. Though Trueman struck up a friendship with the Duke, Bedser was a stickler for team discipline and Trueman would be docked his £50 good conduct bonus {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E
