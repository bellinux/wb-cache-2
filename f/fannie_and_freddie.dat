25|$|On May 11, 2015 The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that A U.S. District Court judge said Nomura Holdings Inc. was not truthful in describing mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giving a victory to the companies’ conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Judge Denise Cote asked the FHFA to propose updated damages {{to be paid}} by Nomura and co-defendant RBS Securities Inc., which underwrote some of the investments. At {{the outset of the}} case, the FHFA asked for about $1.1 billion. The order brought to conclusion a rare trial addressing alleged mortgage-related infractions committed during the housing boom. Over the past few years, more than a dozen firms chose to settle similar allegations brought by the FHFA rather than face a court battle. The settlements have brought <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> $18 billion in penalties. In her decision, Judge Cote wrote that Nomura, in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities sold to <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie,</b> didn't accurately describe the loans’ quality. “The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous,” she wrote. During the boom, <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> invested billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities issued by such companies as Nomura. Those investments bolstered profits but, in the bust, contributed to steep losses that ultimately resulted in the companies’ 2008 government takeover. Nomura and RBS were two of 18 financial institutions, including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., targeted in 2011 by the FHFA, which alleged that the companies lied {{about the quality of the}} loans underlying the securities. During the nonjury trial, lawyers for the FHFA said that Nomura and RBS inflated values of homes behind some mortgages and sometimes said a home was owner-occupied when it was not.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac are government-sponsored {{enterprises}} that {{play a central}} role in U. S. residential mortgage markets. In recent years, policymakers became increasingly concerned about the size and risk-taking incentives of these two institutions. In September 2008, the federal government intervened to stabilize <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac in an effort to ensure the reliability of residential mortgage finance in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. This paper describes the sources of financial distress at <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac, outlines the measures taken by the federal government, and presents some evidence about the effectiveness of these actions. Looking ahead, policymakers will need to consider the future of <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac as well as the appropriate scope of public sector activities in primary and secondary mortgage markets.

500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. Bill Sammon, the Washington {{managing editor for}} Fox News Channel, claimed the donations from <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the {{years leading up to}} the economic crisis of 2008. In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And I said at the time, 'Hey—(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it's going to put people in homes they can't afford, and they're gonna lose them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we could have done it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, {{the agency}} {{had a number of}} other big banks in the {{crosshairs}} as well. JPMorgan (JPM) was one of 18 financial institutions the FHFA sued back in 2011, accusing them of selling <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> securities that [...] "had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials". <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie,</b> the government-backed housing finance firms, sustained massive losses on mortgage-backed securities as the housing market imploded, requiring a bailout of over $187 billion. The firms have been controlled by the FHFA since their 2008 rescue. Swiss lender UBS has already reached an $885 million settlement with the FHFA in connection with losses <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> sustained on over $6.4 billion worth of mortgage securities. The agency also settled for undisclosed sums earlier this year with Citigroup (C) and General Electric (GE). The FHFA is reportedly seeking $4 billion from JPMorgan to resolve its claims over $33 billion worth of securities sold to <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> by JPMorgan, Bear and WaMu. Bank of America (BAC), which acquired Countrywide and Merrill Lynch during the crisis era, could be on the hook for even more. The Charlotte-based firm is facing claims from the FHFA over $57 billion worth of mortgage bonds. In all, the 18 FHFA lawsuits cover more than $200 billion in allegedly misrepresented securities. The question of whether any individual bankers will be held to account is another matter. Thus far, criminal cases related to the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed securities have been conspicuously absent. The proposed JPMorgan settlement covers only civil charges, and would not settle the question of whether any individual executives engaged in wrongdoing. There is an ongoing federal criminal probe based in Sacramento, Calif., the state where Washington Mutual was based. JPMorgan originally sought to be protected from any criminal charges as part of this deal, but that request was rejected by the government.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac, the largest investors in subprime private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLS), influenced the risk characteristics and {{prices of the}} deals in which they participated. To identify the causal effect of the GSEs, we use the fact that PLS deals in which <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac purchased securities included separate mortgage pools: one specifically created for the GSEs and one or more others directed at other triple-A investors. Using within-deal variation, {{we find that the}} pools bought by <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac had similar ex-ante risk characteristics but performed much better ex-post relative to other mortgage pools in the same deals. These effects were concentrated in low-documentation loans and in issuers that were highly dependent on <b>Fannie</b> Mae <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac. Our results extend the importance of disciplining effects of large claimholders beyond informationsensitive securities, such as equities and bank debt, to information-insensitive arm's-length debt...|$|R

2500|$|The American Enterprise Institute, a {{conservative}} think-tank, argues that [...] "the government mission {{required them to}} keep mortgage interest rates low and to increase their support for affordable housing. Their shareholder ownership, however, required them to fight increases in their capital requirements and regulation that would raise their costs and reduce their risk-taking and profitability. But there were two other parties—Congress and the taxpayers—that also had {{a stake in the}} choices that <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> made. Congress got some benefits in the form of political support from the GSEs' ability to hold down mortgage rates, but it garnered even more political benefits from GSE support for affordable housing."

2500|$|Under normal {{accounting}} rules, fully owned {{companies would}} be consolidated into {{the books of}} the owner, but the large size of <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> has made the U.S. government reluctant to incorporate Freddie and Fannie into its own books.

[...] As the intervention has dragged out, pundits have started to further question this accounting treatment, noting that changes in August 2012 [...] "makes them even more permanent wards {{of the state and}} turns the government's preferred stock into a permanent, perpetual kind of security".|$|E

2500|$|The Administration PR {{effort was}} not enough, by itself, {{to save the}} GSEs. Their {{government}} directive to purchase bad loans from private banks, {{in order to prevent}} these banks from failing, as well as the 20 top banks falsely classifying loans as AAA, caused instability. Paulson's plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two GSEs, rather than provide loans as he did for AIG and the major banks; he told president Bush that [...] "the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor", in a reference to the French revolution. The major banks have since been sued by the Feds for a sum of $200,000,000, and some of the major banks have already settled. In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for a) creating an environment by which <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> would be unable to meet their financial obligations b) forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by (a), and c) the gross violation of the (fifth amendment) taking clause.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Bush Administration {{attempted}} {{to create an}} agency to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill never made progress in Congress, facing sharp opposition by Democrats. In 2005, the Republican controlled House of Representatives passed a GSE reform bill (Federal Housing Finance Reform Act) which [...] "would have created a stronger regulator with new powers to increase capital at <b>Fannie</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie,</b> to limit their portfolios {{and to deal with}} the possibility of receivership". However, the Bush administration opposed the bill and it died in the Senate. Of the bill and its reception by the Bush White House, Ohio Republican Mike Oxley (the bill's author) said: [...] "The critics have forgotten that the House passed a GSE reform bill in 2005 that could well have prevented the current crisis. All the handwringing and bedwetting is going on without remembering how the House stepped up on this. What did we get from the White House? We got a one-finger salute." [...] The Bush economic policy regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac changed during the economic downturn of 2008, culminating in the federal takeover of the two largest lenders in the mortgage market.
