This paper proposes imitating market-oriented solutions from private franchise chains to increase the service quality offered by transport operators, solutions that include the threat of losing rents or quasi-rents to stop franchisee opportunism. The study bases its arguments on the complementarities between different control mechanisms and the similarities between <b>franchise</b> and <b>concession</b> contracts. Similarly, the paper proposes linking the renewal of concession contracts to the administrative reputation of operators (measured by customer feedback on service quality).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{the current}} trend towards increased private participation in the rail industry is reshaping {{the way in which}} Governments should address the main regulatory challenges arising from the particular economic and technical characteristics of this industry. We review the role of railroads {{in the last two decades}} and examine the characteristics of the most relevant processes of private participation around the world. The lessons learned from these changes suggest that many of the traditional regulatory paradigms in this industry are being replaced by more flexible schemes of public intervention. Although this change does not fully preclude direct participation by the Government, it seems that the traditional monopolistic rail company is dead as the dominant model around the world, and new forms, such as <b>franchises</b> or <b>concessions</b> competing on the tracks are progressively gaining relevance...|$|R

50|$|An omnichannel {{supply chain}} uses a central stock pool {{to control a}} number of factors such as pricing, fulfilment, sales, stock {{management}} and ordering. These orders are fulfilled from numerous retail channels such as <b>concessions,</b> <b>franchises,</b> catalogue, web, stores and mobile. The central stock pool is the heart of all these operations. The supply chain is now on the front line thanks to omnichannel. Consumers are increasingly demanding in this day and age, expecting to be able to browse, buy and return goods through various channels and not just the traditional in-store way. This requires real-time, channel-agnostic visibility of inventory across the supply chain and a single view of the consumer as they hop from one channel to another.|$|R
40|$|Private {{participation}} in road projects is increasing around the world. The most popular form of <b>franchising</b> is a <b>concession</b> contract, which allows a private firm to charge tolls to road users during a pre-determined period {{in order to}} recover investments. Concessionaires are usually selected through auctions at which candidates submit bids for tolls or payments to the government. This paper discusses how this mechanism does not generally yield optimal outcomes and it induces the frequent contract renegotiations observed in practice. A new franchising mechanism is proposed, based on a flexible-term contract and bi-dimensional bids for total net revenue and maintenance costs. This new mechanism improves outcomes compared to fixed-term concessions, by eliminating traffic risk and promoting the selection of efficient concessionaires. ...|$|R
5|$|On December 10, 2014, {{the network}} was {{approved}} by New York City's <b>Franchise</b> and <b>Concession</b> Review Committee. Installation of two stations on Third Avenue—at 15th and 17th Streets—began on December 28, 2015, followed by other Links on Third Avenue below 58th Street, {{as well as on}} Eighth Avenue. After some delays, the first Links went online in January 2016. The public network was announced in February 2016. Locations like St. George, Jamaica, South Bronx, and Flatbush Avenue were prioritized for LinkNYC kiosk installations, with these places receiving Links by the end of 2016. By mid-July 2016, the planned roll-out of 500 hubs throughout New York City was to occur, though the actual installation proceeded at a slower rate. , there were 400 hubs in three boroughs (most of which were in Manhattan along lower Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Eighth Avenue, upper Amsterdam Avenue, Lafayette Street, parts of Broadway, and the Bowery; at least 25 along Grand Concourse and in Fordham in the Bronx; and some along Queens Boulevard and Jamaica Avenue in Queens). In November 2016, the first two Links were installed in Brooklyn, along Fulton Street in the Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, with plans to install nine more Links in various places around Brooklyn before year's end, especially around Prospect Park and LIU Brooklyn. Around this time, Staten Island also received its first Links, which were installed in New Dorp. The Links were being installed at an average pace of ten per day throughout the boroughs with a projected goal of 500 hubs by the end of 2016. , there were 920 Links installed across the city.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986 transferred operating responsibility for Dulles and Reagan National Airports {{from the federal government}} to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), an independent, nonfederal, public entity. MWAA, which has a 50 -year lease to run the two airports, has entered into a wide range of contracts for supplies, construction, and other services. Although MWAA issued guidance in 1993 for the awarding of contracts and <b>concession</b> <b>franchises,</b> GAO found that the guidance does not adequately reflect competitive contracting principles and is out of date in many respects. Moreover, MWAA does not use its guidance to award contracts for non-concession goods and services. MWAA did not obtain full and open competition for 15 of the 35 contracts GAO reviewed, raising concerns about whether MWAA obtained the best value for the goods and services provided. The failure to obtain full and open competition also raises concerns about whether MWAA has (1) deprived prospective contractors of the chance to compete for contracts and (2) fairly evaluated all of the contractors that have competed for procurements. Finally, by not following recognized competitive principles, MWAA could be giving the appearance of favoritism in its contracting decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{restraints}} {{are defined}} as contractual provisions binding companies of the distribution chain: suppliers and distributors, or wholesalers and retailers. Concern over these vertical restraints is justified because of their significance in the present-day configuration of industrial relations where networks {{play a major role}} and where the methods of distribution are undergoing some particularly far-reaching changes. Contracts econometrics is an interesting way to study these agreements. It is useful to highlight the situations where the constraints can be justified by market failures, more precisely by a range of externalities within the producers-retailers relationships, as explained by the theory of incentives and the principal-agent paradigm. The paper reviews this theoretical framework and provides empirical evidence from French data. To assess the agency theory empirical relevance in analyzing vertical restraints, we focus here on the intra brand competition, thus on externalities that generate a potential free-riding problem between the retailers of the same network. The central goal for the producer confronting this problem is to homogenize his network of retailers. The theory shows that vertical constraints can be a reaction from this agency problem. The data for the current study were collected in the ?yearbook of independent retailers networks? published by the headquarters of the French ?Chambres de Commerce et d?Industrie?. The information included in the 2001 yearbook comes directly from the networks in a broad range of trade and service industries. Our sample consists of 439 networks sharing a brand name. Four standard contractual forms (licence, <b>concession,</b> <b>franchise,</b> commission-affiliation) correspond to this criterion. Each of these contracts is characterized by a particular set of vertical restraints, and there is a hierarchy among the four types of contracts in accordance with the degree of constraint imposed on the retailer. The general testable qualitative prediction from the theoretical framework is that the level of externalities between the retailers of the same network determines the organisational structure of the vertical relationship. More precisely, we assume here that the level of the potential horizontal externality determines the degree of coercion of the contract between the upstream unit (the producer) and the downstream units (the retailers) within a network sharing a brand name. Considering the impossibility of measuring this externality directly, we use three proxy variables. The results of the test ? using an ordered probit model ? are partly consistent with the agency argument. vertical restraints, contract econometrics, advertising externality, ordered probit...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{consideration}} of the definition and content of the national economy’s corporate sector restructuring. Restructuring has been studied in the narrow and broad understanding. In the broad conception, restructuring has been defined as a system of structural and institutional changes both inside the enterprises and out of them that influences the competitiveness of the corporations and its alliances, and also its activity effectiveness. In the narrow conception the restructuring has been defined as structural changes in the corporate economics in order to optimize its activity. A lot of attention has been given to the necessity of priorities changes from intention only to increase pure income to the intention to create balance between social and private interests. Otherwise the rising difference between rich and poor population will become extremely big. The author has {{come to the conclusion that}} restructuring and reformation are synonymous categories and that there are different kinds of restructuring such as structural, economic, adaptive and complex. The last one includes all the previous. Besides, according to the valid legislation, restructuring also includes legal measures in order to improve corporate sector of national economy. Thus, despite the opinion of the most of scientists, the institutional changes are now the part of the restructuring of the corporate sector of national economy. It has been suggested to distinguish three directions of the restructuring: inner corporate restructuring; restructuring of relations; economics conditions restructuring. Inner corporate restructuring includes property forms changes, entity structure changes, capital structure changes, form of incorporation changes, management bodies changes, management changes, staff politics changes, reorganization, liquidation, privatization, corporatization. Restructuring of relations includes sales market changes, conversion of enterprises, diversification, contractor’s changes, property assignation, lease, <b>concession,</b> <b>franchising,</b> debt’s restructuring, changes of credit politics, technical supplement, using alternative power sources, standardization etc. Economics conditions restructuring includes regulation and legislation changes, tax regulation changes, currency market changes, changes in credit policies, changers in stock market. Accordingly, every restructuring direction includes many mechanisms of its possible fulfillment. The author has distinguished twenty six mechanisms all the restructuring and they are presented in the table form. The corporate management models’ use in correlation to corporate restructuring models has been described in the article. The author has come to the conclusion that pragmatic model of the corporate restructuring is more preferable in comparison with world recognized valuable model because of the peculiarities of the post-social economy in Ukraine...|$|R
