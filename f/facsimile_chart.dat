40|$|In the ofice. it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to scan a picture at a certain resolution and then reproduce it at a different (usually higher) resolution. This conversion {{can be achieved by}} interpolating the scanned signal between the sample intervals. This paper discusses a class of linear interpolating methods based on resampling polynomial functions. In addition, we introduce new methods to compare the performance of these interpolating schemes. The signal models used are one-dimensional step and pulse functions. These bi-level models are suficient to describe many blacklwhite documents. The performance of the linear interpolators is determined by evaluating their accuracy in reconstructing the original bi-level signal. The analysis considers the effects of the coarse scan and fine print intervals well as as the quantization effects. Experiments using the IEEE <b>facsimile</b> <b>chart</b> as input verifv the analytical findings. The results show the advantage of using odd-order polynomials, such as the first order and TR W cubic. Also, we discuss the relationship between the interpolating ratio and the number of quantization levels needed to represent the scanned signal...|$|E

All parameters except dew point depressions were obtained from the <b>facsimile</b> <b>charts</b> transmitted by the National Meteorological Center at Suitland, Md. Correlation between the three NMC computed parameters and observed precipitation was riot as good as the correlation between dew point depression and precipitation. However, initial vorticity combined with rorticity advection resulted in a much better correlation with precipitation occurrence than did either parameter alone. 1...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Detailed {{analyses}} of snow crystal sequence and atmospheric conditions were accomplished utilizing macrophotographic techniques for obtaining the snow crystal record at Santiam Pass in the Oregon Cascades on 19 - 20 January, 14 - 15 February, and 9 - 10 March, 1967. The photographic equipment {{consisted of a}} 35 millimeter single lens reflex camera, bellows, and extension tubes which facilitated macro-photography. To conduct crystal studies, problems inherent with crystal photography required solutions. The synoptic {{data for this study}} were extracted from teletype reports, <b>facsimile</b> <b>charts,</b> radio-sonde soundings, and surface observations from U. S. Weather Bureau and Federal Aviation Administration weather stations. The several storms analyzed indicated a crystal sequence commencing with high altitude crystal types progressing to low altitude crystal types with the passage of a warm front occlusion, and a sequence of low altitude crystal types changing to a wide, intermittent crystal type spectra representative of convective and orographic activity following the passage of a cold front occlusion. A relationship between ceiling heights and crystal types was noted in two synoptic situations involving frontal passages. Low ceilings over the valley stations were associated with crystal types from high altitudes and high ceilings were associated with crystals from low altitudes which exhibited riming...|$|R

60|$|Other living races {{have the}} gift of drawing, but none {{more so than the}} Eskimo. I will {{therefore}} speak of these and not of the Australian and Tasmanian pictures, nor of the still ruder performances of the old inhabitants of Guiana, nor of those of some North American tribes, as the Iroquois. The Eskimos are geographers by instinct, and appear to see vast tracts of country mapped out in their heads. From the multitude of illustrations of their map-drawing powers, I may mention one of those included in the journals of Captain Hall, at p. 224, which were published in 1879 by the United States Government, under the editorship of Professor J. E. Nourse. It is the <b>facsimile</b> of a <b>chart</b> drawn by an Eskimo who was a thorough barbarian in the accepted sense of the word; that is to say, he spoke no language besides his own uncouth tongue, he was wholly uneducated according to our modern ideas, and he lived in what we should call a savage fashion. This man drew from memory a chart of the region over which he had {{at one time or another}} gone in his canoe. It extended from Pond's Bay, in lat. 73°, to Fort Churchill, in lat. 58°44', over a distance in a straight line of more than 960 nautical, or 1100 English miles, the coast being so indented by arms of the sea that its length is six times as great. On comparing this rough Eskimo outline with the Admiralty chart of 1870, their accordance is remarkable. I have seen many MS. route maps made by travellers a few years since, when the scientific exploration of the world was much less advanced than it is now, and I can confidently say that I have never known of any traveller, white or brown, civilised or uncivilised, in Africa, Asia, or Australia, who, being unprovided with surveying instruments, and trusting to his memory alone, has produced a chart comparable in extent and accuracy to that of this barbarous Eskimo. The aptitude of the Eskimos to draw, is abundantly shown by the numerous illustrations in Rink's work, all of which were made by self-taught men, and are thoroughly realistic.|$|R
