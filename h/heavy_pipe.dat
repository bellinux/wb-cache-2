50|$|Some {{two hours}} later, {{in order for}} the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land {{on the north side of}} Mount Suribachi, it was decided that a larger flag should be sent up Mount Suribachi to replace the first flag. The {{replacement}} flag attached to another and <b>heavier</b> <b>pipe</b> was raised on the mountain top simultaneous with the lowering of the first flagstaff. It was the black-and-white photograph shot of the second flag-raising by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal which became renowned, made the second-flag raisers famous, and led to the creation of the huge Marine Corps War Memorial (sometimes called the Iwo Jima Memorial) in 1954, at Arlington, Virginia.|$|R

40|$|Distribution {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes in a supply chain, given that it represents up to two thirds of company logistics costs and up to 20 % of the total cost of products. For that reason, it is essential to optimize the costs of distribution.  A steel producer located in Monterrey distributes their products to different parts of Mexico. Currently, the distribution is carried out through empirical knowledge, underusing resources and generating unnecessary costs. The aim is to undertake the distribution process more efficiently.  This paper presents an optimization model based on vehicle routing problem (VRP), for the distribution of <b>heavy</b> <b>pipes</b> taking into account the company’s own characteristics, such as: rented heterogeneous fleet, multiple shipments of products, split deliveries and open cycles (meaning that the routes may not necessarily end in the depot) ...|$|R

5000|$|A slug can {{be added}} by either quickly adding a {{measured}} amount of water to the well or something which displaces a measured volume (e.g., a long <b>heavy</b> <b>pipe</b> with the ends capped off). An alternative object is a solid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) rod, with sufficient weight to sink into the groundwater. The objective here is to displace water, not merely be [...] "heavy". A slug of water can be removed using a bailer or pump, but this {{is more difficult to}} do since it must be done very quickly and the equipment for removing the water (pump or bailer) will likely be in the way of getting water level measurements.|$|E

40|$|Material {{handling}} is {{the primary}} activity of every manufacturing organization. It {{has been estimated that}} at least 15 to 25 % {{of the cost of the}} product is attributable to material handling activities. In case of machine tools like lathe or vertical machining centres it is desired to handle heavy jobs, which is conventionally done manually using chain blocks. This method is time consuming, unsafe and takes a lot of labour time adding to unproductive time of machine. Thus there is a need of a modified work handling device in the form of jaw capable to handle <b>heavy</b> <b>pipes</b> as well as plates with equal efficiency. The jaw system incorporates a twin worm drive that is simply constructed. Two threaded rods, or “worm ” screws, are meshed together. Each worm is wound in a different direction and has a different pitch angle. For proper mesh, the worm axes are not parallel, but slightly skewed. But by selecting proper, and different, pitch angles, the drive will exhibit either self-locking...|$|R
50|$|One {{very old}} design is the Japanese sōzu, known metonymically as a shishi odoshi (although the term shishi odoshi {{properly}} refers to any method of scaring wild animals, including the Western scarecrow). Instead {{of using a}} visual method to distract pests, as the scarecrow does, it uses {{the sound of a}} <b>heavy</b> <b>pipe</b> repeatedly and rhythmically hitting a rock, using water as a timing device. The sōzu is also used in Japanese popular culture to denote inordinate amounts of wealth, combined with a traditional sensibility: by design, the shishi odoshi uses copious amounts of water, meaning either a very high water bill, or that it is situated on high-value land with a stream or river running through it.|$|E

5000|$|The American flag {{flying on}} Mount Suribachi was {{considered}} {{too small to}} be seen easily from the northern part from Mount Suribachi, so the flag was replaced shortly before 1 p.m. on the same day it went up by a larger American flag attached to a shorter and <b>heavier</b> <b>pipe.</b> The raising of this flag became world-famous due to a photograph taken by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal. Schrier was also responsible for seeing that the replacement flag was raised on Mount Suribachi and the first flag returned to Marine headquarters on Iwo Jima. On February 24, Schrier ordered Thomas to report the next morning aboard the flagship [...] to meet with Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner and Lieutenant General Holland Smith. Once there, he met with the two officers and a CBS radio interviewer. On February 27, Schrier became the commander of D Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines. He was later awarded the Silver Star Medal for leading a successful counterattack against a large number of fanatical Japanese soldiers who attacked the rear position of his lightly manned command post on March 24, 1945.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, the {{assumption}} that the aether is not carried in the vicinity, but only within matter, was very problematic as shown by the Hammar experiment (1935).

If aether were dragged by mass, it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would have been enough to cause a visible effect. Once again, no effect was seen, so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.|$|R
50|$|Ordinaries {{had used}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>pipe,</b> but the safeties used twenty-seven feet of tubing: solid round bar would weigh down the machine. Safeties {{required}} thin, high-strength steel tubing. Almost all the Pope manufacturing facilities were located in Hartford in an area previously known for gun-making. Like bicycles, rifle barrels required thin, high-strength tubes, so the skills and processes of rifle manufacturing {{were related to the}} manufacturing of steel tubing for safety bicycles. Importing tubes cost an American manufacturer a forty-five percent import tariff, thus creating a financial incentive for domestic production. The sudden popularity of safety bicycles in the United States created a shortage of tubing supply for manufacturers, both in Europe and the United States. Albert Pope had invested in Shelby Steel Tubing, even while building two steel tubing factories in Hartford, owned by Pope Manufacturing. One was an experimental facility, and the other for commercial production.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a full-scale laboratory {{study of the}} axial sliding behaviour of a trenched pipeline surrounded by sand backfill. Cyclic axial displacements are applied to a <b>heavy</b> <b>pipe</b> buried in a narrow trench (less than three pipe diameters wide), using various backfill cover depths and two different soils: dry Hostun sand and a damp silty sand. A novel testing tank is employed, with compressible foam seals to allow the pipe to settle as it moves axially, and a pressure bag system to simulate backfill depths exceeding {{the height of the}} tank. The test pipe is instrumented to measure (a) the axial soil resistance developed on an isolated central section of pipe (thus avoiding tank boundary effects), and (b) the normal and shear contact stresses at a number of points around the pipe circumference. The results indicate that both the axial resistance and the normal stress distribution around the pipe can undergo considerable changes when a pipeline experiences cyclic axial displacements. An extreme case identified here is the potential for a compacted damp sand backfill to ‘arch’ completely over the pipe as a result of differential settlement, leading to unexpectedly low axial resistance. To address some limitations of the design method currently used in industry, a new approach for estimating axial resistance is suggested and applied to the present test data...|$|E
