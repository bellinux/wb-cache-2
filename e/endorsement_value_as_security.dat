Because a tontine does not entail any guarantees, the payout {{structure of a}} tontine {{is determined by the}} pooling of individual characteristics of tontinists.

Nevertheless, the opportunity to surrender is crucial to the success of a tontine from a regulatory as well as a policyholder perspective.

Results show that the surrender decision requires a discount on the fair surrender <b>value</b> <b>as</b> <b>security</b> for the remaining members. The discount intensifies in decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion. However, tontinists are less willing to surrender for decreasing tontine size and increasing risk aversion, creating a natural protection against tontine runs stemming from short-term liquidity shocks.

The central findings were that materialistic <b>value</b> <b>endorsement</b> emerged <b>as</b> the strongest predictor of individuals' compulsive buying, and that it significantly mediated the observed age differences. A growing number of people engage in uncontrolled, excessive buying of consumer goods that can lead to psychological distress and serious effects on individuals' lives, such as substantial debt (e. g. Benson, 2000; Dittmar, 2004 b). Such dysfunctional behaviour, termed compulsive buying in the clinical literature, has started to attract research attention (cf. Black, 2004; Dittmar, 2004 a; Faber, 2004), and prevalence estimates range from 1 % to 10 % of adults in Western developed economies, including the UK and US. Moreover, a recent study confirmed empirically that compulsive buying is on the increase (Neuner, Raab, & Reisch, 2005). Yet, despite posing a substantial problem, its underlying causes are still poorly understood. To date, clinical models are the main approach, which view compulsive buying as a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders, but without agreement on the type of disorder (e. g. Black, 2004). Recent proposals, which draw on social psychology, conceptualize compulsive buying as compensatory behaviour, where individuals attempt to deal with identity and mood problems through buying material goods (Dittmar, 2004 b; Elliott, 1994). This perspective is consistent with an emphasis on materialistic values, 'the importance ascribed to the ownership and acquisition of material goods in achieving major life goals' (Richins, 2004, p. 210) such as happiness, satisfaction and success. <b>Endorsement</b> of materialistic <b>values</b> has been linked to lower well-being (e. g. Kasser & Ahuvia, 2002; Kasser & Ryan, 1993). In order to improve our limited understanding, the present research therefore examines materialistic <b>value</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>as</b> a factor that may make individuals more vulnerable to compulsive buying. Age is also assessed, given indications that compulsive buying is negatively correlated with age (e. g. D'Astous, 1990; Magee, 1994) and findings that younger people tend to be more materialistic (cf. Myers, 2000). Finally, gender is examined, given the disproportionate prevalence of compulsive buying among women (see reviews by Black, 2004; Faber, 2004) ...|$|R

In this Introduction to a special issue of Law and Contemporary Problems, we argue for a meaning of neoliberalism that can help to organize the stakes of various areas of law while also showing {{the usefulness of the}} term more generally. We define neoliberalism as an overlapping set of arguments, value commitments, predispositions, and ways of framing problems that are unified by the context and purpose of their use: Neoliberal claims serve to protect and expand market imperatives in a persistent political conflict between those imperatives and countervailing democratic demands for <b>values</b> such <b>as</b> <b>security,</b> dignity, fairness, and solidarity. Our definition of neoliberalism helps to tie together various public and private-law areas by showing how market and democratic imperatives are in conflict there, and how law is mediating those conflicts. Legal scholarship, then, needs the concept of neoliberalism. But a useful theory of neoliberalism also needs law: as legal realism showed, and sophisticated economists agree, markets are not natural phenomena, but products of legal choices.

Synchromodality is an innovative concept for container transportation, and the port {{plays an important role}} in connecting the various transportation networks. The large number of global supply chains that use the port as a hub require added value, and this can be provided by interconnecting the three types of networks, for example via the port community system. Global supply chains can be more sustainable when interconnected networks create visibility, together with the proper mechanisms to support value creation, not just monetary value, but also other <b>values</b> such <b>as</b> <b>security</b> and environmental footprint.

40|$|The thesis {{argues for}} the {{centrality}} of normative theory {{in the study of}} international relations because of its unique capacity to address values comprehensively, in contrast to the dominant traditions of political realism which marginalises their theoretical significance. Two themes develop, each reflecting opposing pairs: fact/value, is/ought, description/prescription, feasibility/desirability. The first theme concerns the epistemological framework provided by a normative account of such <b>values</b> <b>as</b> the <b>security</b> and stability of knowledge and the orderly apprehension of the world. In contrast to realism, normative theory maintains the distinction between sensory experience and the assignment of meaning, indicating the contingent nature of epistemological foundations. The second theme concerns the political conditions of knowledge which determine the role of different theories, indicating the need for an adaptation of the traditional normative scholarship by overcoming the separation of ethics from politics which has so far limited its role. As values are central phenomena in politics, and politics is essentially normative in form (as is knowledge of it), consideration of value questions cannot be limited to peripheral commentary. The two themes emerge through analyses of the theoretical literature in international relations; of the philosophical foundations of normative theory; of its relationship to ideas and ideologies; of the encapsulation of values and interests in world views; of the communicative dynamic of norms in ethics and epistemology; and finally of the applied cases of deterrence, and foreign policy.
