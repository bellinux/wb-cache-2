30|$|Calcite {{is a major}} scale-forming mineral and {{of great}} {{importance}} for <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> which were in contact with calcareous reservoir material. Due to the calco-carbonic equilibrium, the solubility behaviour is relatively complex. Calcite solubility depends on temperature, pressure, CO_ 2 partial pressure, pH, and ionic strength. During production of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids,</b> a change in temperature, pressure, and gas load (in case of degassing) occurs.|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the present}} state of the world mineral resources, it is shown out that hightemperature <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> can he used to extract {{valuable}} minerals. For this purpose a technology was devised and experimental vortex equipment was built and tested under laboratory conditions. It was proved that any technological process for concentrating valuable materials (including <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids)</b> demanded a certain vortex flow structure to optimize heat-and-mass transfer...|$|R
30|$|The {{compatibility}} of the inhibitors with <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> of high salinity was {{checked by}} adding them to NaCl solutions of different ionic strength {{according to the}} natural fluids {{that can be found}} in low enthalpy reservoirs. All inhibitors showed compatibility with solutions of concentrations of 0.1, 2, and 5  mol/L NaCl. Only one inhibitor showed flocculation in the solution with the highest salinity and was therefore incompatible with <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> of high salinity.|$|R
50|$|The <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> of Kızıldere {{reservoir}} has a Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) of 2.1 and Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) of 2.3 by a pH {{value of}} 9.3, making scaling take place very rapidly.|$|E
50|$|The source {{temperature}} {{at the first}} reservoir is between 240 - 260 C. All the <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> used in the power plant is reinjected into the reservoir {{for the purpose of}} maintaining the sustainability of the source.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} powered with steam and fluid from the Tauhara steamfield, and all used <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> is reinjected {{back into the}} edge of the steamfield. A 33,000-volt line connects the power station to Transpower's Wairakei substation, injecting the station's {{electricity}} into both Unison's Taupo distribution network and the national grid.|$|E
30|$|Testing and {{eventually}} producing high-temperature <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> {{from the current}} field laboratories in Iceland and Italy will help to validate new technology to handle the hostile downhole conditions.|$|R
30|$|Like upwelling, {{downwelling}} and recharge may {{be controlled}} by permeability in complex structural interaction areas as well. However, modern recharge of meteoric fluids probably constitutes a relatively minor component of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> in the Basin and Range. Oxygen isotope data suggest that many Basin and Range <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> are predominantly composed of older fluids, rather than modern meteoric fluids, which probably originated in the wetter Pleistocene (Flynn and Buchanan 1990; Smith et al. 2002). Additionally, as much as one-quarter of Basin and Range <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> may comprise deep, crustal-derived fluids, rather than meteoric fluids (Bergman et al. 2015 and references therein). Though modern downwelling may take advantage of faulted permeability pathways in magmatic geothermal systems and structurally controlled geothermal systems {{in other parts of}} the world (e.g., Stimac et al. 2015), it appears to not be an important aspect of Basin and Range geothermal systems, and so we do not evaluate downwelling and recharge in our characterization of the structural controls of geothermal circulation herein.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the effects of non-condensable gases (IG) represented by carbon dioxide, on the numerically simulated flow characteristics of water and steam in geothermal wells. The presence of IG affects the thermodynamic conditions dominating the flow process in the well or within the reservoir. Most <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> are generally composed of a mixture of water and steam and substantial amounts of IG and salts. Gas concentrations often vary considerably in a geothermal field. They can be useful tools for inferring flow patterns both in wells and within <b>geothermal</b> reservoirs. <b>Geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> also carry a high content of dissolved solids and salts. Well and pipeline flow simulation of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> requires that thermodynamic and transport properties be properly accounted for. Several equations and correlations were used to estimate the properties of the H 2 O-CO 2 mixture during simulations. The results revealed that the presence of CO 2 affects significantly the location of the flashing point in the well and the amount of steam produced...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to electricity generation, the <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> serves for processing {{of carbon dioxide}} gas as a byproduct, and this is used in dry ice production at two nearby plants. The total annual dry ice production in Kızıldere is 80,000 tons. Further applications are heating of [...] greenhouse space and 2,500 households.|$|E
50|$|Full {{capacity}} operation requires 740 tons per hour of geothermal brine from the reservoir. The <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> is supplied from {{a total of}} 4 production wells, GK-1, GK-3, GK-7 and GK-9. Re-injection of the fluid into the reservoir is realized through two re-injection wells, R-GK-4 and R-GK-6. A third, temporary re-injection well R-GK-1 is kept standby at the power plant site.|$|E
50|$|In the Mt. Kare mine in New Guinea {{the mineral}} occurs with gold {{and is an}} {{important}} maker of gold deposits. The temperature of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> that deposited the roscoelite was from 127 to 167 C. The fluid contained {{a high level of}} salt and also contained carbon dioxide, methane, carbonyl sulfide and other minor amounts of rock forming elements.|$|E
50|$|There was no cement {{production}} in the country; most imports came from Persian Gulf countries. Other mineral occurrences of potential economic interest included diatomite, <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> and mineral salts, gold, gypsum, perlite, petroleum, and pumice.|$|R
40|$|Sericite, {{either as}} illite or illite/smectite, is {{ubiquitous}} in geothermal systems. Theoretical Ca- and Na-smectite contents of non-expanding geothermal sericites have been calculated from published electron microprobe analyses. Geothermal sericites can be modeled as solid solutions of muscovite and smectite. For those sericites that fit the model, {{the amount of}} smectite in solid solution is related to temperature by the expression TºC = 1000 /(0. 45 LogX{sub smectite} + 2. 38) – 273. The temperature dependence of illite interlayer chemistry suggests a related temperature dependence of the K, Na and Ca content of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids.</b> The original data used by Fournier and Truesdell (1973) to derive the empirical Na-K-Ca geothermometer for <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> can be modeled equally well by an equation incorporating the equilibrium constant for the reaction of smectite to illite: T ºC = 1. 145 * 10 {sup 3 }/([0. 35 LogNa + 0. 175 LogCa – 0. 75 LogK] + 1. 51) – 273, where the concentration units are molalities. This supports the hypothesis that illite and illite/smectite are important controls on the concentrations of Na, K and Ca in <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids...</b>|$|R
30|$|Almost all running EGS {{projects}} in the power generation phase utilize binary power plants. Binary systems use <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> with low temperature in the primary loop to vaporize working fluids with low boiling point {{that are used in}} the secondary loop to activate turbine-generator machine.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2011, {{the provincial}} {{administration}} allocated [...] land {{needed for the}} construction site of the geothermal power plant expansion. The project forecast 575 GWh annual electrical energy generation, and {{a contribution to the}} country's economy at US$60 million yearly. The <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> would be used also in dry ice production and for heating in greenhouses and households in the villages around the power plant.|$|E
50|$|The hot <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> that is {{extracted}} is originally cold rainwater that had percolated downwards and been heated by hot rock; pumping back {{the warm water}} that emerges from the exhaust of the generator system thus reduces the heat drawn from the ground. Also, the Waikato river water is already too high in arsenic content to be safe to drink without special treatment, so reinjection of the facility's water does not exacerbate this problem.|$|E
50|$|By 1996 {{the power}} station was built. MGL {{attempted}} {{to apply for}} additional consents allowing the discharge of contaminants to the air, but the Ngati Rauhoto hapu appealed due to inadequate consultation. An application to commence usage was rejected because it was MGL's error in deciding to complete the station before securing all necessary consents, but a priority hearing was allowed. Ngati Rauhoto sought to relitigate the power station consent, but were estopped as having already accepted the use of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid.</b> Costs of $700,000 were awarded against Ngati Rauhoto.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{we use a}} data-base {{compiled}} by the IGA to examine the increase of geothermal energy use in recent years. We speak about electricity produced by different plant types and direct uses of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids.</b> We can conclude {{that the use of}} geothermal energy has tended to increase in recent years. According to the IGA, there are 233 geothermal plants planned to be in operation in the coming years. The direct use of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> is increasing especially the use of geothermal heat pumps. The last part of the work is dedicated to geothermal resources and future research related to this subject. We discuss different problems related to each type of resource and present the benefits that their exploration can bring to humanity, especially those related to air pollution...|$|R
5000|$|To {{boost the}} [...] "renewables" [...] ratio, {{geothermal}} power is often counted as renewable, {{even though the}} geothermal heat reservoirs are depleted (observably so at Wairakei, the longest-running), and, they are not emissions-free. For example, the Ngawha geothermal field emits an unusually high amount of CO2 (350 tonnes CO2 per GWh [...] ) and the geothermal fields plus natural hot springs draining to the Waikato river deliver sufficient arsenic to render the water unsafe to drink without special treatment. Re-injection of the waste <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> can reduce these problems (even extending {{the life of the}} field), but involves additional expense.|$|E
5000|$|Champagne Pool is a {{prominent}} geothermal feature within the Waiotapu geothermal {{area in the}} North Island of New Zealand. The terrestrial hot spring is located about 30 km southeast of Rotorua and about 50 km northeast of Taupo. The name Champagne Pool {{is derived from the}} abundant efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2), similar to a glass of bubbling champagne. The hot spring was formed 900 years ago by a hydrothermal eruption, which makes it in geological terms a relatively young system. Its crater is around 65 m in diameter with a maximum depth of approximately 62 m and is filled with an estimated volume of [...] of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The deep {{geothermal}} water below Champagne Pool {{is of the}} order of [...] but water temperature within the pool is maintained at [...] to [...] by losing heat to the atmosphere. The pH of 5.5 is relatively constant due to buffering by the flux of CO2. Gases are mainly CO2, but to less extent nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and traces of oxygen (O2). The siliceous <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluid</b> is oversaturated with metalloid compounds such as orpiment (As2S3) and stibnite (Sb2S3), which precipitate and form orange subaqueous deposits. The colourful deposits are {{in sharp contrast to the}} grey-white silica sinter surrounding Champagne Pool.|$|E

5000|$|The high {{geothermal}} potential {{is due to}} geology such as the Western Anatolian Graben systems.

40|$|Quantitative bulk {{analysis}} of fluid inclusion volatiles measures {{the composition of}} trapped geothermal liquids and vapor. Fluid-inclusion gas-analyses may identify fluid boiling and mixing, and the analyses {{can be used as}} a fluid tracer. Fluid boiling is indicated by excess gaseous species. Linear arrays of data points on gas ratio diagrams indicate fluid mixing. Nitrogen-argon ratios are used to discriminate atmospheric fiom magmatic volatiles. Crustal components in <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids</b> are best indicated by concentrations of methane and helium. Methane strongly correlates with other organic compounds, and N 2 -Ar-CH 4 plots are similar to N 2 -Ar-He diagrams. Alkene to alkane ratios of C 2 - 7 organic species indicate the oxidation state of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fluids.</b> The Geysers inclusion analyses are an example of how inclusion fluids may be used to understand the paleo hydrology of a geothermal system...|$|R

ECNZ objected because of their need for the Wairakei power station. A report describing this need was not made available to GEL, despite applications and in frustration, GEL applied to declare the ECNZ [...] "anti-competitive" [...] and using their dominant market position to deter advisors, service providers, customers, financiers and investors from dealing with GEL, as well as making baseless statutory applications to hinder GEL's planning applications, and that the ECNZ intended to prevent GEL from supplying power to Electrical Supply Authorities.|$|E
30|$|Cogeneration {{topping cycle}} A power plant is {{followed}} by a direct-use heat application in series.
