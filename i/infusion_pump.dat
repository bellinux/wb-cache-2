2500|$|The {{duration}} of a [...] "single-shot" [...] brachial plexus block is highly variable, commonly lasting anywhere from 45minutes to 24hours. The block {{can be extended}} by placing an indwelling catheter, which may be connected to a mechanical or electronic <b>infusion</b> <b>pump</b> for continuous administration of local anesthetic solution. A catheter may be inserted at the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular or axillary location, depending on the desired location of nerve block. The infusion of local anesthetic can be programmed to be a continuous flow or patient-controlled analgesia. In some cases, people can maintain the catheters and infusions at home after release from the facility where the surgery was performed.|$|E
2500|$|The core {{instrument}} in an inhalational anesthetic delivery system is an anesthetic machine. [...] It has vaporizers, ventilators, an anesthetic breathing circuit, waste gas scavenging system and pressure gauges. The {{purpose of the}} anesthetic machine is to provide anesthetic gas at a constant pressure, oxygen for breathing and to remove carbon dioxide or other waste anesthetic gases. [...] Since inhalational anaesthetics are flammable, various checklists {{have been developed to}} confirm that the machine is ready for use, that the safety features are active and the electrical hazards are removed. Intravenous anesthetic is delivered either by bolus doses or an <b>infusion</b> <b>pump.</b> There are also many smaller instruments used in airway management and monitoring the patient. [...] The common thread to modern machinery in this field is the use of fail-safe systems that decrease the odds of catastrophic misuse of the machine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability of}} the {{electronic}} controls of the <b>infusion</b> <b>pump,</b> particularly in the bolus shaping capability, suggests that the control algorithm may replicate {{the function of the}} healthy pancreas in a more copycat fashion. [...] At present, the insulin bolus is a predictive dose based on what is about to be eaten, and then infused completely. [...] Even with the benefit of the closed-loop control of the basal insulin, the standard bolus is still a [...] "guess and then fix it later" [...] approach. [...] Compare to the pancreatic physiology, where insulin and amylin are released from the beta cells in pulses almost directly to the liver in response to the immediate blood glucose level. The natural release from the beta cells is a closed loop response to sensed glucose, and the shape of the insulin delivery is adaptable and appropriate to the food eaten and the body's present metabolic capability.|$|E

30|$|<b>Infusion</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are often}} {{associated}} with poor usability and an increased likelihood of medication errors [1]. Critically ill patients {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) usually receive multiple infusions simultaneously, which increases the likelihood of pump-related errors. Furthermore, the ICU is frequently a hectic environment, compounding the likelihood of human error. Improving the usability of <b>infusion</b> <b>pumps</b> could help prevent injury or death in this vulnerable population. Where previous usability studies focused on individual pumps, this study focuses on the pump system as a whole, a situation more representative of the ICU.|$|R
