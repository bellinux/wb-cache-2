5000|$|Improved gear designs {{decreased}} {{wear and}} increased efficiency. Mathematical gear designs {{were developed in}} the mid 17th century. French mathematician and engineer Desargues designed and constructed the first mill with epicycloidal teeth ca. 1650. In the 18th century <b>involute</b> <b>gears,</b> another mathematical derived design, came into use. <b>Involute</b> <b>gears</b> are better for meshing gears of different sizes than epicycloidal.

The asymmetry means that different pressure angles are applied for driving and coast sides, respectively. By applying the equations of designed profile of rack cutter, {{the principle of}} coordinate transformation, the theory of differential geometry, and the theory of gearing, the mathematical models of <b>involute</b> helical <b>gear</b> is given.

50|$|The {{involute}} {{has some}} properties {{that makes it}} extremely important to the gear industry: If two intermeshed gears have teeth with the profile-shape of involutes (rather than, for example, a traditional triangular shape), they form an <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> system. Their relative rates of rotation are constant while the teeth are engaged, and also, the gears always make contact along a single steady line of force. With teeth of other shapes, the relative speeds and forces rise and fall as successive teeth engage, resulting in vibration, noise, and excessive wear. For this reason, nearly all modern gear teeth bear the involute shape.|$|E
50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for pitch diameter, circular pitch, diametral pitch, pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|E
5000|$|If two planar rigid {{bodies are}} in contact, and each body {{has its own}} {{distinct}} centre of rotation, then the relative centre of rotation between the bodies has to lie somewhere on the line connecting the two centres. As a result, since pure rolling can only exist when the centre of rotation is {{at the point of}} contact (as seen above with the wheel on the road), it is only when the point of contact goes through the line connecting the two rotation centres that pure rolling can be achieved. This is known in <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> design as the pitch point, where there is no relative sliding between the gears. In fact, the gearing ratio between the two rotating parts is found by the ratio of the two distances to the relative centre. In the example in Sketch 4 the gearing ratio is ...|$|E
5000|$|Line of action, {{pressure}} line : Line along which the force between two meshing gear teeth is directed. It {{has the same}} direction as the force vector. In general, the line of action changes from moment to moment during the period of engagement of a pair of teeth. For <b>involute</b> <b>gears,</b> however, the tooth-to-tooth force is always directed along the same line—that is, the line of action is constant. This implies that for <b>involute</b> <b>gears</b> the path of contact is also a straight line, coincident with the line of action—as is indeed the case.|$|R

40|$|The torus <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> drive {{originates}} {{from the}} involute spur gear drive, which {{is composed of}} a gear with convex teeth and the one with concave teeth. Previous researches of its mesh principle indicate that the torus <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> can compensate large axial misalignments in parallel-shaft transmission, while its dynamic behavior has not been investigated comprehensively, or {{compared with that of}} the standard <b>involute</b> <b>gear.</b> This paper focuses on the dynamic performance of this type of gear. Considering the time variation of meshing stiffness, a 6 -degree-of-freedom dynamics model of the torus <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> pair is established, which counts in the effect of alternate meshing of single-double tooth pairs.

40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov gears having {{circular}} flanks {{hold out}} a very promising {{future in the}} field of gearing for power transmission in very heavily loaded machineries. In order to optimize the profile parameters of these gears, a photoelastic investigation was carried out. Models of Wildhaber-Novikov gears made of photoelastic material, Araldite-D, were used in the investigation. Included were the models with various profile radii and fillet radii at different pressure angles. The flank and bending stresses of these gears were determined in each case and were compared with those of <b>involute</b> <b>gears.</b> From this investigation, it was concluded that the load-carrying capacity of circular-arc gears is 3. 5 times that of <b>involute</b> <b>gears.</b> It was found that with profile radius up to 1. 5 module, the bending stresses of these gears are lower than those of corresponding <b>involute</b> <b>gears,</b> under identical conditions of loading. It was observed that high pressure angles, when used for Wildhaber-Novikov gears having comparatively smaller profile radii, produce high flank stresses. Gears with larger profile radii, at smaller pressure angles were seen to have a high value for the ratio of flank stress to the bending stress. On the other hand, gears with smaller profile radii, at higher pressure angles, were observed to have a smaller value for this ratio of stresses...|$|R

40|$|A {{test rig}} to {{evaluate}} {{the performance of a}} micro <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> with a diameter below 1 mm has been developed. Shaft position and shaft center distance of gears have great influence on the gear performance and therefore they must be adjusted precisely. In this research, the measurement and adjustment method of gear assembly condition and an in-situ observation system of gear condition are proposed, that are appropriately designed for micro gears. The meshing condition of micro involute gears is investigated experimentally. Based on the observation of sliding marks on the tooth flank, it is clarified that the meshing condition of a micro <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> follows the meshing theory of an <b>involute</b> <b>gear.</b> Failure modes of SK 4 micro gears and metallic glass micro gears are investigated.

40|$|The {{development}} of technology requires higher load capacity, rotating speed, power-weight ratio, lower vibration, and noise {{with respect to}} the gear transmission. The new type microsegment gear’s tooth profile curve is composed of many microsegments. Previous researches indicate that the microsegment gear has a good static performance, while the dynamic behavior of the microsegment gear has never been investigated. This paper will focus on the dynamic performance of the gear. The profile deviation between microsegment gear and <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> is regarded as a displacement excitation in the proposed dynamic model. The numerical analysis for three cases is conducted and the results shows that, in low-speed and heavy-load, medium-speed and medium-load conditions, microsegment gear and <b>involute</b> <b>gear</b> both exhibit a good performance, while, in high-speed and heavy-load condition, microsegment gear has a better performance than that of <b>involute</b> <b>gear.</b> The influence of backlash on the dynamic performance is also studied.
