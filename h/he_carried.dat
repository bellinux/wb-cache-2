50|$|The Pardoner is also {{deceptive}} in how <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> out his job. Instead {{of selling}} genuine relics, the bones <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> belong to pigs, not departed saints. The cross <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> {{appears to be}} studded with precious stones that are, in fact, bits of common metal. This irony could be an indication to Chaucer's dislike for religious profit—a pervasive late medieval theme hinging on anti-clericalism. Chaucer's use of subtle literary techniques, such as satire, seem to convey this message.|$|R

5|$|After {{a two-month}} stay in Bucharest, Vasil Levski {{returned}} to Bulgaria {{for a second}} tour, lasting from 1 May to 26 August 1869. On this tour <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> proclamations printed in Romania by the political figure Ivan Kasabov. They legitimised Levski as the representative of a Bulgarian provisional government. Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, Plovdiv, Pazardzhik, Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, Chirpan, Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Sevlievo and Tryavna. According to some researchers, Levski established the earliest of his secret committees during this tour, but those assumptions are based on uncertain data.|$|E
5|$|After another knee {{operation}} and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was {{kept out of}} the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, a fire {{broke out}} in a wing of Dunvegan Castle, and {{according}} to Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, the flames were checked and extinguished when the flag was carried past to safety.

5|$|Pickett was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 8th Infantry Regiment.

5|$|The Duke {{occupied}} {{the post of}} Lord Warden until 1765, save for two periods when it was filled by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and John Sidney, the Earl of Leicester. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> out extensive work to make the castle more habitable, building extensions towards the north bastion and constructing a small house in the south bastion for the soldiers. Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, the politicians Robert Darcy, the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery but it became increasingly less military in character.|$|E

5|$|A British assault force {{landed on}} the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to intensify the {{blockade}} off Bastia. For {{the rest of the}} month <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia. However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk an assault. Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for an assault on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart.|$|E
