Scott Newark, a former prosecutor {{and executive director of}} the Canadian Police Association, who is now special counsel to the Ontario Attorney General's Office for Victims of Crime, stated that the Correctional Service of Canada is out of control and that [...] "I think Canadians <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be outraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|PA {{officials}} also insisted {{that some of}} the gunmen in the border attack had come from the Gaza Strip. They provided the names of several suspects from Gaza to the Egyptian authorities. [...] One official said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that terrorist groups from the Gaza Strip were involved in the attack. [...] These groups operate {{under the watchful eye of}} the Hamas government and sometimes even receive support from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{schooner}} {{was hired}} {{into the service}} of the American Continental Army by General George Washington. Washington commissioned Nicholson Broughton to command the Hannah on 2 September 1775 and ordered the vessel to, [...] "...cruize against such vessels as may be found [...] [...] [...] bound inward and outward to and from Boston, in {{the service of the}} [...] army, and to take and seize all such vessels, laden with soldiers, arms, ammunition, or provisions [...] [...] [...] which you shall <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suspect are in such service." [...] Hannah set sail from the harbor of Beverly, Massachusetts on 5 September 1775, but fled to the protection of the harbor of Gloucester, Massachusetts two days later under the pursuit of [...] and a second British vessel. [...] Leaving Gloucester Harbor, Hannah captured HMS Unity.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and {{sympathy for the}} Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence {{of the number of}} Irish Catholics in the Battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Another hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while [...] "there was a portion of truth" [...] in the view—commonly assigned by officers—that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result ," [...] describing how he found the punishments used for [...] "trivial offensives" [...] to be [...] "revolting and disgusting". Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.|$|E
2500|$|Politician and {{minister}} Jesse Jackson, {{a friend}} of Michael Jackson's family, said that the family was concerned about Murray's role. [...] "They <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be [...] he left the scene." [...] Over the next few weeks, law enforcement grew increasingly concerned about the doctor, and on July 22 detectives searched Murray's medical office and storage unit in Houston, removing items such as a computer and two hard drives, contact lists and a hospital suspension notice. On the 27th, an anonymous source reported that Murray had administered propofol within 24 hours of Jackson's death. Murray's lawyers {{refused to comment on}} what they called [...] "rumors, innuendo or unnamed sources." [...] The following day it was reported that investigators had searched Murray's home and office in Las Vegas, and that Murray had become the primary focus of the investigation. On August 11, a Las Vegas pharmacy was searched by investigators looking for evidence regarding Murray, according to an anonymous police source. Murray's lawyer advised patience until the toxicology results arrived, noting that [...] "things tend to shake out when all the facts are made known". [...] On February 8, 2010, Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter by prosecutors in Los Angeles. Murray pleaded not guilty and was released after posting $75,000 (USD) bail. Shortly after, the California Medical Board issued an order preventing Murray from administering heavy sedatives.|$|E
2500|$|When Hooker {{received}} the {{report about the}} Confederate movement, he thought that Lee might be starting a retreat, but he also realized that a flanking march might be in progress. He took two actions. First, he sent a message at 9:30a.m. to {{the commander of the}} XI Corps, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard on his right flank: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose the enemy is moving to our right. Please advance your pickets for purposes of observation as far as may be safe in order to obtain timely information of their approach." [...] At 10:50a.m., Howard replied that he was [...] "taking measures to resist an attack from the west." [...] Hooker's second action was to send orders to Sedgwick ("attack the enemy in his front" [...] at Fredericksburg if [...] "an opportunity presents itself with a reasonable expectation of success") and Sickles ("advance cautiously toward the road followed by the enemy, and harass the movement as much as possible"). Sedgwick did not take action from the discretionary orders. Sickles, however, was enthusiastic when he {{received the}} order at noon. He sent Birney's division, flanked by two battalions of Col. Hiram Berdan's U.S. sharpshooters, south from Hazel Grove with orders to pierce the column and gain possession of the road. [...] But the action came too late. Jackson had ordered the 23rd Georgia Infantry to guard the rear of the column and they resisted the advance of Birney and Berdan at Catherine Furnace. The Georgians were driven south and made a stand at the same unfinished railroad bed used by Wright's Brigade the day before. They were overwhelmed by 5 p.m. and most were captured. Two brigades from A.P. Hill's division turned back from the flanking march and prevented any further damage to Jackson's column, which by now had left the area.|$|E

Some call this view “strong agnosticism” but I prefer the term “skeptheism” in order to clearly distinguish between two distinct epistemic attitudes {{with respect to the}} existence of God, namely, agnosticism and skepticism. For the skeptheist, we cannot know (or <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> believe) that God exists, since there can be neither conceptual (a priori) nor empirical (a posteriori) evidence for the existence of God...|$|R
