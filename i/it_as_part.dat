5|$|Briarcliff College was a women's {{college in}} Briarcliff Manor, New York. The school was founded as Mrs. Dow's School for Girlsin 1903 at the Briarcliff Lodge. After Walter W. Law donated land and a {{building}} for the college, it operated at its location at 235 Elm Road in Briarcliff until 1977; closing due to low enrollment and financial problems. Pace University subsequently operated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> of its Pleasantville campus from 1977 to 2015.

Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} suggest that he most likely did <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> {{of a plan to}} re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> of a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E

King Charles passed through the castle in May 1645 {{on his way to}} besiege Leicester, but the following month his forces were defeated at the Battle of Naseby; the King briefly stayed at the castle once again as he retreated west.

5|$|Its {{popularity}} has spread throughout Eastern Europe {{and the former}} Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents.

5|$|The {{potential}} political {{threat to}} Apollo blew over, {{due in large}} part to the support of President Lyndon B.

5|$|The text of {{the short}} work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a {{connecting}} recitative. The topic is to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> of his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{photographs}} of Bahá'u'lláh, both {{taken at the}} same occasion in 1868 {{while he was in}} Adrianople (present-day Edirne). The one where he looks at the camera was taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bahá'í Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bahá'í World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bahá'ís view <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> of an organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes, and Bahá'í institution strongly suggests to use an image of Bahá'u'lláh's burial shrine instead.|$|E
