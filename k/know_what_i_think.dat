500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, but you <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this is a better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera {{was chosen as the}} featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E

We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I've cracked it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Davout marched from Naumburg {{to glory}} at Auerstedt, Bernadotte refused {{to join his}} fellow marshal despite {{positive}} orders to do so. Instead, he executed an earlier set of orders to march to Dornburg and missed the fighting at both Jena and Auerstedt. Bernadotte found himself in serious trouble with his emperor. In a conversation with General of Division Jean Rapp Napoleon guessed that Bernadotte's behavior was caused by professional jealousy. The emperor remarked to General of Division Anne Jean Marie René Savary, [...] "This business is so hateful that if I send him before a court-martial {{it will be the}} equivalent of ordering him to be shot; it is better for me not to speak to him about it, but I shall take care he shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of his behavior. I believe he has enough honor to recognize that he has performed a disgraceful action regarding which I shall not bandy words with him." [...] In the end, Bernadotte's career may have been saved because of Napoleon's fondness for his wife Désirée Clary, whom he almost married.|$|E

In the following January he was equally successful and, to fulfill his obligations to write music for Catania—a condition of his scholarship—he sent a Messa di gloria which was performed the following October. His involvement in Zingarelli's class took place over the 1822/23 school year. By January 1824, after passing examinations where he did very well, resulted in his being given the title of primo maestrino, a post which required him to tutor younger students, allowed him to have a room of his own in the Collegio, and also allowed him visits to the opera on Thursdays and Sundays, where he saw his first opera by Rossini, Semiramide. While Weinstock gives an account of how he was [...] "clearly captivated by the music of Rossini... he put Rossini on a pedestal", he relates that, returning from the performance Bellini was unusually quiet and then [...] "suddenly exclaimed to his companions, 'Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> After Semiramide, it's futile for us to try and achieve anything' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1882 Brahms {{completed}} his Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83, dedicated to his teacher Marxsen. Brahms was invited by Hans von Bülow {{to undertake a}} premiere of the work with the Meiningen Court Orchestra; this {{was the beginning of}} his collaboration with Meiningen and with von Bülow, who was to rank Brahms as one of the 'Three Bs'; {{in a letter to his}} wife he wrote [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Brahms: after Bach and Beethoven the greatest, the most sublime of all composers." [...] The following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony Op. 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony Op. 98 (1885). Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: [...] "a giant work, great in concept and invention." [...] Another, but cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance; he rated Brahms as superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven.|$|E
