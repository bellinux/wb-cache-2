25|$|In the Abhijñānaśākuntalam, {{written by}} Kalidasa, when the maiden Shakuntala ignored Durvasa's demands to be welcomed {{as a guest}} because she was daydreaming about her lover, Dushyanta, he cursed her that her lover would forget her. Horrified, Shakuntala's companions managed to mollify Durvasa, who {{softened}} the curse, saying that Dushyanta would remember Shakuntala {{when he saw the}} ring that he gave her as a token of their love. The sage's curse came true of course and was eventually lifted, just as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be. By the end of the play, the two lovers are reconciled and are happy to be together again, along with their son, Bharata.|$|E
25|$|To get an {{audience}} with the casino's CEO Jay Sarno, Knievel created a fictitious corporation called Evel Knievel Enterprises and three fictitious lawyers to make phone calls to Sarno. Knievel also placed phone calls to Sarno claiming to be from American Broadcasting Company and Sports Illustrated inquiring about the jump. Sarno finally agreed to meet Knievel and arranged for Knievel to jump the fountains on December 31, 1967. After the deal was set, Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports. ABC declined, but said that if Knievel had the jump filmed {{and it was as}} spectacular as <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be, they would consider using it later.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his drawing}} pupils was Margaret Lindsay, eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick and Amelia Murray (granddaughter to David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and sister to the naval officer John Lindsay). He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her father never forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> increase ‘as my affairs increase, and I thank God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for your Daughter, who, I am sensible, is entitled to much more than ever I shall have to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E

25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E

500|$|Usher reiterated his {{statements}} in another interview with Access Hollywood, {{and when asked}} if he thought the racy lyrics would raise eyebrows, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> commenting that that was an objective of the song. Usher also said that the work was like the dichotomy of Raymond v. Raymond, distinguishing one world from another, as in [...] "playing the nice guy" [...] or [...] "showing the other side."

500|$|In February 1916 Heseltine {{returned}} to London, ostensibly {{to argue for}} exemption from military service. However, {{it became clear that}} there had been a rift with Lawrence; in a letter to his friend Robert Nichols, Heseltine described Lawrence as [...] "a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is". The social centre of Heseltine's life now became the Café Royal in Regent Street, where among others he met Cecil Gray, a young Scottish composer. The two decided to share a Battersea studio, where they planned various unfulfilled schemes, including a new music magazine, and, more ambitiously, a London season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter's English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham's productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in artistic value; in his own venture there would be [...] "no compromise with the mob". Beecham ridiculed the plan; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> [...] "be launched and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life".|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} in this episode were received {{with a bit}} more enthusiasm than the episode itself. Benigno described them as [...] "decent songs", but though Canning wrote that [...] "Candyman" [...] was [...] "fun", {{he also said that}} the [...] "rest of the music" [...] prevented the episode [...] "from being much better". Indeed, [...] "Candyman" [...] was a favorite of many reviewers: The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman called it [...] "bouncy and fun", Futterman praised the [...] "tight harmonies" [...] and the [...] "diva notes from Mercedes and Santana", and Slezak gave the number an [...] "A" [...] and said he loved the Troubletones [...] "absolutely soaring" [...] in their performance. Hankinson, Hyman, and Chaney singled out the production values of the number—Hyman to call them [...] "amazing"; Chaney to note, as she gave the song an [...] "A−", that the costuming cost for the number would have rivaled the $2,004 budget of West Side Story that had Sue so upset; and Hankinson, although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been his favorite in a [...] "blind test", to call it [...] "a classic example of the kind of inexplicably elaborate performance I hate the most on this show".|$|E
500|$|Sports {{gambling}} expert R. J. Bell, {{president of}} sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy worked from 2003 to 2007. [...] He discovered {{that during the}} two seasons investigated by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the Las Vegas sports books 57 percent of the time. In the previous two seasons, this only happened 44 percent of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy are 1 in 1,000, and there was [...] "a 99.9 percent chance that these results {{would not have happened}} without an outside factor." [...] He also found 10 straight games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 1.5 points or more before the tip— an indication that big money had been wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that [...] "something (was) going on". [...] However, Bell suggested {{that there was no way}} anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss about Donaghy's actions during a game; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been another year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.|$|E

500|$|Writing in the New Law Journal, Chris Pamplin {{called the}} {{decision}} [...] "unprincipled" [...] {{and argued that}} the decision [...] "threatens the very foundation of witness immunity", based on an out-of-date view of the expert witness as a [...] "hired gun". [...] Pamplin's view was that the majority had [...] "ignored the fundamental difference" [...] between experts and advocates, saying that advocates {{had no choice but}} to continue in the legal system whereas experts could continue their ordinary work without needing to carry on as an expert witness. [...] Therefore, experts would be more likely to abandon such work than advocates, making them more vulnerable to vexatious litigation. [...] However, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make [...] "little immediate difference" [...] for many experts, since [...] "conscientious professionals" [...] would have little worry about being found negligent and would have insurance in case they were. The ruling would also help develop a [...] "professional class of expert", making it less likely that people would contribute expertise occasionally, and although a professional expert witness would have a better knowledge of their role and duties, this would be at the expense of [...] "freshness and challenge to dogma".|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{published}} {{a review of the}} show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card. He considered the main event [...] "underwhelming" [...] due to the [...] "audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe-Booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish" [...] and that it was [...] "not memorable" [...] but that it would [...] "generate talk about Jarrett." [...] He gave the bout 2 stars. [...] "That was an epic match", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a [...] "silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation" [...] and that the [...] "all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win." [...] Caldwell felt the match made Styles look [...] "like a star when he won, then he came across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out" [...] but that he had a [...] "memorable, star-making victory over Angle." [...] He disapproved of Styles being [...] "used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life." [...] Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, {{he said it was a}} [...] "fun brawl for the audience" [...] and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had [...] "good heat" [...] that [...] "over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking" [...] and that it was [...] "refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match." [...] He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been [...] "great" [...] if it had avoided involving [...] "outside interference." ...|$|E
