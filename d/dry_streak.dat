50|$|Bagdad {{holds the}} record for the longest <b>dry</b> <b>streak</b> in United States history with 767 {{straight}} days without rain, from October 3, 1912 to November 8, 1914. It is to the south of the Granite Mountains and the Mojave National Preserve, and north of the Bullion Mountains.|$|E
50|$|Fujisawa {{turned pro}} in 1940 and reached 9 dan in 1963. He {{won his first}} major title in 1962, the Meijin. He then won two Asahi Pro Best Ten titles in 1965 and 1968. He won his second major title, the Oza, which he held for three {{consecutive}} years from 1967 to 1969. The same year that he lost the Oza, he won the NHK Cup. He didn't win the NHK Cup again until 1981. The Meijin title was Fujisawa's again when he won it in 1970. He then went on a <b>dry</b> <b>streak</b> of titles. By 1976, {{he won his first}} title since the Meijin in 1970, the Tengen.|$|E

40|$|The present {{simulation}} of 6. 7 -micron channel water vapor imagery employs March 6 - 7, 1982 soundings from the Limited Area Mesoscale Prediction System (LAMPS) mesoscale model as inputs to a radiative transfer scheme. A comparison of model-generated and observed brightness temperatures indicates that LAMPS {{was able to}} replicate major features of the VAS imagery, including the pronounced warm, <b>dry</b> development <b>streak</b> and a cold cloud area. The model was not, however, able to resolve such finer-scaled details as the double structure of the development portion of the streak...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} unanimous {{critical acclaim}} particularly for Vikram and Surya's performances. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu praised Vikram as [...] "Without any dialogue {{to support him}} he carves a niche for himself in the viewer's mind with his expressions and excellent body language" [...] and Suriya as [...] "Who {{would have thought that}} this young man, pitted against the serious Chithan, would prove so perfect a foil?" [...] going on to declare the movie as [...] "..a symphony on celluloid". Balaji Balasubramaniam of Thiraipadam.com reviewed as [...] "With unique characterization, tremendous performances and a smooth screenplay, the movie offers a satisfying experience to the discerning viewer..." [...] and noted [...] "Vikram pretty much lives the role of the undertaker. With <b>dry</b> and <b>streaked</b> hair, dirty teeth and torn clothes, he looks the part and though he doesn't utter a word, he conveys everything through his expressions and body language". A reviewer at Sify.com noted, [...] "..it is the expert performance of the lead actors that elevate the film above the commonplace".|$|R
40|$|Three-week-old tamarillo {{seedlings}} were inoculated on the cotyledons {{and first}} true leaf with seven different viruses known to infect solanaceous plants. Five of the viruses caused systemic mosaic or necrotic symptoms in {{some or all}} of the inoculated plants. Alfalfa mosaic, cucumber mosaic and tomato spotted wilt viruses were the most severe, causing significant decreases in leaf, stem and root <b>dry</b> weight. Tobacco <b>streak</b> virus caused a significant decrease in dry weight of roots only, but results with potato virus X were not significant. Potato virus Y and tobacco mosaic virus failed to cause infection in tamarillo as indicated by lack of symptoms, failure to recover virus in indicator plants and failure to detect virus particles in leaf extracts using immunosorbent electron microscopy...|$|R
60|$|This {{decision}} {{pointed at}} once to the delay of another week. No time was lost in vain regrets, however; but all hands went to work to get the schooner into shallow water again, and to look further for the principal leak. Accurate trimming and pumping showed that {{a good deal of}} the water was already stopped out; but too much still entered to render it prudent to think of sailing until the injury was repaired. This time the schooner was not suffered to lie on her bilge at all. She was taken into water just deep enough to permit her to stand upright, sustained by shores, while the tide left two or three <b>streaks</b> <b>dry</b> forward; it being the intention to wind her, should the examination forward not be successful.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{goals are}} to {{describe}} the information content of Vertical Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) radiance data, especially the 6. 7 micrometers water vapor channel, to better interpret the atmosphere's water vapor structure from 6. 7 micrometers imagery, and to investigate new analysis and forecasting techniques utilizing retrieved VAS soundings. Researchers made major progress toward these goals during FY- 85. They are investigating 6. 7 micrometer imagery on 6 to 7 March 1982, a day when special mesoscale ground truth data were collected during the 1982 atmospheric variability experiment/vertical amospheric sounder (AVE/VAS) field experiment. A dark (<b>dry)</b> image <b>streak</b> having mesoscale details was located over the special data region, and it provides the major focus of the case study. Mesoscale radiosonde-derived humidity data are found to verify fine scale features of the image that are not evident from the standard National Weather Service network. Thus, VAS imagery is a reliable detector of mesoscale moisture structure during this case. To investigate causes for the image streak, researchers are calculating water vapor budgets. Subsidence {{is found to be}} a factor in the current case as well; however, patterns of descent are not related to the jet streak according to traditional conceptual models. Thus, it appears that more research into jet stream dynamics is needed in order to better interpret 6. 7 micrometer imagery...|$|R
60|$|When {{her father}} slept indoors, which was seldom except in winter, he {{occupied}} {{a couch in}} the opposite corner. A rude cupboard had been built against the logs next to the fireplace. It contained supplies and utensils. Toward the center, somewhat closer to the door, stood a crude table and two benches. The cabin was dark and smelled of smoke, of the stale odors of past cooked meals, of the mustiness of <b>dry,</b> rotting timber. <b>Streaks</b> of light showed through the roof where the rough-hewn shingles had split or weathered. A strip of bacon hung upon {{one side of the}} cupboard, and upon the other a haunch of venison. Ellen detested the Mexican woman because she was dirty. The inside of the cabin presented the same unkempt appearance usual to it after Ellen had been away for a few days. Whatever Ellen had lost during the retrogression of the Jorths, she had kept her habits of cleanliness, and straightway upon her return she set to work.|$|R
