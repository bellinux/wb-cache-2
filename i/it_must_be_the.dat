However, while resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who then tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas.

5|$|When the Indian flag is {{displayed}} with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state {{that if the}} flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India {{should be in the}} middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must be {{in front of the other}} poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> uppermost flag.

25|$|The Theodicy {{tries to}} justify the {{apparent}} imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist.

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Moon's craters as impact {{features}} became widely accepted only in the 1940s. This realization allowed the impact history of the Moon to be gradually worked out {{by means of the}} geologic principle of superposition. That is, if a crater (or its ejecta) overlaid another, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> younger. The amount of erosion experienced by a crater was another clue to its age, though this is more subjective. Adopting this approach in the late 1950s, Gene Shoemaker took the systematic study of the Moon away from the astronomers and placed it firmly {{in the hands of the}} lunar geologists.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} proceeds by contradiction, supposing that {{a continuous}} function f:D n→D n has no fixed point, and then attempting to derive an inconsistency, which {{proves that the}} function must in fact have a fixed point. For each x in D n, {{there is only one}} straight line that passes through f(x) and x, because <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that f(x) and x are distinct by hypothesis (recall that f having no fixed points means that f(x) ≠ x). Following this line from f(x) through x leads to a point on S n − 1, denoted by F(x). This defines a continuous function F:D n→S n − 1, which is a special type of continuous function known as a retraction: every point of the codomain (in this case S n − 1) is a fixed point of the function.|$|E

25|$|However, an {{algebraic}} {{function of}} several variables may yield an algebraic number {{when applied to}} transcendental numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent. For example, π and (1 − π) are both transcendental, but π + (1 − π) = 1 is obviously not. It is unknown whether π + e, for example, is transcendental, though {{at least one of}} π + e and πe must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers a and b, at least one of a + b and ab must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial (x − a)(x − b) = x2 − (a + b)x + ab. If (a + b) and ab were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, a and b, must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case {{that at least one of}} the coefficients is transcendental.|$|E

500|$|Semen {{collection}} is naturally an integral component of this entire process. [...] Once semen has been collected {{it can be}} used immediately for insemination or slowly frozen for use at a later date. Fresh semen is recognized as the method of choice as it lives longer and yields higher conception rates. Frozen semen will work but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> highest quality of semen and the ewes must be inseminated twice in the same day. The marketing of ram semen is a major part of this industry. [...] Producers owning prize winning rams have found this to be a good avenue to leverage the accolades of their most famous animals.|$|E

[...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> weed, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E
