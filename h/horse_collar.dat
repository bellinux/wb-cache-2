5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the <b>horse</b> <b>collar.</b> The <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Although ox-carts and chariots were {{previously}} used in China, the wheelbarrow {{was first used}} in Han China in the 1st century BC. Han artwork of horse-drawn chariots shows that the Warring-States-Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse's chest {{was replaced by the}} softer breast strap. Later, during the Northern Wei (386–534 AD), the fully developed <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> was invented.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by {{the spread of the}} <b>horse</b> <b>collar,</b> which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the <b>horse</b> <b>collar,</b> which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the <b>horse</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{horse and}} ox-drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China {{long before the}} Han dynasty, {{it was not until}} the 1st century BCE that {{literary}} evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods. While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs. In the final stage of evolution, the modern <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> was invented in China by the 5th century CE, during the Northern Wei period.|$|E
5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
25|$|The {{same basic}} design {{is seen in}} other painted Chinese frescoes, one from 520–524 AD (with shafts {{projecting}} beyond the horses chest for sternal traction), and another circa 600 AD (Sui Dynasty). This Sui Dynasty depiction (in cave 302) is of particular interest, since its depiction of the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> is not only more accurate (the same seen even in north and northwest China today), but it is used for a camel, not a horse. The Chinese had used camels often from the 2nd century BC onwards during the Han Dynasty, and {{there was even a}} Camel Corps serving the military on the frontier of the Tarim Basin. However, the adapted <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> for camels would not have been common until the 6th century. In cave 156, there is a panorama painting of the Tang Dynasty Chinese general and provincial governor Zhang Yichao riding triumphantly after the recapture and conquest of the Dunhuang region from the Tibetan Empire in 834 AD. According to evidence provided by Dr. Chang Shuhong, the date of the painting is precisely 851 AD, yet Needham points out that there is universal consensus amongst historians that it was painted anytime between roughly 840 to 860 AD. This latter painting accurately depicts the <b>horse</b> <b>collar,</b> with a well-padded collar coming low on the chest and rising behind the cross-bar.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of the {{specific}} date of domestication, use of horses spread rapidly across Eurasia for transportation, agricultural work and warfare. Horses and mules in agriculture used a breastplate type harness or a yoke more suitable for oxen, which was not as efficient at utilizing the full strength of the animals as the later-invented padded <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> that arose several millennia later.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> removed the previous physical restrictions the old harness had on the animal, and allowed the horse {{to be able to}} exert its full strength in plowing. Originally, the structure of the old harness forced the horse to literally pull its workload, the horse collar’s development instead allowed the horse to push its workload, increasing the efficiency of its labor output.|$|E
25|$|The <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> {{was very}} {{important}} to the development of many areas of the world. Wherever oxen were used and could be replaced with horses, the use of horses boosted economies, and reduced reliance on subsistence farming. This allowed people more free time to take on specialized activities, and consequently to the development of early industry, education, and the arts in the rise of market-based towns.|$|E

5000|$|In 1903, Edward McClain of the American Textile Company bought 600 {{acres of}} land north of Cartersville to {{construct}} a textile plant to manufacture <b>horse</b> <b>collars.</b> The plant was completed in 1904. In addition to building the plant, the American Textile Company also constructed about 40 homes for its workers. It was from the American Textile Company where Atco got its name. A post office called Atco was established in 1907, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1965.|$|R
25|$|Technological {{advances}} in soil preparation and seed placement at planting time, use of crop rotation and fertilizers to improve plant growth, and {{advances in}} harvesting methods have all combined to promote wheat {{as a viable}} crop. Agricultural cultivation using <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> leveraged plows (at about 3000BCE) {{was one of the}} first innovations that increased productivity. Much later, when the use of seed drills replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th century, another great increase in productivity occurred.|$|E
25|$|Innovations {{continued}} through the Middle Ages with innovations such as silk, the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> and horseshoes {{in the first few}} hundred years {{after the fall of the}} Roman Empire. Medieval technology saw the use of simple machines (such as the lever, the screw, and the pulley) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the wheelbarrow, windmills and clocks. The Renaissance brought forth many of these innovations, including the printing press (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with science, beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.|$|E
500|$|Significant {{technological}} advances in equestrian equipment, often introduced from other cultures, allowed for {{significant changes in}} both warfare and agriculture.

50|$|The three {{field system}} {{required}} more plowing {{of land and}} its introduction coincided with {{the adoption of the}} moldboard plow. These parallel developments worked hand in hand to increase the productivity of the land. The legume crop needed summer rain to succeed, and so the three-field system was less successful around the Mediterranean. Oats for horse food could also be planted in the spring, which, combined with the adoption of <b>horse</b> <b>collars</b> and horseshoes, led to the replacement of oxen by horses for many farming tasks, with a concomitant increase in agricultural productivity and the nutrition available to the population.|$|R

Allen lost everything. But, thanks to his established business track record, a local bank loaned him the money he needed to re-establish and rebuild his business. It didn't take Bonaparte long to restore his thriving business and pay off all of his debt.|$|R
500|$|A {{significant}} development {{which increased}} {{the importance and}} use of horses in harness, particularly for ploughing and other farm work, was the <b>horse</b> <b>collar.</b> The <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> was invented in China during the 5th century, arrived in Europe during the 9th century, [...] and became widespread throughout Europe by the 12th century. It allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle by means of yokes or breastcollars used in earlier times. The yoke was designed for oxen and not suited to the anatomy of horses, it required horses to pull with their shoulders rather than using {{the power of their}} hindquarters. Harnessed in such a manner, horse teams could pull no more than 500kg. [...] The breastplate-style harness that had flat straps across the neck and chest of the animal, while useful for pulling light vehicles, was of little use for heavy work. [...] These straps pressed against the horse's sterno-cephalicus muscle and trachea, which restricted breathing and reduced the pulling power of the horse. Two horses harnessed with a breastcollar harness were limited to pulling a combined total of about [...] [...] In contrast, the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> rested on horses' shoulders and did not impede breathing. It allowed a horse to use its full strength, by pushing forward with its hindquarters into the collar rather than to pull with its shoulders. [...] With the <b>horse</b> <b>collar,</b> a horse could provide a work effort of 50% more foot-pounds per second than an ox, because it could move at a greater speed, as well as having generally greater endurance and the ability to work more hours in a day. A single horse with a more efficient collar harness could draw a weight of about [...]|$|E

500|$|Horse harness, ("trace" [...] or [...] "breast"): Throughout {{the ancient}} world, the 'throat-and-girth' harness {{was used for}} {{harnessing}} horses that pulled carts; this greatly limited a horse's ability to exert itself as it was constantly choked at the neck. A painting on a lacquerware box from the State of Chu, dated to the 4th century BC, shows the first known use of a yoke placed across a horses's chest, with traces connecting to the chariot shaft. The hard yoke across the horse's chest was gradually replaced by a breast strap, which was often depicted in carved reliefs and stamped bricks of tombs from the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Eventually, the <b>horse</b> <b>collar</b> was invented in China, at least by the 5th century.|$|E
50|$|Crotal bells, {{also known}} as rumble bells, were used on horse-drawn {{vehicles}} before motorised vehicles were common. They were often made of bronze with a slot cut down the side. These bells were used to warn other horse-drawn vehicle users (mostly on country roads) that another vehicle was approaching. They came in many sizes, from a small 1-inch version to bells that were many inches across - the older ones were forged while others were cast. They were either hung on a small leather-and-iron harness bracket above the <b>horse's</b> <b>collar</b> on smaller vehicles. On larger vehicles, such as delivery wagons, they were driven into the wooden frame of the wagon.|$|R
500|$|According to ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna's estimations, {{calculated}} from measurements of <b>horse</b> <b>collars</b> used in Finland {{in the early}} 18thcentury, the average peasant's horse was about [...] tall, while some horses employed by manors were larger, sometimes more than [...] tall. Vilkuna also discovered that the horses of the southern and western regions of Finland were larger {{than those of the}} northern and eastern regions. This was probably due to the influence of imported horses.

The Navy officers insisted that MacKinnie and Graham, at least, be visibly punished, while the Imperial political representatives wanted to give Makassar a chance to continue to develop independently. Using the pretext of Graham's illegal introduction of new technology - wooden <b>horse</b> <b>collars</b> - on Makassar, the political representatives offered MacKinnie and Graham exile on Makassar as punishment (while reminding them that Dougal was likely to execute them due to their fame), and they accepted.|$|R
