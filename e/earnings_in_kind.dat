40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{decision}} by top-level executives of more than 1, 200 public corporations to exercise large stock option awards in the period 1992 - 2001. We hypothesize and find that abnormally large option exercises predict stock return future performance. We then hypothesize that this predictive ability represents private information about disappointing <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> the post-exercise period. Consistent with this hypothesis we find that abnormally positive <b>earnings</b> performance <b>in</b> the pre-exercise period turns to disappointing <b>earnings</b> performance <b>in</b> the post-exercise period, and that this pattern comes {{as a surprise to}} even sophisticated market participants (financial analysts). We also hypothesize and find that the disappointing <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> the post-exercise period represent a reversal of inflated <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> the pre-exercise period. Collectively, these findings suggest that the private information used by top-level executives to time abnormally large exercises follows from earnings management so as to increase the cash payout of exercises. ...|$|R

Furthermore, we observe that increased trade openness impact positively and significantly on the probability of unemployment of the treated group. Finally, we observe a positive effect on monthly <b>earnings</b> (<b>in</b> monetary terms plus <b>in</b> <b>kind)</b> and increases for our three measures of wage dispersion tried.|$|R
