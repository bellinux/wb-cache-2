Four days hence, in Finsbury Fields, our <b>good</b> <b>King</b> <b>Henry,</b> of great renown, holdeth a grand shooting match, and all the most famous archers of merry England will be thereat. Our Queen would fain see thee strive with these, knowing that if thou wilt come thou wilt, with little doubt, carry off the prize. Therefore she hath sent me with this greeting, and furthermore sends thee, {{as a sign of}} great good will, this golden ring from off her own fair thumb, which I give herewith into thy hands." ...|$|E
