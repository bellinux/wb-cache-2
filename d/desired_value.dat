5|$|The {{iterative}} algorithms were independently {{published in}} 1975–1976 by American physicist Eugene Salamin and Australian scientist Richard Brent. These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the <b>desired</b> <b>value.</b> The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, {{in what is}} now termed the arithmetic–geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss–Legendre algorithm. As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{glitches}} {{will actually}} occur {{depends on the}} physical nature of the implementation, and whether we {{need to worry about}} it depends on the application. In clocked logic, it is enough that the logic settles on the <b>desired</b> <b>value</b> in time to meet the timing deadline. In our example, we are not considering clocked logic.|$|E
25|$|Two basic {{requirements}} are regulation (disturbance rejection – {{staying at a}} given setpoint) and command tracking (implementing setpoint changes) – these refer to how well the controlled variable tracks the <b>desired</b> <b>value.</b> Specific criteria for command tracking include rise time and settling time. Some processes must not allow an overshoot of the process variable beyond the setpoint if, for example, this would be unsafe. Other processes must minimize the energy expended in reaching a new setpoint.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{measurement}} goes as follows. First, {{a sample of}} the substance is cooled to absolute zero. At this temperature, the entropy is zero by definition. Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a <b>desired</b> <b>value</b> (usually 25°C). The obtained data allows to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature. This value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.|$|E

25|$|Chemical buffer stabilizes the pH {{value to}} the <b>desired</b> <b>value</b> within the gel itself and in the {{electrophoresis}} buffer. The choice of buffer also affects the electrophoretic mobility of the buffer counterions and thereby {{the resolution of the}} gel. The buffer should also be unreactive and not modify or react with most proteins. Different buffers may be used as cathode and anode buffers, respectively, depending on the application. Multiple pH values may be used within a single gel, for example in DISC electrophoresis. Common buffers in PAGE include Tris, Bis-Tris, or imidazole.|$|E
25|$|Explicit {{numerical}} integration {{over the}} ordered pairs can yield the Fourier transform output value for any <b>desired</b> <b>value</b> of the conjugate Fourier transform variable (frequency, for example), {{so that a}} spectrum can be produced at any desired step size and over any desired variable range for accurate determination of amplitudes, frequencies, and phases corresponding to isolated peaks. Unlike limitations in DFT and FFT methods, explicit numerical integration can have any desired step size and compute the Fourier transform over any desired range of the congugate Fourier transform variable (for example, frequency).|$|E
25|$|In {{engineering}} and economics, many problems involve multiple objectives {{which are not}} describable as the-more-the-better or the-less-the-better; instead, there is an ideal target value for each objective, and the desire is to get {{as close as possible}} to the <b>desired</b> <b>value</b> of each objective. For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct open market operations so that both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are {{as close as possible to}} their desired values.|$|E

25|$|By finding many {{intervals}} {{where the}} function Z changes sign one {{can show that}} there are many zeros on the critical line. To verify the Riemann hypothesis up to a given imaginary part T of the zeros, one also has to check that there are no further zeros off the line in this region. This can be done by calculating the total number of zeros in the region and checking that it {{is the same as the}} number of zeros found on the line. This allows one to verify the Riemann hypothesis computationally up to any <b>desired</b> <b>value</b> of T (provided all the zeros of the zeta function in this region are simple and on the critical line).|$|E
25|$|Regulators powered from AC power {{circuits}} can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as {{the series}} device. Whenever the output voltage {{is below the}} <b>desired</b> <b>value,</b> the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the AC mains voltage passes through zero (ending the half cycle). SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but {{because they can not}} terminate an ongoing half cycle of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate voltage regulation in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger, both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance.|$|E
