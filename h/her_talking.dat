Before taking Barrigas's call, Forsyth had called into the show and was placed on hold by one of the show's producers, only to have Stern take the call and unable to get Forsyth's attention.|$|E

40|$|After <b>her</b> <b>talk</b> at UCLA on February 10, Professor Lata Mani graciously {{extended}} {{her time and}} critical thinking to this interview and helped frame it as a conversation, rather than a didactic exposition of her work. I am grateful for both. As a continuation of <b>her</b> <b>talk,</b> this interchange refers to the problems she raised in it, but I hope {{it will also be}} accessible to those who were not present. In <b>her</b> <b>talk,</b> she discussed varied topics, from Taylorism as an industrial process to the possibly productive relationship between secular academic discourse and sacred knowledge...|$|R

500|$|Several reviews {{criticized the}} {{decision}} to film Erin {{in front of a}} green screen for one of <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> heads. White attributed the [...] "terrible green-screen effect" [...] among other things, to Wilson's [...] "offbeat sense of humor and style." [...] McNutt proposed that the reason for the [...] "obnoxious" [...] effect was because the show had lost that lawn set but wanted to add an additional talking head scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included four cut scenes from [...] "Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager" [...] {{within a week}} of the episode's release. In the first, 66-second clip, Dwight shows the documentary crew his new office apparel including his desk modeled after Uday Hussein's desk. In the second, 77-second clip, Jim pranks Dwight by putting fake results from Jordan's surveillance of the office. Later in <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> head, it is hinted that Jordan has a crush on Jim. In the third, 86-second clip, the staff realize they are stuck with Dwight as their boss as Phylis attempts to remember a movie. In the fourth, 49-second clip, [...] Gabe attempts to get Erin back by using her love of Pixar films, but ultimately fails.|$|E
500|$|Love {{has been}} {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} across various mediums: Artist Barbara Kruger used one of Love's quotes on her New York City bus project, and the indie pop punk band The Muffs named their second album Blonder and Blonder (1995) after a quote by Love, while a recording of <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> about a stolen dress appears as the track [...] "Love" [...] on the band's 2000 compilation album Hamburger. She was also {{the basis of the}} character [...] "Courtney" [...] in Michael Hornburg's 1995 novel Bongwater; the novel, set in Portland, Oregon, is based on Hornburg's teenage years living there, where he had known her. The novel was adapted as the 1998 film Bongwater, in which the character was renamed [...] "Serena", played by Alicia Witt.|$|E

500|$|... "The One {{with the}} Embryos" [...] was Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc's {{favorite}} {{episode of the}} series. Cox liked the episode because she enjoys playing Monica at her most competitive, while LeBlanc spoke fondly of {{the pace of the}} episode and the information about the characters that came out. He identified scenes that featured just the six core cast as the best, [...] "because you don't have to introduce a character–you don't have to lay any pipeline–you just get right to the funny". On the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Marta Kauffman cited the episode being [...] "so much fun to do" [...] and enjoyed the writing process. The scene involving Phoebe talking to the embryos was Kevin S. Bright's favorite in the show's history because of Kudrow's ability to [...] "draw you into the scene ... even though it's only <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> to the dish". David Crane highlights how the episode explores generosity; doing a selfless act which pays off when Phoebe [...] gives birth in [...] "The One Hundredth". Bright moreover felt the trivia contest was the catalyst that rejuvenated the entire fourth season and [...] "put Friends in a different place".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> head.|$|E
2500|$|Begun in March and {{completed}} {{at the end}} of July 1950, The Horse and His Boy was published on 6 September 1954. The story takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. A young boy named Shasta and a talking horse named Bree, both of whom are in bondage in the country of Calormen, are the protagonists. By [...] "chance", they meet and plan their return to Narnia and freedom. Along the way they meet Aravis and <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> horse Hwin who are also fleeing to Narnia.|$|E

2500|$|Temple got her {{start in}} foreign service after her failed run for Congress in 1967 when Henry Kissinger overheard <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> about South West Africa at a party. [...] He was {{surprised}} that she knew anything about it. She was appointed as a delegate to the 24th United Nations General Assembly by President Richard M. Nixon (September – December 1969) and United States Ambassador to Ghana (December 6, 1974 – July 13, 1976) by President Gerald R. Ford. She was appointed first female Chief of Protocol of the United States (July 1, 1976 – January 21, 1977) and in charge of arrangements for President Jimmy Carter's inauguration and inaugural ball.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{theory is}} that Joan is {{actually}} a comic figure, and the huge alterations in her character are supposed to evoke laughter. Michael Taylor, for example, argues, [...] "A fiendish provenance replaces a divine one in , a scene that reduces Joan to a comic, bathetic dependency on shifty representatives of the underworld." [...] In line with this thinking, it is worth pointing {{out that in the}} 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation, Joan, and the French in general, are treated predominantly as comic figures. Joan (Brenda Blethyn), Alençon (Michael Byrne), the Bastard (Brian Protheroe), Reignier (David Daker) and Charles (Ian Saynor) are treated as buffoons for the most part, and there is no indication of any malevolence (significantly, when Joan’s fiends abandon her, we never see them, we simply see <b>her</b> <b>talking</b> to empty air). Examples of the comic treatment of the characters are found during the battle of Orléans, where Joan is ludicrously depicted as defending the city from the entire English army single-handed, whilst Talbot stands by incredulously watching his soldiers flee one after another. Another example appears in Act 2, Scene 1, as the five of them blame one another for the breach in the watch at Orléans that allowed the English back into the city. Their role as comic figures is also shown in Act 3, Scene 2. After Joan has entered Rouen and the others stand outside waiting for her signal. Charles is shown sneaking through a field holding a helmet with a large plume up {{in front of his face}} in an effort to hide.|$|E
