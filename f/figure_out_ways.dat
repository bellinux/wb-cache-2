She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>ways</b> to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1903 and 1913, {{the entire}} {{building}} was torn down in phases {{and replaced by}} the current Grand Central Terminal.

Wilgus started to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>ways</b> to build the new terminal efficiently. His solution was to demolish the old Grand Central Station and build the new terminal in sections, while some station operations were shifted to the Grand Central Palace Hotel for a while. This doubled the cost of construction, but obviated the need to suspend all rail service for the duration of construction.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the Cold War, {{many of the}} {{targeted}} countries' governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People's Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions , but People's Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. Chinese language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976. However, {{after the collapse of}} the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies. The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts. Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal. David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: [...] "The North Korean government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse.
