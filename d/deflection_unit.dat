40|$|This {{investigation}} {{considers the}} design methodologies {{associated with the}} development and optimization of a magnetic deflection system for Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Display Systems. The development of a magnetic deflection system and the calculations necessary to determine the associated performance are both complex tasks. Their complexity arises from the detailed geometry involved in <b>deflection</b> <b>unit</b> designs, {{the wide range of}} product types and sizes, and variability in product performance specifications. The large variations of these issues compound the difficulty in realising an acceptable product design. Software simulation techniques which are able to accurately manipulate data and perform iterative calculations greatly aid this process. This work introduces a simulation technique used within the Philips organisation, called DUCAD (<b>Deflection</b> <b>Unit</b> Computer Aided Design), which is used to analytically and numerically model the deflection system, with the objective of assessing and speedily realising a design. The simulation technique allows magnetic deflection product designs to be synthesized by simulating the magnetic field generated by the deflection system. Approximate solutions can be iteratively investigated leading to a greater understanding of the problem domain. To gain a degree of confidence with the simulation results the software design proposal is thereafter replicated in hardware allowing a full validation of the DUCAD. Extensive simulation studies and practical prototyping experiments are presented to support the theoretical development. Comparing the calculated theoretical performance and the actual measured values, conclusions are drawn as {{to the quality of the}} simulation tool in deriving the intrinsic magnetic deflection characteristics of the generated product design.

The transducer consists of split ring resonators loaded with micro-bimorph cantilevers, which can potentially operate up to millimeter-wave frequencies (above 30 GHz).

A design is proposed, that has a maximum sensitivity of 2. 62 GHz/µm, in terms of frequency shift per <b>deflection</b> <b>unit,</b> corresponding to a sensitivity of 498 MHz/°C for an operating frequency around 30 GHz, i. e. a frequency shift of 1. 6 % per °C.

40|$|For volume {{reflection}} {{process in}} a bent crystal, exact analytic expressions for positively- and negatively-charged particle trajectories are obtained within a model of parabolic continuous potential in each interplanar interval, with the neglect of incoherent multiple scattering. In the limit of the crystal bending radius greatly exceeding the critical value, asymptotic formulas are obtained for the particle mean <b>deflection</b> angle in <b>units</b> of Lindhard's critical angle, and for the final beam profile. Volume reflection of negatively charged particles is shown to contain effects of rainbow scattering and orbiting, whereas with positively charged particles none of these effects arise within the given model. The model predictions are compared with experimental results and numerical simulations. Estimates of the volume reflection mean angle and the final beam profile robustness under multiple scattering are performed. Comment: 21 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
