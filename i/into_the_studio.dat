5|$|After {{the success}} of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album. By then, the band had created a large fan base, and the {{expectations}} for their follow-up album were high. They went back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.|$|E
5|$|After {{the tour}} concluded, the duo went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> {{to work on}} {{what was to be}} a reunion album. However, after {{increasingly}} acrimonious disagreements, Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which became Simon's 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.|$|E
5|$|The band {{did a lot}} of experimenting and {{arranging}} in Cardiff before going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> as a result of which Love Kraft was recorded in just three weeks. Drummer Dafydd Ieuan also attributes the album sessions' speedy conclusion to producer Mario Caldato Jr. who was very good at keeping the group together and on the right track.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Disney began reissuing the {{previous}} features, beginning with re-releases of Snow White in 1944, Pinocchio in 1945, and Fantasia in 1946.

5|$|No Code is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on August 27, 1996 through Epic Records. Following a troubled tour for its previous album, Vitalogy (1994), in which Pearl Jam engaged in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, the band went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> to record its follow-up. The music on the record was more diverse than what the band had done on previous releases, incorporating elements of garage rock and worldbeat.|$|E
5|$|Vs. is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Pearl Jam, {{released}} on October 19, 1993 through Epic Records. After a relentless touring schedule in support of their 1991 debut album Ten, Pearl Jam headed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. The resulting album, Vs., featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer Brendan O'Brien, and their first album with drummer Dave Abbruzzese.|$|E

5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
50|$|Smear's non-ownership of an {{amplifier}} at {{the time}} actually led to the unique guitar sound on the record. Geza X was supposed to lend him one for the recording sessions, but had forgotten; instead he strung together some effect pedals and Smear plugged directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio's</b> mixing board.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{originally}} {{divided into three}} separate legal entities; Secret Level Games, Secret Level Tools, and Secret Level Technology.

5000|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that Johnny Cashâ€™s voice does not seem to appear on any of the released tracks. Since his voice is not obvious on the tracks, the point at which Cash arrived at <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> has been a matter of discussion. Carl Perkins and others [...] have stated that Cash was already at <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> when Presley arrived, with Perkins adding that Cash had stopped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> to [...] "get some money".|$|R
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The episode guest stars Christina Ricci, who recorded her lines over the phone instead of going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> The beach house the Simpson family stays in is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire. The episode features cultural references to Pippi Longstocking, The New Yorker character Eustace Tilley, and Alice and The Hatter from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 8.8, and was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} set of The Queen Victoria pub {{was taken}} apart and rebuilt exactly to scale on the George Lucas Stage, a fire stage at Elstree Film Studios, for interior scenes, filmed over four days. The interior set took seven weeks {{to build and}} two weeks to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> Controlled gas pipes were used to shoot jets of flames and a header was specially built to collapse on Phil. Salisbury had {{to ensure that the}} fire for the interior scenes matched that of the already-filmed exterior scenes. Producers decided to extend the 10 September episode featuring Peggy's departure by ten minutes, meaning it would clash with rival soap opera Coronation Street.|$|E

50|$|The 1A2 {{system is}} {{uncommon}} today, but some very large installations {{are still in}} use {{because of the high}} cost of replacing them. 1A2 systems are also still popular at radio stations.

5|$|With Shannon Larkin (ex Ugly Kid Joe, Souls at Zero, Wrathchild America, MF Pitbulls) {{replacing}} Tommy Stewart, {{who left}} due to personal differences {{for the second}} time, Godsmack went back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> to record a new album that was released in 2003. Faceless debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200, selling 269,000 copies in its first week, and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States. Faceless managed to beat West Coast nu metal band Linkin Park, with the release of their second studio album Meteora, which dropped to number two on the Billboard 200. Faceless also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks. A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{revealed}} that Bieber and Flatts would be shooting a video for the remix {{version of the}} song when TMZ revealed photos on Bieber on set of the video shoot. The photos pictured Bieber after a dramatic haircut, changing his trademark style over the previous two years. The video premiered during the ABC special, Rascal Flatts: Nothing Like This Presented by JC Penney, which aired March 12, 2011. The video begins with Rascal Flatts arriving in a Cadillac Escalade to a studio. Inside, they are directed to Bieber, who is playing the keyboard. Bieber then sings his lines, playing guitar, and is joined by Joe Don Rooney also on guitar, and Jay DeMarcus now on keyboard. The woman who directed the band <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> now directs them and Bieber into another room with lights, to film the video. Gary LeVox then sings his lines, joined by Bieber for the chorus while Rooney is on guitar and DeMarcus playing a grand piano. All are wearing black, with Bieber in particular wearing a leather jacket, his signature dog tag, and grey Supras sneakers. During the sequence of the video, more behind-the-scenes action is shown, before it ends with only Bieber's silhouette shown, as his jacket is on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam {{was formed}} in 1990 by bassist Jeff Ament, guitarist Stone Gossard, and guitarist Mike McCready, who then {{recruited}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band signed to Epic Records in 1991. A {{few months after the}} completion of the band's debut studio album, Ten, drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band. Ten broke Pearl Jam into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s. Following an intense touring schedule, the band went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> to record what would become its second studio album, Vs. Upon its release, Vs. set the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks {{at the top of the}} Billboard 200. Burdened by the pressures of success, Pearl Jam decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. In 1994, the band released its third studio album, Vitalogy, which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status.|$|E

5|$|Wendy Oxenhorn, {{director}} of the Foundation, arranged for housekeeping and free medical care for Norman, as well as helping him plan for his future, providing back rent and negotiating with Norman's landlord. In {{the course of that}} housekeeping, in July 2002, Norman's rare tape of his jam session with Marley was located in his apartment and placed on auction, retrieving considerably above its estimated value when auctioned at $26,290. During the same housekeeping session, Norman rediscovered old notebooks containing his compositions. Producer Kerryn Tolhurst recorded Norman performing the songs on a tape recorder in his apartment, taking the tapes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> later to add parts by other musicians. Judy Collins, whose drummer Tony Beard contributed to the project, released the resultant album under her own Wildflower label in 2004. The project, titled Little Pieces, is the first album Norman has ever released with wide distribution. In 2006, Little Pieces won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.|$|E
