This paper discusses the feasibility analysis of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>system</b> at Kallar Kahar Pakistan. The feasibility study mainly focuses on the technical and economic analysis of the components of <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>system</b> for the selected site. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>system</b> is based on the wind and photovoltaic technology with storage batteries. The site has an average wind speed of 7. 11 m/s and solar irradiance of 5. 02 kWh/m 2 and is suitable for wind and photovoltaic <b>power</b> generation <b>systems.</b> The system is designed for single house initially which can be expanded further for the whole village. The total electrical power demand of single home is 1 kW so properly sized components will be selected to meet the required power demand of single house. This paper also discusses the importance of diesel generation as backup source. The HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable) software developed by National Renewable Electric laboratory USA will be used to study the feasibility analysis of <b>hybrid</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>system.</b> The Pre-feasibility study of stand-alone hybrid energy systems for applications in Newfoundland is carried out by [5].
