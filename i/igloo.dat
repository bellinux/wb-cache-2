5|$|With the {{conclusion}} of aerial operations around Khe Sanh and the close out of the Marine base, the focus of <b>Igloo</b> White (as the operation was redesignated in June) turned once again to Laos. On 15 November 1968, the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force had inaugurated Operation Commando Hunt, a series of continuous interdiction operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail that would continue {{until the end of}} American participation in the war. For the next four years <b>Igloo</b> White and Commando Hunt would be interlinked in the anti-infiltration effort.|$|E
5|$|Costing between $1 and $1.7billion {{to design}} and build (and another billion dollars per year to operate over the five-year life of the operation) and {{possessing}} and controlling {{some of the most}} sophisticated technology in the Southeast Asia theater, <b>Igloo</b> White still remains in question as to its effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, a site {{on nearby}} Kerry Road {{was chosen for}} the {{erection}} of 5 large span nailed timber arch <b>igloos.</b> The five Kerry Road <b>igloos</b> were constructed on this site by the Allied Works Council for the Department of Aircraft Production in 1943-44. The <b>igloos</b> were situated near the Archerfield Aerodrome but separated by Beatty Road. A taxiway between the aerodrome and the <b>igloos</b> allowed the structures {{to be used for}} the servicing and repair of military aircraft. Four of these <b>igloos</b> were used as hangars and the fifth as a store.|$|R

50|$|The site {{comprises}} four timber framed <b>igloos</b> with {{corrugated iron}} and ribbed metal sheet cladding. Numbered {{from the eastern}} end of the site, the <b>igloos</b> are identified by a number from 1 to 4. The site fronts Kerry Road to the north, with a recreation reserve to the south fronting Mortimer Road.|$|R
5|$|<b>Igloo</b> White {{was rushed}} into service during the Battle of Khe Sanh and {{successfully}} passed its first operational test. Combined with Operation Commando Hunt in 1969, the system {{served as the}} keystone of the U.S. aerial interdiction effort of the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction campaigns {{were also}} expensive. <b>Igloo</b> White cost around one billion dollars {{per year to}} operate. The cost of the bombing {{operations}} that the sensors supported amounted to approximately 18.2million dollars per week. Those costs {{did not include the}} hundreds of aircraft lost during the interdiction campaigns or the priceless crews that manned them.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the history}} of Canada, {{heraldry}} in the country has incorporated aboriginal and First Nations symbols and elements. The Coat of Arms of Nunavut, for example, includes elements such as an inukshuk, a qulliq, and an <b>igloo,</b> all of which are references to the Inuit peoples who live in the area, while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include ravens, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut.|$|E
25|$|Constructed on site, {{the main}} {{parabolic}} frames of St Paul's Church were of laminated timber, {{with the exception}} of the front frame which was made of pre-cast concrete. The first two laminated arches constructed were used as the basis for the formwork of the front concrete arch. The unusual form of the nave with its exposed internal structure led to it being compared to World War II <b>igloos.</b> With their large curved trusses made from small pieces of timber, <b>igloos</b> were a familiar building type to Oribin who had worked in the Allison Overhaul Assembly Plant <b>igloos</b> at Albion during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>igloos</b> were {{designed}} to have the half arches raised by ropes and pulleys before being pinned together at the centre. The <b>igloos</b> at Archerfield were one of several designs for lightweight long span structures which utilised timber in small sectional sizes of chords to enable the lattice trusses to be hand nailed in jigs on site and speedily erected at low cost. As previously stated, it has been noted {{in a study of}} prefabricated Second World War structures that the Archerfield Second World War <b>Igloos</b> are among [...] "the longest clear span buildings existing in Australia".|$|R

5|$|On 8 September 1967, the {{electronic}} portion of Dyemarker was divided and the aerial, sensor-based portion was designated Muscle Shoals. On 1 June 1968, the aerial portion was redesignated <b>Igloo</b> White. That name {{became the most}} associated with the program though various elements received a number of separate codenames. All resources for Dyemarker/Muscle Shoals were redesignated Duck Blind in April 1968, and in June 1968 Muscle Shoals outright became Duel Blade. In October 1968 Duck Blind was changed to Duffel Bag.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} barrier {{was to be}} backed up by air-dropped and hand-emplaced acoustic and seismic sensors that would provide both warning and location of enemy movements. A scientific group was established to find or develop the technology for what was initially titled Practice Nine. On 17 June 1967 {{the title of the}} program was altered to Illinois City and on 15 July to Dyemarker, the electronic barrier portion of which was designated Muscle Shoals. In June 1968 it was renamed for the last time, becoming Operation <b>Igloo</b> White.|$|E
5|$|Operation <b>Igloo</b> White was {{a covert}} United States joint {{military}} electronic warfare operation conducted from late January 1968 until February 1973, during the Vietnam War. These missions {{were carried out}} by the 553d Reconnaissance Wing, a U.S. Air Force unit flying modified EC-121R Warning Star aircraft, and VO-67, a specialized U.S. Navy unit flying highly modified OP-2E Neptune aircraft. This state-of-the-art operation utilized electronic sensors, computers, and communications relay aircraft in an attempt to automate intelligence collection. The system would then assist in the direction of strike aircraft to their targets. The objective of those attacks was the logistical system of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) that snaked through southeastern Laos and was known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail (the Truong Son Road to the North Vietnamese).|$|E

5|$|Stromberg demanded {{complete}} authenticity in casting, language, and {{the depiction}} of Eskimo life. Casting was critical. Van Dyke cast Inupiat natives (most of them from Barrow, Alaska) for all the minor roles, but Stromberg was so insistent on finding the perfect male lead that casting the title role of Mala/Kripik proved difficult. MGM wanted Ray Wise, the actor and cameraman (who later {{changed his name to}} Ray Mala), as the star of the picture, and he would become Alaska's first movie star. Wise was a half-Inupiat, half-Russian Jew who previously starred in the 1932 documentary film <b>Igloo.</b> Van Dyke wanted an all-native cast, not a half-native lead, and rejected Wise. A young native Alaskan was hired for the role, but he walked off the set in July 1932 when the stress of filming proved too great. Already on location in Alaska and isolated from the studio, Van Dyke turned to Ray Wise. Not only could Wise perform his own stunts, but Stromberg praised him as an immensely realistic actor. Wise came to Hollywood in 1925, and in addition to his work on <b>Igloo</b> was working as an assistant cameraman. He was hired as a guide for Eskimo's production to Alaska, and was able to offer his services to the film when the original actor quit. Although the film's credits state that professional actors were used only for the Canadian police roles, in fact the major female roles were played by professional actresses Lotus Long and Lulu Wong Ying. Numerous minor roles are also clearly filled by trained actors in make-up and costume.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of <b>Igloo</b> White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. Armed {{reconnaissance}} – the patrolling of known segments of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That {{is not to say}} the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force was not about to surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an <b>igloo,</b> may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E

25|$|In October 1942, Manuel Richard Hornibrook was {{commissioned}} by the US Army to erect four large stores at Eagle Farm, most likely hangars 4,5,6 and 7 of an <b>igloo</b> design. The <b>igloo</b> {{is a form of}} light nailed timber arch construction. These hangars were built fronting the straight six section, as a ready made apron, with hangar 7 built for the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU) located separately {{at the end of the}} straight. These hangars were based on the US Army 104ft span timber box frame design and were clad with galvanised iron, but when that material was restricted, terne-coated iron was used, a lead-tin coating usually used for fuel tank manufacture. There were various <b>igloo</b> designs, but the AWC designs were considered to be far more rugged than US designs, and were designed to have a reasonably long life under winds of up to 65 miles per hour, and used standard grade Group C hardwood timber.|$|E
