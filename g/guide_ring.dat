50|$|Owing to {{its ability}} to realise high purity results, orbital welding found {{its place in the}} {{production}} of clean-room components for the semiconductor industry. Its application has now expanded to the construction of pipework and equipment for diverse industries like food processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, automotive engineering, biotechnology, shipbuilding and aerospace. Automated orbital TIG welding is also used in the construction of power stations, (thermal power plants). The construction materials used must be able to withstand the enormous mechanical loads produced by the high pressures and temperatures created by the media carried in the tubes. Notches, pores and inclusions in the weld seams must be avoided at all costs, as these create weak points that can lead to subsequent formation of cracks. These in turn can have serious consequences in terms of component failure. This means that tubes are often made from nickel-based materials with walls up to 200mm thick. One manufacturer has developed an orbital narrow gap welding system with hot-wire feed specifically for this purpose, which uses running gear that moves on a <b>guide</b> <b>ring</b> fixed around the tube. This new variant has created {{a lot of interest in}} the sector, with the worldwide boom in power station construction fueling the never-ending search for increasingly productive manufacturing methods using new types of high-temperature steels.|$|E

Velocity distributions at different areas of the reactor as well as mixing characteristics of fuel and graphite pebbles were investigated.

40|$|Lecturepg. 11 In 1991, {{four large}} double suction cooling pumps were {{installed}} at a chemical plant in Texas. Although these pumps met performance specifications {{on the test}} stand, they proved to be noisy when installed. Sound power levels greater than 93 dbA were observed. Pumping applications involving cooling water have been especially difficult to solve over the tears, due {{to the presence of}} dissolved air inherent in a cooling tower sump. Water that contains large amounts of dissolved air changes the apparent required net positive suction head (NPSH). In such applications, traditional correction techniques failed because the entire system was not analyzed, and the source of the noise generation could not be pinpointed. This paper deals with the steps involved with obtaining a solution to this problem. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on the pump and impeller. Initial investigation revealed that the impeller was not the source of the problem. The casing inlet was then analyzed. The model indicated the presence of separation in the suction nozzle, causing a flow distortion at the impeller eye. A unique <b>guide</b> <b>ring</b> was developed to minimize the flow separation.

40|$|A clutch {{actuator}} {{is used in}} a vehicle to transmit movement and force from the clutch pedal to the release bearing of the clutch. A pneumatic {{clutch actuator}} consists of an anodised aluminium cylinder, inside of which a piston, with a rubber lip seal and a PTFE <b>guiding</b> <b>ring,</b> slides. The system is lubricated with silicone grease before assembly. A commercial clutch actuator of this type, has a service life of 3 million actuations and must function in a wide temperature range, from - 40 ºC to 140 ºC. In this thesis, the complex tribological system of pneumatic clutch actuators has been studied. Field worn actuators have been disassembled and investigated. A laboratory test method has been developed to understand the tribomechanisms present in pneumatic clutch actuators. The test method's capability of simulating the real contact has been verified, by the comparison with studied actuators from the field. The influence of contact parameters: temperature, load, lubrication and particle contamination, has been investigated. In addition, different anodised aluminium surfaces have been studied. The manufacturing method of the aluminium cylinder influences surface topography {{and structure of the}} oxide, resulting in different mechanical and frictional properties. The wear during tests with only silicone grease is reminiscent, but on a lower scale, to the wear during tests with a mixture of silicone grease and standard dust. The initially applied amount of silicone grease is not important, the friction seems to depend on the amount of silicone grease that is dragged into or pushed out from the contact area during testing. Silicone grease lubrication reduces wear of the lip seal. However, during some tests, an adhesive layer, composed of  grease residuals and some PTFE, was formed on the lip. A triple PTFE transfer, from <b>guiding</b> <b>ring</b> to aluminium surface, to lip seal, to aluminium surface, occurred.

40|$|Circular overbraiding of {{composite}} preforms on complex mandrels currently lacks automatic {{generation of}} machine control data. To solve this limitation, an inverse kinematics-based procedure {{was designed and}} implemented for circular braiding machines with optional guide rings, resulting in a take-up speed profile for a given braid angle distribution on mandrels with complex 3 D shapes including non-axisymmetric, optionally eccentric cross-sections that can vary in shape and size along an optionally curved mandrel centerline, allowing a curved machine movement. This procedure reduces the problem size, resulting in a short computation time, fit for CAE process chain integration. Numerical control data was generated for a complex mandrel with a specified braid angle and a triaxial braid. A simulation using this control data yields a braid angle that deviates a few degrees from the specified braid angle. The simulation was validated experimentally, using the generated instructions to control the braiding machine. This showed a deviation from the simulated braid angle of 3 degrees in the centered, non-tapered mandrel regions, up to 10 degrees in tapered regions and an experimental scatter of 7 degrees.
