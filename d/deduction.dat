The FIGC ruled Juventus be stripped of their title, relegated to Serie B and start the following season with a nine-point <b>deduction.</b> The other clubs involved suffered similarly with relegation and points <b>deduction.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most personal, living, {{and family}} {{expenses}} are not deductible. However, see Personal <b>deductions,</b> below. Business <b>deductions</b> allowed for Federal income tax {{are almost always}} allowed in determining state income tax. Only some states, though, allow itemized <b>deductions</b> for individuals. Some states also limit <b>deductions</b> by corporations for investment related expenses. Many states allow different amounts for depreciation <b>deductions.</b> State limitations on <b>deductions</b> may differ significantly from Federal limitations.|$|R

5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax <b>deduction</b> and a robust state tax <b>deduction</b> in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|The two {{additional}} episodes, Turnabout Reclaimed and Quiz Turnabout <b>Deduction,</b> were made available as downloadable content {{shortly after the}} game's Japanese release. Turnabout Reclaimed was released in the West on November 21, 2013, but Quiz Turnabout <b>Deduction</b> remained exclusive to Japan due to its dependency on in-depth knowledge of Japanese culture. Downloadable costumes for Phoenix, Athena and Apollo were made available for download upon the game's release. These costumes were available for free until August 15, 2013 in Japan, and until November 7, 2013 for the English versions, after which they were available for purchase.|$|E

40|$|We {{find that}} {{employee}} stock option <b>deductions</b> lead to large aggregate tax savings for Nasdaq 100 and S&P 100 firms and also affect corporate marginal tax rates. For Nasdaq firms, the median marginal tax rate is 31 percent when option <b>deductions</b> are ignored but falls to 5 percent when one accounts for the <b>deductions.</b> For S&P firms, however, option <b>deductions</b> do not affect marginal tax rates to a large degree. In the spirit of DeAngelo and Masulis (1980), option <b>deductions</b> are important nondebt tax shields that can affect corporate policies. We find evidence consistent with option <b>deductions</b> substituting for interest <b>deductions</b> in corporate capital structure decisions. This evidence may explain in part why some firms use so little debt...|$|R

5|$|He {{made his}} initial fortune in real estate, taking {{advantage}} of the Frank Lyon Co. v.

5|$|The general {{principle}} behind {{the process of}} qiyas {{is based on the}} understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical <b>deduction</b> can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, this {{limitation}} on itemized <b>deductions</b> is applied after any other limitation. [...] This {{means that you}} first {{need to figure out}} the total allowable miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions,</b> etc., before determining any limits on the total amount of <b>deductions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before {{considering}} the payroll taxes, {{it is necessary}} to talk about the basic formula for the Net Pay. From gross pay (the salary paid to the employee) one or more <b>deductions</b> are subtracted, to arrive at Net Pay. Thus the employee's gross pay (pay rate times number of hours worked, including any overtime) minus payroll tax <b>deductions,</b> minus voluntary payroll <b>deductions,</b> is equal to Net Pay. Payroll tax <b>deductions</b> play a critical role and because they are provided by law they are known as Statutory payroll tax <b>deductions.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, {{suppose a}} {{taxpayer}} in Year One has an {{adjusted gross income}} of $100,000. Two percent of the adjusted gross income is $2,000. To be able to deduct miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions</b> in calculating taxable income, the taxpayer's miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions</b> must exceed $2,000. If the taxpayer has miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions</b> of $5,000, the taxpayer may deduct $3,000 ($5,000-$2,000=$3,000). If the taxpayer has miscellaneous itemized <b>deductions</b> of only $1,000, the taxpayer {{will not be able}} to deduct anything because their <b>deductions</b> do not exceed the $2,000 (2%) floor.|$|R
5|$|Ángel Román Martínez {{competed for}} Puerto Rico in taekwondo. Born in 1984, Román entered Beijing at age 24, {{competing}} in the men's welterweight class (which includes athletes under 80kilograms in weight). Román had not previously competed in any Olympic games or events. During {{the course of the}} competition's first round, which took place on August 22, Román faced Canada's Sébastien Michaud in the sixth match. The Puerto Rican judoka won a total of two deuk-jeom (points), with one in the first round and one in the third round, but lost a deuk-jeom to a <b>deduction.</b> His Canadian opponent scored a total of three deuk-jeom, but lost one to a <b>deduction.</b> Thus, as Michaud ended with a score higher than Román's score, Michaud won the round. Román did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first <b>deduction</b> {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E
5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point <b>deduction.</b> Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Reynolds {{was obliged}} to hand over control to the Sterling Consortium to bring the club out of administration, Stewart Davies taking over as chairman. He and his staff adopted a fan-friendly approach, in {{contrast}} to the abrasive Reynolds, before in 2006, the club was sold to property developer George Houghton. For four consecutive seasons, under Hodgson, sacked in 2006, and then under successor Dave Penney, the Quakers finished in {{the top half of the}} table, reaching the play-off semi-final in 2008 only to lose to Rochdale on penalties. In February 2009, Darlington again went into administration, triggering an automatic 10-point <b>deduction,</b> without which they would have again reached the play-offs. Fundraising efforts kept the club going, but when no buyer was found for the club by a May deadline, the administrators made the majority of the first-team squad available for transfer and cut staff numbers to a minimum. On 20 May, Houghton returned to the club as chairman, appointed former Middlesbrough boss Colin Todd as manager, and brokered an agreement which led to the club coming out of administration and ownership passing to local businessman Raj Singh and enabling it to compete in the 2009–10 season without any points <b>deduction.</b> Todd left the club after losing seven of his first nine games and was replaced by former Republic of Ireland manager Steve Staunton, who only won four of 23 league games.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the <b>deduction</b> of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{it may not}} be {{a logical}} <b>deduction,</b> but to my {{imagination}} it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers, —ants making slaves, —the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars, —not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement <b>deduction</b> on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal <b>deduction</b> according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
