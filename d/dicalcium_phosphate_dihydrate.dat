One hundred and ninety two day-old male broiler chicks (Hubbard) were distributed between 6 treatments with 4 replicates each. During the experimental period (1 - 42 days), the birds were fed 2 diets: "starter" (1 to 21 days) and "finisher" (22 to 42 days). Feed and water were supplied ad libitum. The phosphates were chemically analyzed for Ca, P, V, Cd, Al and F. FB had a higher P content than FA; and contained concentrations of the contaminants F, Cd, V and Al that were not detected in FA.

40|$|Two {{freeze dried}} pregelatinized Dioscorea {{starches}} {{have been evaluated}} as directly compressible excipients for sustained release using diclofenac sodium and caffeine as the model drugs. The tableting properties of the binary and ternary mixtures of the drug/starch/excpients were assessed using the 3 -D modeling parameters. The crushing force (CF) of the tablets and the drug release properties were evaluated. The effect of <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> on the compaction and drug release properties of the matrices was also investigated. The results obtained indicate that the tablet formation properties of the starches depend on the Dioscorea starch used and on the concentration of drug present in the matrix tablets. There {{appears to be a}} decrease in the CF of the tablets as the concentration of drug in the matrix is increased. Inclusion of <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> in the tablet matrix increased the bonding in the matrix tablets leading to an increase in CF of the tablets. The drug release from the matrices, and the release rates and mechanism were also dependent on the Dioscorea starch used and the drug concentration. Modified Bitter Yam starch matrices provided a controlled release of diclofenac for up to 5 hours while modified Chinese Yam starches provided controlled release for over 24 hours. The release mechanism from modified Chinese Yam starch matrices was found to be Super Case-II transport or time-independent release kinetics. Furthermore, the release rates were dependent on the concentration of the drug present in the matrix. Thus, the modified starch matrices could be used to achieve different drug release profiles depending on the intended use of the tablets.

Five rumen fistulated Holstein steers weighting 275 - 283 kg were used. Experimental design was a 5 &# 215; 5 Latin square and diets consisted of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of <b>dicalcium</b> <b>phosphate</b> replacement by rock phosphate in the mineral supplement. Addition of rock phosphate in the diets produced a linear increase on intake, rumen outflow and fecal output and total disappearance of fluorine.
