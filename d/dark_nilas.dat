50|$|Nilas designates a sea {{ice crust}} up to 10 cm in thickness. It bends without {{breaking}} around waves and swells. Nilas {{can be further}} subdivided into <b>dark</b> <b>nilas</b> - up to 5 cm in thickness and very dark, and light nilas - over 5 cm in thickness and lighter in color.|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Mapping of snow cover using ERTS- 1 data {{proved to be}} six times faster than that done from U- 2 photography. However, NOAA- 2 VHRR snow cover mapping was almost as fast as ERTS- 1, and it is available more frequently. Ice conditions in the Great Lakes can be readily determined by ERTS- 1. Ice features characteristic of thawing conditions such as rotten ice, lack of pressure ridges, brash belts, and compacted ice edges can be identified. A great decrease in apparent reflectivity in band 7 as compared to band 4 also indicated melting conditions. Using sidelap from two successive ERTS- 1 images of Lake Erie (February 17 and 18, 1973) a measure of ice movement was made, agreeing closely with the estimate from conventional methods. The same imagery permitted tentative identification of the following features: shuga, light and <b>dark</b> <b>nilas,</b> fast ice, icefoot, ice breccia, brash ice, fracturing, ridging, rafting, sastrugi, thaw holes, rotten ice, ice islands, dried ice puddles, hummocked ice, and leads...|$|E
40|$|A C-band ship-based {{scatterometer}} {{was used}} to measure the backscatter coefficient of sea ice in the Weddell Sea during June and July 1992. These are the first microwave scatterometer data ever to be collected in the Antarctic sea ice cover during the austral winter. The instrument was a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FM-CW) radar altimeter modified by the University of Kansas Radar Systems and Remote Sensing Laboratory to perform backscatter measurements. Measurements were taken as part of a Jet Propulsion Laboratory experiment aboard the German ice research vessel F. S. Polarstern. Backscatter measurements were performed at incidence angles ranging from 17 to 65 degrees with VV and HV polarization as the Polarstern travelled from east to west across the central Weddell Sea. Backscatter measurements were made of several different types of ice sea including pancake, <b>dark</b> <b>nilas,</b> white nilas, grey, first-year and second-year ice. Periodic external calibrations were performed {{with the aid of a}} Luneberg Lens to enable absolute values of backscatter to be derived from the data. At each radar measurement location, in-situ measurements were made of snow and sea ice. Physical and chemical analyses of ice core and snow samples, together with high magnification photography of snow crystallography provide important information with which to develop physical models of the scattering systems. Meteorological information and oceanographic conditions were also recorded throughout the experiment. Many of the stations were chosen to coincide with periods of near-simultaneous or coincident imaging by the ERS- 1 satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). This enabled spaceborne imaging by the C-band SAR of areas of sea ice in which backscatter measurements were taken. This provides a valuable tool for interpretation of satellite SAR imagery from Antarctic sea ice in terms of the physical properties of the sea ice and snow. Preliminary results of the backscatter from the various ice types and their relation to the physical properties of sea ice are presented...|$|E
