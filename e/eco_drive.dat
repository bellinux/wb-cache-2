40|$|ABSTRACT-Energy {{generation}} is increasing {{day by day}} due to rapid industrialization. Energy generation through thermal power plants is very typical now days. Pond ash (PA) from these thermal plants is available in large quantities. Pond ash utilization helps to reduce the consumption of natural resources. In current time natural sand are using and a it is costly so it’s require to replace by Pond Ash. Use of alternative material in concrete such as industrial by-product coal Ash (Fly Ash and Pond Ash) is an important <b>eco</b> efficiency <b>drive.</b> It is also the social responsibility of researchers to encourage the “beneficial use of industrial by- products {{in order to preserve}} resources, conserve energy and reduce or eliminate the need for disposal of industrial waste in landfills.

40|$|Abstract—Pond ash is {{wastes and}} {{by-products}} of Thermal power plant, {{have been introduced}} into Indian concrete industry to conserve natural resources of ingredients of concrete. In India, most of the Thermal power plants adopt wet method of ash disposal. Pond ash is collected from Thermal power plant at the bottom, in that it contains significant amount of relatively coarser particles (spanning from 150 microns to 2. 36 mm). Pond ash utilization helps to reduce the consumption of natural resources. Also it is help {{to solve the problem}} of disposal of Pond ash because it contains huge amount of chemical compounds such as SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 etc. These chemical compounds (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3) are plays an important role in hydration reaction and helps to produce bond between two adjacent particles. Use of Pond Ash in concrete is an important <b>eco</b> efficiency <b>drive.</b> It is necessary to find the exact suitable percentages of pond ash so that it is decided to use in varying percentage as 0 %, 5 % 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %. And to check the properties of fresh concrete and hardened concrete such as slump and compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength respectively. Also concrete plays an important role in long life period of structure so it is also important to check effect on durability by using sulphate attack, chloride ion penetration, drying shrinkage. Study shows the basic properties of Pond ash. It also compares these properties with natural sand. Partial replacement does not cause any adverse effect on properties of fresh concrete. The result shows that concrete giving good strength with partial replacement of fine aggregate. As well as Pond ash is the good if used as filler material in concrete. Thus, it is suitable to use pond ash as fin...|$|R
50|$|Several {{interior}} {{parts and}} {{components in the}} new Saga were borrowed from other Proton models {{in an effort to}} increase economies of scale and reduce costs and pricing. These include the steering wheel, CVT gear lever and driver's power window controls on all variants, as well as the Premium-exclusive double-DIN head unit and integrated rear view mirror display. The notable carryovers from the second generation Saga include the air-con controls, handbrake lever and manual gear knob. The driver's instrument cluster is largely unchanged, but the meter graphics have been updated, and the HUD now includes Proton's <b>ECO</b> <b>Drive</b> Assist system, an indicator which lights up in green when the car is being driven in an economical manner.|$|E

50|$|Like the Iriz, the new Persona is paired {{to either}} a Getrag 5-speed manual or a Punch Powertrain VT2+ CVT. However, Proton has refined the Punch CVT for a {{smoother}} drive, and in its latest iteration is claimed {{to be far more}} responsive and has narrowed the gap to its competitors. As a result of the various refinements made to the engine and transmission combination in the BH Persona, Proton claims that fuel efficiency has improved by 13% to 5.6L/100 km with the manual, and by 10% to 6.1L/100 km with the CVT, both at a constant speed of 90 km/h. The BH Persona is the first Proton model to utilise the company's new <b>ECO</b> <b>Drive</b> Assist feature. The system assesses the driver's throttle input, and a green indicator on the instrument cluster will light up when the car is being driven in an economical manner.

40|$|AbstractEco-driving {{is a way}} {{to drive}} that allow to use less fuel. To be eco-driver you need to follow a set of simple rules such as: {{upshifting}} to avoid engine speeds over 2500 rpm, keep steady vehicle speed, anticipating traffic, accelerating and decelerating smoothly, and avoiding long idles. The promotion of an energy-efficient driving style is a measure that can have an important impact on fuel consumption. The eco-driving behaviour varies the attitude in setting speed and distance to the preceding vehicles. Speed and distance are parameters that influence, at the macroscopic level, the speed and density of traffic. To assess measure's impact at road network level we need to simulate, first the microscopic level movement of vehicles and then scale up in a suitable way the result to the macroscopic level. A suitable software platform has been developed using and enhancing the models adopted in the existing commercial tools in order to simulate traffic with drivers having different behaviour such as eco driver. The results shows that different behaviour, which imply different law for interaction between vehicle, can have different impact on emission when not a single vehicle is considered but the traffic on a real road network. Results show that <b>Eco</b> <b>drive</b> has more impact in free and normal traffic condition, but could be not useful when traffic condition is congested...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{measurement of the}} energy consumption and efficiency of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are key topics to determine their usability and performance in real-world conditions. This paper aims to present {{the results of a}} test campaign carried out on a BEV, representative of the most common technology available today on the market. The vehicle is a 5 -seat car, equipped with an 80 kW synchronous electric motor powered by a 24 kWh Li-Ion battery. The description and discussion of the experimental results is split into 2 parts: Part 1 focuses on laboratory tests, whereas Part 2 focuses on the on-road tests. As far as on-road tests are concerned, the vehicle has been tested over three different on-road routes, ranging from 60 to 90 km each, with a driving time ranging from approximately one and half to two and half hours. The routes have been designed to include different pathways (i. e. city driving, rural roads and highway), different vehicle speeds and road slopes that could be encountered in real-world driving. The influence of the driving modes of the vehicle (i. e. normal versus economic driving mode (<b>ECO)</b> <b>drive)</b> on the energy consumption and range has been also addressed. The results show that the energy consumption of the vehicle ranges from 111 to 148 Wh/km (i. e. equivalent gasoline consumption from 1. 2 to 1. 7 l/ 100 km) in normal driving mode, depending on the route. The ECO driving mode shows lower energy consumption compared to the normal driving mode, with higher energy recuperation from regenerative braking. The driving range calculated with an abbreviated test approach goes from 139 to 185 km in normal driving mode, and up to 188 km for the ECO mode. The paper provides the reader with {{a detailed description of the}} measurement equipment and setup adopted during the tests, setting the background for future technical analyses and experimental campaigns.
