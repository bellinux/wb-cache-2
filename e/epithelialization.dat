50|$|Fossilized embryos of the 635- to 551-million {{year old}} Doushantuo Formation of {{southern}} China exhibit occasional asynchronous cell division, common in modern embryos, implying that sophisticated mechanisms for differential cell division timing and embryonic cell lineage differentiation evolved before 551 million years ago. However, embryos composed of hundreds {{to more than}} ~1000 cells still show no evidence of blastocoel formation or the organization of blastomeres into epithelia - <b>epithelialization</b> should be underway in modern embryos with >100 cells. Features preserved on Doushantuo embryos are compatible with metazoans (animals), but the absence of <b>epithelialization</b> is consistent only with a stem-metazoan affinity.It is not until the Cambrian that embryos with demonstrable eumetazoan features occur; gastrulation and a pentaradial symmetry are expressed in some lower Cambrian fossils.|$|E
50|$|As keratinocytes {{continue}} migrating, new {{epithelial cells}} must be formed at the wound edges {{to replace them}} and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet. Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins {{a few days after}} wounding and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of <b>epithelialization</b> than in normal tissues. Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.|$|E
50|$|Cadexomer iodine was {{developed}} in the early 1980s in Sweden by Perstorp AB, and given the name Iodosorb. The product was shown to be effective in the treatment of venous ulcers,. More recently, it has been shown in studies in animals and humans that, unlike the iodophor povidone-iodine, Iodosorb causes an acceleration of the healing process in chronic human wounds. This is due to an increase in epidermal regeneration and <b>epithelialization</b> in both partial-thickness and full-thickness wounds. In this way cadexomer iodine acts as a cicatrizant.|$|E
50|$|HB-EGF is the {{predominant}} growth {{factor in the}} <b>epithelialization</b> required for cutaneous wound healing. The mitogenic and migratory effects of HB-EGF on keratinocytes and fibroblasts promotes dermal repair and angiogenesis necessary for wound healing and is {{a major component of}} wound fluids. HB-EGF displays target cell specificity during the early stages of wound healing being released by macrophages, monocytes, and keratinoctyes. HB-EGF cell surface binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans enhances mitogen promoting capabilities increasing the rate of skin wound healing, decreasing human skin graft healing times, and promotes rapid healing of ulcers, burns, and epidermal split thickness wounds.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{visualization}} methods, such as scanning electron microscopy, in situ hybridization, and confocal microscopy, {{combined with}} the simple approach of peeling off the epidermis to see the forming kidney, have shown {{that this is not}} the case. Nephric mesenchyme separates from the intermediate mesoderm as a single elongated primordia. As this primordia begins to undergo <b>epithelialization</b> the anterior portions of the pronephros form rounded protrusions, which then later become the dorsal branches of the pronephros that link to nephrostomes (distinct from nephrotomes). These rounded bumps are probably the structures observed in histological sections that are referred to as nephrotomes. Nephrotomes are not related to nephrostomes, which are thin ciliated funnels that link pronephric nephrons to the coelom.|$|E

50|$|The {{formation}} of granulation tissue {{into an open}} wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment. Basal keratinocytes from the wound edges and dermal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat glands and sebacious (oil) glands are the main cells responsible for the <b>epithelialization</b> phase of wound healing. They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles and nerves do not form. With the lack of hair follicles, nerves and sweat glands, the wound, and the resulting healing scar, provide {{a challenge to the}} body with regards to temperature control.|$|E
5000|$|Growth factors, {{stimulated by}} integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges. Keratinocytes {{themselves}} also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in <b>epithelialization</b> {{and in other}} phases of healing. Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes. [...] Keratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point contact inhibition causes them to stop migrating. [...] When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane. [...] Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and become anchored once again to the basement membrane.

50|$|In humans, {{the spinal}} cord {{comprises}} {{a major part of}} the central nervous system (CNS). Along with the brain, it develops from the dorsal nerve cord in the embryonic stage. The spinal cord consists of such segmental enlargements called ganglia. These ganglia form the basis for the peripheral nervous system’s (PNS) sensory and motor neurons that innervate various parts of the body. The vertebral segmentation is a process that forms a distinctive feature of the group. At first, somites form as a spherical epithelial structure with a central lumen lined by radially arranged cells. Structures such as mesenchymal sclerotome which later develop as the vertebral column along with notochord, and dermomyotome which further divides to form two types of cells, develop from these somites. The sequential <b>epithelialization</b> of the mesodermal mesenchymal rods lead to the formation of somites and the vertebrae originate from these structures. In higher vertebrates such as humans, the segmental plates are laid down during the process of gastrulation and the segmental plates appear on both sides of the mid-line neural epithelium. Later, the process of neurulation occurs in the mid-line and the segmental plates proceed to the side of the neural tube and notochord. Even though mitotic cell divisions create more cells within these plates, the length of the plates is maintained constant. Although intercellular connections mechanisms such as gap junctions and tight junctions are formed in the cells of the segmental plates, tight junctions are not involved in large network of cells as observed commonly in mature epithelium. A cell-cell adhesion chemical, namely calcium dependent N-cadherin, is present at varying concentrations in the anterior and posterior parts as it is expressed at a higher concentration in the anterior portion of the segmental plate and at lower concentration at the posterior part. During segmentation, the concentration of N-cadherin increases at the apical portion of the cell surface. Later, the ventromedial part of the somite is dis-aggregated from the sclerotome after a measurable loss of immunoreactivity of N-cadherin in this region. The observed change in the concentration of this chemical exemplifies the role of the mediatory molecular mechanism in the cell-cell adhesion during the formation of somites.|$|E

40|$|Clinicians often {{experience}} delayed <b>epithelialization</b> in diabetic patients, {{for which}} a high glucose condition {{is one of the}} causes. However, the mechanisms underlying delayed wound closure have not been fully elucidated, and effective treatments to enhance <b>epithelialization</b> in patients with hyperglycaemia have not been established. Here we propose a new reagent, acylated homoserine lactone (AHL), to improve the delayed <b>epithelialization</b> due to the disordered formation of a basement membrane of epidermis in hyperglycaemic rats. Acute hyperglycaemia was induced by streptozotocin injection in this experiment. Full thickness wounds were created on the flanks of hyperglycaemic or control rats. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to identify hyperglycaemia-specific abnormalities in epidermal regeneration by comparison between groups. We then examined the effects of AHL on delayed <b>epithelialization</b> in hyperglycaemic rats. Histological analysis showed the significantly shorter epithelializing tissue (P < 0. 05), abnormal structure of basement membrane (fragmentation and immaturity), and hypo- and hyperproliferation of basal keratinocytes in hyperglycaemic rats. Treating the wound with AHL resulted in the decreased abnormalities of basement membrane, normal distribution of proliferating epidermal keratinocytes, and significantly promoted <b>epithelialization</b> (P < 0. 05) in hyperglycemic rats, suggesting the improving effects of AHL on abnormal <b>epithelialization</b> due to hyperglycemia...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the experimental (keratin-based) dressing accelerates ep-ithelialization rates during healing of partial-thickness wounds, relative to a Standard Care dressing. Method: A randomized control trial was conducted using a Standard Care dressing {{side by side with}} the experimental dressing on a sample (n = 26) of partial-thickness donor site wounds. The proximal/distal placement of the control and treatment was randomized. Percentage <b>epithelialization</b> after approximately 7 days was estimated from which time to fully epithelialize can be inferred. Patients were grouped into “young ” (≤ 50 y/o) and “old ” (> 50 y/o). Results: For the “old ” patients (n = 15), the median <b>epithelialization</b> percentage at 7 days is 5 % and was significantly (P =. 023) greater for the experimental dressing. For the “young ” patients (n = 11), the median <b>epithelialization</b> percentage at 7 days was 80 % and there is no significant difference between the experimental and Standard Care control dressings.

40|$|Boundary {{formation}} and <b>epithelialization</b> are crucial {{processes in the}} morphological segmentation of vertebrate somites. By a genetic screening procedure with zebrafish, we identified two genes, integrinα 5 (itga 5) and fibronectin (fn), required for these processes. Fibronectin proteins accumulate at somite boundaries in accordance with <b>epithelialization</b> of the somites. Both Fibronectin accumulation and the <b>epithelialization</b> are dependent on itga 5, which is expressed in the most medial part of somites. Although somite boundaries are initially formed, but not maintained, in the anterior trunk of the mutant embryos deficient in either gene, their maintenance is defective at all axial levels of embryos deficient for both of these genes. Therefore, Integrinα 5 -directed assembly of Fibronectin appears critical for <b>epithelialization</b> and boundary maintenance of somites. Furthermore, with an additional deficiency in ephrin-B 2 a, the segmental defect in itga 5 or fn mutant embryos is expanded posteriorly, indicating that both Integrin-Fibronectin and Eph-Ephrin systems function cooperatively in maintaining somite boundaries...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} perform a comparative analysis of the influence of perichondrium on conjunctival <b>epithelialization</b> over conchal cartilage grafts used in eyelid reconstruction in rabbits. Methods: The posterior lamellae of 100 lower eyelids from 50 rabbits were reconstructed with autogenous grafts of conchal ear cartilage. In the right eyelids, cartilage was grafted with the perichondrium in direct contact with the eyeball, and the left eyelids were reconstructed in a similar manner but using cartilage grafts without perichondrium. The animals were killed after 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, and their lower eyelids were analyzed macroscopically and histologically. Results: The percentage difference in conjunctival <b>epithelialization</b> on the cartilage with perichondrium and that without perichondrium was 11. 41 percent in the first week of the experiment, 13. 64 percent in the second week, 18. 69 percent in the third week, 10. 38 percent in the fourth week, and 6. 17 percent in the fifth week.

The study presented herein aimed to clone the full length cDNA and to study the spatio-temporal expression profile of mRNA and protein for LAMR 1, previously attributed a role in wound <b>epithelialization,</b> during the repair of body and limb wounds in the horse. Cloning was achieved by screening a cDNA library previously derived from 7 -day wound biopsies. Expression was studied in unwounded skin and in samples from 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 - and 6 -week-old wounds of the body and limb. Temporal gene expression was determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) while protein expression was mapped immunohistochemically. Full-length cDNA for equine LAMR 1 was shown to be highly similar to that of other species.

40|$|The skin is a {{composite}} structure composed of a superficial epidermis and an underlying dermis. Wounding of this structure with resultant functional and anatomical disintegration leads to a cascade of events directed at the restoration of these features.

The uncoupling of anatomical and functional renovation due to accelerated wound closure without proper regeneration and spatial organization of the underlying cellular/extracellular assembly leads to scarring and loss of function. <b>Epithelialization</b> and contraction are the major mechanisms acting to minimize the exposed wound surface. 1 Disconnection of these two procedures, especially for extensive superficial wounds, for example burns, may prove useful; the potential delay between these procedures, while keeping the <b>epithelialization</b> at an optimum level, provides sufficient time for spatial organization of the underlying matrix and thereby prevents loss of function.

Prior {{to the adoption of}} this method some eight years ago, these cavities had been treated by packing with sterile gauze in the ordinary way, and it was noted that the granulations grew much faster from the peripheral parts of the cavities than from their depths, which often resulted in the formation of small deep-lying saccules connected by a narrow track with the superficial surface of the granulation tissue. These saccules were responsible for the persistence of multiple points of discharge on the sur-face of the granulation tissue and failure of <b>epithelialization</b> at these points. The method to be described obviates this disadvantage and promotes really rapid <b>epithelialization...</b>|$|E
40|$|Basic {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (bFGF) has recently beet {{shown to be}} a mitogen for keratinocytes. This observation has now been extended in a porcine model of epidermal wound healing. A single application of recombinant human bFGF given at the time of injury to healthy animals accelerated the rate of <b>epithelialization</b> by 20 %; multiple applications gave no greater effect than the single application. Histologic analysis of biopsies of these partial-thickness wounds taken during bFGF-mediated healing supported the assessment of an enhanced rate of <b>epithelialization</b> and an earlier onset of dermal healing. Because no histologic abnormalities were observed, bFGF induced an acceleration of {{what appears to be the}} normal healing process...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} prospectively the <b>epithelialization</b> process in the healing temporalis myofascial flap (TMF). Eight cats underwent maxillectomy and immediate reconstruction with TMF. They were killed at the determined time and the reconstructed maxillae were processed for examination by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Results revealed that <b>epithelialization</b> of the healing TMF was initiated by hyperplastic changes followed by active migration of epithelial cells deriving from the wound margins. The partial maxillectomy wound was completely covered by a smooth oral mucosa at postoperative week 24. The mucosa had histological and ultrastructural features different from normal palatal mucosa. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
