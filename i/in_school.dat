40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} screening students <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> for emotional/behavioral problems. METHODS: Elements relevant to planning and implementing effective mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> are considered. Screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> is linked to a broader national agenda to improve {{the mental health of}} children and adolescents. Strategies for systematic planning for mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> are presented. RESULTS: Mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> is a very important, yet sensitive, agenda that is in its very early stages. Careful planning and implementation of mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> offers a number of benefits including enhancing outreach and help to youth in need, and mobilizing school and community efforts to promote student mental health while reducing barriers to their learning. CONCLUSIONS: When implemented with appropriate family, school, and commu-nity involvement, mental health screening <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> {{has the potential to be}} a corner-stone of a transformed mental health system.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{violence}} <b>in</b> <b>schools.</b> By analyzing empirical data and heuristic ideas about violence and violence prevention <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> {{a theory of}} violence is constructed. It is shown that violence <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> is produced by the interaction of pupils which {{is caused by the}} structural violence of the school. As violence is caused by the school, it can also be prevented by the school if appropriate conditions for interaction are created. This must be guaranteed by the state. The first chapters offer a comparison of different heuristic ideas and research about violence <b>in</b> <b>schools.</b> Then the views concerning violence <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> which are shared by the majority of scholars are contrasted with various other violence theories, and a new theory of violence <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> is developed. This new theory of violence <b>in</b> <b>schools</b> includes an interaction theory which is about the realization of individual potential in the world. This interaction theory is universal. Its applicability is not restricted to schools...|$|R
