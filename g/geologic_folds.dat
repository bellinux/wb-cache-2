50|$|Structurally, the Jura {{consists}} of a sequence of <b>geologic</b> <b>folds,</b> the formation of which is facilitated by an evaporitic decollement layer. The box folds are still relatively young, which is evident by the general shape of the landscape showing {{that they have not}} existed long enough to experience erosion, thus revealing recent mountain building.|$|E
50|$|The <b>geologic</b> <b>folds</b> {{comprise}} {{three major}} bands (lithological units) of building that date from three epochs: the Lias (Early Jurassic), the Dogger (Middle Jurassic) and the Malm (Late Jurassic) geologic periods. Each era of folding reveals effects of previously shallow marine environments {{as evidenced by}} beds with carbonate sequences, containing abundant bioclasts and oolitic divisions between layers (called horizons).|$|E

5000|$|These {{reefs and}} broken shorelines {{are from a}} <b>geologic</b> <b>folding</b> of the Earth's crust, which brought many {{interesting}} marine fossils to the surface. Some good examples {{can be found on}} the southeast arm of Sucia Island.|$|R
50|$|The Spawning Lake Stock is an Archean age granitoid {{stock in}} Northeastern Ontario, Canada, located in Briggs Township and Chambers Township of Temagami. It intrudes through the Tetapaga Syncline, a major <b>geologic</b> <b>fold</b> in the Temagami Greenstone Belt. However, it remains undeformed by strain {{associated}} {{with the formation of}} the fold. The stock is intruded by dikes composed of biotite lamprophyre on its outer margins.|$|R
50|$|The Silurian Shawangunk {{conglomerate}} lies {{on top of}} the Martinsburg formation. This is due to {{the quartz}} pebbles being transported {{on top of the}} Martinsburg shale, and then due to <b>geologic</b> pressure, <b>folded</b> and faulted. Thus the Kitatinny Mountain was born. About half of the valley is of the Martinsburg formation which is shale and slate. Some of the valley is of the Kittatinny and Jacksonburg limestones. The Kittatinny formation formed during the Cambrian period. Most of the formations are in belts traversing a northeast to southwest axis.|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the first}} {{balanced}} treatment of southern California geology to become available. It represents years of painstaking planning and preparation by Dr. Jahns and {{the staff of the}} California Division of Mines, and includes contributions by 103 authors. The result is a monumental publication: 886 double-size pages (including over 500 diagrams and photographs), together with 63 <b>folded</b> <b>geologic</b> maps-many printed in colors...|$|R
50|$|The United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) {{manages the}} range as the Mecca Hills Wilderness. The {{designated}} Wilderness Area includes narrow steep-walled canyons {{that create a}} natural maze within the badlands. Uniquely faulted and <b>folded</b> <b>geologic</b> formations {{are the result of}} activity on the local sections of the San Andreas Fault, making the Mecca Hills one of the more unusual geological sites of this kind.|$|R
50|$|The geology of Alabama {{is marked}} by {{abundant}} geologic resources {{and a variety of}} <b>geologic</b> structures from <b>folded</b> mountains in the north to sandy beaches along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Alabama spans three continental geologic provinces as defined by the United States Geological Survey, the Atlantic Plain, Appalachian Highlands, and Interior Plains. The Geological Survey of Alabama breaks these provinces down into more specific physiographic provinces.|$|R
50|$|The Kansas River {{flows through}} {{what is known}} as the Stable Interior region. Since this region is near the center of the North American Plate, it has not {{experienced}} any extensive <b>geologic</b> faulting, <b>folding,</b> or mountain building in recent geologic time. The river flows through limestone and shale strata that, except for diagenesis, remain largely undisturbed since deposition beneath the Western Interior Seaway. The age of the rock exposed by the river becomes progressively older as the river moves downstream for two main reasons. First, downstream areas experience more erosion from increased flow, and second because the slight uplift of the Ozark dome to the southeast caused the strata in Kansas to dip very slightly to the west.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{development}} is rapidly {{occurring in the}} karstic terrain of the Frederick Valley, Maryland, USA. Sinkholes are an inherent feature of the landscape; they present hazards and engineering challenges {{to the development of}} residential, commercial and industrial infrastructure. Here, a new approach is presented for assessing susceptibility of sinkhole occurrence. A sinkhole dataset and geologic map was obtained from the Maryland Geological Survey (Brezinski, 2004). Clustering and kernel density analyses were performed on the sinkhole location data to assess interdependence of sinkhole locations. External factors relating to sinkhole development were examined separately using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and ordinary linear regression. These factors included <b>geologic</b> structure (<b>folds</b> axes and faults), rock type, proximity to impervious surfaces and surface drainage patterns. In order to determine the relative likelihood of sinkhole formation, the results of the cluster analysis, density analysis, and regression analyses resulted in map layers that could be weighted and overlain to create a sinkhole susceptibility map. Cluster analysis is important for analyzing sinkhole development for two reasons: 1) human activities tend to fill an empty space by creating a more uniform pattern than random, 2) the eye tends to “se...|$|R
40|$|Kluses and Related Forms in the Swiss Jura Mountains – It {{is shown}} that the usual theory of {{the genesis of the}} "kluses" (transverse gorges cutting across ndges) in the Jura {{mountains}} of Switzerland by fluvial erosion by antecedent rivers is untenable: 1 st. the erosive power of a river on its bed is by at least a factor 100 too small to abrade solid rock as found in the kluses 2 nd. the orientation structure of the segments of the rivers flowing in the kluses is non-random which, by the tenets of the principle of antagonism in landscape development. is indicative of a non-exogenic origin of them. 3 rd. the orientation structure of the klus-nvers agrees with that of the joints in the area. 4 th, {{in view of the fact}} that the joints are known to have been caused by recent plate-tectonic processes, the same must be assumed for the kluses: the latter owe their genesis to complicated <b>geologic</b> lineaments, <b>folds</b> and shear faults. This fact has practical consequences: During the construction of tunnels underneath a klus one has to take into consideration that the disturbance in the landscape represented by a klus my well reach geologically far into the basement. 5 th,the erosion of the kluses oecurred in parallel to the direction of the joints. In this instance, the debris produced by the tectonic processes and by frost action was removed by the mechanical and chemical action of the water. During the cold times and cold spells during warm times this water was mainly melt-water. 6 th, special studies are necessary for the determination of the quantity of debris that was removed. The time-span available for this removal is much longer than commonly assumed: it begins with the first tectonic foldnig, in the Jura mountains already in mid-Miocene, 15 Ma ago...|$|R
