40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} determinant functors which allows us to extend Deligne's determinant functors for exact categories to Waldhausen categories, (strongly) triangulated categories, and derivators. We construct universal determinant functors in all cases by original methods which are interesting even for the known cases. Moreover, we show that the target of each universal determinant functor computes the corresponding $K$-theory in dimensions 0 and 1. As applications, we answer open questions by Maltsiniotis and Neeman on the $K$-theory of (strongly) triangulated categories and a question of Grothendieck to Knudsen on determinant functors. We also prove additivity theorems for low-dimensional $K$-theory and obtain generators and (some) relations for various $K_{ 1 }$-groups. Comment: 73 pages. We have deeply revised the paper to make it more accessible, it contains now explicit examples and computations. We have removed the part on localization, it was correct but we didn't want to make the paper longer and we thought this part was the less interesting one. Nevertheless it will remain here in the arXiv, in version 1. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> in your research, please let us kno...|$|E
40|$|Memory {{seems to}} be so simple. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>it</b> then just get some and use it. On most systems, one memory page {{is as good as}} another. On a NUMA system however the {{distance}} of the memory to the executing process matters. Performance can sink dramatically if memory references are made too frequently to pages on remote nodes. Local memory is special to the execution context because it has minimal latency and optimal bandwidth characteristics. The kernel has the task to assign memory to a process in the most optimal way so that the process can execute with the highest performance. For that purpose, the kernel has been equipped with various mechanisms that determine node locality and insure that memory is allocated {{in such a way that}} the NUMA distances are minimized. During the execution of a process the locality constraints may change due to a variety of influences (scheduler, administrator, memory allocation). The kernel therefore also needs the ability to move pages while a process is executing. This is called page migration. Memory allocation can also be controlled by the process itself through the establishment of memory policies. This is in particular useful if it is known that processes will use more memory than one node has available. It allows the distribution of memory to optimize the performance of the application...|$|E
40|$|Recent time-resolved {{spectral}} {{studies of}} a few Active Galactic Nuclei in hard X-rays revealed occultations of the X-ray primary source probably by Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds. An important open question {{on the structure of}} the circumnuclear medium of AGN is whether this phenomenon is common, i. e. whether a significant fraction of the X-ray absorption in AGN is due to BLR clouds. Here we present the first attempt to perform this kind of analysis in a homogeneous way, on a statistically representative sample of AGN, consisting of the ~ 40 brightest sources with long XMM-Newton and/or Suzaku observations. We describe our method, based on a simple analysis of hardness-ratio light curves, and its validation through a complete spectroscopic analysis {{of a few}} cases. We find that X-ray eclipses, most probably due to clouds at the distance of the BLR, are common in sources where the expected occultation time is compatible with the observation time, while they are not found in sources with longer estimated occultation times. Overall, our results show that occultations by BLR clouds may be responsible for most of the observed X-ray spectral variability at energies higher than 2 keV, on time scales longer than a few ks.
