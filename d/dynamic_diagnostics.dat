40|$|The {{structure}} of mass transport in the stratosphere, {{as well as}} its dynamic behaviors, is explored by imposing idealized sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations in an aqua-planet model. Mass transport within stratosphere is simultaneously running through two processes: the diabatic circulation, also well known as the Brewer-Dobson Circulation (BDC), advecting air mass across isentropic surfaces, and the quasi-horizontal mixing ventilating air mass along isentropic surfaces. It is shown that, with an equatorial SST heating, the stratospheric transport will increase in strength, in a circumstance with both BDC and high-latitude isentropic mixing being accelerated. Behaviors of transport, for both BDC and isentropic mixing, turn out to be with more complexities when the imposed SST perturbation being relocated at different ranges of latitudes or expanding itself with larger longitudinal span. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>diagnostics</b> further relate the changes of stratospheric transport mainly to the changes of eddies, which are originated from the induction of SST perturbation...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The McTronX Research {{group at}} the Potchefstroom campus of the North-West University, aims to {{establish}} a knowledge base on active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems. Up to date, the group has established a firm knowledge base on various topics related to AMB systems. A recent focus was the design and development of a high speed AMB supported rotor system called the rotor delevitation system (RDS) to analyse rotor drops. During the testing phase of the RDS, the machine exhibited vibrations, of which the origins were unknown. The research presented in this dissertation sets out to characterize the vibrations of the RDS, which is the group’s first attempt to fulfil the need for characterizing vibrations in an AMB supported rotor. Emphasis is placed on characterizing the natural response of the RDS rotor, stator and integrated system. The research project is {{defined in terms of}} four main objectives: rotor and stator characterization, modelling, system characterization and rotor <b>dynamic</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> A comprehensive literature study introduces the fundamental concepts regarding vibrations of single and multiple degree of freedom systems. These concepts include; natural frequencies, damping, machine vibrations, rotor dynamics and modelling techniques. These modelling techniques are introduced to verify the experimental methodology used to determine the natural frequencies. A critical overview of the literature contextualises the theory with the research investigation. For the RDS rotor and stator characterization, a modal analysis process also known as the “bump test” is implemented in order to validate the bending natural frequencies of the rotor and stator. A simulation model of the RDS is constructed in the finite element (FE) package DyRoBeS®. The model is verified with a numerical and an analytical model and validated with the measured bending natural frequencies of the RDS rotor. For the system characterization, a number of modal analysis processes are implemented, which validates the rigid body natural frequencies of the RDS. These frequencies are also used to validate the FE simulation. The origins of the synchronous vibration harmonics are verified by formulating and evaluating hypotheses according to different modal analysis processes. From the RDS rotor modal analysis it was identified that a bending natural frequency of the rotor is situated at approximately 443. 33 Hz. This was verified using the FE simulation model. During the system modal analyses, it was identified that only one rigid body natural frequency, situated at approximately 62 Hz, is excited. This frequency increases with the differential gain control parameter of the system up to approximately 140 Hz. After evaluating two hypotheses regarding the origins of the synchronous vibrations harmonics, it was verified that non-circularity of the rotor at the measuring positions is the cause. Overall the objectives of the study were addressed by characterizing the natural frequencies of the rotor, stator and RDS system. This include the mode forms of the rigid body and bending natural frequencies of the system. The results of the verification and validation methods correlated, which imply these methods are reliable to identify the origins of vibrations in rotor-bearing systems. The differential gain control parameter of the AMBs control the equivalent damping in the RDS. An increase in this parameter should lead to a decrease in amplitude and frequency of the maximum vibration, and vice versa. However, it was noted that an increase in this parameter caused a linear increase in the rigid body natural frequency. The literature indicates that this effect can only be caused by an increase in system stiffness. It is therefore recommended to evaluate the stiffness of the system {{as a function of the}} differential gain control parameter. Master...|$|E
40|$|Children {{learn new}} words {{every day and}} this ability {{requires}} auditory perception, phoneme discrimination, attention, associative learning and semantic memory. Based on previous results showing {{that some of these}} functions are enhanced by music training, we investigated learning of novel words through picture-word associations in musically-trained and control children (8 – 12 year-old) to determine whether music training would positively influence word learning. Results showed that musically-trained children outperformed controls in a learning paradigm that included picture-sound matching and semantic associations. Moreover, the differences between unexpected and expected learned words, as reflected by the N 200 and N 400 effects, were larger in children with music training compared to controls after only 3 min of learning the meaning of novel words. In line with previous results in adults, these findings clearly demonstrate a correlation between music training and better word learning. It is argued that these benefits reflect both bottom-up and top-down influences. The present learning paradigm might provide a useful <b>dynamic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tool to determine which perceptive and cognitive functions are impaired in children with learning difficulties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Imperfect test outcomes, due {{to factors}} such as {{unreliable}} sensors, electromagnetic interference, and environ-mental conditions, manifest themselves as missed detections and false alarms. This paper develops near-optimal algorithms for dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD) problems {{in the presence of}} imperfect test outcomes. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> inference problem is to determine the most likely evolution of component states, the one that best explains the observed test outcomes. Here, we discuss four formulations of the DMFD problem. These include the deterministic situation corresponding to a perfectly-observed coupled Markov decision processes, to several partially-observed factorial hidden Markov models ranging from the case where the imperfect test outcomes are functions of tests only to the case where the test outcomes are functions of faults and tests, as well as the case where the false alarms are associated with the nominal (fault-free) case only. All these formulations are intractable NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. We solve each of the DMFD problems by decomposing them into separable subproblems, one for each component state sequence.

In this study, not only the spatial variability of the crop growth parameters, but also that of the radiative transfer model parameters, was taken into account.

40|$|Background: Bow hunter′s syndrome, {{also known}} as {{rotational}} vertebrobasilar insufficiency, arises from mechanical compression of the vertebral artery during the neck rotation. Surgical options have been the mainstay treatment of choice. Postoperative imaging is typically used to assess adequate decompression. On the other hand, intraoperative assessment of decompression has been rarely reported. Case Description: A 52 -year-old male began to see "black spots," and experienced presyncope whenever he rotated {{his head toward the}} right. The patient ultimately underwent a <b>dynamic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> cerebral angiogram, which revealed a dominant right vertebral artery and complete proximal occlusion of the right vertebral artery with the head rotated toward the right. Subsequently, the patient underwent an anterior transcervical approach to the right C 6 /C 7 transverse process. The bone removal occurred along with the anterior wall of the C 6 foramen transversarium, followed by the upper portion of the anterior C 6 body medially, and the transverse process of C 6 laterally. An oblique osseofibrous band was noted to extend across the vertebral artery; it was dissected and severed. An intraoperative cerebral angiogram confirmed no existing compression of the vertebral artery with the head rotated toward the right. The patient recovered from surgery without issues; he denied recurrence of preoperative symptoms at follow-up. Conclusions: The authors report the third instance where intraoperative dynamic angiography was employed with good outcomes. Although intraoperative cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, which prompts additional risks, the authors believe the modality affords better, real-time visualization of the vertebral artery, allowing for assessment of the adequacy of the decompression. This advantage may reduce the probability for a second procedure, which has its own set of risks, and may counteract the risks involved with intraoperative dynamic angiography...|$|R

In the first part of the thesis, we address the problem of detecting an anomaly (e. g., intrusions, fraud and unusual business activities) with minimum delay and fewest false alarms. In our application, an anomaly is a sequence of very few transactions of interest embedded in a large number of noise (benign) transactions. We propose a sequential detection-based approach to detect HMMs, which are used to model anomalies (asymmetric threats). A transaction-based probabilistic model is developed to combine hidden Markov models and feature-aided tracking. A detailed performance analysis of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm is performed along with a comparison with the maximum likelihood-based data mining method. ^ In the second part of the thesis, we develop near-optimal algorithms for dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD) problems in the presence of imperfect test outcomes.

The use of the ultrasound in the diagnostics of DDH, beside the visualization and making the respective clinical findings objective, made possible verification (still without a distinction of the tissues) of the two basic categories of the primary condition of a newborn baby hips. Objective The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the optimal methodological procedure for the early detection of DDH in newborn infants and suckling. Method During 2002 and 2003, at the Neonatal Department of the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics, Novi Sad, as well as at the Institute for Orthopedic Surgery "Banjica" Belgrade, there were 4016 newborn infants examined, i. e. 8032 hips clinically and by ultrasound. The standard Graf’s methodological procedure was applied completely, supplemented by the dynamic examination by pushing back and stretching femora along, that is by the techniques of Couture and Harcke. Results In order to categorize the condition of the hip of a newborn infant, the sonographic classification of R. Graaf, Th. Harcke and D. Pajić was used. The ultrasound analysis demonstrated a frequency of the sonotype Ia in 552 (13. 08 %) of the newborn infants, the sonotype Ib in 2934 (73. 00 %), the sonotype IIa+ in 481 (11. 97 %) and the pathological cases with sonotypes IIg 42 (1. 04 %), IId 17 (0. 42 %), IIIa 15 (0. 37 %) and IV 5 (0. 12 %). The total number of unstable critical, discentering and discentered cases of DDH was 79 (1. 95 %). The incidence of DDH was three times more frequent in girls, mostly bilateral; when unilateral, it was more frequent in the left one. The results of the early treatment were uniformly excellent, but in two cases there was established osteochondritis of the first degree (Pavlik’s harness 1, Von Rosen’s splint 1). Conclusion It has been proven that the {{clinical examination}} was inevitable, but insufficient for diagnosis of DDH. The standard sonographic examination should be supplemented by provocative <b>dynamic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> procedures in all immature, at risk and discentering hips.

So {{it is important to}} provide farmers crop N status diagnostic tools in order to decide the rate and the timing of N fertilizer applications. Theory on crop N uptake and allocation allows the determination of a diagnostic tool, the Nitrogen Nutrition Index, based on the determination of the critical N dilution curve for each crop species considered. During the vegetative growth period of all the crop species studied, including C 3 and C 4 species and monocots and dicots, plant N concentration decreases monotonically as crop grows because of (i) the ontogenetic decline in leaf area per unit of plant mass, and (ii) the remobilisation of N from shaded leaves {{at the bottom of the}} canopy to well illuminated leaves at the top. NNI appears then as an indicator well connected with the physiological regulation of N uptake at canopy level. So this indicator can be used as the basis for determination of crop N nutrition status, and then for decision making on the necessity of an N application for achieving target yield. Nevertheless despite its high physiological relevance, NNI cannot be used directly in farm conditions because its determination is very time consuming. So it is necessary to develop indirect methods for NNI estimation through more operational procedures. Several methods have been proposed in literature, such as nitrate concentration in sap or chlorophyll meter. But the calibration or validation of these methods with NNI have not been always made and, when they have been, they did not give univocal relationships, showing a strong dependence of the relationship with cultivar and environment, that limits considerably the relevance of such diagnostic tools in a large range of situations. Easier to use is the indirect estimation of crop NNI by remote sensing measurements. This method allows the estimation of both actual crop mass, through LAI estimation and crop N content, through crop chlorophyll content. The possibility to have repeated estimations of crop NNI during the period of vegetative growth would allow a <b>dynamic</b> <b>diagnostic</b> tool of crop N status. The coupling of indirect measurements of crop N status with dynamic models of crop growth and development should allow a very promising method for crop N diagnostics for decision tools in N fertilization.
