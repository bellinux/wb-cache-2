25|$|As {{bit cell}} size decreases, more {{data can be}} put onto a single drive platter. In 2013, a {{production}} desktop 3TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an areal density of about 500Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (<b>electrothermal</b> instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known write head materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium. Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as flash memory-based solid-state drives (SSDs).|$|E

5000|$|Nevertheless, {{experimental}} studies about {{the growth rate}} of the <b>electrothermal</b> instability and the critical conditions showed that a stability region still exists for high electron temperatures. The stability is given by a quick transition to [...] "fully ionized" [...] conditions (fast enough to overtake {{the growth rate of}} the <b>electrothermal</b> instability) where the Hall parameter decreases cause of the collision frequency rising, below its critical value which is then about 2. Stable operation with several megawatts in power output had been experimentally achieved as from 1967 with high electron temperature. But this <b>electrothermal</b> control does not allow to decrease Tg low enough for long duration conditions (thermal ablation) so such a solution is not practical for any industrial energy conversion.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the period}} 1990 to 1997 Snowden {{developed}} a new <b>electrothermal</b> physics-based equivalent circuit model for heterojunction bipolar transistors which was suited to power amplifier applications (widely used in cellular handsets). He was awarded the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society Microwave Prize in 1999 for this work described in his 1997 paper [...] "Large-signal Microwave Characterization of AlGaAs/GaAs HBT's Based on a Physics Based <b>Electrothermal</b> Model' (IEEE TMTT, MTT-45, pp. 58-71, 1997).|$|E

50|$|The atomizers most {{commonly}} used nowadays are (spectroscopic) flames and <b>electrothermal</b> (graphite tube) atomizers. Other atomizers, such as glow-discharge atomization, hydride atomization, or cold-vapor atomization might be used for special purposes.|$|E

50|$|His {{career in}} the field of MHD is well-known: first method of <b>electrothermal</b> {{instability}} control and first usable MHD generator with non-equilibrium ionized gas (1967); kinetic theory of non-equilibrium plasmas (1972); MHD aerodynes with ionization control (1975); Shock wave cancellation by MHD force field around a cylindrical profile imbedded in a liquid flow (1983); 2nd method of <b>electrothermal</b> instability control by magnetic pressure gradient in an MHD accelerator (1981); Thesis director about shock wave annihilation around a flat wing in a hot supersonic gas flow: Resolution of Navier-Stokes equations within an MHD force field by the method of characteristics (1987).|$|E
50|$|The Electro Thermal Dynamic Stripping Process (ET-DSP) is {{currently}} {{being used in the}} Athabasca Oil Sands to thermally recover bitumen and heavy oil by E-T Energy Limited. This <b>electrothermal</b> process converts electromagnetic energy into thermal energy by inducing current through the formation using excitor electrodes. Considerable control can be effected over the path taken by the currents and over the temperature profiles that will develop in the deposit by varying the operating frequency and excitor spacing. <b>Electrothermal</b> processes are virtually free of problems related to very low initial formation injectivity, poor heat transfer and the near impossibility of adequately controlling the movement of injected fluids and gases.|$|E
50|$|However {{it should}} be noted that this <b>electrothermal</b> {{stabilization}} by magnetic confinement, if found too late for the development of MHD power plants, might be of interest for future applications of MHD to aerodynamics (magnetoplasma-aerodynamics for hypersonic flight).|$|E

50|$|Other {{methods of}} sample {{introduction}} are also utilized. <b>Electrothermal</b> vaporization (ETV) and in torch vaporization (ITV) use hot surfaces (graphite or metal, generally) to vaporize samples for introduction.

50|$|If {{a device}} has a {{positive}} dR/dT, an increase in temperature (for example, due to thermal fluctuations or the absorption of a photon) will increase the electrical resistance R. If the device is biased with a constant voltage V, this increase in resistance will decrease the Joule power P = V2/R. The decrease in Joule heating will cause the device to return to its equilibrium temperature. This is known as negative <b>electrothermal</b> feedback, as the change in Joule heating opposes the change in temperature. If the device is instead biased with a constant current I, the Joule power P = I2R will increase if the temperature increases. Thus the Joule heating amplifies a change in temperature, an effect known as positive <b>electrothermal</b> feedback. The situation is reversed for {{the case of a}} negative dR/dT.|$|E
