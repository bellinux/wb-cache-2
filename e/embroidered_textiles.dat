2500|$|In {{addition}} to woven dress and furnishing fabrics, Byzantine workshops were {{also known for}} woven tapestries and richly <b>embroidered</b> <b>textiles</b> with decoration that often included figurative scenes. The most impressive example to survive is the 10th century [...] "Bamberger Gunthertuch", a woven tapestry piece over two metres square, with a mounted emperor between two female personifications. Nearly a century after it was made it was acquired by the Bishop of Bamberg in Germany, {{on a pilgrimage to}} Constantinople. He died during the journey and it was used for his shroud. Embroidered religious scenes were also used for vestments and hangings, and the famous English Opus Anglicanum seems to have been heavily influenced by Byzantine embroidery. This continued Late Antique trends, which among other evidence are known from finds in Egyptian cemeteries, and the complaint by Saint Asterius of Amasia in around 410 about his flock in northeastern Turkey, where he says the laity decorated their clothes with religious images: ...|$|E

50|$|The textile {{museum is}} {{essentially}} {{spread out over}} the entire town. The exhibits aims at {{telling the story of}} the use of textiles in the home i.e. the introduction of curtains and sofa cushions. During the 19th century a tendency to hide furniture behind textiles erupted. Towels were hidden behind embroidered linen and the stove was hidden behind an <b>embroidered</b> <b>textile</b> screen and in the 1890s the average home resembled a box excessively lined with coloured curtains, screens and linen. The functionalism of the 1920s was a rebellion against this tendency. The Mayor's House showcases the tendencies of 250 years of interior decoration.|$|R

50|$|Kaitag {{textiles}} are {{an unusual}} <b>embroidered</b> <b>textile</b> art form from the Kaitag district of southwest Daghestan, Russia, inhabited mainly by Dargins and Kumyks. Kaitag textiles are of simple construction, being laid and couched silk-floss embroidery on a cotton ground. The designs {{are often in}} the style of classical Safavid Persian art, sometimes illustrating horsemen and hunting scenes. Abstract Kaitag designs have been compared to those of Matisse and Paul Klee, though it is unlikely that either artist ever saw a Kaitag textile. Surviving examples are mostly from the 17th and 18th centuries. These embroideries were apparently made for local use in weddings, funerals, and for cradle trappings.The traditional Kaitag art of embroidery was reportedly stamped out under Soviet rule.|$|R

Today’s adhesive conducting gel electrodes are not suitable for such applications. We have developed an <b>embroidered</b> <b>textile</b> electrode from polyethylene terephthalate yarn which is plasma-coated with silver for electrical conductivity and with an ultra-thin titanium layer on top for passivation. Two of these electrodes are embedded into a breast belt. They are moisturized with a very low amount of water vapor from an integrated reservoir. The combination of silver, titanium and water vapor results in an excellent electrode chemistry. With this belt the long-time {{monitoring of}} electrocardiography (ECG) is possible at rest as well as when the patient is moving...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the first embroidery machines were developed in St. Gallen. In 1910 the embroidery production constituted the largest export branch (18% of the total export value) in Switzerland {{and more than half of}} the worldwide production of embroidery originated in St. Gallen. One fifth of the population of the eastern part of Switzerland was involved with the textile industry. However, World War I and the Great Depression caused another severe crisis for St. Gallen embroidery. Only in the 1950s did the textile industry recover somewhat. Nowadays, because of competition and the prevalence of computer-operated embroidery machines, only a reduced textile industry has survived in St. Gallen; but its <b>embroidered</b> <b>textiles</b> are still popular with Parisian haute couture designers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Embroidered</b> <b>textile</b> {{electromagnetic}} structures {{based on}} substrate-integrated technology use computercontrolled stitching with metalized yarns to form metallic side walls. In these structures, the tensile {{stress of the}} thread compresses the flexible substrate along the seams. As a consequence, the overall shape of a manufactured design is modified, which will both impact the frequency and efficiency of the structure. In this paper, the mechanical impact of the seam compression on manufactured antennas is first estimated for two types of lowpermittivity substrates, namely closed foam and felt material. Then, {{the influence of the}} depth and width of the compression is quantified in terms of electromagnetic performance for a textile half-mode substrate-integrated cavity antenna, a substrateintegrated waveguide and a shielded stripline. It is demonstrated that seam compression significantly improves the efficiency of this type of structures, but comes at a cost of of slightly increased overall dimensions.

Perfumed by cypress trees, and with French lavender scattered on the ground for the event, the plaza lay across the crest of a ridge, to which one ascended, entering by way of the Torre de la Justicia. It was decorated for the occasion by the artist Ignacio Zuloaga, whose visual display employed brilliant <b>embroidered</b> <b>textiles</b> and mantones capes of Andalucia.

5000|$|As well as {{the major}} Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans. Spanish carpets, which {{sometimes}} interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include coats of arms, enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the Papal Palace, Avignon, and the industry continued after the Reconquista. [...] Armenian carpet-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought. The Berber carpets of North Africa have a distinct design tradition. Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, {{there was also a}} large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs. As well as pile carpets, kelims and other types of flat-weave or <b>embroidered</b> <b>textiles</b> were produced, for use on both floors and walls. Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of woven and <b>embroidered</b> <b>textiles</b> {{is the most}} prolific of all traditional crafts in Laos. Almost all {{regions of the country}} are suitable for the farming of cotton and mulberry trees, which are often planted on cooperative land with a view to providing raw materials for the wider community. Textiles are made of perishable materials and only survive the millennia when preserved under exceptional circumstances. Archaeological finds point to a high level of skill and sophistication at an astoundingly early date. The first prestigious garments were probably the skins of dangerous animals worn by daring hunters. In tropical regions, the alternative to leather was the inner bark of certain trees, which was beaten until it became soft. Succeeding generations developed more flexible fibres, with the invention of spinning which was used {{in different parts of the}} world to make yarn from wool, linen, cotton, or silk. Colour is very essential to textiles. In Laos, many villages, however, produce organic dyes from plants, roots, insect, resin, and soil. Raw dye materials are crushed or sliced and then boiled to extract the colour. The sediment is removed and the remaining liquid is suitable as a dye. Dyes are absorbed into the very fibres of textiles, ensuring a much longer lifetime than paints. Of the exceptional wealth of ornamentation, four groups of motifs have been distinguished: ...|$|E
