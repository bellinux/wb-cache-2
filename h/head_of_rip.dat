40|$|The {{analysis}} of long-term measurements {{carried out on}} the coast of Sele River, located on the western margin of southern Italy, showed a rather articulated morphology of the submerged beach. Along it several channels perpendicular to the shoreline were found, which affecting the original bars parallel to the shore, thus they have shrunk dramatically. These channels are developed mainly between 0 and 5 meters deep and, according to the sedimentological characters, {{play a significant role in}} the seaward transport of sediments removed from the bottom. More specifically, the bars are constituted by fine and relatively unsorted sands, while the channels are characterized by the presence of sandy and sorted sediments. The increased size of the sediment in the channels as well as its better selection correlates well to the high hydrodynamic energy of flowing water in the channels probably modeled by rip currents. The presence of these currents has been confirmed by some bathymetric surveys. The rip currents are also responsible for the morphological changes of the emerged beach and of the typical rhythmic shoreline, with alternating embayments separated by cusps. The embayments are located in correspondence of the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> channels, while the cusps laid out at the bars edges, on which the incident waves break. The rip currents erosion on the seabed extended over the inner portion of the emerged beach, causing erosion processes on the dune and discontinuity in the dune system. Such discontinuities promote the genesis of blowouts and parabolic dunes on the beach, that can be the first sign of severe erosion of the coastal system, which is already quite evident in the investigated coastline...|$|E

50|$|Rip {{currents}} typically flow {{at about}} 0.5 metres per second (1-2 feet per second), {{but they can}} be as fast as 2.5 metres per second (8 feet per second), which is faster than any human can swim. However, most rip currents are fairly narrow, and even the widest rip currents are not very wide; swimmers can easily exit the rip by swimming at a right angle to the flow, parallel to the beach. Swimmers who are unaware of this fact may exhaust themselves trying unsuccessfully to swim against the flow. The flow of the current also fades out completely at the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rip,</b> outside the zone of the breaking waves, so there is a definite limit to how far the swimmer will be taken out to sea by the flow <b>of</b> a <b>rip</b> current.|$|R

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>ripping</b> and water <b>head</b> on infiltration rate of sandy-loam and clay-loam soils during Summer, 2001. The treatments involved <b>ripping</b> <b>of</b> soil with chisel plough up to 60 - 90 cm depth of soil with four water head treatments ranging from 5 to 20 cm depth of irrigation water. The difference in infiltration rate <b>of</b> soil between <b>ripping</b> and control treatments was significant. Mean infiltration rate of sandy loam soil ranged between 4. 35 - 8. 13 cm hr‾ 1 (control treatment) and 5. 79 - 13. 72 cm hr‾ 1 in the ripping treatment in different water head treatments. Similarly, mean infiltration rate of clay loam soil ranged between 1. 51 - 3. 28 cm hr‾ 1 (control) and 2. 23 - 4. 76 cm hr‾ 1 (ripping) in different water <b>head</b> treatments. <b>Ripping</b> <b>of</b> soil and water head significantly increased the infiltration rate of soil than the control treatment. The magnitude of increase in the infiltration rate was 132 - 163 % in sandy loam soil and 136 - 146 % in clay loam soil in various treatments. In conclusion, ripping improved the infiltration rate of soil thus providing an opportunity for speedy reclamation of salt affected lands where hardpan is a major limitation for salt leaching. The positive effect <b>of</b> <b>ripping</b> and increasing water head on infiltration rate of soil warrants the scientific irrigation scheduling and precision land leveling to avoid unnecessary water losses for efficient water management and conservation in an arid environment...|$|R

The peritoneal zymosan evoked neutrophils of mice NMRI strain were used. Production of the reactive oxygen species was estimated by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence.

40|$|AbstractThe tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor 1 (TNFR 1) and the Fas receptor recruit complexes {{formed by}} the interactions between RIP kinase, TRADD, FADD and RAIDD – adaptor proteins that contain death domains – which in turn recruit other proteins to initiate signaling [1 – 5]. To identify proteins associated with the TNF signaling pathway, we performed a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen using RIP as bait. We isolated a kinase, RIP 3, which shares homology with the kinase domain <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> and RIP 2 (also known as Rick or CARDIAK). RIP 3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with RIP, TRAF 2 and TNFR 1 in mammalian cells. The carboxy-terminal domain <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3, like that <b>of</b> <b>RIP,</b> could activate the transcription factor NFκB and induce apoptosis when expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, this region shares no significant sequence homology to the death domain <b>of</b> <b>RIP,</b> the caspase-recruiting domain (CARD) <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 2 [6 – 8] or any other apoptosis-inducing domain. As with RIP and RIP 2, the kinase domain <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 was not required for either NFκB activation or apoptosis induction. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 strongly inhibited the caspase activation but not the NFκB activation induced by TNFα. Therefore, RIP 3 appears to function as an intermediary in TNFα-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|The death domain kinase Rip 1 is {{recruited}} to the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 and mediates the IkappaB kinase and p 38 MAP kinase pathways. In response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), we find Rip 1 phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, suggesting that Rip 1 phosphorylation may stimulate its ubiquitination. To address {{the contribution of}} the kinase activity <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1 to its ubiquitination and to TNF-alpha signaling, we introduced wild type Rip 1 and a kinase-inactive form <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1, Rip 1 D 138 N, into rip 1 -/- murine embryonic fibroblast cells by retroviral infection. TNF-alpha-induced ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1 is observed in Rip 1 D 138 N cells, supporting the argument that Rip 1 autophosphorylation is not required for Rip 1 ubiquitination. TNF-alpha-induced Ikk and p 38 MAP kinase activation is normal, and the Rip 1 D 138 N cells are resistant to TNF-alpha-induced cell death, indicating that the kinase activity <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1 is not required to mediate its antiapoptotic functions. In the absence of Traf 2, TNF-alpha-induced ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1 is impaired, suggesting that Traf 2 may be the E 3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the TNF-alpha-dependent, ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1. Finally, recruitment of the ubiquitinated Tak 1 complex is dependent on the presence <b>of</b> <b>Rip</b> 1, suggesting that Rip 1 ubiquitination rather than its phosphorylation is critical in signaling...|$|R
40|$|RIP 2 kinase is {{a central}} {{component}} of the innate immune system and enables downstream signaling following activation of the pattern recognition receptors NOD 1 and NOD 2, leading {{to the production of}} inflammatory cytokines.

40|$|International audienceThe {{androgen}} receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that controls {{growth and survival}} of prostate cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of AR activity by the receptor-interacting protein 140 (RIP 140). We first showed that RIP 140 could be coimmunoprecipitated with the receptor when coexpressed in 293 T cells. This interaction appeared physiologically relevant because chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that, under R 1881 treatment, RIP 140 could be recruited to the prostate-specific antigen encoding gene in LNCaP cells. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays provided evidence that the carboxy-terminal domain of AR could interact with different regions <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140. By means of fluorescent proteins, we demonstrated that ligand-activated AR was not only able to translocate to the nucleus but also to relocate RIP 140 from very structured nuclear foci to a diffuse pattern. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 strongly repressed AR-dependent transactivation by preferentially targeting the ligand binding domain-dependent activity. Moreover, disruption <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 expression induced AR overactivation, thus revealing RIP 140 as a strong AR repressor. We analyzed its mechanism of transrepression and first demonstrated that different regions <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 could mediate AR-dependent repression. We then showed that the carboxy-terminal end <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 could reverse transcriptional intermediary factor 2 -dependent overactivation of AR. The use <b>of</b> mutants <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 allowed us to suggest that C-terminal binding protein played no role in RIP 140 -dependent inhibition of AR activity, whereas histone deacetylases partly regulated that transrepression. Finally, we provided evidence for a stimulation <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 mRNA expression in LNCaP cells under androgen treatment, further emphasizing the role <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 140 in androgen signaling...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNecroptosis {{is a form}} of {{regulated}} necrosis {{that can}} be activated by ligands of death receptors and stimuli that induce the expression of death receptor ligands under apoptotic deficient conditions. Activation of necroptosis by ligands of death receptors requires the kinase activity <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 1, which mediates the activation <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 and MLKL, two critical downstream mediators of necroptosis. Blocking the kinase activity <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 1, a key druggable target in the necroptosis pathway, by necrostatins inhibits the activation of necroptosis and allows cell survival and proliferation in the presence of death receptor ligands. The activation of necroptosis is modulated by different forms of ubiquitination, including K 63, linear and K 48 ubiquitination, as well as phosphorylation <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 1, RIP 3 and MLKL. Necroptosis is suppressed by caspase- 8 /FADD-mediated apoptosis. Deficiency in caspase- 8 and FADD leads to embryonic lethality, tissue degeneration and inflammation which can be suppressed by inhibition <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 1 kinase and RIP 3. On the other hand, the lack <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 kinase activity leads to early embryonic lethality which can be suppressed by the loss of caspase- 8, suggesting that although the kinase activity <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 is involved in mediating necroptosis, the basal activity <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3 kinase may be required for suppressing caspase- 8 mediated apoptosis. Necroptosis as well as RIP 1 - and RIP 3 -mediated inflammatory response have been implicated in mediating multiple human diseases including TNF-mediated hypothermia and systemic inflammation, ischemic reperfusion injury, neurodegeneration, Gaucher's disease, progressive atherosclerotic lesions, etc. Targeting RIP 1 kinase may provide therapeutic benefits for the treatment of human diseases characterized by necrosis and inflammation...|$|R

40|$|RIP 2 is an {{important}} regulator of myoblast proliferation and differentiation. It had previoiusly been demonstrated that in the myoblast cell line C 2 C 12 and in primary myoblasts, downregulation <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 2 gene expression {{is a prerequisite for}} differentiation. To further study the role <b>of</b> the <b>rip</b> gene family in myogenesis, we compared expression patterns <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 1 - 4 in two myoblast cell lines – C 2 C 12 and C 2 F 3 – after the induction of differentiation. These two cell lines are derived from the same clonal origin, but differ with respect to their differentiation behaviour: the differentiation process is slower and more incomplete in C 2 F 3 cells. When analyzing cells up to four days after the induction of differentiation, we found no downregulation <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 2 gene expression in C 2 F 3 cells, which might be linked to the low differentiation potential of these cells. In addition, in contrast to C 2 C 12 cells, the rip 3 gene was not expressed in C 2 F 3 cells. To further study the role <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> genes in the regulation of myoblast growth and differentiation, the expression patterns <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 1 - 4 in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were analyzed: in contrast to the C 2 C 12 myoblasts, rip 2 expression was not downregulated after the induction of differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Furthermore, in contrast to normal myoblasts, they did not express the rip 3 and rip 4 genes. The focus was now on the functional role <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 2 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells: inhibition <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 2 gene expression in C 2 C 12 and in rhabdomyosarcoma cells using specific siRNAs led to decreased proliferation and promoted the differentiation process of these cells.

40|$|RIP 1 is an adaptor kinase {{originally}} {{identified as}} being able to associate with TNFR 1 and Fas, and is later shown {{to be involved in}} signaling induced by TLRs. Major signaling pathways regulated by RIP 1 include necroptosis, apoptosis, and pro-survival/inflammation NF-B activation. Previous studies show that RIP 1 deficiency has no effect on mouse embryogenesis, but blocks postnatal development. This phenotype could not readily be explained, since mice lacking TNFR 1, Fas, or TLRs show no apparent developmental defect. Certain types <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 1 -deficient cells are hypersensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis. However, in our previous study, deletion of the apoptotic adaptor protein, FADD, provides marginal improvement of postnatal development <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 1 -/- mice. Remarkably, the current data shows that haploid insufficiency <b>of</b> <b>RIP</b> 3, a known mediator of necroptosis, allowed survival <b>of</b> <b>rip</b> 1 -/-fadd-/- mice beyond weaning age, although the resulting rip 1 -/-fadd-/- rip 3 +/- mice were significant smaller in size and weight.
