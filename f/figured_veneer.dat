50|$|The most {{complete}} British organised-harpsichord is that constructed for the Earl of Wemyss. The harpsichord {{is typical of}} the early and ornate work of Jacob Kirckman, with an organ case that matches the marquetry and elaborate <b>figured</b> <b>veneer</b> of the harpsichord. The harpsichord stop levers are laid out in the conventional fashion {{on either side of the}} name-board, with the organ stops being placed at either side of the keyboards with a coupling mechanism to the organ at the front of the harpsichord.|$|E
50|$|It is {{considered}} a tropical hardwood with a clear, cylindrical bole to 80 ft. It can grow to heights of 180 ft with typical trunk diameters ranging from 36 to 48 in. Anigre has a medium texture with closed pores similar to maple. Growth rings aren’t always well-defined, and the wood can be rather plain-looking; though certain figure is occasionally present, such as curly or mottled grain. The sapwood and the heartwood are not usually distinguishable. The heartwood is a light yellowish-brown, sometimes with a pinkish hue. Color tends to darken with age. The quarter <b>figured</b> <b>veneer</b> has become a popular choice for furniture, cabinetry, and decorative architectural applications. It {{is said to have}} a faint odor similar to Cedar. In its untreated form Anigre is susceptible to termite and fungi attacks and generally has low durability. Anigre is usually considered easy to work with hand and power tools, although depending on the origin of the wood it can have a high silica content which can dull wood working tools quickly.|$|E

5000|$|Ornamentation is minimal, in {{contrast}} to earlier 17th-century and William and Mary styles, which prominently featured inlay, <b>figured</b> <b>veneers,</b> paint, and carving. The cabriole leg is the [...] "most recognizable element" [...] of Queen Anne furniture. Cabriole legs were influenced by the designs of the French cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle and the Rococo style from the French court of Louis XV. But the intricate ornamentation of post-Restoration furniture was abandoned in favor more conservative designs, possibly {{under the influence of}} the simple and elegant lines of imported Chinese furniture.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid acacia, {{produced}} from natural crossing between two introduced timber species Acacia mangium and A. auriculiformies {{has been studied}} for assessing the suitability of plywood and particleboard manufacture. It was found that 1. 5 mm thick smooth and <b>figured</b> <b>veneer</b> can be made and dried easily. Three-ply plywood were made using veneer of this species bonded with liquid urea formaldehyde glue of 50 % solid content extended with wheat flower and catalyzed (ammonium chloride) with 2 % hardener under the specific pressures, viz., 1. 05, 1. 40 and 1. 76 N/mm 2 in three replications at 6 minute press time and 120 oC press temperature. Dry and wet shear test were conducted on the sample and their shear load at failure per unit area and percentage of wood failure were determined. 1. 76 N/mm 2 pressure for the manufacture of ply wood {{is found to be}} the best. The particleboard was tested for determining the strength and dimensional stability. The bending strength passed the standard specification, tensile strength was found to be low as per Indian standard...|$|E

5000|$|Jean-Pierre Latz (Paris, 4 August 1754 [...] ) {{was one of}} {{the handful}} of truly {{outstanding}} cabinetmakers (ébénistes) working in Paris in the mid-18th century. Like several of his peers in the French capital, he was of German origin. His furniture is in a fully developed rococo style, employing boldly sculptural gilt-bronze mounts complementing marquetry motifs of flowers and leafy sprays, in <b>figured</b> tropical <b>veneers</b> like tulipwood, amarante, purpleheart and rosewood, often featuring the distinctive end-grain cuts. He also produced lacquered pieces, most famously the slant-front desk in the collection of Stavros Niarchos, Paris.|$|R

50|$|The most {{elaborate}} furniture in this style was made around 1815-25, often incorporating columns with rope-twist carving, animal-paw feet, anthemion, stars, and acanthus-leaf ornamentation, sometimes {{in combination with}} gilding and vert antique (antique green, simulating aged bronze). The Red Room at the White House is {{a fine example of}} American Empire style. A simplified version of American Empire furniture, {{often referred to as the}} Grecian style, generally displayed plainer surfaces in curved forms, highly <b>figured</b> mahogany <b>veneers,</b> and sometimes gilt-stencilled decorations. Many examples of this style survive, exemplified by massive chests of drawers with scroll pillars and glass pulls, work tables with scroll feet and fiddleback chairs. Elements of the style enjoyed a brief revival in the 1890s with, particularly, chests of drawers and vanities or dressing tables, usually executed in oak and oak veneers.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the form}} and the {{respective}} patented movement (in 1818) were invented by the clockmaker and this timekeeper was devised to offer an alarm mechanism in a high-style shelf clock. Originally known as the [...] "Patent Alarm Timepiece", S. Willard's patent also refers to them as [...] "alarum (sic) clocks", they have become known as lighthouse clocks (a 20th century term) for their obvious similarities. The design of the cases {{were based on the}} classical art then in vogue; Neoclassicism and Empire. Some of these clocks, however, are less formal and reflect the vernacular interest in painted furniture, particularly Windsor chairs. Therefore, the wood cases are quite varied in design, quality and workmanship, and they could be paint and stencil decorated or mahogany with decorative ormolu brass mounts. The best pieces, displayed <b>figured</b> mahogany <b>veneer</b> as the finest Empire parlour furnitures. Few original Willard lighthouse clocks have survived and it is estimated that about 200 to 300 examples of this highly sought-after collector timepiece remain.|$|R
