5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total <b>daily</b> <b>amount</b> of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the maximum <b>daily</b> {{precipitation}} <b>amounts</b> in Romania for the period 1961 - 1996. The data were collected from 96 meteorological stations distributed over the entire Romanian territory. The annual maximum of <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> for successive years over the period 1961 - 1996 and the absolute maximum of the maximum <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> for the period 1961 - 1996 were determined for each station. A statistical analysis of the annual values of maximum <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> was performed in order to provide their spatial and temporal variability. Various statistical characteristics of maximum <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> during the whole period analyzed, like the annual mean, the standard deviation and the coefficient of linear trend were mapped over Romania. The annual maximum of the <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> series shows mostly a decreasing trend during the analyzed period, but statistically significant trends were found only at a few stations in Romania. The temporal variability and linear trends of maximum <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> were presented for selected Romanian stations. The influence of the atmospheric circulation on the extreme daily precipitation was analyzed by using the large-scale pattern classification expressed by Hess-Brezowsky weather types. The highest <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>amounts</b> occur usually during circulation types with cyclonic centre or cyclonic trough over south-eastern Europe. However, heavy rainfalls may occur over Romania during other situations including those with high pressure...|$|R

60|$|You will be {{astonished}} when I {{tell you}} what this curious play of carbon amounts to. A candle will burn some four, five, six, or seven hours. What, then, must be the <b>daily</b> <b>amount</b> of carbon going {{up into the air}} in the way of carbonic acid! What a quantity of carbon must go from each of us in respiration! What a wonderful change of carbon must take place under these circumstances of combustion or respiration! A man in twenty-four hours converts as much as seven ounces of carbon into carbonic acid; a milch cow will convert seventy ounces, and a horse seventy-nine ounces, solely by the act of respiration. That is, the horse in twenty-four hours burns seventy-nine ounces of charcoal, or carbon, in his organs of respiration, to supply his natural warmth in that time. All the warm-blooded animals get their warmth in this way, by the conversion of carbon, not in a free state, but in a state of combination. And what an extraordinary notion this gives us of the alterations going on in our atmosphere. As much as 5,000,000 pounds, or 548 tons, of carbonic acid is formed by respiration in London alone in twenty-four hours. And where does all this go? Up into the air. If the carbon had been like the lead which I shewed you, or the iron which, in burning, produces a solid substance, what would happen? Combustion could not go on. As charcoal burns, it becomes a vapour and passes off into the atmosphere, which is the great vehicle, the great carrier for conveying it away to other places. Then, what becomes of it? Wonderful is it to find that the change produced by respiration, which seems so injurious to us (for we cannot breathe air twice over), is the very life and support of plants and vegetables that grow upon the surface of the earth. It is the same also under the surface, in the great bodies of water; for fishes and other animals respire upon the same principle, though not exactly by contact with the open air.|$|E

40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to argue that {{recommendations}} to the general public on <b>daily</b> <b>amounts</b> for low-risk alcohol consumption must retain the word ‘regular’ in order to avoid being rejected. Method Narrative review of the evidence-base for daily limits to alcohol consumption, the guidance the public actually receives in the UK and media reactions to this guidance. Results Evidence for daily limits (not more than 3 – 4 units for men and 2 – 3 units for women) rests on epidemiological surveys that enquire about ‘average’ or ‘usual’ amounts of consumption and this is reflected by the use of ‘regular’ or ‘consistent’ in the UK Government's Sensible Drinking report in 1995 and in guidance currently issued by the English Department of Health. In contrast, guidance the public actually receives often omits the word ‘regular’ and implies that the limits in question are maximum <b>daily</b> <b>amounts.</b> Media reactions to this inaccurate information suggest that the general public is likely to find these recommendations incredible and to reject them. Conclusion If guidance to the public on <b>daily</b> drinking <b>amounts</b> is to stand any chance of being credible and effective, it must be accurate and must therefore retain the word ‘regular’...|$|R
