40|$|Adventitious {{presence}} {{of genetically modified}} crops (AGMP) in their non-GM counterparts is an important problem in the EU, where a policy of coexistence {{between the two is}} being sought. The economic impacts of AGMP could be severe and could prevent the practical application of GM coexistence measures. To date, research has concentrated on the contribution of pollen gene flow as the major source of AGMP, while other sources have not been investigated. We have examined the potential for AGMP from the use of shared farm equipment and transport, which has previously been assumed to have a low contribution. Oilseed rape (OSR) was examined in a typical UK production regime including tillage, sowing, spraying, harvesting and grain drying. At each stage in the process, OSR in the machinery was measured and its potential for AGMP calculated. In sowing and grain <b>drying,</b> <b>mustard</b> grain was used as a proxy for GM grain and was measured during the processes by real-time PCR quantification to give estimates of GM dilution rates during the processes. The effects of cleaning and other mitigation methods were examined. Total potential AGMP was estimated at 1. 47 % when no mitigation was performed, and 0. 08 % when machinery was cleaned.

40|$|Modern {{agriculture}} {{is in need}} of alternative methods of pest control due to a rise in pest resistance and growing demand for organic crops. Brassicaceae seed meal extracts show potential as natural pesticides, and are more consistent and manageable than using Brassicaceae seed meal itself. In Oriental (Brassica juncea L.) mustard, the glucosinolate sinigrin hydrolyzes to produce the biologically active compound 2 -propenyl isothiocyanate, which can be used to control nematodes and other soil pests. Due to the extraction process, the mustard meal extract requires formulation with myrosinase enzyme from mustard meal, a buffer, and ascorbic acid to facilitate the hydrolysis reaction and formation of 2 -propenyl isothiocyanate. We are researching how to formulate the mustard meal extract for optimal release of active pesticidal compounds when applied to varying soil types. The 2 -propenyl isothiocyanate is unstable and difficult to quantify in the soil environment, so we have researched alternative methods of quantifying product formation via an enzymatic assay and ion chromatography. Methods for producing and <b>drying</b> the powdered <b>mustard</b> meal extract are being analyzed as well as optimization of the added myrosinase, buffer, and ascorbic acid to result in an effective extract formulation with the potential for organic certification...|$|R
40|$|Mustard (Brassica juncea) is a {{significant}} component of the world production of vegetable oils. Mustard is a thermophilic and very drought-resistant plant well adapted for <b>dry</b> continental climates. <b>Mustard</b> (Brassica juncea) is a drought-resistant crop which can tolerate water stress and can be grown in rotation with other crop species. Mustard is relatively undemanding to soil and it can even grow on saline soils. The nutrients most important for the growth and development of mustard are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The study was conducted during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 growing seasons on a meadow chestnut soil at the "Agrouniversity " experiment station of the Kazakh National Agrarian University at Almaty, Kazakhstan to evaluate the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers on the production of mustard in short crop rotations. Nitrogen rates of 0, 40 and 75 kg ha- 1 gave seed yields of 1. 628, 2. 095 and 2. 191 Mg ha- 1, respectively. Protein yields were 0. 402, 0. 543 and 0. 573 Mg ha- 1 and oil yields were 0. 352, 0. 498 and 0. 505 mg ha- 1 for the three respective N rates.

40|$|Abstract Given the {{abundance}} of non-native spe-cies invading wildland habitats, managers need to employ informed triage to focus control efforts on weeds with the greatest potential for negative impacts. Our objective here {{was to determine the}} level of threat Sahara mustard, Brassica tournefortii, represents to meeting regional goals for protecting biodiversity. Sahara mustard has spread throughout much of the Mojave and lower Sonoran Deserts. It has occurred in southern California’s Coachella Valley for nearly 80 years, punctuated by years of extremely high abundance following high rainfall. In those years the mustard has clear negative impacts on the native flora. Using mustard removal experiments we identified reductions in native plant reproduction, shifting composition increasingly toward Sahara mustard while decreasing the fraction of native species. High between-year variance in precipitation may be a key to maintaining biodiversity as the mustard is less abundant in <b>drier</b> years. Sahara <b>mustard</b> impacts to the native fauna were much less evident. Of the animal species evaluated, only the Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard, Uma inornata, demonstrated a negative response to mustard abun-dance; however the impacts were short-lived, lasting no {{more than a year after}} the mustard’s dominance waned. Without control measures the long-term impacts to desert biodiversity may rest on the changing climate. Wetter conditions or increased periodicity of high rainfall years will favor Sahara mustard and result in reduced biodiversity, especially of native annual plants. Drier conditions will keep the mustard from becoming dominant but may have other negative consequences on the native flora and fauna...|$|R

The soil was amended with fly ash at the rates of 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 % (w/w). Our {{results showed that the}} uptake of Cd, Pb and Zn from soil to mustard root increased with the increase in fly ash application rates, but their root to shoot translocation was relatively restricted. Increase in chlorophyll content and <b>dry</b> mass of <b>mustard</b> plant on treatments ≥ 20 % even at elevated accumulation of Cd (1. 67 mgkg(- 1)), Pb (18. 25 mgkg(- 1)) and Zn (74. 45 mgkg(- 1) dry weight) in its shoot showed relatively higher tolerance of selected mustard cultivar to heavy metal stress. The transfer coefficient (TC(1)) of Cd from mustard shoot to aphid was always > 1, indicating that Cd biomagnified in aphids at second trophic level. But, there was no biomagnification of Cd in adult beetles at third trophic level. Zinc accumulation was 2. 06 to 2. 40 times more in aphids than their corresponding host shoots and 1. 26 - 1. 35 times more in adult beetles than their prey (aphids) on which they fed. Lead was only metal whose TC was 0. 05) biomass and predation rate of predatory beetles indicated that all levels of soil amendments with fly ash did not have any lethal or sub-lethal effects on beetles...|$|R
40|$|Oilseed {{and pulse}} crops have been {{increasingly}} used to replace conventional summer fallow and diversify cropping systems in northern high latitude areas. The knowledge of water use (WU) and its distribution {{profile in the}} soil is essential for optimizing cropping systems aimed at improving water use efficiency (WUE). This study characterized water use and distribution profile for pulse and oilseed crops compared to spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a semiarid environment. Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) ], three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) ], and spring wheat were seeded in removable 100  cm deep x   15  cm diameter lysimeters placed in an Aridic Haploboroll soil, in southwest Saskatchewan in 2006 and 2007. Crops were studied under rainfed and irrigated conditions where lysimeters were removed and sampled for plant biomass and WU at various soil depths. Wheat yields were greater than pulse crop yields which were greater than oilseed yields, and WUE averaged 4. 08  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for pulse crops, 3. 64  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for oilseeds, and ranged between 5. 5 and 7. 0  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for wheat. Wheat used water faster than pulse and oilseed crops with crop growth. Pulse crops extracted water mostly from the upper 60  cm soil depths, and left more water unused in the profile at maturity compared to oilseeds or wheat. Among the three pulses, lentil used {{the least amount of}} water and appeared to have a shallower rooting depth than chickpea and dry pea. Soil WU and distribution profile under canola and mustard were generally similar; both using more water than flax. Differences in WU and distribution profile were similar for crops grown under rainfall and irrigation conditions. A deep rooting crop grown after pulses may receive more benefits from water conservation in the soil profile than when grown after oilseed or wheat. Alternating pulse crops with oilseeds or wheat in a well-planned crop sequence may improve WUE for the entire cropping systems in semiarid environments.
