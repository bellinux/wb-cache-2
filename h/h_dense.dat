40|$|Abstract. The use {{of ceramic}} {{coatings}} and tailored composite materials has gained interest for many structural applications. Dipping and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) have demonstrated to be economic and simple methods to obtain coatings and self-supported microlaminates, while gelcasting with biopolymers {{is a powerful}} route for manufacturing complex-shaped bulk parts. The combination of these two forming processes {{has led to the}} development of a new method for manufacturing ceramic coatings from aqueous suspensions. Graphite and ceramic substrates were coated with Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 films by combining either dipping or EPD with carrageenan gelation. The rheological behaviour of Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 aqueous suspensions was studied as a function of temperature focusing the effect of the concentration of gelling additive and the volume fraction of particles. Its effect on the EPD conditions was also studied in order to obtain uniform and reliable films.

40|$|Corn {{gluten meal}} (CGM) {{has been shown}} to be an {{effective}} natural preemergence herbicide and fertilizer for various plant production systems. Alaninyl-alanine (Ala-Ala), along with four other dipeptides, were isolated from CGM and identified as being the inhibitory compounds. The herbicidal effects are seen as growth-regulating, root inhibitors that have minimal effect on shoots at low concentrations. Little is known about the inhibitory action of CGM or Ala-Ala;The objective of the first phase of this research was to elucidate morphological and anatomical differences in perennial ryegrass seedlings treated with Ala-Ala using light and transmission electron microscopy, as well autoradiographic studies using (3 H+) -Ala-Ala. Results from these experiments described the treated root tips as being void of cellular components, specifically discernible nuclei and mitotic structures, with an overall loss of cytoplasmic integrity. Furthermore, root tips had extreme cell wall abnormalities including uneven thickening and breakage. Autoradiographs suggested that at high treatment concentrations causing epidermal tissue damage, there was minimal inward movement of dipeptide. At lower concentrations, root tip epidermal necrosis was not evident, and inward movement of Ala-Ala was not impeded;The objectives of the second phase of research were to use time-course studies to monitor the mitotic activity of roots treated with Ala-Ala; to use light and transmission electron microscopy to describe Ala-Ala induced changes in root cell ultrastructure; and to make comparisons with other reported modes of action of synthetic herbicides. Results showed that Ala-Ala exhibited activity on mitosis within 4 h of exposure, and by 6 h, reduction in the number of mitotic figures was nearly 100 %, resulting in only interphase cells.

While the strength of the [C ii] line correlates with the star formation rate, the contributions of the various gas phases to the [C ii] emission on galactic scales are not well established. In this study we establish an empirical multi-component model of the ISM, including <b>dense</b> <b>H</b> ii regions, <b>dense</b> photon dissociation regions (PDRs), the warm ionized medium (WIM), low density and surfaces of molecular clouds (SfMCs), and the cold neutral medium (CNM). We test our model on ten luminous regions within the two nearby galaxies NGC 3184 and NGC 628 on angular scales of 500 - 600 pc. Both galaxies are part of the Herschel key program KINGFISH, and are complemented by a large set of ancillary ground- and space-based data. The five modeled phases together reproduce the observed [C ii] emission quite well, overpredicting the total flux slightly (about 45 %) averaged over all regions. We find that dense PDRs are the dominating component, contributing 68 % of the [C ii] flux on average, followed by the WIM and the SfMCs, with mean contributions of about half of the contribution from dense PDRs, each. CNM and <b>dense</b> <b>H</b> ii regions are only minor contributors with less than 5 % each.

40|$|Sparse {{and dense}} {{cultures}} of chick embryo cells were affected differently by pH. The rates of cell multiplication and of thymidine- 3 H incorporation into DNA of dense cultures were increased as the pH was increased from 6. 6 to 7. 6. At pH higher than 7. 6 {{the rate of}} multiplication decreased slightly in the dense cultures, but the rate of thymidine 3 H incorporation continued to increase. The discrepancy was {{due in part to}} cell death and detachment at very high pH, and in part to a more rapid uptake of thymidine- 3 H at very high pH. Sparse cultures were much less sensitive to pH reduction and, when a suitably conditioned medium was used to minimize cell damage, very sparse cultures grew almost as well at pH 6. 7 as at higher pH. The rates of cell multiplication and thymidine- 3 H incorporation at low pH decreased in the initially sparse cultures before they reached confluent cell densities. There was no microscope evidence of direct contact between plasma membranes of cells at these densities although the parallel orientation indicated that the cells were influencing locally each other's behavior. Even at much higher cell densities, electron microscopy revealed large intercellular gaps partly filled with a fragmentary electron-opaque material suspected to be glycoprotein. Wounding experiments showed that pH affected cell migration {{in a manner similar to}} its effects on cell multiplication. Low pH inhibited cell migration, but those cells which migrated into the denuded region multiplied as rapidly at low pH as at high pH. The effects of pH on growth were correlated with effects on the uptake of 2 -deoxyglucose- 3 <b>H.</b> <b>Dense</b> populations of cells inhibited by low pH were stimulated to incorporate thymidine- 3 H by the addition of small amounts of diethylaminoethyl-dextran.
