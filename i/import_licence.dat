40|$|This ban {{comes into}} force with {{immediate}} effect on Friday 22 July 2011. Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine which is currently not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (1971 Act) in the UK. Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs's advice: The UK Government has received independent expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that phenazepam is sufficiently harmful to justify an immediate import ban under the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> pending its control as a Class C drug under the 1971 Act. The ACMD’s assessment reports that phenazepam is being marketed as a so called ‘legal high’ product, particularly on the internet. It {{has been identified as}} being a potent member of the benzodiazepine family causing harms such as amnesia and drowsiness that may potentially proceed to a coma with respiratory depression. Whilst phenazepam has been recognised to have limited medicinal properties, it is not prescribed in the UK for treatment neither does it have a UK marketing authorisation. Further, it has no legitimate commercial or industrial uses in the UK. This amendment to the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> will remain in place until such time as it is revoked. This will likely occur when phenazepam is fully controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 where it will be a criminal offence to unlawfully import, export, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply and be in simple possession of this substance without a licence or lawful authority.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of contemporary sugar trade policy in Indonesia highlights {{problems in the}} institutional framework for trade policy making. The institutions through which sugar trade policy is formulated entrench the interests of rent-seeking bureaucrats, <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> holders and traders {{to the detriment of}} consumers and downstream producers of processed products. Moreover, the resulting trade policy regime has problematic effects on sugarcane farmers. The structure of regulatory intervention is due less to democratic pressures than to the inclusion of vested interests in the institutions that formulate policy. Further, the lack of effective mechanisms for inter-ministerial coordination and for resolving conflicting policy preferences among ministries hinders the development of coherent trade policy and obstructs reform efforts. An institutional framework that facilitates representation of all interests affected by sugar trade policies and public scrutiny of the effects of policy intervention is likely to deliver better outcomes for consumers and producers alike. ...|$|E

40|$|The Czech Republic {{is part of}} {{integrated}} domestic market of the European Union and it is abided by rules of the Common agricultural policy for the common organization {{of the market for}} single sectors of commodities in case of agrarian products. All Czech commodities have free access on the whole territory of domestic market of the European Union without the tariff and non-tariff barriers. It was abolished the customs procedure, the proving of the origin and the founding of bonded warehouse and the paying of licence fee and charges for certification. The Czech farmers (vine-growers) can operate in stabilized business environment on the basis of definite rules of economic competition. The Czech Republic within a regulation of an agrarian trade must manage common regulations of a horizontal character and vertical regulations for the sectors of commodities after the integration into the EU. The regulation is executed through the common organization of the market. The common organization of the market in wine is based on three principles – regulation of the supply, regulation of the wine quality and regulation of the market. These rules are concerned with domestic market, when the commodities move within European Union and within foreign trade, when commodities are transported a frontier. The regulation of external agrarian trade, which is concerned with conditions of import and conditions of export, is executed through the so-called trade mechanisms. The <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> and export licence, export aid and guarantee belong among these mechanisms of regulation. The intervention purchases, sales, support of private storage and so on belong among basic tools of regulation of domestic agrarian market.
