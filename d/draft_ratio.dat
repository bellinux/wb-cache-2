50|$|Heel {{induced drag}} - When a sailing yacht heels, there are {{adjustments}} which {{need to be}} made to the base resistance of the hull due to the modified hull geometry, all of which are captured by this term. The first change is the wetted surface area of the hull, which will result in a greater viscous drag if increased. More significantly, however, are the changes in residuary resistance when heeled. The underwater portion of the hull will no longer be symmetric and will usually result in increased residuary resistance. This is particularly true if there are major changes to the beam to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> or the longitudinal center of buoyancy.|$|E
5000|$|The Taylor Series allows {{variation}} of the slenderness ratio, beam to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio,</b> and prismatic coefficient. While these are far from the only parameters that can be varied in a warship's hull design, {{it is possible to}} get a preliminary estimate of ship resistance from the series for essentially all warships, and many merchant ships, built since Taylor's time. Taylor's main contribution was to recognize that these three simple parameters were the critical ones for ship performance. A Taylor series estimate is accurate enough to plan the model test and to develop an idea of how much power will be required to achieve design speed, prior to model testing the actual hull form. Today the Taylor Series has been programmed in electronic form and is used in several ship [...] "synthesis models" [...] to do feasibility studies for new ships.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ship sailing {{resistance}} {{is an important}} index of cross section size optimization of restricted channel. Through real ship experiment with one typical ship in inland restricted channel, the relationship between ship sailing resistance and factors such as water depth to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio,</b> discharge section area and so on is studied. And modified calculation formula of ship sailing {{resistance is}} put forward. The results show that as water depth to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases, or discharge section area becomes smaller, ship sailing resistance will increase significantly. By introducing two parameters: section blockage ratio and water depth to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio,</b> the Zivankov formula of ship sailing resistance calculation is modified, and the calculation accuracy which the modified formula applied in restricted channel has greatly improved...|$|E

There are many parameters of cross section which affect the physical and mechanical properties of {{textured yarns}}. These parameters are surface area, perimeter, equivalent diameter, large diameter, small diameter, convexity, stiffness, eccentricity, and hydraulic diameter. These parameters were evaluated by digital image processing techniques. To find trends between production criteria and evaluated parameters of cross section, three criteria of production line have been adjusted and different types of yarns were produced. These criteria are temperature, <b>drafting</b> <b>ratio,</b> and D/Y ratio. Finally the relations between production criteria and cross section parameters were considered. The results showed that the presented technique can recognize and measure the parameters of fiber cross section in acceptable accuracy.

40|$|Stability is one {{of safety}} {{parameters}} of ships in seaways {{as required by the}} International Maritime Organization (IMO) or national ship classification in order to get safety certificates. Therefore characteristics the ship stability should be initially controlled in design stage. In order to easily investigate the ship stability in design process, it is necessary to investigate relationship between the ship geometry and stability characteristics. This paper discuss effect of several geometry characteristics of ship, such as breadth and <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> as well as freeboard and breadth ratio. These geometries ratio are varied in a certain range and calculate righting arm of the ships. The obtained righting arms are evaluated using the IMO intact stability kriteria. Basec on the evaluation results, the minimum breadth and <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> as well as the minimum freeboard and breadth ratio can be obtained as function of vertical center of gravity and height ratio. These results show that the ship stability tends to increase when the breadth and <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. The ships with larger draft have better stability than the smaller one for the same breadth and draft ration. The ship stability also increases when the freeboard and breadth ration increase. In cases of freeboard and breadth ration less than 0, 06 the difference of stability characteristics are not significant for all ships subject. A significant difference occurs when the ratio of freeboard and breadth is larger than 0, 10. This difference may caused by the hull form characteristics such as the block coefficient of the subject ships...|$|E
40|$|As in many {{coastal and}} estuary areas, {{navigation}} to {{and in the}} Belgian harbours takes place in environmental and operational conditions which differ from the design conditions of sea-going ships: water depth to <b>draft</b> <b>ratios</b> vary between 2. 0 and 1. 1 {{which means that the}} under keel clearance is often restricted to 10 % of the ship’s draft. In addition, low ship velocities have to be considered as manoeuvring in harbour areas is characterised by a wide range of speed - propeller rpm combinations. Based on the results of captive model tests executed in the Towing Tank for Manoeuvres in Shallow Water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research - Ghent University, Antwerp, Belgium) with a 6000 TEU containership and the tanker Esso Osaka, an optimized test program has been developed for the determination of a mathematical manoeuvring model in later-ally unrestricted water. Contrary to deep water and service speed the selected test types and test parameters will influence the measured contributions of the modules hull, propeller and rudder in shallow water: as an example, stationary oblique towing and harmonic sway tests may lead to dif-ferent results, while the reliability of the test results is much more sensitive to the selected test pa-rameters during PMM tests.

40|$|Finite {{water depth}} effect for wave-body {{problems}} are studied by continuous Rankine source method and non- desingularized technique. Free surface and seabed surface profiles {{are represented by}} continuous panels rather than a discretization by isolated points. These panels are positioned exactly on the fluid boundary surfaces and therefore no desingularization technique is required. Space increment method is applied for both free surface source and seabed source arrangements to reduce computational cost and improve numerical efficiency. Fourth order Runge-Kutta iteration scheme is adopted on the free surface updating at every time step. The finite water depth effect is studied quantitatively {{for a series of}} cylinders with different B/T ratios. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model are validated by comparison with published numerical results and experimental data. Numerical results show that hydrodynamic coefficients vary for cylinder bodies with different ratios of B/T. For certain set of B/T ratios the effect of finite water depth increases quickly with the increase of motion frequency and becomes stable when frequency is relatively large. It also shows that water depths have larger hydrodynamic effects on cylinder with larger breadth to <b>draft</b> <b>ratios.</b> Both the heave added mass and damping coefficients increase across the frequency range with the water depths decrease for forced heave motion.

[Methods] Based {{on the theory}} of three-dimensional potential flow, the buoyant motion response of a buoy is calculated. A type of array of wave-power navigational lighting buoys located in an offshore seadrome is proposed,and a procedure for the design optimization of its component buoys is presented. Matching the best Power Take-Off(PTO) damping, the diameter to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> and array distance with the best energy capture width ratio are acquired, and the energy capture for the short-term forecast of the buoy array is accomplished. On this basis, combined with the actual sea conditions, energy capture for the long-term forecast of an individual buoy is accomplished. The influence of the buoy diameter, buoy draft and array distance on the energy capture width ratio is discussed. [Results] The {{results show that the}} energy capture width ratio is at its greatest when the diameter to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> is between 2. 4 - 2. 6; the smaller the distance between array buoys, the greater the energy capture width of each buoy.

40|$|Maritime Administration (MarAd) in {{cooperation}} with Hydronautics Inc., motivated by the rising interest for full hull form merchant ships in the early 1970 ’s {{and the lack of}} systematic data regarding the performance of these vessels, developed the so-called MARAD Systematic Series, comprised of 16 full hullforms, specifically designed for use as bulk carriers and tankers. The experimental resistance data are available in a series of diagrams illustrating the residual resistance coefficient {{as a function of the}} geometric characteristics of each hull for a range of Froude numbers. The present thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to estimate the residual resistance coefficient, and subsequently the resistance, of hullforms designed according to MARAD Systematic Series, given their main dimensions and block coefficient. The data used for the training of the networks were collected from five diagrams, which are provided by the Series, and illustrate the resistance coefficient for different combinations of their length to breadth and breadth to <b>draft</b> <b>ratios</b> and block coefficient. To this end, three different types of ANNs have been considered; Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The performance of a network, regardless its type, is affected by its characteristics, among which its architecture and learning method are of particular importance. Several trials have been conducted for every type of network, changing systematically these characteristics. The developed networks have been thoroughly evaluated, assessing their potential to accurately predict the resistance of MARAD-type hullforms. A total number of 616 networks were developed; 380 MLPs, 125 RBFs and 111 SVMs. Selected alternatives of these networks, i. e. 4 MLPs, 2 RBFs and 2 SVMs are presented and their potential for the prediction of MARAD hullforms’ resistance is discussed. The deviations of the best-performing networks’ predictions from the resistance data provided by MARAD were not higher than 1. 6 % for hullform characteristics inside the limits of the training dataset and 6. 8 % outside them. ANNs are quick and effective in estimating the resistance of MARAD hullforms, eliminating the need for searching through the diagrams that provided their training data. The results indicate that their use could be successfully applied also in the case of other Systematic Series. In addition, it might be argued that ANNs could be successfully trained to estimate calm water resistance of selected hullform types, based on the results of systematic calculations using advanced CFD software tools...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} the {{analysis}} of the motion of icebergs in waves is presented and the possible interaction effects between the iceberg and waves as well as its interaction with offshore structures is briefly discussed along with the hydrodynamic aspects involved in the analysis of wave induced motions of icebergs. A combined theoretical and experimental study for the estimation of the first order wave induced motions in surge and heave of a free floating iceberg in a regular wave field is presented. The theoretical model is based on the mathematical formulations of Garrison (1979) and Standing (1979) which employ a three dimensional source distribution technique. The computed model results have been compared with the previous analytical model and good agreement has been found. The computed results are then compared with the measured heave and surge motions of the model icebergs which agree quite well, within the limits of experimental error. The computational and experimental models are not meant to address in detail all the hydrodynamic aspects of wave interaction with a free floating iceberg. Only the oscillatory motions of icebergs have been computed and measured. The results indicate that the surge and heave velocity of model icebergs, with a draft to water depth ratio of less than 0. 1 can be greater than 0. 8 times the water particle velocity when the iceberg horizontal dimension is less than 0. 3 times the wavelength. Additional computational and experimental model studies showed that the surge motion is reduced to less than 0. 1 times the particle velocity when the <b>draft</b> to depth <b>ratio</b> is about 0. 9 and the horizontal dimensions of the iceberg are increased to 0. 5 times the wavelength.

After winning, {{at the age}} of twenty-two, {{the highest}} academic distinction at Louvain, he decided to follow his stepbrother and enter the Society of Jesus, and was sent to St. Ignatius of Loyola in Rome, who received him into the Society. On the completion of his novitiate, Theodorich was appointed professor of theology in Vienna, but was soon after appointed rector of the Jesuit College at Munich. Here, in 1562, one of the first productions in Germany of the morality play Homulus (corresponding to the English Everyman or the Dutch Elckerlijc) was given in Latin by the students under his direction. From Munich, where he was succeeded in 1565 by the celebrated Paul Hoffaeus, he was transferred to Dillingen, where for twenty years he presided over the college and the academy and laboured with zeal and success for the improvement of studies and for the religious training of the students. From 1565 to 1582 he held the office of chancellor of the university. In company with his distinguished brother, he attended the first provincial congregation of the Society of Jesus in Upper Germany, and furthered important reforms in the teaching of philosophy. In 1585 he was made rector of the Jesuit College of Ingolstadt, and in this capacity {{became a member of the}} German commission which tested in practice the first <b>draft</b> of the <b>Ratio</b> Studiorum.

Two years later, on the advice of his physician, he was relieved of the burden and allowed to return to Lucerne. A fortnight after his arrival the death of St. Peter Canisius was announced; the shock deprived Theodorich of memory and speech, an affliction which he bore with exemplary patience for seven years. For his amiable disposition and spotless purity of life he deservedly received the surname of Angelus 'angel'. In 1604, he was transferred again to Ingolstadt, where he died, and was interred in the church of the Holy Cross.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of the mooring system on the dynamic response of a point-absorber type ocean-wave energy converter (WEC) is investigated using a frequency-domain approach. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of WECs, careful consideration of the response and resonance frequencies in all motions must be evaluated, including the effects of the mooring system. In this study, a WEC floater with a closed, flat bottom is modeled as a rigid vertical cylinder tethered by elastic mooring lines. The WEC hydrodynamic added mass and damping are obtained using established potential-flow methods, with additional damping provided by the energy-extraction system. The results show that the response of the WEC, and the corresponding power takeoff, varies with the diameter-to-draft (D=T) ratio, mooring system stiffness, and mass distribution. For a given wave climate in Northern California, near San Francisco, the heave energy extraction is found to be best for a shallow WEC with a soft mooring system, compared to other systems that were examined. This result assumes a physical limit (cap) on the motion which is related to the significant wave height to <b>draft</b> <b>ratio.</b> Shallow draft designs, however, may experience excessive pitch motions and relatively larger viscous damping. In order to mitigate the pitch response, the pitch radius of gyration should be small and the center of mass should be low. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|E

An Apron Draft spinning frame was modified in to ring system by incorporating rings and travelers instead of flyers. The experiments were performed for investigating the effect of spindle speed on textile properties and productivity of jute yarn of 103 tex. The spindle speed was varied from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm. The experiments were performed with Bangla White B (BWB) grade jute sliver of finisher drawing of linear density 2415 tex (70 lb/spy). The <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> and the twist used in the experiments were 23 and 240 tpm (turns per meter) respectively. The ring size was KW (4) 76 mm Ø. Steel travelers number 1, Type G, semicircular in shape were used in the experiment. Ten runs were performed for the experiment at the standard atmospheric condition, 20 + 2 ˚C, and relative humidity 65 % + 2 %. The nominal count of the yarn produced was 103 tex. The yarns produced through the experiments were tested for different textile properties. Analysis of the test results shows that the spindle speed greatly influences the textile properties, such as strength, elongation, yarn breakage, productivity, quality ratio etc. of produced yarn.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. An analytical model based on linear potential theory is proposed to predict the three-dimensional wave diffraction from a truncated cylinder with an upper porous sidewall and an inner column in the finite water depth. The velocity potential is analytically derived in the whole fluid domain based on the method of variable separation and eigen-function expansion technique. The continuous conditions of pressure and velocity potential are satisfied on the interface between the adjacent sub-domains. Wave forces are calculated directly from the incident and diffracted potentials. The model is validated in comparison with other published results of wave diffraction from a porous bottom-mounted cylinder and impermeable truncated cylinder, respectively. Then the numerical tests are performed to investigate the effects of the porous coefficient G, the <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> h/h 1 (h and h 1 mean the drafts of the porous part and whole cylinder, respectively), the ratio of the inner and outer radii b/a and the water depth d/h 1 (d means the water depth) on the wave forces acting on the structure. It is found that, by introducing an upper porous sidewall, the hydrodynamic loads are improved in comparison with the fully impermeable structure, which may be benefit to enhance the survivability of the relating marine structure.

Trees provide critical functions to {{the ecology of}} streams. Trees affect hydrology, mitigate sediment inputs, and buffer water temperatures by providing shade. Watersheds with {{a higher proportion of}} mature forest tend to have less variable hydrographs, and older trees provide larger pieces of wood to streams. Instream wood itself affects nearly every process in stream ecology. Despite their ecological importance, trees and instream wood have been greatly modified by humans. The studies described in this dissertation advance current knowledge as follows: We demonstrate that headwater streams in northern forests can require ten years to recover from a large input of fine sediment, depending on the occurrence of stormflows. Our analyses suggest that, at the basin scale, warmer air temperatures in summer are more important to the abundances of some headwater fish species than instream habitat or spring precipitation. The analyses also lend support to previous findings that riparian forest harvest can cause local stream warming. Wood transport in streams is a dynamic process. Forty-one percent of over 800 wood pieces were mobilized (at least 10 m) during a study period by a single high flow event. Thirty-two percent of the mobilized pieces became entrapped again before leaving their study reach. Mobilization of wood in streams is a complex function of both mechanical and hydraulic factors. Eleven potential predictor variables were studied, and seven were identified as significant to wood mobilization using multiple logistic regression. The seven predictors were burial, effective depth, length ratio, bracing, rootwad presence, downstream force ratio, and <b>draft</b> <b>ratio.</b> Entrapment of wood in streams is related primarily to the length ratio and weight of the wood pieces. The mechanisms for entrapment are not always clear; wood pieces may simply be entrapped wherever they are located when high water recedes. Together, this dissertation suggests that forest harvest should avoid excess sediment inputs (due to persistence) and stream warming (due to effects on fish). It also develops models {{that can be used for}} more informed management of instream wood. Stream managers and restorers can apply the results presented to reverse the impacts of historic logging and wood removal on streams...|$|E

Too much yarn hairiness is undesirable for many end uses {{as well as the}} spinning and post spinning processes. The main aims of this project are to examine the hairiness features of various yarns and to reduce yarn hairiness. The thesis covers five related areas – hairiness assessment, factors affecting yarn hairiness, the hairiness of newly developed yarns, yarn hairiness reduction, and effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning. The worsted cashmere, pure wool and wool/cashmere blend yarns were employed to investigate the effect of some fibre parameters on the yarn hairiness. A single exponential distribution of the hair-length was confirmed first, using the data from the Zweigle G 565 Hairiness Meter. A linear relationship was observed between the blend ratio and the hairiness indexes. In particular, the effect of fibre crimp or curvature on yarn hairiness is examined. The theory of yarn hairiness composition was also developed further. The effect of <b>draft</b> <b>ratio</b> and spindle speed on the hairiness of worsted wool yarn was examined next with a factorial experiment design. Several new hairiness indexes, namely the relative hairiness indexes, have been used to explain the results obtained. In the investigation of the hairiness of newly developed yarns, the hairiness of the Compact Spun and Roller-Jet-Spun yarns was examined first. The composition of the yarn hairiness, the hair-length distribution, and the effect of test speed on yarn hairiness were then studied. An important finding is that for both yarns, the predominant hairiness feature is the looped hairs. A comparison of the hairiness of Solospun yarns and the equivalent ring spun wool yarns was undertaken. The hair-length distribution of the Solospun yarn was examined first. The Solospun yarns used had fewer hairs in most hair-length groups and lower variations in hairiness. In addition, the effect of twist level and spindle speed on the hairiness of Solospun and conventional ring spun yarns has also been discussed. A novel approach of reducing yarn hairiness – spinning with a ‘Diagonal’ yarn path was examined next. Both ‘Left Diagonal’ and ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn arrangements were studied. A new finding is that the ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn path leads to reduced hairiness for the Z-twist yarn, while yarn evenness and tenacity are not as sensitive to the modified yarn path. The mechanism of hairiness reduction with the ‘Diagonal’ yarn path has been discussed. The spinning performance of “Right Diagonal” yarn arrangement has also been evaluated. Finally, the effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model has been developed, which represents the first attempt at theoretically investigating the influence of yarn hairiness on energy consumption during the winding stage of ring spinning. The experimental results have generally confirmed predictions of this model. Recommendations for further research in this area have also been made in the concluding chapter of this thesis...|$|E
