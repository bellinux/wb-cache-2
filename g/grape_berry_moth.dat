50|$|Its viticultural {{characteristics}} {{makes it}} prone to producing low yields and a susceptibility to mildew and the <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moth.</b> It {{also tends to}} fall victim to leaf roll, odium and grey rot and requires a long growing season as it tends to bud early and ripen late.It ripens early in Australia for production of low alcohol moscato style wines. Picking can commence in early February. Picking for fortified production can take place in mid-March; this would be regarded as mid-season, not late.Muscat blanc à petits grains {{is one of the}} first harvests in France, starting as early as mid August, in Mireval and other areas of the mediterranean basin, in hot dry years like 2009. The grapes used to produce the fruity sec are picked about seven to ten days earlier than the grapes used to produce the Vin Doux Naturel. Vendange tardive (late harvest) of the grapes is also made to exploit the high sugar and flavour concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims Social, {{environmental}} and regulatory evolution encourages grapegrowers to reduce chemical use. Organic production is one possible answer, but controlling pests and diseases by products allowed in organic production is less easy than with chemicals. We integrated disease severity levels (Botrytis bunch rot, powdery and downy mildews) and pest incidence (<b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moths)</b> {{to develop an}} indicator of pests and disease damage in grape bunches, named assessment indicator of damage in grape bunches (AIDB), {{which can be used}} to assess pest incidence in networks of grower vineyards. Methods and Results In 2011 and 2012, we tested AIDB by monitoring damage at key phenological stages in 20 vineyards in the Bordeaux and Languedoc regions in the south of France, under three modes of production: conventional production, organic production and in conversion to organic production. The indicator proved accurate in describing the total damage on grape bunches under all conditions tested. Conclusions Irrespective of the mode of production, the AIDB value was negatively correlated with yield parameters and the technical expertise of the grower. This indicator proved to be an innovative tool to estimate the multipest damage on grapevines over a range of conditions. Significance of the Study The AIDB enables grapegrowers and advisors to assess the integrated impact of their treatment strategies on grape production, which is necessary when reducing pesticide use...|$|R

40|$|Several {{factors have}} {{prompted}} the reevaluation of control recommendations for key pests of grapes in recent years. First, {{the costs of}} insecticides and their application have risen substantially. Growers who improve the efficiency of their use of pesticides can realize significant savings in production costs. Second, grape processors have responded to consumer desires to minimize pesticide residues in food by promoting judicious use of pesticides. Finally, increased governmental restrictions regarding what pesticides {{can be used in}} vineyards and how they may be used may increase the overall difficulty that growers encounter when using pesticides. The result of these factors is that while producers and processors continue to require control of economically-damaging pests, this now must be achieved with the least amount of pesticide possible. The <b>Grape</b> <b>Berry</b> <b>Moth</b> Risk Assessment Program was developed to address these concerns. In this publication we describe how Risk Assessment can be used to maintain acceptable control of <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moth</b> and the Eastern grape leafhopper while minimizing use of insecticides...|$|E

The goals of this project are to look at the parasitic wasp, Trichogramma ostriniae, to determine if it would parasitize <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moth</b> eggs in the field and to look at the economics of late season losses to this pest and how they relate. An oversimplification of the ‘economics of’ GBM damage is whether a load is rejected at the processing plant.

40|$|For some Lepidopteran pests, {{such as the}} <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moth</b> Paralobesia viteana (Clemens), poor {{correlation}} between males captured in traps baited with sex pheromone and oviposition activities of female moths has called into question the value of pheromone-based monitoring for these species. As an alternative, we compared the capture of female and male <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moth</b> in panel traps baited with synthetic host volatiles with captures of males in pheromone-baited wing traps over two growing seasons in two blocks of grapes in a commercial vineyard in central New York. Lures formulated in hexane to release either 7 -component or 13 -component host volatile blends captured significantly more male and female <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> <b>moth</b> on panel traps compared with the numbers captured on panel traps with hexane-only lures. For both sexes over both years, the same or more moths were captured in panel traps along the forest edge compared with the vineyard edge {{early in the season}} but this pattern was reversed by mid-season. Male moths captured in pheromone-baited wing traps also displayed this temporal shift in location. There was a significant positive {{correlation between}} captured males and females on panel traps although not between females captured on panel traps and males captured in pheromone-baited traps for both years suggesting pheromone traps do not accurately reflect either female or male activity. Male moths captured in pheromone traps indicated a large peak early in each season corresponding to first flight followed by lower and variable numbers that did not clearly indicate second and third flights. Panel trap data, combining males and females, indicated three distinct flights, with some overlap between the second and third flights. Peak numbers of moths captured on panel traps matched well with predictions of a temperature-based phenology model, especially in 2008. Although effective, panel traps baited with synthetic host lures were time consuming to deploy and maintain and captured relatively few moths making them impractical, in the current design, for commercial purpose...|$|E

The acidity of berries is a major parameter in determining <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> quality for wine making and fruit consumption. Despite the importance of malic and tartaric acid (TA) storage and transport for <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> acidity, no vacuolar transporter for malate or tartrate has been identified so far. Some members of the aluminium-activated malate transporter (ALMT) anion channel family from Arabidopsis thaliana {{have been shown to be}} involved in mediating malate fluxes across the tonoplast. Therefore, we hypothesised that a homologue of these channels could have a similar role in V. vinifera <b>grape</b> <b>berries.</b> We identified homologues of the Arabidopsis vacuolar anion channel AtALMT 9 through a TBLASTX search on the V. vinifera genome database. We cloned the closest homologue of AtALMT 9 from <b>grape</b> <b>berry</b> cDNA and designated it VvALMT 9. The expression profile revealed that VvALMT 9 is constitutively expressed in berry mesocarp tissue and that its transcription level increases during fruit maturation. Moreover, we found that VvALMT 9 is targeted to the vacuolar membrane. Using patch-clamp analysis, we could show that, besides malate, VvALMT 9 mediates tartrate currents which are higher than in its Arabidopsis homologue. In summary, in the present study we provide evidence that VvALMT 9 is a vacuolar malate channel expressed in <b>grape</b> <b>berries.</b> Interestingly, in V. vinifera, a tartrate-producing plant, the permeability of the channel is apparently adjusted to TA...|$|R

We predict that diurnal temperature range change can substantially alter insect life history. Altering diurnal temperature range independent of the mean temperature can affect development rate and voltinism, with the magnitude of the effects dependent on whether changes occur to the daily minimum temperature (Tmin), daily maximum temperature (Tmax), or both.
