Girlband were eliminated as the act with the fewest public votes. During the show, a mistake was made {{in one of the}} overlays and Ruth's number was briefly displayed incorrectly, meaning any calls to that number would not have registered a vote. After the show, viewers complained that they had dialled this <b>incorrect</b> <b>number</b> and could not get through to vote for Ruth, but ITV insisted the issue should not have made any difference to the overall result.|$|E
25|$|The ethnic {{relationship}} of Prešov Region {{is complex and}} volatile. A long-term cultural and everyday cohabition of Rusyns, Slovaks and Hungarians, under the prepodence of the non-Rusyn element led to the linguistic Slovakization of Rusyns, while in some parts (in cities and ethnic islands in the south) they were Magyarized. Still, in both cases they preserved their religion (Greek Catholicism). Until the 1920s, the Slovak-speaking Greek-Catholics composed a transitional group that was connected with the Rusyns through religion and traditions, with Slovak as their language. Their number was gradually increasing with the transition of the parts of Rusyn population to the Slovak language. Slovakization of the Rusyn population increased in the times of the Czechoslovakian authorities (since 1920). The Greek Catholics and Orthodox started to perceive themselves as Slovaks. It is difficult to estimate {{the distribution of the}} Orthodox and the Greek Catholics by the language as well as to determine the number of Rusyns because both the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian censuses provided the <b>incorrect</b> <b>number</b> of Rusyns, but it contains roughly 50-100 000 people. According to censuses the decrease of the number of Rusyns was influenced not only by Slovakization but also by emigration of a significant number of Rusyns from Prešov, mainly to the Czech lands.|$|E
500|$|The next week, Kinne's lawyers {{requested}} {{that she be}} released on bond, supported by a community petition signed by 132 supporters of her innocence. The motion was denied {{on the basis of}} first-degree murder not being a bailable offense; presiding judge Tom J. Stubbs also counseled Kinne's lawyers that he felt their involvement in such a petition at a time when a motion for bond was being considered was [...] "highly improper". A subsequent defense motion {{requested that}} Kinne's conviction be vacated because the jury had delivered its verdict based on [...] "surmise and speculation" [...] rather than [...] "substantial evidence". The motion also listed a series of procedural errors that Kinne's counsel alleged had taken place before and during the trial, including a juror taking [...] "incomplete" [...] notes, attorneys for both sides of the case having disputed John Boldizs's testimony, and an <b>incorrect</b> <b>number</b> of potential jurors being provided for selection. The motion was denied by Judge Stubbs in April 1962, but appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which in March 1963 reversed Kinne's conviction and ordered a new trial on the basis of Kinne's defense having been denied adequate peremptory challenges during jury selection in her trial. Kinne was denied an opportunity for bail in May 1963, but that ruling was overturned in July and Kinne was released on $25,000 bond, posted by her brother. The state's request that the Missouri Supreme Court re-consider its position on Kinne's conviction was granted, but in October 1963 that hearing resulted in further grounds being found for a new trial, this time {{on the basis of the}} prosecutor having been allowed to cross-examine a prosecution witness. A second request for a re-hearing on the validity of Kinne's conviction was denied by the Missouri Supreme Court. Kinne and her children moved in with her mother and awaited the start of her new trial.|$|E

50|$|Chromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) {{is a type}} of genomic {{instability in}} which chromosomes are unstable, such that either whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes are duplicated or deleted. The unequal distribution of DNA to daughter cells upon mitosis results in a failure to maintain euploidy (the correct number of chromosomes) leading to aneuploidy (<b>incorrect</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomes).
