40|$|SUMMARY: Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} of myoelectrode amplifiers for prosthetic {{control is}} important for safe operation in electrically noisy conditions. Factors affecting susceptibility to interference (impedance, common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and isolation) were studied using a commercial amplifier. INTRODUCTION: Electrical interference can enter the system either directly between the active electrodes as a differential signal, or via the common electrode as a common mode signal. The direct path is susceptible to interference due to the high gain of the amplifier. Shielding and electrode geometry design can help reduce the effects. A notch filter is generally used to reduce greatly the amplifier gain at mains frequency, though harmonics are still passed. Common mode interference is mitigated by the normally very high CMRR of the amplifier; however, common mode signals can also be converted to differential signals through imbalances in electrode impedances (Winter and Webster, 1983; Scott and Lovely, 1986). Common mode interference mainly enters via the power and output leads of a myoelectrode amplifier, so effective isolation should reduce the effect. METHODS: Two Otto Bock 13 E 125 active myoelectrodes {{were used for the}} investigations. Sinusoidal signals of different frequencies were applied in differential and common mode configurations and the output measured. The myoelectrode and measuring equipment were all battery powered to avoid conductive mains interference. Connection to the electrode contacts was through an assembly of spring-loaded platinum contacts, and the myoelectrode was shielded from the external environment in a die-cast box. Measurements were made with different balanced and unbalanced input impedances to represent the skin interface. The measurements were made with the myoelectrode alone and also in combination with an isolation amplifier (Burr-Brown ISO 124), and a d. c. -d. c. converter (Murata MEA 1 D 0505 SC) to provide isolated power. RESULTS: The d. c. input impedance and intrinsic CMRR of the myoelectrode amplifier were extremely high by design (> 40 M? and > 90 dB). The response to differential signals was greatest at 200 Hz to 1 kHz, with a sharp notch at 50 Hz. The CMRR was significantly reduced for a. c. signals if the electrode impedances were unbalanced. As the amplifier gain was non-linear and frequency dependent, a protocol was followed where the imbalance in electrode impedances was adjusted to give the same output as a known differential input. Thus the effect of impedance imbalance could be separated from the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier. The results obtained fitted the Winter-Webster model with input capacitances of 400 pF. The centre earth electrode was found to be strongly coupled to the 0 V lead at a. c. via a capacitance of 1 ?F. Isolating the amplifier improved the rejection of common mode signals introduced via the 0 V lead. There was a 20 dB increase in CMRR with the isolation components used. CONCLUSION: Common mode interference can enter via the leads of a myoelectrode amplifier. Even if the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier is very high, common mode is converted to an interfering differential signal if the electrode impedances are unbalanced. This is very likely to be the case, due to differences in skin contact. It has been demonstrated that the common mode route can be blocked by an <b>isolating</b> <b>amplifier</b> and dc-dc converter, though at the expense of extra complexity and the need to power these components. Practical implementations may come from developments in low power circuitry for applications such as wireless sensor networks. REFERENCES: Winter B. and Webster J.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of the hyperpolarization-activated current, Ih, on the excitability of human axons. It {{exploits}} the unique characteristics of the underlying hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels to improve existing and create new techniques for studying Ih. An <b>isolated</b> <b>amplifier</b> with low-noise and high common-mode rejection was developed, and threshold tracking techniques were modified to allow the measurement of the excitability of low-threshold sensory axons and of cutaneous afferents close to their receptors. These developments open up the possibility of studying changes in polyneuropathies, where symptoms and possibly the underlying pathology are more apparent distally in the limbs. Strong and long-lasting hyperpolarization was used to open more HCN channels and to examine their contribution to the excitability of motor and sensory axons. A mathematical model of myelinated motor axons was adapted to account for the response to strong and long-lasting hyperpolarization. Without structural changes the model was then modified to fit the observed excitability of sensory axons. Changes in the excitability and safety margin during focal hyperthermia were studied in both motor and sensory axons of the median nerve, and the underlying mechanisms were explored using the new mathematical model. Finally, the involvement of Ih in the frequency preference of oscillation in human axons was investigated by developing resonance techniques that have hitherto never been used to study axonal function...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{measurement}} and recording methods are inadequate for continuous monitoring of ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure. Therefore a new miniaturised solid state system has been developed and assessed. A manometer tipped catheter, inserted via a subclavian or cephalic vein, was used together with an <b>isolated</b> <b>amplifier</b> and peak detectors to determine systolic and diastolic pressures. Pressures were averaged over 30 seconds and stored in digital memory. After a 24 hour recording period data were rapidly transferred to a microcomputer for numerical or graphical display. Thirteen patients had continuous ambulatory monitoring performed for between 24 and 96 hours, in seven to evaluate symptoms of dyspnoea in subjects with valvular or coronary disease (group 1), and in six to achieve optimal oral treatment for left heart failure (group 2). The catheter was calibrated before insertion and was rechecked after removal. There was less than 1 % zero level drift and similar gain stability. Systolic pressures ranged from 10 to 97 (mean 39. 5) mmHg, and diastolic from 1 to 46 (mean 15. 3) mmHg. Four patients in group 1 had symptoms of dyspnoea associated with normal pressures, while three had raised pressures. Four of the six patients monitored in group 2 had major alterations in their treatment based on data obtained during monitoring. There were no complications. This system, which allows safe, reliable, and prolonged recording of ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure, represents a considerable advance {{in the ability to}} assess the cause of dyspnoea and to manage left heart failure...|$|R
500|$|The {{stage was}} as huge as {{a tennis court}} and was made movable. Above the stage was a vast {{electrical}} grid, composed of truss sections, chain motors, electrical cables and the control devices that linked electronically or mechanically with the performances happening below. Four gigantic video monitors formed {{the backdrop of the}} stage. Other equipment included a mechanical bull and equipment for aerial movements. The sets were built in sections by three companies. A permanent crew of around hundred was hired. Monitor mixing was handled by four monitor engineers, with two of them for Madonna's monitors. Blake Suib, one of the engineers, commented that Madonna was a perfectionist and she knew when a sound, coming from the speakers, sounded bad or good during rehearsals. By the suggestion of music director Pat Leonard, they tried out using 14kHz of sound frequency in their live speakers, which was unusual to use at that point of time. Also they {{came up with the idea}} of using <b>isolated</b> <b>amplifiers</b> to pick up the sound of the instruments individually. Suib commented that [...] "the creative process of coming up with new ideas, implementing them, and then soberly evaluating their results was time-consuming but worth it." [...] The poster and the logo for the tour was developed by Chase Design Group. They wanted to make the logo as much aesthetic as possible. They developed a custom icon and logo type to convey the unique and ethereal qualities of Madonna's show, which was described by the group's founder Margo Chase as [...] "a multilayered musical and spiritual journey through diverse worlds." [...] Chase commented that since [...] "Madonna is a student of Kabbalah, she requested that we include references to that body of knowledge." [...] The resulting logo and poster included both Arabic and Hebrew references. A number of designs were prepared by Chase and the one ultimately chosen by Madonna made it to the main poster of the show, which featured Madonna's face-shot from the [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] video shots.|$|R
40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) is {{a standard}} clinical procedure for treating many cardiac arrhythmias. In order to increase the success rate of this treatment, the evaluation of lesion development {{with the help of}} intracardiac electrogram (EGM) criteria has to be improved further. We are investigating in-vitro the electrophysiological characteristics of cardiac tissue by using fluorescence-optical and electrical techniques. In this project, it is intended to create ablation lesions under defined conditions in rat atria or ventricle and to determine the electrical activity in the myocardium surrounding these lesions less than 1 s after the ablation. Therefore, we developed a semi-automatic RFA procedure, which was integrated into an existing experimental setup. Firstly, a controllable protection circuit board was designed to galvanically <b>isolate</b> the sensitive <b>amplifiers</b> for measuring extracellular potentials during the ablation. Secondly, a real-time system was implemented to control and to autonomously monitor the RFA procedure. We verified each component as well as the different sequences of the RFA procedure. In conclusion, the expanded setup will be used in future in-vitro experiments to determine new EGM criteria to assess lesion formation during the RFA procedure...|$|R
40|$|A radio {{frequency}} parallel transmitter {{was developed for}} magnetic resonance imaging. Eight channels of vector modulation and <b>isolating</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> were constructed so that the performance of different amplifier architectures could be investigated. An eight channel system was implemented and tested using both quantitative bench measurements and imaging experiments. The imaging experiments were performed on three separate MR systems at 3 T, 4. 7 T, and 7 T at different sites using both B 1 shimming and fast modulation techniques. The modulation system implemented is based on vector modulators {{in order to simplify}} integration with existing MRI systems. Current Source and Low Output Impedance amplifiers were built and compared in terms of theory of operation, their ability to isolate array coils, and the amount of power they can deliver to a coil. The current source amplifiers function by introducing a high impedance in series with the coil which is series resonant. In contrast, the low output impedance amplifiers present a low impedance to the coil which has a matching network that forms a parallel resonant tank. Both are able to provide isolation, with the current source amplifiers producing in excess of 30 dB of isolation and low output impedance amplifiers providing approximately 12. 5 dB in practical situations. The current source amplifiers can only produce approximately 10 A (or between 150 W and 300 W) of output power because they are not power matched. In contrast, the low output impedance amplifiers can produce roughly 1 kW (the device rating) because they are power matched. Ultimately, there is no single best architecture of power amplifiers at this time. Standard amplifiers are useful when only one or two transmit channels are needed and broad-bandedness is valuable. Current source amplifiers are best suited to situations where very high channel counts are needed because of their high isolation. Low output impedance amplifiers are most useful with moderate channel counts because they provide some isolation at moderately high powers...|$|R
40|$|Millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) {{wireless}} communication systems often employ phased array architecture {{to overcome the}} high path loss and to provide spatial selectivity. As the number of elements in the array increases, the complexity {{as well as physical}} area required for the circuitry also increase. This calls for circuit blocks that are multifunctional and can be electronically reconfigured. This dissertation presents the analyses, designs and implementations of electronically reconfigurable circuit blocks that operate bidirectionally and at multiple frequency bands. The first part of the dissertation discusses three mm-Wave reconfigurable circuit blocks realized using the constructive wave amplification technique (CCWA) in both SiGe BiCMOS and CMOS SOI processes. First, a power amplifier is designed at 60 GHz in a 0. 12 -μm SiGe BiCMOS process that incorporates a CMOS-bipolar cascode (BiFET) feedback circuit topology. Second, a dual Q- and W- band, bidirectional amplifier is demonstrated in a 45 -nm CMOS SOI process where operations at different bands and directions are realized by electronically config- uring the feedback “field of FETs”. The bidirectional concept is then extended to the design of a three-port V-band reconfigurable active circulator that directs traveling waves between different pairs of ports while providing isolation from the remaining ports. Secondly, a switchless bidirectional front-end architecture is demonstrated in a 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. The proposed architecture enables a time-division duplexed (TDD) operation without the use of high-speed transmit and receive (T/R) switch. A passive transmission line matching network is used to <b>isolate</b> the power <b>amplifier</b> and low-noise amplifier and a bidirectional passive mixer is used for up- and down-conversion of the signal. The front-end is incorporated to a two-element linear coupled oscillator array to form a local oscillator beamforming transceiver. Finally, a high-speed track-and-hold amplifier (THA) is demonstrated in a 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. This work demonstrates the competitiveness of advance integrated silicon processes when being benchmarked against high performance III-V processes. The continuous improvement of silicon-based transistors will allow integrated systems to operate at higher frequencies. All the circuits techniques present in this dissertation are applicable to the design at mm-Wave and beyond...|$|R
40|$|In {{a process}} monitoring/control {{applications}} tens {{to thousands of}} sensors are used for monitoring system parameters. To achieve overall system goals, their reliable performance is critical. Generally a sensor’s output signal is too small or too noisy {{and may not be}} compatible with the input requirements of a Data Acquisition System. The sensor is interfaced to Data Acquisition System, through cabling, junction boxes and Interface Electronics like excitation circuitry, multiplexers, signal-conditioning circuitry etc. An interface or signal conditioning circuit does impedance matching, filtering, multiplexing, pre-amplification, amplification and digitization to make the sensor’s output signal compatible with the Data Acquisition System. Conventional Signal Conditioning includes Multiplexers, Anti aliasing filters, Operational Amplifier, Instrumentation Amplifiers, Isolation Amplifiers and Charge Preamplifiers etc. Operational Amplifiers e. g. voltage followers with High input impedance and low output impedance are used for impedance matching between the sensor and processing electronics. Anti aliasing filters remove noise from the sensor’s output signal. Normally the sensor is located away from the processing electronics and data is transmitted through wires/cables. During transmission, interference from external fields’ especially strong Audio Frequency, Radio Frequency and 50 Hz power line fields affects the sensor’s output signal. To minimize the effect of external field twisted pair shielded cables are used. Amplifiers with Differential input configuration are used to suppress the effect of interfering signals. Differential input Instrumentation Amplifiers with High input impedance, high CMRR; are most widely employed. Isolation <b>Amplifiers</b> <b>isolate</b> the input and output circuits by an extremely high impedance. Galvanic, optical isolations are most common. The conditioned data is transmitted to Data Acquisition System (DAS) and at the DAS the signal is multiplexed, filtered and digitized using Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs), followed by Digital Filtering and processing. For Control applications, the processed data is converted back to analog form using Digital to Analog Converters (DACs) for interfacing to external world. The transmission distance varies from tens of centimeters to few meters. Depending upon the distance twisted pair cables, IR transmission and Optical transmission is employed. During transmission, the data is prone to interferences from EMI, EMC, Noise and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) degradation with distance. This affects the reliability of the system and increases the overall system cost. To eliminate the effects due to the environmental disturbances during transmission and to maintain signal integrity, it is preferred to have a unique and compact solution for each sensor where signal conditioning (excitation, filtering, amplification, compensation and digitization) is carried out and digital data can be transmitted to Data Acquisition System. Here each sensor has its own signal conditioning module. Directly interfacing sensors with micro controller yields simple and compact design solutions. Direct Sensor interface Technology (DSiT) is one {{of the state of the}} art technologies for sensor interfaces where an unconditioned, uncompensated, raw output signals from sensors are interfaced directly to a single-chip solution. The sensors’ output are multiplexed using Multiplexer; Amplified using Programmable Gain Amplifier (PGA), digitized using ADC, filtered using Digital Filters and transmitted using Digital Interfaces (SPI, I 2 C, UART) in a single chip. DSiT scheme incorporates all the elements necessary in an instrumentation system creating a balanced combination of features, to create truly intelligent sensor systems. The sensors are interfaced directly to a single DSiT chip, without any additional circuitry and the direct digital data transmission is achieved with the help of Digital Interfaces SPI, UART, SMBus/I 2 C. As this involves onchip signal conditioning and digital data transmission, expenditure on additional signal conditioning circuitry, analog interfaces for analog data transmission, separate Analog to Digital Converter for each sensor is reduced. This reduces the overall system cost and as the count of discrete components is reduced the system reliability is improved. In addition, as the data is transmitted digitally the effects of noise, S/N degradation and electromagnetic interferences are eliminated. The accuracy level achieved is sufficiently good for monitoring and control applications. In Launch Vehicles/Satellites number of sensors are used for performance evaluation, monitoring and control purposes. Harnessing, signal conditioning of the sensors’ output and onboard processing of the sensor data is carried out individually for each sensor. Implementation of the DSiT system will reduce the total weight of the launch vehicles and satellites, resulting in reduced overall system cost, increased reliability and reduced onboard processing overhead. In addition, the reduction in weight allows incorporation of larger payloads/ more propellant loading in payloads which increases the life of the Satellites. As it is compact, it can be readily used for facility parameter measurements during the ground testing of liquid engines and stages at LPSC/ISRO. Implementation of DSiT for facility parameter measurements will reduce the cabling cost and improve the reliability of the chain...|$|R
40|$|Human {{reactions}} to vibration have been extensively investigated in the past. Vibration, {{as well as}} whole-body vibration (WBV), has been commonly considered as an occupational hazard for its detrimental effects on human condition and comfort. Although long term exposure to vibrations may produce undesirable side-effects, {{a great part of}} the literature is dedicated to the positive effects of WBV when used as method for muscular stimulation and as an exercise intervention. Whole body vibration training (WBVT) aims to mechanically activate muscles by eliciting neuromuscular activity (muscle reflexes) via the use of vibrations delivered to the whole body. The most mentioned mechanism to explain the neuromuscular outcomes of vibration is the elicited neuromuscular activation. Local tendon vibrations induce activity of the muscle spindle Ia fibers, mediated by monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways: a reflex muscle contraction known as the Tonic Vibration Reflex (TVR) arises in response to such vibratory stimulus. In WBVT mechanical vibrations, in a range from 10 to 80 Hz and peak to peak displacements from 1 to 10 mm, are usually transmitted to the patient body by the use of oscillating platforms. Vibrations are then transferred from the platform to a specific muscle group through the subject body. To customize WBV treatments, surface electromyography (SEMG) signals are often used to reveal the best stimulation frequency for each subject. Use of SEMG concise parameters, such as root mean square values of the recordings, is also a common practice; frequently a preliminary session can take place in order to discover the more appropriate stimulation frequency. Soft tissues act as wobbling masses vibrating in a damped manner in response to mechanical excitation; Muscle Tuning hypothesis suggest that neuromuscular system works to damp the soft tissue oscillation that occurs in response to vibrations; muscles alters their activity to dampen the vibrations, preventing any resonance phenomenon. Muscle response to vibration is however a complex phenomenon as it depends on different parameters, like muscle-tension, muscle or segment-stiffness, amplitude and frequency of the mechanical vibration. Additionally, while in the TVR study the applied vibratory stimulus and the muscle conditions are completely characterised (a known vibration source is applied directly to a stretched/shortened muscle or tendon), in WBV study only the stimulus applied to a distal part of the body is known. Moreover, mechanical response changes in relation to the posture. The transmissibility of vibratory stimulus along the body segment strongly depends on the position held by the subject. The aim of this work was the investigation on the effects that the use of vibrations, in particular the effects of whole body vibrations, may have on muscular activity. A new approach to discover the more appropriate stimulus frequency, by the use of accelerometers, was also explored. Different subjects, not affected by any known neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, were voluntarily involved in the study and gave their informed, written consent to participate. The device used to deliver vibration to the subjects was a vibrating platform. Vibrations impressed by the platform were exclusively vertical; platform displacement was sinusoidal with an intensity (peak-to-peak displacement) set to 1. 2 mm and with a frequency ranging from 10 to 80 Hz. All the subjects familiarized with the device and the proper positioning. Two different posture were explored in this study: position 1 - hack squat; position 2 - subject standing on toes with heels raised. SEMG signals from the Rectus Femoris (RF), Vastus Lateralis (VL) and Vastus medialis (VM) were recorded. SEMG signals were amplified using a multi-channel, <b>isolated</b> biomedical signal <b>amplifier</b> The gain was set to 1000 V/V and a band pass filter (- 3 dB frequency 10 - 500 Hz) was applied; no notch filters were used to suppress line interference. Tiny and lightweight (less than 10 g) three-axial MEMS accelerometers (Freescale semiconductors) were used to measure accelerations of onto patient’s skin, at EMG electrodes level. Accelerations signals provided information related to individuals’ RF, Biceps Femoris (BF) and Gastrocnemius Lateralis (GL) muscle belly oscillation; they were pre-processed in order to exclude influence of gravity. As demonstrated by our results, vibrations generate peculiar, not negligible motion artifact on skin electrodes. Artifact amplitude is generally unpredictable; it appeared in all the quadriceps muscles analysed, but in different amounts. Artifact harmonics extend throughout the EMG spectrum, making classic high-pass filters ineffective; however, their contribution was easy to filter out from the raw EMG signal with a series of sharp notch filters centred at the vibration frequency and its superior harmonics (1. 5 Hz wide). However, use of these simple filters prevents the revelation of EMG power potential variation in the mentioned filtered bands. Moreover our experience suggests that the possibility of reducing motion artefact, by using particular electrodes and by accurately preparing the subject’s skin, is not easily viable; even though some small improvements were obtained, {{it was not possible to}} substantially decrease the artifact. Anyway, getting rid of those artifacts lead to some true EMG signal loss. Nevertheless, our preliminary results suggest that the use of notch filters at vibration frequency and its harmonics is suitable for motion artifacts filtering. In RF SEMG recordings during vibratory stimulation only a little EMG power increment should be contained in the mentioned filtered bands due to synchronous electromyographic activity of the muscle. Moreover, it is better to remove the artifact that, in our experience, was found to be more than 40 % of the total signal power. In summary, many variables have to be taken into account: in addition to amplitude, frequency and duration of vibration treatment, other fundamental variables were found to be subject anatomy, individual physiological condition and subject’s positioning on the platform. Studies on WBV treatments that include surface EMG analysis to asses muscular activity during vibratory stimulation should take into account the presence of motion artifacts. Appropriate filtering of artifacts, to reveal the actual effect on muscle contraction elicited by vibration stimulus, is mandatory. However as a result of our preliminary study, a simple multi-band notch filtering may help to reduce randomness of the results. Muscle tuning hypothesis seemed to be confirmed. Our results suggested that the effects of WBV are linked to the actual muscle motion (displacement). The greater was the muscle belly displacement the higher was found the muscle activity. The maximum muscle activity has been found in correspondence with the local mechanical resonance, suggesting a more effective stimulation at the specific system resonance frequency. Holding the hypothesis that muscle activation is proportional to muscle displacement, treatment optimization could be obtained by simply monitoring local acceleration (resonance). However, our study revealed some short term effects of vibratory stimulus; prolonged studies should be assembled in order to consider the long term effectiveness of these results. Since local stimulus depends on the kinematic chain involved, WBV muscle stimulation has to take into account the transmissibility of the stimulus along the body segment in order to ensure that vibratory stimulation effectively reaches the target muscle. Combination of local resonance and muscle response should also be further investigated to prevent hazards to individuals undergoing WBV treatments...|$|R
