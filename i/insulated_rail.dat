2500|$|It is {{possible}} to supply power to an electric train by inductive coupling.

50|$|Once dry, {{the plates}} are stacked with {{suitable}} separators and inserted {{in a cell}} container. The alternate plates then constitute alternating positive and negative electrodes, and within the cell are later connected to one another (negative to negative, positive to positive) in parallel. The separators inhibit the plates from touching each other, which would otherwise constitute a short circuit. In flooded and gel cells, the separators are <b>insulating</b> <b>rails</b> or studs, formerly of glass or ceramic, and now of plastic. In AGM cells, the separator is the glass mat itself, and the rack of plates with separators are squeezed together before insertion into the cell; once in the cell, the glass mats expand slightly, effectively locking the plates in place. In multi-cell batteries, the cells are then connected {{to one another in}} series, either through connectors through the cell walls, or by a bridge over the cell walls. All intra-cell and inter-cell connections are of the same lead alloy as that used in the grids. This is necessary to prevent galvanic corrosion.|$|R

This is only under the condition that no other command overrides it.

50|$|The {{third rail}} {{has also been}} used to {{automate}} and animate layouts. An accessory, such as a railway signal, can be wired to a section of track that has had one of its outer rails insulated (not grounded), either at the factory or by a hobbyist.

50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{are used}} {{in places such as}} wet tunnels (such as the Severn Tunnel), where ordinary track circuits are unreliable. Axle counters are also useful on steel structures (such as the Forth Bridge), which may prevent the normal operation of track circuits if <b>insulating</b> the <b>rails</b> from the structure proves impracticable. Axle counters are also useful on long sections where several intermediate track circuits may be saved. A Thales axle counter sensor, for example, can be 10,500 m from the evaluation unit when connected using the ISDN communication only, but with the addition of an Ethernet converter the distance is limited by the transmission system, while the latest ALTPRO axle counter sensor model ZK24 can be up to 49 km from the evaluation unit.|$|R
50|$|In Germany {{during the}} early Third Reich, a railway system with 3 m gauge width was planned. For this Breitspurbahn railway system, {{electrification}} with a voltage of 100 kV taken from a third rail was considered, {{in order to avoid}} damage to overhead wires from oversize rail-mounted anti-aircraft guns. However such a power system would not have worked, as {{it is not possible to}} <b>insulate</b> a third <b>rail</b> for such high voltages in close proximity to the rails. The whole project did not progress any further owing to the onset of World War II.|$|R
50|$|Because of this feature, {{railroad}} cars {{intended for}} three-rail operation {{will not work}} on two-rail track unless their wheels are first insulated from each other.

It requires either replacing the bogies (wheel assemblies) on the car, or replacing metal axles with axles made of a non-conductive material.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2006. This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the intersection of two powerful technologies: organic electro-optic materials and silicon-based photonics. By combining the ever-increasing speed of the organics with the ubiquitous silicon, {{a new generation of}} photonic devices has been realized. The primary devices are ring resonator photonic components fabricated in silicon and integrated with electro-optic material to form electro-optic modulators for the purpose of converting data from the electronic to the optical domain. These devices represent a vast improvement over the current modulators used in fiber optic telecommunications networks worldwide. Two main types of devices are the focus: traditional ring resonators with single, monolithic waveguides and split-waveguide devices with the optical field concentrated between two electrically <b>insulated</b> <b>rails</b> separated by ∼ 100 nm. In order to capitalize on the benefits of silicon as a photonic medium significant challenges were overcome, the most significant of which was a large discrepancy between the dielectric breakdown point of the silicon resonators and the field needed to electrostatically pole the electro-optic polymer integrated with the resonators. This was accomplished through the use of intricate 3 D lithographic processing in the case of monolithic rings and by using the individual waveguide rails themselves as electrodes for split-waveguide devices. Additional problems overcome in pursuit of developing theses modulators include developing techniques for poling using doped silicon as an electrode instead of metal and the use of nanoimprint lithography for completely and repeatably filling the nano-scale features of these devices. Complete and successfully functioning modulators of both types have been achieved with low drive voltages (∼ 1 V), high speeds (MHz), and three orders of magnitude decrease in size when compared to current devices. An additional result was the creation of a nano-scale photodetector, capable of detecting optical signals six orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported results, by running the electro-optic modulator in reverse: inserting an optical signal into the resonator and generating an electrical signal. The end result is the development of two vital components for future photonic integrated circuits: a modulator and a detector. These are the first reported devices to perform these functions by combining organic electro-optic materials and silicon photonic resonators, two significant technologies which will likely shape the future of telecommunications for years to come...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{track circuit}} interrupters were {{directly}} connected to the rail, both physically and electrically. One of the track circuit tail cables would {{be connected to the}} interrupter, it being connected to the rail. If the interrupter was broken, it was possible that the broken part, with cable still attached, could drop onto the rail and allow the track circuit to remain energised and show 'clear'. To overcome this, it is now practice for track circuit interrupters to be <b>insulated</b> from the <b>rail</b> to which they are attached. A track circuit cable is taken via the interrupter, with one end connected to the upper part of it and another end to the lower part. The cable is at opposite polarity to the rail, therefore should the broken part of the interrupter drop onto the rail, the track circuit will be short circuited and show 'occupied'.|$|R
25|$|The key {{advantage}} of the four-rail system is that neither running rail carries any current. This scheme was introduced because {{of the problems of}} return currents, intended to be carried by the earthed (grounded) running rail, flowing through the iron tunnel linings instead. This can cause electrolytic damage and even arcing if the tunnel segments are not electrically bonded together. The problem was exacerbated because the return current also had a tendency to flow through nearby iron pipes forming the water and gas mains. Some of these, particularly Victorian mains that predated London's underground railways, were not constructed to carry currents and had no adequate electrical bonding between pipe segments. The four-rail system solves the problem. Although the supply has an artificially created earth point, this connection is derived by using resistors which ensures that stray earth currents are kept to manageable levels. Power-only rails can be mounted on strongly insulating ceramic chairs to minimise current leak, but this is not possible for running rails which have to be seated on stronger metal chairs to carry the weight of trains. However, elastomeric rubber pads placed between the rails and chairs can now solve part of the problem by <b>insulating</b> the running <b>rails</b> from the current return should there be a leakage through the running rails.|$|R

40|$|<b>Insulated</b> <b>rail</b> joints are {{a safety}} valve in {{railways}} {{that are used}} {{as part of the}} signalling system to determine the position of a train. <b>Insulated</b> <b>rail</b> joints are the weakest part of the railroad, where their life ranges between a third and half of the life of rails.

Residual stresses change significantly during service due to the complex deformation and damage effects associated with wheel rolling, sliding and impact.

40|$|<b>Insulated</b> <b>rail</b> joints are {{designed}} {{in a similar}} way to butt jointed steel structural systems, the difference being a purpose made gap between the main rail members to maintain electrical insulation for the proper functioning of the track circuitry at all times of train operation. When loaded wheels pass the gap, they induce an impact loading with the corresponding strains in the railhead edges exceeding the plastic limit significantly, which lead to metal flow across the gap thereby increasing the risk of short circuiting and impeding the proper functioning of the signalling and broken rail identification circuitries, of which the joints are a critical part. The performance of <b>insulated</b> <b>rail</b> joints under the passage of the wheel loading is complex due to the presence of a number of interacting components and hence is not well understood. This paper presents a dynamic wheel-rail contact-impact modelling method for the determination of the impact loading; a brief description of a field experiment to capture strain signatures for validating the predicted impact loading is also presented.
