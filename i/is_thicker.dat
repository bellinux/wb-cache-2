5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; sometimes the lower cuticle <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark eyes and a stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E

50|$|Arrows come in many types, {{among which}} are breasted, bob-tailed, barreled, clout, and target. A breasted arrow <b>is</b> <b>thickest</b> at the area {{right behind the}} fletchings, and tapers towards the (nock) and head. A bob-tailed arrow <b>is</b> <b>thickest</b> right behind the head, and tapers to the nock. A {{barrelled}} arrow <b>is</b> <b>thickest</b> in {{the centre of the}} arrow. Target arrows are those arrows used for target shooting rather than warfare or hunting, and usually have simple arrowheads.|$|R
5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but with a touch enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a touch enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E

25|$|A {{diverging}} lens (one that <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> {{at the edges}} than the middle) or a convex mirror forms a virtual image. Such an image is so reduced in size {{when compared to the}} original object. A converging lens (one that <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> in the middle than at the edges) or a concave mirror is also capable of producing a virtual image if the object is within the focal length. Such an image will be magnified. In contrast, an object placed in front of a converging lens or concave mirror at a position beyond the focal length produces a real image. Such an image may be magnified or reduced depending on the position of the object.|$|E

25|$|The {{water line}} is built {{up by the}} coronet and by the wall's corium (the living tissue {{immediately}} beneath the walls).

25|$|The human penis <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> {{than that}} of any other primate, both in {{absolute}} terms and relative {{to the rest of the}} body. Early research, based on inaccurate measurements, concluded that the human penis was also longer. In fact, the penis of the common chimpanzee is no shorter than in humans, averaging 14.4cm (5.7 inches), and some other primates have comparable penis sizes relative to their body weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{described here}} was originally developed to describe FowlerNordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii {{down to about}} 10 to 20nm. It {{can be adapted to}} surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as ν and D then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. When the emitter is so sharp that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable.|$|E

25|$|The {{central area}} of the disc is {{avascular}} and lacks innervation, and, in contrast, the peripheral region has both blood vessels and nerves. Few cells are present, but fibroblasts and white blood cells are among these. The central area is also thinner but of denser consistency than the peripheral region, which <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> but has a more cushioned consistency. The synovial fluid in the synovial cavities provides the nutrition for the avascular central {{area of the}} disc. With age, the entire disc thins and may undergo addition of cartilage in the central part, changes {{that may lead to}} impaired movement of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can {{be either}} {{positive}} or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative meniscus lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive meniscus lens has a steeper convex surface and <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, which makes a real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a meniscus lens must have slightly unequal curvatures {{to account for the}} effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E
25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of various trees, {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly double-layered, with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope <b>is</b> <b>thicker</b> when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat might be related to the rain exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use leaves from the tree, incorporated into the envelope, to cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
