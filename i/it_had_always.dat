5|$|In 1760, Pombal {{arranged}} for Dom Pedro {{to marry the}} king's unstable daughter Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple {{to live with their}} children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away from the seat of government. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she did not have time to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the period}} Portugal faced {{increasing}} dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions {{imposed by the}} international community. By 1973, the war had become increasingly unpopular due to its length and financial costs, the worsening of diplomatic relations with other United Nations members, and the role <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> played as a factor of perpetuation of the entrenched Estado Novo regime and the non-democratic status quo.|$|E

25|$|The Green Drawing Room {{is between}} the Octagon Drawing room and the new kitchen. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> {{previously}} {{been used as a}} breakfast room or small dining room, less formal than the Dining Room itself. When the National Trust took over management of the house, the room was refurnished and displayed as a drawing room. The room has a moulded plaster neoclassical ceiling and is hung with green silk which was formerly curtains at Englefield House, Berkshire. The white marble fireplace in this room {{is one of the few}} original to the house.|$|E
25|$|Since its beginning, {{the mall}} had {{been blamed for}} the flight of {{business}} from downtown. The mall {{had not been able}} to attract housing for urban professionals and had not offered a sustainable nightlife, yet <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been home to transients and panhandlers. Community leaders could not develop the mall. Potential customers did not enjoy the mall and rarely had reason to go there. But the explanations about the failure of the Eugene Mall were not sufficient to address why some businesses and government offices could not survive downtown.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been a {{strongly}} held conviction of U Hla that language should be simple and easily {{accessible to the}} readers. He had advocated speed reading and easy writing to the young writers, and when they started a campaign for writing Burmese in the colloquial form instead of the prevailing archaic literary form, he embraced and promoted it {{with the help of}} U Kyaw Yin and Dr. Than Tun while Daw Amar expressed some reservations at first. It was a very controversial movement in the history of Burmese literature, regarded as left wing and subversive by conservative traditionalists and in government circles.|$|E

25|$|The new empire was characterised {{by a great}} {{enthusiasm and}} vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in {{imitation}} of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model that everyone wanted to imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief {{of the armed forces}} and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.|$|E
25|$|The {{splitting}} {{of empire}} and {{the adoption of}} Christianity had many cultural consequences. Considerations of comfort aside, the toga was firmly associated with the old order and the old religion. The pallium was simple, practical, and easy to wear; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been considered the dress of philosophers. For those who professed allegiance to Christ and the new, Christian order, it seemed a more fitting formal garment than the toga. While the beleaguered Western emperor Honorius tried to impose the toga on his subjects in defence of Roman values, the Theodosian Lex Vestiaria of 382 had already acknowledged the toga's obsolescence in the Eastern empire, which centred on Constantinople. Equites were now expected to wear the pallium, and senators the paenula, as their proper public dress. Byzantine art and portraiture show the highest functionaries of court, church and state in magnificently wrought, extravagantly exclusive court dress and priestly robes; the underlying construction of these pictured garments is difficult to fathom, but some at least {{are thought to be}} much-mutated versions of the Imperial toga. In the early European kingdoms that replaced Roman government in the West, kings and aristocrats alike dressed like the late Roman generals they sought to emulate, rather than the toga-clad senators of ancient tradition.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} project ready for theaters, Lasseter {{would need to}} add 12 minutes or so of {{material}} and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since {{it could not be}} mere padding—it would have to feel as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been there, an organic part of the film. With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. [...] There, he hosted what he called a [...] "story summit", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.|$|E

500|$|David Jason was {{the first}} actor to be cast for the production, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been his desire to play Rincewind in a film {{adaptation}} of The Colour of Magic. Jason had mentioned in an interview some fifteen years previously that, of all the parts available, the character of Rincewind was the one he coveted the most. Jason describes the wizard as [...] "just such an amusing, endearing character... I always kept this idea in my head that one day I [...] play Rincewind". Jason's appointment to the role, announced in April 2007, drew mixed reactions, with comments ranging from [...] "terrible choice" [...] to [...] "brilliant". A common criticism was that Jason, at 68, {{was too old to}} play a character who is, according to the books, middle-aged.|$|E
500|$|Burger King's product {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes over the years. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company touted its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. When McDonald's moved to eliminate its styrofoam packaging, Burger King ran several sarcastically-worded ads in national newspapers stating that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> wrapped its sandwiches in waxed paper; they welcomed McDonald's [...] "to the club". To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was mostly eliminated in 1991; it was replaced with waxed paper. Paperboard boxes are still used for its [...] "finger food" [...] products like Chicken Tenders and Fries, French toast sticks, and desserts.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{had three}} goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy {{restoration}} of the states, {{on the grounds that}} they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved [...] "plebeians". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, [...] a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.|$|E

500|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where Kennedy J {{dismissed}} claims under nuisance, negligence and Rylands v Fletcher because the harm was not foreseeable. His decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, who cited an [...] "obscure decision" [...] to justify doing so. The case {{then went to the}} House of Lords, where a decision was read by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993. Goff first countered the Court of Appeal decision, restoring Kennedy's dismissal of the case, before moving on to the deeper legal points. Based on the original decision in Rylands, Goff argued that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been intended for foreseeability of harm to be a factor, something not previously put into law by the English judiciary. He then stated that Rylands was arguably a sub-set of nuisance, not an independent tort, and as such the factors which led him to including a test of foreseeability of harm in Rylands cases also imposed such a test on all nuisance cases.|$|E
500|$|On 17 July 2009, lawmakers voted 33–28 (with two abstentions) {{to approve}} a {{government}} plan for Iceland to apply for full European Union membership. [...] Although Iceland (as a member of EFTA) already had a free trade arrangement with the EU, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> rejected full membership due to concerns that its independence could be compromised. However, Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, who was elected in April, had promised to bring Iceland into the EU to help stabilize its economy. EU enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn expressed support for Iceland's membership, stating that as [...] "a country with deep democratic traditions", Iceland will be welcome in the EU's expansion plans. (However, on 13 September 2013 the Government of Iceland dissolved its accession team and suspended its application to join the EU. On 12 March 2015, Foreign Minister of Iceland Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson stated that he had {{sent a letter to}} the EU withdrawing the application for membership, without the approval of the Althing, though the European Union stated that Iceland had not formally withdrawn the application.) ...|$|E
500|$|For some time, it was {{doubtful}} that the match would be played at all. Shortly before the match, Fischer {{demanded that the}} players receive, {{in addition to the}} agreed-upon prize fund of $125,000 (5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the loser) and 30% of the proceeds from television and film rights, 30% of the box-office receipts. He failed to arrive in Iceland for the opening ceremony on July 1. Fischer's behavior was seemingly full of contradictions, as it had been throughout his career. He finally flew to Iceland and agreed to play after a two-day postponement of the match by FIDE President Max Euwe, a surprise doubling of the prize fund by British investment banker Jim Slater, and much persuasion, including a phone call by Henry Kissinger to Fischer. Many commentators, particularly from the USSR, have suggested that all this (and his continuing demands and unreasonableness) was part of Fischer's plan to [...] "psych out" [...] Spassky. Fischer's supporters say that winning the World Championship was the mission of his life, that he simply wanted the setting to be perfect for it when he took the stage, and that his behavior was the same as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been.|$|E

500|$|... 10 was {{released}} {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of MercyMe's single [...] "I Can Only Imagine". In 1999, the band was working on an independent record, The Worship Project, and needed one more song {{to fill out the}} project. Lead singer Bart Millard wrote the song while reminiscing about his father's death. Although the band was aiming to produce a worship record of easy-to-sing songs, they included it because it was important to Millard. It was later included on the band's major-label debut, 2001's Almost There, where it became a hit on Christian radio before crossing over and becoming successful on mainstream radio in 2003. Around eight months before the release of 10, the band had been approached by their label about producing a greatest-hits record. The band was initially against the idea, and according to Millard, they felt <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> meant a band was near the end of their career. However, Millard later remembered he had written the song in 1999, and the idea shifted from a greatest-hits record to a celebration of the song's ten-year anniversary, a concept the band was more comfortable with.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{described}} Joseph as an [...] "awkward {{and very}} bookish" [...] character, one who struggled {{to relate to}} his patients, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "happy-go-lucky Sam", which resulted in comedy as [...] "Sam is the antithesis of Joe." [...] He also deemed his character [...] "incredibly honest and morally upright", [...] "a total oddball with all sorts of hang-ups", and as being [...] "very stuck in his ways." [...] During his tenure, these aspects of his characterisation have each been explored. It was revealed in Joseph's first appearance that both his father and grandfather had been pioneering cardiothoracic Consultants, and that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been expected of him to follow the same path. [...] His residual guilt over his brother's attempted suicide was developed throughout his first few months at Holby City Hospital. Roberts commented on the event that: [...] "It underpins much of his behaviour. He is a man burdened by guilt and loss. I think I can be so bold as to say he transfers many of his feelings about his brother onto patients and staff alike, without ever betraying the source of his pain." [...] Joseph's resultant fastidiousness developed into OCD, something he attempted to control and hide by use of relaxant medication.|$|E
500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school.
