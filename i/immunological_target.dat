40|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and pa-tients with chronic liver disease. Several {{studies have suggested}} that the hepatitis B core antigen could be an <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CGL, the entire core region ofHBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No signifi-cant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in a small segment of 18 amino acids (codons 84 - 101 {{from the start of the}} core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had ad-vanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the five patients without mutations. These data suggest that the region with mutation clustering is the major target ofCTL, and that the mutations evolve under the pressur...|$|E
40|$|Immunization with megalin induces active Heymann nephritis, which reproduces {{features}} of human idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis. Megalin {{is a complex}} <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> with four discrete ligand-binding domains (LBDs) that may contain epitopes to which pathogenic autoantibodies are directed. Recently, a 236 -residue N-terminal fragment, termed “L 6, ” that spans the first LBD was shown to induce autoantibodies and severe disease. We used this model to examine epitope-specific contributions to pathogenesis. Sera obtained from rats 4 weeks after immunization with L 6 demonstrated reactivity only with the L 6 fragment on Western blot, whereas sera obtained after 8 weeks demonstrated reactivity with all four recombinant fragments of interest (L 6 and LBDs II, III, and IV). We demonstrated that the L 6 immunogen does not contain the epitopes responsible for the reactivity to the LBD fragments. Therefore, the appearance of antibodies directed at LBD fragments several weeks after the primary immune response suggests intramolecular epitope spreading. In vivo, we observed a temporal association between increased proteinuria {{and the appearance of}} antibodies to LBD fragments. These data implicate B cell epitope spreading in antibody-mediated pathogenesis of active Heymann nephritis, a model that should prove valuable for further study of autoimmune dysregulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of hear shock proteins (HSPs) {{on the surface}} of tumor cells suggested the possibility of using stress proteins as <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> for specific immunotoxins (ITs). Flow cytometry analysis showed that U 937 cells constitutively express both 28 and 60 kDa HSP in vitro, while the HPC- 4 cells only express surface HSPs when grown in vivo, i. e. explanted from SCID mice. Incubation of U 937 cells with monoclonal antibodies against 28 or 60 kDa HSP, and then with an immunotoxin consisting of a goat anti-mouse antibody linked to the ribosome inactivating protein Saporin- 6 specifically inhibits cell proliferation in vitro. Moreover; an anti-HSP 60 immunotoxin prepared by direct linking of the specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) ML 30 to saporin was able to inhibit the proliferation of the U 937 line in vitro, and tumor growth in SCID mice bearing the human pancreatic carcinoma line HPC- 4 in vivo. Finally, low expression of HSPs on the membrane of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and their resistance to the toxic effect exerted by anti-HSP immunotoxins, suggest further evaluation of the possible applications of anti-HSP immunotoxins for HSP + tumors...|$|E
40|$|Gynecologic Oncology {{has changed}} in the last few decades. An {{increasing}} proportion of patients is benefiting from long term survival although patients diagnosed with advanced disease suffer from a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, several recent studies are confirming that changing the combinations of "traditional" cytotoxic drugs is unlikely to obtain a real breakthrough in survival rates. Furthermore, there is discouraging data regarding consolidation therapies. It is, therefore, necessary to identify new target therapies with a minimal impact on quality of life. It is likely that new breakthroughs are only going to be achieved when changes in therapies are tailored to the entire natural history of the disease and on specific patient characteristic's. Since the discovery that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes represent an independent prognostic factor in ovarian cancer patients, several researchers have dedicated their attention to cancer immune response in order to identify prognostic factors and <b>immunological</b> <b>targets.</b> Analyses on immunophenotype at diagnosis and throughout the entire course of treatment are currently ongoing and are giving the new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools to the physicians.

40|$|Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) {{has been}} {{strongly}} {{linked to an}} anomalous self-assembly of the amyloid-b peptide (Ab). The correlation between clinical symptoms of AD and Ab depositions is, however, weak. Instead small and soluble Ab oligomers are suggested to exert the major pathological effects. In strong support of this notion, <b>immunological</b> <b>targeting</b> of Ab oligomers in AD mice-models shows that memory impairments can be restored without affecting the total burden of Ab deposits. Consequently a specific <b>immunological</b> <b>targeting</b> of Ab oligomers is of high therapeutic interest. Methodology/Principal Findings: Previously the generation of conformational-dependent oligomer specific anti-Ab antibodies has been described. However, to avoid {{the difficult task of}} identifying a molecular architecture only present on oligomers, we have focused on a more general approach based on the hypothesis that all oligomers expose multiple identical epitopes and therefore would have an increased binding to a multivalent receptor. Using the polyvalent IgM immunoglobulin we have developed a monoclonal anti-Ab antibody (OMAB). OMAB only demonstrates a weak interaction with Ab monomers and dimers having fast on and off-rate kinetics. However, as an effect of avidity, its interaction with Aboligomers results in a strong complex with an exceptionally slow off-rate. Through this mechanism a selectivity towards Ab oligomers is acquired and OMAB fully inhibits the cytotoxic effect exerted by Ab(1 - 42) at highly substoichiometric ratios.

40|$|Immunotherapeutics for {{colorectal}} cancer {{have been under}} investigation for decades. Unfortunately, a recent meta-analysis has revealed only a 1 % response rate for all immunotherapeutic trials in {{colorectal cancer}}, highlighting the need for improved immunotherapeutic target antigens which are tumor-specific, immunogenic, and shared by patients. However, to produce <b>immunological</b> responses <b>targeting</b> tumor/self antigens, one has to overcome tolerance, which has constituted an obstacle to previous studies. Guanylyl cylcase C is the index cancer-mucosa antigen, an emerging class of tumor antigens in colorectal cancer. As a mucosa-restricted antigen, GCC is amenable to <b>immunological</b> <b>targeting</b> and uniquely suited for immunotherapy of colorectal cancers. GCC is only expressed in the intestine and it is so highly restricted in its expression {{that it can be}} utilized to detect metastases in non-intestinal tissues. However, previous studies have defined tolerance as a key mechanism limiting efficacy of GCC-targeted vaccines. A tissue-specific model-self antigen expressed in the intestine is required to define tolerance mechanisms to intestinal antigens. Here, we created a model self-antigen comprised of the OT-II CD 4 + T cell epitope, OT-I CD 8 + T cell epitope, and HA tag B cell epitope that can be employed to create transgenic mice for studying mechanisms of GCC-specific tolerance. 22 PowerPoint slides...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{symptoms of}} human malaria are mediated, {{at least in}} part, by the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) by monocytes and macrophages. We have found that lysates of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes stimulate the secretion of TNF from human mononuclear cells, and we have generated several immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that inhibit the induction of TNF by such lysates. Here we describe the properties of MAb 5 AB 3 - 11, which causes dose-dependent inhibition of the TNF-inducing factors derived from P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, with a 50 % reduction in TNF secretion at nanomolar concentrations (1 to 2 micrograms/ml). The inhibitory effect appears to be malaria specific in that the induction of TNF by either lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid is not affected. MAb 5 AB 3 - 11 binds to liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol but not to other phospholipid liposomes, showing that it recognizes a phosphatidylinositol-like epitope. MAb 5 AB 3 - 11 inhibits the induction of TNF by whole lysates from several strains of P. falciparum which originated {{from different parts of}} the tropics, indicating that all of the major TNF-inducing factors derived from Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes contain a common epitope.

40|$|Background: Isoflurane in {{clinical}} {{use is a}} racemate of S- and R-isoflurane. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the effects of S-isoflurane on relevant anesthetic targets might be modestly stronger (less than 2 -fold) than R-isoflurane. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the <b>immunological</b> <b>target,</b> leukocyte function-associated antigen- 1 (LFA- 1) with racemic isoflurane suggested that only S-isoflurane bound specifically to this protein. If so, the use of specific isoflurane enantiomers may have advantage in the surgical settings where a wide range of inflammatory responses is expected to occur. Here, we have further tested the hypothesis that isoflurane enantioselectivity is apparent in solution binding and functional studies. Methods: First, binding of isoflurane enantiomers to LFA- 1 was studied using 1 -aminoanthracene (1 -AMA) displacement assays. The binding site of each enantiomer on LFA- 1 was studied using the docking program GLIDE. Functional studies employed the flow-cytometry based ICAM binding assay. Results: Both enantiomers decreased 1 -AMA fluorescence signal (at 520 nm), indicating that both competed with 1 -AMA and bound to the aL I domain. The docking simulation demonstrated that both enantiomers bound to the LFA- 1 ‘‘lovastatin site. ’ ’ ICAM binding assays showed that S-isoflurane inhibited more potently than R-isoflurane, consistent with the result of 1 -AMA competition assay. Conclusions: In contrast with the x-ray crystallography, both enantiomers bound to and inhibited LFA- 1. S-isofluran...|$|E

Several studies have suggested that the hepatitis B core antigen could be an <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. To investigate the reason why the extreme immunological attack occurred in fulminant hepatitis and severe exacerbation patients, the entire precore and core region of hepatitis B virus DNA was sequenced in 24 subjects (5 fulminant, 10 severe fatal exacerbation, and 9 self-limited acute hepatitis patients). No significant change in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue was noted in the nine self-limited acute hepatitis patients. In contrast, clustering changes in a small segment of 16 amino acids (codon 84 - 99 {{from the start of the}} core gene) in all seven adr subtype infected fulminant and severe exacerbation patients was found. A different segment with clustering substitutions (codon 48 - 60) was also found in seven of eight adw subtype infected fulminant and severe exacerbation patients. Of the 15 patients, 2 lacked precore stop mutation which was previously reported to be associated with fulminant hepatitis. These data suggest that these core regions with mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B viral disease, and such mutations are related to severe liver damage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) is a stem cell disease in which BCR/ABL plays an {{important}} role as an oncoprotein and a molecular and immunogenic target. Despite the success of targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), CML remains largely incurable, most likely due to the treatment resistance of leukemic stem cells. Several immunotherapies have been developed for CML in different stages and relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the this review, several specific immunotherapeutic approaches for CML, including vaccination and adoptive cellular immunotherapy, are discussed along with results from clinical trials, and the value of such immunotherapies in the era of imatinib and leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs), which are capable of inducing specific T cell responses and are appropriate target structures for the <b>immunological</b> <b>targeting</b> of CML cells, are also summarized. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disease characterized by pain, chronic inflammation and joint destruction. Epidemiological investigations in large populationbased cohorts have identified both genetic (such as HLA-DRB 1 Shared epitope, SE) and environmental (such as smoking) {{risk factors for}} the development of RA. One of the hallmarks of the disease is the presence of antibodies against a large array of citrullinated proteins (anti citrullinated protein antibodies, ACPA), which are present years before the onset of clinical symptoms. These findings suggest that RA-associated autoimmunity might be initiated somewhere else than the joints, possibly at the mucosal surfaces of the lungs. In the current thesis we aimed to investigate immunological events in the lungs contributing to ACPA generation and to identify novel targets for these antibodies. Presence of ACPA associates with parenchymal lung abnormalities (as detected by high resolution computed tomography, HRCT) in early-untreated RA. Recognition of more than one citrullinated target by ACPA and specifically recognition of citrullinated fibrinogen peptides increases the odds of detecting HRCT lung abnormalities. Beside HRCT abnormalities, significantly decreased microbial richness and diversity is present in the bronchoalveolar lavage of early-untreated RA patients as compared to healthy volunteers. Interestingly, a similar microbiota dysbiosis is also detected in the presence of overt lung inflammation in the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with lung sarcoidosis, suggesting that similar inflammatory mechanisms might be active in both lung sarcoidosis and RA. To further explore the possibility that changes in the lungs contribute to generation of autoimmunity in RA, we investigated the presence of citrullinated targets in the mucosal biopsies of early-untreated RA. We identified several novel citrullinated targets, with two citrullinated vimentin peptides detected in a majority of the biopsies. Interestingly these two peptides were also identified in the inflamed synovial tissues of RA patients showing that shared <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> are present in the lungs and joints in RA patients. Antibodies against these novel targets were detectable in RA patients suggesting that they could act as <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> during disease development. Using a similar approach, we further screened for antibody-reactivity against novel citrullinated targets identified in the synovial fluid of RA patients. Several citrullinated fibrinogen peptides specifically reacted with the antibodies in RA serum, with varying proportion of reactivity for each of these peptides. Interestingly, these antibodies differ from the classical ACPA being associated with the PTPN 22 risk allele but not with the HLA-DRB 1 SE. As such RA patients carrying the PTPN 22 risk allele displayed higher proportion of B cells reacting with citrullinated fibrinogen loaded B cell antigen tetramers than those lacking the risk allele. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a pathogenic link between early events in the lungs and autoimmunity in RA and identify several novel <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> for this autoimmunity. Our studies contribute {{to the understanding of the}} longitudinal development of RA, opening the possibility for future targeting of early pathogenic events in order to delay and/or prevent the disease...|$|R
40|$|Author Summary Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (the {{cause of}} tuberculosis) can persist {{for many years}} in humans without causing disease but has the potential to reactivate. One of the conditions the bacterium must survive in these circumstances is hypoxia. In order to do so, the bacterium uses a characteristic set of genes that help alter its metabolism. It follows that the products of such genes may encode protein antigens that can be recognized by the immune response. We therefore analyzed gene response patterns of tuberculosis subject to prolonged hypoxia as a guide to the discovery of new antigens that might be useful as vaccines or diagnostic agents. Amongst the genes most strongly increased by low oxygen levels, one was identified (known as Rv 1986) that is missing from most strains of the tuberculosis vaccine Mycobacterium bovis BCG. When we analyzed human immune responses to this protein in tuberculosis infected people our experiments showed it was particularly well recognized by cells that produce a chemical messenger (cytokine) called interleukin- 2. Interleukin- 2 is important for long-term immunological memory. The BCG vaccine is only partially effective and our experiments therefore suggest one of the reasons could be that an important <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> is missing from many strains. Further evaluation of BCG strains in which Rv 1986 is present or absent is therefore warranted in the hope that this might improve the efficacy of existing or new tuberculosis vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cancer {{immunotherapy}} can be potentiated by conditioning regimens such as cyclophosphamide, {{which reduces}} {{the level of}} regulatory T cells (tregs). However, myeloid suppressive cells are still remaining. Accordingly to previous reports, gemcitabine improves immune status of cancer patients. In this study, the role of gemcitabine was further explored to map its <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> cells and molecules in patients with pancreatic cancer. Methods: Patient blood was investigated by flow cytometry and cytokine arrays at different time points during gemcitabine treatment. Results: The patients had elevated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and Tregs at diagnosis. Myeloid cells were in general decreased by gemcitabine. The granulocytic MDSCs were significantly reduced while monocytic MDSCs were not affected. In vitro, monocytes responding to IL- 6 by STAT 3 phosphorylation were prevented to respond in gemcitabine medium. However, gemcitabine could not prevent STAT 3 phosphorylation in IL- 6 -treated tumor cell lines. TGF beta- 1 was significantly reduced after only one treatment and continued to decrease. At the same time, the effector T cell:Treg ratio was increased and the effector T cells had full proliferative capacity during the gemcitabine cycle. However, after a resting period, the level of suppressor cells and TGF beta- 1 had been restored showing the importance of continuous conditioning. Conclusions: Gemcitabine regulates the immune system in patients with pancreatic cancer including MDSCs, Tregs and molecules such as TGF beta- 1 but does not hamper the ability of effector lymphocytes to expand to stimuli. Hence, it may be of high interest to use gemcitabine as a conditioning strategy together with immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{rendered}} {{deficient in}} interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) by gene targeting (IL- 10 −/− mice) develop chronic enterocolitis resembling human {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) when maintained in conventional animal facilities. However, they display a minimal and delayed intestinal inflammatory response when reared under specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, suggesting the involvement of a microbial component in pathogenesis. We show here that experimental infection with a single bacterial agent, Helicobacter hepaticus, induces chronic colitis in SPF-reared IL- 10 −/− mice and that the disease {{is accompanied by a}} type 1 cytokine response (gamma interferon [IFN-γ], tumor necrosis factor alpha, and nitric oxide) detected by restimulation of spleen and mesenteric lymph node cells with a soluble H. hepaticus antigen (Ag) preparation. In contrast, wild-type (WT) animals infected with the same bacteria did not develop disease and produced IL- 10 as the dominant cytokine in response to Helicobacter Ag. Strong H. hepaticus-reactive antibody responses as measured by Ag-specific total immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, IgG 3, and IgA were observed in both WT and IL- 10 −/− mice. In vivo neutralization of IFN-γ or IL- 12 resulted in a significant reduction of intestinal inflammation in H. hepaticus-infected IL- 10 −/− mice, suggesting an important role for these cytokines in the development of colitis in the model. Taken together, these microbial reconstitution experiments formally establish that a defined bacterial agent can serve as the <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> in the development of large bowel inflammation in IL- 10 −/− mice and argue that in nonimmunocompromised hosts IL- 10 stimulated in response to intestinal flora is important in preventing IBD...|$|E

Cancer stem cells, that are less responsive to these treatments, are blamed for this recurrence of disease. Immune therapy either cellular or humoral is a novel concept to treat cancer. It is based on the notice that immune cells invade the tumor. However, the tumor invest heavily to escape from immune elimination by recruiting several immune suppressive mechanisms.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} are a {{new class}} of agents targeted at specific receptors on cancer cells. In addition to direct cellular effects, antibodies can carry substances to the targeted cells, such as radioactive isotopes, toxins, and antineoplastic agents. At present monoclonal antibodies, directed against both lymphoid antigens (CD 20 and CD 52) and a myeloid antigen (CD 33) are available for clinical use. In ALL, rituximab, a humanized anti CD 20 antibody, has been combined to chemotherapy mainly in mature B-ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma and preliminary results are promising. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD 52 humanized antibody, which showed anti-tumour activity in CLL; clinical effects were observed in some patients with relapsed adult ALL. Monoclonal antibodies against myeloid antigens have been prevalently used in acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), where the most utilised <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> is CD 33. The CD 33 molecule is expressed by approximately 90 % of AMLs but not on CD 34 (+) bone marrow-resident hematopoietic stem cells. The humanized anti-CD 33 monoclonal antibody HuM 195 has only modest activity against overt AML, but it can eliminate minimal residual disease. Radioimmunotherapy with beta-particle-emitting isotopes targeting CD 33 shows a major efficacy. Targeted chemotherapy with the anti-CD 33 -calicheamicin construct gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) has produced remissions as a single agent in patients with relapsed AML and appears promising when used in combination with standard chemotherapy. GO is composed of a humanized immunoglobulin G(4) (IgG(4)) monoclonal antibody (mAb), targeting the CD 33 antigen and linked to a calicheamicin derivative, a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic. GO has been approved by FDA as second-line therapy in older patients with AML. The most common adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies are myelosuppression, infusion-related reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. Rituximab may cause tumour lysis syndrome. Alemtuzumab causes immunosuppression, increasing the risk of infection. GO may cause hepatotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tumor {{associated}} antigens {{are useful}} in colorectal cancer (CRC) management. The ribosomal P proteins (P 0, P 1, P 2) {{play an important role}} in protein synthesis and tumor formation. The immunogenicity of the ribosomal P 0 protein in head and neck, in breast and prostate cancer patients and the overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal P 0 epitope (C- 22 P 0) in some tumors was reported. METHODS: Sera from 72 colorectal tumor patients (67 malignant and 5 benign tumors) were compared with 73 healthy donor sera for the presence of antibodies to CEA, EGFR, ErbB 2 and ribosomal P proteins by western blotting or ELISA. Expression of the C- 22 P 0 epitope on tissues and colon cancer cells was determined by immunoperoxidase staining and indirect immunofluorescence/western blotting, respectively, employing MAb 2 B 2. Biological effects of MAb 2 B 2 on colon cancer cells were assessed by the Sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay, trypan blue exclusion test and cleaved caspase- 3 detection. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of auto-antibodies positive patients with healthy donors. Variation in the C- 22 P 0 expression, and in the number of apoptotic cells was evaluated by Student's t-test. Variation in cell survival and cell death was evaluated by Newman-Keuls test. RESULTS: No significant humoral response was observed to CEA, EGFR and ErbB 2 in CRC patients. Conversely, 7 out of 67 CRC patient sera reacted to ribosomal P proteins. The prevalence of P proteins auto-antibodies in CRC patients was significant. Five patients showed restricted P 0 immunoreactivity, while two patients reacted simultaneously to all P proteins. The C- 22 P 0 epitope was homogenously expressed both in malignant tumors and the adjacent mucosa, but the intensity of expression was higher in the tumor. Starved colon cancer cells showed a higher C- 22 P 0 epitope plasma membrane expression compared to control cells. MAb 2 B 2 inhibited colon cancer cell growth and induced cell death in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a spontaneous humoral immune response to ribosomal P 0 protein in CRC patients and the inhibition of in vitro cancer cell growth after C- 22 P 0 epitope targeting. The ribosomal P 0 protein might be a useful <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> in CRC patients...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a non-cytopathic {{virus that}} causes liver disease with {{variable}} duration and severity. During infection, host immune response is responsible for both liver damage and viral clearance. The adaptive immune response, particularly virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, {{has been shown to}} play a major role in HBV infection immunopathogenesis by destroying the infected hepatocytes or eliminating HBV in a non-cytolytic manner. From virus-host interaction perspective, HBV core antigen (HBcAg) has been of interest because it is a major <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> of CTL. Many human leucocyte antigen (HLA) -restricted HBcAg T cell epitopes have been reported which might be different due to the diverse distribution ethnic-specific HLA in distinct geographical regions. Therefore, it is important to identify and characterize HBcAg CTL epitopes in area with high HBV endemic and high population diversity like Indonesia. To support HBcAg as a promising protein to develop CTL epitope-based vaccine, HBcAg sequences of samples from individuals in Indonesia were analyzed. It was found that the sequences were conserved, and amino acid substitutions observed did not reflect the influence of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) types on the HBcAg variability. To develop such a vaccine, the first thing to do is to determine the peptide(s) that must be immunogenic and can interact with HLA class I proteins of Indonesian populations. Using immunoinformatic approaches, 20 HBcAg CTL epitopes (14 nonamers and 6 decamers) against HLA alleles in Javanese, Sundanese-Javanese, and T ernatean populations were identified. These 20 CTL epitopes were also characterized for sequence variation and conservation in 125 HBcAg of Indonesian isolates. Variations of HBcAg CTL epitope were detected, but one variant was found to be predominant in each epitope. By immunoinformatic analysis, different binding affinity was observed for each variant. The difference was found to depend on the location and type of amino acid in related epitope that affect its interaction with HLA binding grooves. The present study describes the use of immunoinformatic approaches as a pilot study to identify HBcAg-CTL epitopes of Indonesian isolates and analyze their conservation and variability. Of 20 CTL epitopes, HBcAg 18 - 27 was found the best CTL epitope for the Indonesian populations represented by the Javanese, Sundanese-Javanese, and Ternatean. Among the discovered epitope variants, residue FLPSDFFPSI was identified as the best candidate to develop peptide-based vaccine due to its predominance among all isolates studied.

Past research has successfully identified desmosomes as <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> and has demonstrated that acantholysis is initiated through direct binding of IgG. The exact mechanisms of acantholysis, however, are still missing. Experimental model systems have contributed considerably to today&# 39;s knowledge and are still a favourite tool of research. In this paper we will describe to what extent human cell and tissue models represent the in vivo situation, for example, organ cultures of human skin, keratinocyte cultures, and human skin grafted on mice and, furthermore, how suitable they are to study the pathogenesis of pemphigus. Organ cultures closely mimic {{the architecture of the}} epidermis but are less suitable to answer posed biochemical questions. Cultured keratinocyte monolayers are convenient in this respect, but their desmosomal make-up in terms of adhesion molecules does not exactly reflect the in vivo situation. Reconstituted skin is a relatively new model that approaches organ culture. In models of human skin grafted on mice, acantholysis can be studied in actual human skin but now with all the advantages of an animal model...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{are complex}} multi-component products, {{in which an}} interdependent {{relationship}} among constituents exists: the concomitant inclusion of antigens, adjuvants, and excipients is essential to guarantee {{the efficacy of the}} final product. The selection of adjuvants and formulation criteria is a fundamental aspect, having implications towards efficacy, safety and stability of vaccines. In this field, the work was aimed at the design, formulation and characterization of novel vaccines suitable for intradermal delivery and able to induce earlier onset of immune response as well as more potent and longer lasting immune responses in comparison to conventional vaccines. With this purpose two different model antigens were used to evaluate the intradermal route as <b>immunological</b> <b>target</b> for vaccination: MenC-CRM_ 197 glycoconjugate and CRM_ 197 protein (detoxified diphtheria toxin). Moreover different adjuvants were tested to potentiate and modulate the immune responses towards a desired quality profile. The impact of adjuvant-antigen conjugation on immune response against the antigen was investigated in comparison to the adjuvant/antigen co-delivery. For the first time, the intradermal delivery was evaluated as route for the administration of a MenC-CRM_ 197 glycoconjugate vaccine. LT mutant (LTK 63), MPL (TLR 4 a), Toll like receptor 7 agonist (TLR 7 a), αGalCer analog, Dectin- 1 receptor agonist (β-(1 - 3) glucan hexasaccharide) and an oil in water (o/w) emulsion have been chosen to target the skin-resident antigen-presenting cells and to enhance the immune response against the antigen. The in vivo evaluation of such novel formulations provided encouraging results with respect to quantity, quality and functionality of the induced immune responses. Notably, the intradermal delivery of MenC-CRM_ 197 glycoconjugate showed superiority in term of immunogenicity and serum bactericidal titers compared to the intramuscular administration, highlighting the power of the intradermal route for glycoconjugate vaccine delivery. Moreover, the addition of LTK 63, TLR 4 a, TLR 7 a, αGalCer analog adjuvants allowed the reduction of the number of doses administered and especially LTK 63, TLR 4 a, TLR 7 a adjuvants were able to modulate the quality of the immune response towards a more beneficial, for the model antigen used, Th 1 response. No adjuvant effect was observed when formulations were combined with (β-(1 - 3) glucan hexasaccharide. When MenC-CRM_ 197 +TLR 4 a formulation was intradermally delivered in combination with the o/w emulsion adjuvant no additional improvements in immunogenicity were observed in comparison to the single adjuvant effect. The immune system activation was also investigated using a protein model antigen 〖(CRM〗_ 197) intradermally; however no improvements in term of immunogenity were observed in comparison to the intramuscular administration. This finding has specified the interest in selecting a glycoconjugate antigen to exploit the advantages of the intradermal route in terms of immunogenicity. To further investigate the role of adjuvant and to ensure codelivery of adjuvant/antigen, the conjugations of TLR 7 a to the glycoconjugate model antigen have been investigated. Two different approaches were developed: the conjugation of TLR 7 a to MenC polysaccharide and to CRM_ 197 carrier protein. When the conjugation of TLR 7 a to CRM_ 197 carrier protein was tested in vivo, results clearly showed that conjugation of the TLR 7 a enhances the anti-carbohydrate response. This effect was less pronounced than after co-administration of a commercial glycoconjugate with a standard dose of TLR 7 a adsorbed on AlumOH. Conjugation of the small immunopotentiator molecule was particularly suited for vaccination via intradermal delivery, where insoluble salts of aluminum cannot be used because of their reactogenicity. These findings have opened the path to the rational design of improved adjuvanted glycoconjugate vaccines for intradermal routes. Regarding the conjugation of TLR 7 a to MenC polysaccharide tested in vivo, the obtained results have shown a negative impact of the conjugation to MenC polysaccharide receptor recognition and consequently a reduction of the anti-MenC carbohydrate response. In order to investigate the potential use of a short β-glucan chain as adjuvant for intradermal vaccination toward the CRM_ 197 protein model antigen, in comparison to the previously presented glycoconjugate model antigen, the results obtained by the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the β-glucan conjugation to the CRM_ 197 protein were reported. The results have demonstrated that receptor activation was significantly impacted by the presentation of the glucan conjugated to the protein antigen. Considering that glycoconjugate vaccines are some of the safest and most effective vaccines for reducing, even eradicating, infectious diseases, the conjugation of well-defined synthetic glucans could represent a useful strategy for developing new glycoconjugate vaccines for intradermal delivery, with inherent adjuvant properties. The combination of antigens and adjuvants needs to be rationally defined to develop stable formulations and to give the safest and most efficient response with respect to the considered pathogen and route of administration. In the present work, formulation science has been proposed as a key element of novel vaccine development suitable for intradermal delivery. ...|$|E
40|$|Leishmaniasis is a {{neglected}} disease that affects more than 12 million people worldwide. In Brazil, the cutaneous disease is more prevalent with about 28, 000 new cases reported each year, and L. braziliensis {{is the main}} causative agent. The interesting data about the infection with this parasite is {{the wide variety of}} clinical manifestations that ranges from single ulcerated lesions to mucocutaneous and disseminated disease. However, experimental models to study the infection with this parasite are difficult to develop due to high resistance of most mouse strains to the infection, and the mechanisms underlying the distinct manifestations remain poorly understood. Here, the authors use a mouse experimental model of infection with different L. braziliensis isolates, known to induce diseases with distinct severity in the human hosts, to elucidate immune mechanisms that may be involved in the different manifestations. They showed that distinct parasite isolates may modulate host response, and increased IL- 4 production and Arg I expression was related to more severe disease, resulting in longer length of disease with larger lesions and reduced parasite clearance. These findings may be useful in the identification of <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> to control L. braziliensis infection and potential clinical markers of disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Venomous animals {{produce a}} {{diverse range of}} {{peptides}} and small molecules that are of both therapeutic and pharmacologic value. One such animal, the cone snail, produces peptides known as conotoxins, which may {{be of interest to}} those studying the mammalian immune system. Conotoxins are a family of venom peptides that display extraordinary diversity and often exquisite specificity for membrane protein targets, especially voltage and ligand activated ion channels. Conopeptides are proving to be important pharmacological tools to probe human physiology, with some showing promise as therapeutics for conditions such as neuropathic pain. The potential of these peptides to interact and modulate the human immune system has not been investigated despite literature suggesting that conotoxins could be valuable research tools and potential therapeutics in the area of immunology. Known pharmacological targets of conopeptides expressed by immunocompetent cells include voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv), voltage-gated calcium channel (Cav), nicotinic and acetylcholine receptors. In addition, the 5 -HT 3, GABAB and NMDA receptors that are not considered classic immunomodulators may play a secondary role in modulating immune responses.

40|$|Deliberate {{immunization}} {{to control}} fertility {{differs from that}} to control disease. Those differences can be discussed within various frameworks, e. g., intent, recipient population, biological bases, and <b>immunological</b> <b>targets.</b> Others include differing perspectives of developers, providers and users, and rights {{of the state to}} impose programs of control. Almost all of the differences are grounded in the social, economic, and gendered aspects of societies. The intent of providing a fertility-regulating vaccine is to prevent pregnancy. In theory, men as well as women could receive such vaccines; in reality, most are designed for women. Traditional vaccines are intended to prevent disease and are generally given to susceptible individuals whether male or female, child or adult. The biological bases of contraceptive vaccines are molecules specific to reproduction. The immune response generated by most anti-fertility vaccines is directed toward 'self', one's own cells and molecules. In contrast, the bases of traditional vaccines are materials derived from non-self, disease-causing microorganisms; the <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> are those microorganisms or their toxic products. From a developer perspective vaccines that regulate fertility differ little from those that control disease; both prevent a particular condition. Developers cite these advantages to contraceptive vaccines: non-invasive, no serious side-effects, easy to use, reduced patient failure, and long-lasting but naturally reversible. Because anti-fertility vaccines have been tested only in small-scale clinical trials, information on user reactions and experiences is limited. Not surprisingly, the perspectives of women's health advocates and of potential users (mostly women) often differ markedly from those of developers. Women cite as disadvantages the cryptic nature of immunity which leaves one without an obvious signal for the beginning of protection (against pregnancy) and its decline, and the inability to 'turn-off' an immune response. Further, long-acting contraception can complicate alleviation of side-effects, and it leaves women always vulnerable to sexual demands. Most women object to the lack of user control and are especially concerned about the enormous potential for misuse and coercion by population control programs should fertility-regulating vaccines become widely available. Many scholars and government officials subscribe to the following logic: the global environmental crisis is due to over-population which necessitates population control programs; thus pregnancy can be considered a disease subject to state control. But pregnancy is not a disease nor is over-population the single major cause of environmental degradation. However, as governments grapple with the economic, social, and ecological consequences of population growth, draconian measures to control fertility will be ever more tempting. The resistance or compliance of individuals (and of populations) will depend greatly upon their social, cultural, economic, and gendered places in society. fertility control immunization women's health...|$|R
40|$|Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and {{pemphigus}} vulgaris (PV) are autoimmune blistering diseases {{characterized by}} autoantibodies against desmoglein (Dsg) 1 and Dsg 3, respectively. The role of classical cadherins as <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> of pemphigus autoantibodies is unknown. In this study, {{we tested the}} reactivity of sera from patients with PF, Fogo Selvagem (FS), and PV by immunoprecipitation coupled with immunoblotting (IP–IB) and ELISA techniques using a baculovirus-expressed ectodomain of E-cadherin. By IP–IB, anti-E-cadherin reactivity was detected in all tested sera of PF (n= 13) and FS (n= 15) patients, and in 79 % of mucocutaneous-type PV patients (n= 33), but in none of the mucosal-type PV patients (n= 7). By ELISA, anti-E-cadherin IgG was detected in most pemphigus sera that produced strong E-cadherin bands by IP–IB. The immunoreactivity of PF/FS sera with E-cadherin was also demonstrated by IP–IB using human epidermal extracts. However, immunofluorescence staining of A 431 DE cells (E-cadherin positive, Dsg 1 negative) with pemphigus sera showed negative results. Immunoadsorption and competitive ELISA analysis suggest {{that most of the}} anti-E-cadherin antibodies cross-react with Dsg 1, whereas others may represent independent antibodies that do not cross-react with Dsg 1.

40|$|Minor {{histocompatibility}} antigens with expression {{restricted to}} the recipient hematopoietic compartment represent prospective <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> for graft-versus-leukemia therapy. It remains unclear, however, whether donor T cell recognition of these hematopoietically derived minor histocompatibility antigens will induce significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Using established bone marrow irradiation chimeras across the multiple minor histocompatibility antigen–disparate, C 57 BL/ 6 →BALB. B combination, we studied the occurrence of lethal GVHD mediated by CD 4 + T cells in recipient mice expressing only hematopoietically derived alloantigens. Even substantial dosages of donor C 57 BL/ 6 CD 4 + T cells were unable to elicit lethal GVHD when transplanted into [BALB. B→C 57 BL/ 6] chimeras. Instead, chimeric mice displayed transient cachexia with reduced target-tissue injury over time, reflecting an early, limited, graft-versus-host response. On the other hand, the importance of minor histocompatibility antigens derived from nonhematopoietic tissues was demonstrated by the finding that [C 57 BL/ 6 →BALB. B] chimeric mice succumbed to C 57 BL/ 6 CD 4 + T cell–mediated GVHD. These data suggest that severe acute CD 4 + T cell–mediated GVHD across this minor histocompatibility antigen barrier depends on the expression of nonhematopoietically rather than hematopoietically derived alloantigens for maximal target-tissue infiltration and injury...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to their effects on alveolar surface tension, some components of lung surfactant also have immunological functions. We found recently that the hydrophobic lung surfactant protein SP-C specifically binds to the lipid A region of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we show that SP-C also interacts with CD 14. Four observations showed cross talk between the three molecules SP-C, LPS, and CD 14. (i) Like LBP, SP-C allows the binding of a fluorescent LPS to cells expressing CD 14 (the other surfactant components were ineffective). (ii) Recombinant radiolabeled CD 14 and SP-C (or a synthetic analog of SP-C) interact in a dose-dependent manner. (iii) LPS blocks the binding of radiolabeled CD 14 to SP-C-coated wells. (iv) SP-C enhances the binding of radiolabeled CD 14 to LPS-coated wells. These results, obtained with native murine SP-C and with three synthetic analogs, suggest that LPS and CD 14 interact with the same region of SP-C and that binding of SP-C modifies the conformation of CD 14 or the accessibility of its LPS-binding site, allowing it to bind LPS. This ability of SP-C {{to interact with the}} pattern recognition molecule CD 14 extends the possible <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> of SP-C to a large panel of microorganisms that can enter the airways...|$|R

40|$|The <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> of {{estrogen}} at the molecular, humoral, and cellular level {{have been well}} documented, as has estrogen's role in establishing a gender bias in autoimmunity and cancer. During a healthy immune response, activation-induced deaminase (AID) deaminates cytosines at immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, initiating somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). Protein levels of nuclear AID are tightly controlled, as unregulated expression can lead to alterations in the immune response. Furthermore, hyperactivation of AID outside the immune system leads to oncogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the estrogen–estrogen receptor complex binds to the AID promoter, enhancing AID messenger RNA expression, leading to a direct increase in AID protein production and alterations in SHM and CSR at the Ig locus. Enhanced translocations of the c-myc oncogene showed that the genotoxicity {{of estrogen}} via AID production {{was not limited to}} the Ig locus. Outside of the immune system (e. g., breast and ovaries), estrogen induced AID expression by > 20 -fold. The estrogen response was also partially conserved within the DNA deaminase family (APOBEC 3 B, - 3 F, and - 3 G), and could be inhibited by tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist. We therefore suggest that estrogen-induced autoimmunity and oncogenesis may be derived through AID-dependent DNA instability...|$|R

40|$|Many host-adapted {{bacterial}} pathogens contain DNA methyltransferases (mod genes) {{that are}} subject to phase-variable expression (high-frequency reversible ON/OFF switching of gene expression). In Haemophilus influenzae and pathogenic Neisseria, the random switching of the modA gene, associated with a phase-variable type III restriction modification (R-M) system, controls expression of a phase-variable regulon of genes (a "phasevarion"), via differential methylation of the genome in the modA ON and OFF states. Phase-variable type III R-M systems are also found in Helicobacter pylori, suggesting that phasevarions may also exist in this key human pathogen. Phylogenetic studies on the phase-variable type III modH gene revealed that there are 17 distinct alleles in H. pylori, which differ only in their DNA recognition domain. One {{of the most commonly}} found alleles was modH 5 (16 % of isolates). Microarray analysis comparing the wild-type P 12 modH 5 ON strain to a P 12 ΔmodH 5 mutant revealed that six genes were either up- or down-regulated, and some were virulence-associated. These included flaA, which encodes a flagella protein important in motility and hopG, an outer membrane protein essential for colonization and associated with gastric cancer. This study provides the first evidence of this epigenetic mechanism of gene expression in H. pylori. Characterisation of H. pylori modH phasevarions to define stable <b>immunological</b> <b>targets</b> will be essential for vaccine development and may also contribute to understanding H. pylori pathogenesis...|$|R

We propose that this presentation of "autoimmune adult onset focal epilepsy and encephalitis" is a recognisable clinical syndrome, and provide evidence it {{may be associated with}} heterogeneous <b>immunological</b> <b>targets.</b> Between 2008 and 2011 we encountered six patients with new-onset epilepsy in whom we suspected an autoimmune aetiology. We first characterised the clinical, electroencephalographic, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), imaging, and pathological findings of this syndrome. We subsequently tested them for antibodies against both intracellular and neuronal cell surface antigens. All patients presented with recurrent seizures with focal frontotemporal onset, refractory to multiple anticonvulsants. Four had focal T 2 -weighted hyperintensities on MRI. CSF mononuclear cells were variably elevated with positive oligoclonal bands in four. Brain biopsy in one patient demonstrated perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. Two were treated with immunosuppression and went on to achieve complete seizure control and return to baseline cognition. Three of four patients who received only pulsed steroids or no treatment had ongoing frequent seizures, with two dying of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Subsequently, three had antibodies identified against neuronal cell surface antigens including N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1. We suggest that patients with such a presentation should be carefully evaluated for a suspected autoimmune aetiology targeting cell surface antigens and have a therapeutic trial of immunosuppression as this may improve their long-term outcome. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
