50|$|In 1996 another ferry {{service was}} launched, the Starcraft Ferry. This service's fleet is the {{ancestor}} {{of the current}} Pasig River Ferry Service fleet since this service had 30 units of catamaran-type boats (the same type used by the current Pasig River Ferry Service) with a seating capacity of 30 people with air-conditioning. Unlike Magsaysay Lines, it had a smaller boat aptly name the M/V Tamaraw or the River Taxi, as during this same year the Tamaraw <b>FX</b> <b>service</b> became very popular. It offered a seating of 12 people, also air-conditioned, and can be hired like a taxi service for travel along the river, just like a Tamaraw FX taxi. The route stretched from Bambang in Pasig down to Escolta in Manila (a total of 16.2 kilometers). However, like the Magsaysay Lines, Starcraft Ferry only lasted {{for a year and}} it closed in 1997. Like the Magsaysay Lines, the problems encountered during the operation were informal settlers, water lilies (since it prevents the boats from traveling at normal speeds), foul odor and garbage disposed on the river.|$|E

50|$|Haug {{began in}} the film {{industry}} in the 1970s as a motion control programmer. In the 1980s, he became involved with video productions that began using computer-generated effects. In the following decade, he worked on visual effects for television commercials and for two music videos directed by Mark Romanek. Haug's first role as visual effects supervisor came with The Game when one of its producers Cean Chaffin hired him. Haug was active as a visual effects supervisor from 1997 through 2003 before he decided to do more modest visual effects work for independent film directors. He worked as visual effects designer for Marc Forster on the 2004 film Finding Neverland. Haug said the position was similar to production designer in how it had greater involvement earlier in a film's production {{rather than at the}} end. Haug {{was also one of the}} founders of the production <b>service</b> <b>FX</b> Cartel.|$|R
40|$|Large {{multinational}} corporations {{operate in a}} wide variety of countries with a range of risks associated with their size, infrastructures and operational practices. Increasingly ubiquitous and powerful ICTs have enabled the centralisation of many support functions from local operations to the corporate headquarters. This, in turn, has led to a concentration of contracting for financial services with global and strong regional banks, primarily in Western countries by corporate treasuries. In this context, the development and adoption of standardisation in informational linkages can become a crucial component in remote and centralised decision-making by providing a mechanism for re-engaging financial service providers in emerging markets in the execution of financial services with limited intermediation from global or regional banks. Prime broker services, for example, combined with an efficient processing of transactions, can facilitate enhanced international market access for local financial institutions by providing the necessary credit intermediation between {{multinational corporations}} and local financial institutions. This paper seeks to show how the corporate treasury of a large multinational corporation, through the use of ICT-enabled transactional process innovations, is developing effective and efficient mechanisms for the management of the credit, concentration, and operational risks involved in contracting with local financial services firms. It also demonstrates how interoperability based on ICT standards is an essential component of such an arrangement if the risks of operating in a volatile and heterogeneous global financial environment are to be mitigated rather than just displaced or obscured. The paper also illustrates how over the past five years, significant progress has been made in constructing the infrastructures and establishing the services that will be needed to enable financial services institutions in emerging markets to benefit from enhanced access to global markets. It further shows how the pro-active engagement of these local financial services firms and their regulators with such arrangements is an indispensable part to any strategy to reversed, or at least mitigate, the current trend of financial services provisions migrating from local institutions to regional and global banks. Such a pro-active engagement should involve a focused seeking-out of new ways to deliver financing, liquidity management, <b>FX</b> and related <b>services</b> to international multinational firms. This, as will be show, entails a high degree of standardisation, automated supporting of transaction services, active contracting with prime broker services and engagement with regulators in order to ensure automation of reporting requirements and rapid authorisation processes for cross-border transactions.
