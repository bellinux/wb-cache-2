50|$|In August 1999, Biscet, {{along with}} two dozen other dissidents, were {{detained}} by Cuban police for organizing meetings in Havana and Matanzas. He was released five days earlier on August 17, 1999. He claimed that while in custody, the police tortured him by beating, <b>kicking,</b> <b>stripping,</b> and burning him. The government then threatened to detain him longer if he continued promoting his counterrevolutionary activities in Cuba. Later in 1999, he was sent back in prison for a three-year sentence for dishonoring a national symbol, public disorder, and instigating to commit crime, after having protested Cuba's lack of freedom by showing the Cuban flag upside down. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience and called for his immediate release. He was released from a high-security prison in the Holguín Province after having served his full sentence.|$|R

50|$|With {{four minutes}} remaining, {{and the ball}} deep in North Queensland's territory, Ben Hunt conceded a penalty for a {{dangerous}} lifting tackle on Linnett, giving North Queensland field position. North Queensland failed to score on the ensuing set; but on Brisbane's following set, the Broncos failed {{to get to a}} sixth tackle <b>kick,</b> after Feldt <b>stripped</b> the ball one-on-one from Hunt at midfield on fourth tackle with one minute remaining. North Queensland attacked, and on the sixth tackle, Michael Morgan ran to the right side, cut in to draw three Brisbane defenders, then flicked a short outside pass to Feldt who scored just inside the right corner as time expired. Thurston's attempted game-winning conversion hit the near upright and bounced out, leaving the game tied at 16-16.|$|R
5000|$|McBain had {{a banner}} year in 1960. In {{addition}} to appearing in a top feature film and guest-starring in eight TV episodes, she was assigned two more theatrical features. The first offered {{her one of}} three ingenue roles in a major [...] "A" [...] film, Parrish, {{and the other was}} a title role in her own [...] "B"-film vehicle, Claudelle Inglish when she replaced the original choice for the lead, Anne Francis. She was given what would turn to be her only regular part in a prime-time series, Daphne Dutton on Surfside 6.

5000|$|Glu (Bugu) - Glu {{is not an}} enemy, {{but usually}} annoys Blu by doing almost {{everything}} to take part of his strips. Blu never accepts, so Glu sees himself forced to perform his famous [...] "imitations", even against Blu's wills. However, {{in the end he}} is always <b>kicked</b> off the <b>strip</b> (literally). He always says [...] "Alô, mamãe!" [...] (Hello, mommy!) when he enters the strip, and [...] "Tchau, mamãe!" [...] (Bye, mommy!), when he is kicked off. He has also appeared as Mister B (a reference to the magician Mr. M), a great magician who everybody thought to be Blu. Glu {{was one of the few}} characters not conceived by de Sousa himself, but by his brother Márcio, who describes him as his [...] "self-prortrait" [...] for always trying to [...] "steal his famous brother's show".|$|R

2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a <b>strip,</b> <b>kicked</b> Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|R
5000|$|On October 26, 1967, McCain {{was flying}} his twenty-third mission, {{part of a}} twenty-plane strike force against the Yen Phu thermal power plant in central Hanoi that {{previously}} had almost always been off-limits to U.S. raids due {{to the possibility of}} collateral damage. [...] Arriving just before noon, McCain dove from 9,000 to 4,000 feet on his approach; as he neared the target, warning systems in McCain's A-4E Skyhawk alerted him that he was being tracked by enemy fire-control radar. [...] Like other U.S. pilots in similar situations, he did not break off the bombing run, and he held his dive until he released his bombs at about 3,500 feet (1,000 m). [...] As he started to pull up, the Skyhawk's wing was blown off by a Soviet-made SA-2 anti-aircraft missile fired by the North Vietnamese Air Defense Command's 61st Battalion, commanded by Captain Nguyen Lan and with fire control officer Lieutenant Nguyen Xuan Dai. [...] (McCain was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this day, while Nguyen Xuan Dai was awarded the title Hero of the People's Armed Forces. Decades later, Soviet Army Lieutenant Yuri Trushechkin claimed that he had been the missile guidance officer who had shot McCain down. In any case, the raid was a failure, as the power plant was not damaged and three of the attacking planes were shot down.)McCain's plane went into a vertical inverted spin. McCain bailed out upside down at high speed; the force of the ejection fractured his right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him unconscious.
