50|$|<b>Future</b> <b>proofing</b> is {{not much}} of an issue for thin clients, which are likely to remain useful for the {{entirety}} of their replacement cycle - one to four years, or even longer - as the burden is on the servers.

40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} <b>future</b> <b>proof</b> optical access {{networks}} is a challenging and hot research topic. In this work we summarized {{the requirements for}} <b>future</b> <b>proof</b> networks and the expected evolution of optical access networks. The current network infrastructure is composed by too many domains where the electronic processing bottleneck must be relieved. The evolution and penetration of Optical Access Networks threatens to create a higher electronic bottleneck at Metro‒Access interfaces. In this paper we evaluated an enhanced version of time‒wavelength access architecture with optical bypass and traffic self‒aggregation based on colorless customer terminals. The purpose of this hybrid Passive Optical Network with Wavelength Division Multiplexing and Time Division Multiplexing architecture is {{to allow for a}} transparent Metro‒Access interface with low latency and reduced powe...|$|R

50|$|In addition, CIOs are {{directly}} required {{to map out}} both the ICT strategy and ICT policy of an organization. The ICT strategy covers <b>future</b> <b>proofing,</b> procurement, and the external and internal standards laid out by an organization. Similarly, the CIO must write up the ICT policy, detailing how ICT is utilized and applied. Both are needed {{for the protection of}} the organization in the short and long term and the process of strategizing for the future. Paul Burfitt, former CIO of AstraZeneca, also outlines the CIO’s role of IT governance, which he refers to as the “clarifying” of “accountability and the role of committees”.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plan has}} come under some criticism, mainly due to BT's plans for {{broadband}} internet access services. BT's main plan for providing Internet access is to upgrade their DSLAMs to ADSL2+ in the exchange.

This has led to criticisms that BT is not <b>future</b> <b>proofing</b> their network, since fibre, while more expensive to lay, is a lot more future proof.

50|$|The Local Government (Springfield Zoning) Act 1997 was gazette {{in view of}} {{the long}} term nature of {{development}} being undertaken across Greater Springfield. This Act gave rise to a unique Planning Regime which provides certainty to the developer. The Structure Plan established a unique assessment process that ensures the intentions, provisions and understanding in and behind the Springfield Structure Plan are not to be overreached or changed through Local Planning Policies so to adversely affect the development entitlements conferred by the Structure Plan. All levels of Government recognise that the achievement of this goal is essential to ensure the certainty of the development rights.

5000|$|The {{hardware}} {{is cheaper}} on thin clients, since processing requirements on the client are minimal, and 3D acceleration and elaborate audio support {{are not usually}} provided. Of course, a diskless node can also be purchased with a cheap CPU and minimal multimedia support, if suitable. Thus, cost savings may be smaller than they first appear for some organizations. However, many large organizations habitually buy hardware with a higher than necessary specification {{to meet the needs}} of particular applications and uses, or to ensure <b>future</b> <b>proofing</b> (see next point). There are also less [...] "rational" [...] reasons for overspecifying hardware which quite often come into play: departments wastefully using up budgets in order to retain their current budget levels for next year; and uncertainty about the future, or lack of technical knowledge, or lack of care and attention, when choosing PC specifications.

50|$|The Hub has {{a number}} of ESD {{features}} and incorporates strategies of water, waste and recycling management that contribute to its Greenstar rating. The outer skin of the Hub incorporates automated sunshading. The shade cells have been designed {{so that they can be}} easily replaced with solar cells as research into solar energy results in improved technology and the infrastructure for that evolution has been built into the façade and building management systems. This meets RMIT’s request for <b>future</b> <b>proofing</b> the ESD performance of the building while at the same time enabling the university’s solar research department to continue aspects of its research in situ - the entire building façade, in other words, has the capacity to be upgraded as solar technology evolves and may one day generate enough electricity to run the whole building.Perimeter air intakes incorporated into the double glazed inner skin provide fresh air to the working environment which lowers energy consumption and provides a more desirable thermal comfort alternative to a wholly conditioned work environment.
