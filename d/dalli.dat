Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis <b>dalli).</b>|$|E

40|$|On the {{occasion}} of an event in the European Parliament marking the Brewers’ of Europe’s "Brewers’ Pledge" EPHA has issued a reaction, expressing our scepticism at the ability of modern technology and self regulation to tackle the enormous harms caused by alcohol misuse in Europe. EPHA has released the following comments today (28 February 2012) on {{the occasion}} of an event organised by the Brewers’ of Europe launching what they have called the ’Brewers’ Pledge’. The Brewers claim that the Pledge represents a proactive stance on their part to tackle what they themselves recognise is a ’serious issue’. Their promise to address this with ’informational campaigns’, however, does not go far enough. "What the alcohol industry call a ‘proactive stance’ to tackling alcohol harm through self regulation is in fact nothing more than a desperate pre-emptive measure on their part to avoid more restrictive, binding legislation. In other words legislation which might actually go some way to tackling the enormous harms caused by alcohol misuse, both to those who misuse, and to third parties. " reacted Monika Kosinska, Secretary General of EPHA "The industry may claim that disseminating information via social media tools will fulfil Commissioner <b>Dalli’s</b> message to "live up to today’s challenges by using today’s tools" and reduce alcohol related harm, but we in the public health community know that this is a smoke-screen for aggressive marketing to young people. There are three principle factors affecting consumption; price, marketing and availability. Moves taken by the alcohol industry to change these are welcome, however the ‘Brewers’ pledge’ appears to be merely a public affairs exercise. " continued Kosinska...|$|R

25|$|On 16 June 2015, Civil Liberties Minister Helena <b>Dalli</b> {{announced}} that the Government planned to introduce a bill to ban sexual orientation or gender identity conversion therapy on minors. On 15 December 2015, <b>Dalli</b> presented the bill for its first reading in Parliament. The public consultation of the bill was launched the same day and lasted until 15 January 2016. The bill passed the second reading and the committee stage with amendments in November 2016, by a unanimously held vote. It then moved to a third reading and later signed by the President before going into effect. The MCP (Malta Chamber of Psychologists, the MAP (Maltese Association of Psychiatry), the MACP (Malta Association for the Counselling Profession) and the MAFT & SP (Malta Association of Family Therapy and Systemic Practice) have given their full support to the bill to come into law. The bill unanimously passed its final reading on 6 December. Malta thus became the first country in the European Union to prohibit the use of conversion therapy.|$|E

It {{was signed into law}} and published in the Government Gazette on 1 August 2017. Malta became the 14th country in Europe to legalise same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|The {{large mammals}} found {{throughout}} the territory include caribou (Rangifer tarandus, both barren-ground and woodland), moose (Alces alces), wolves (Canis lupus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) and American black bears (Ursus americanus). Higher elevation have Dall sheep (Ovis <b>dalli)</b> and, in the south, Rocky Mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus). polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are found on the Arctic coast. The mule deer (Odocoileus hermionus) and its predator, the cougar (Puma concolor), are becoming increasingly common in the south, and coyotes (Canis latrans) are increasing their range to the northern Yukon. Elk and bison have been introduced.|$|E
25|$|Ovis canadensis is one {{of three}} species of {{mountain}} sheep in North America and Siberia; the other two species being O. <b>dalli,</b> which includes Dall sheep and Stone's sheep, and the Siberian snow sheep, O. nivicola. Wild sheep crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia into Alaska during the Pleistocene (about 750,000 years ago) and subsequently spread through western North America as far south as Baja California and northwestern mainland Mexico. Divergence from their closest Asian ancestor (snow sheep) occurred about 600,000 years ago. In North America, wild sheep diverged into two extant species—Dall sheep, which occupy Alaska and northwestern Canada, and bighorn sheep, which range from southern Canada to Mexico. However, the status of these species is questionable given that hybridization has occurred between them in their recent evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|Commissioners have various privileges, such {{as being}} exempt from member state taxes (but not EU taxes), and having {{immunity}} from prosecution for doing official acts. Commissioners have sometimes {{been found to have}} abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had 'even the slightest sense of responsibility'. This {{led to the creation of}} the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John <b>Dalli,</b> who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus <b>dalli,</b> can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia {{for males and females}} do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
500|$|White sharks also attack {{dolphins}} and porpoises from above, behind {{or below}} {{to avoid being}} detected by their echolocation. Targeted species include dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops ssp.), Humpback dolphins (Sousa ssp.), harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), and Dall's porpoises (Phocoenoides <b>dalli).</b> Groups of dolphins have occasionally been observed defending themselves from sharks with mobbing behaviour. White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed. In August 1989, a [...] juvenile male pygmy sperm whale (Kogia breviceps) was found stranded in central California with a bite mark on its caudal peduncle from a great white shark. In addition, white sharks attack and prey upon beaked whales. Cases where an adult Stejneger's beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), with a mean mass of around , and a juvenile Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), an individual estimated at , were hunted and killed by great white sharks have also been observed. When hunting sea turtles, they appear to simply bite through the carapace around a flipper, immobilizing the turtle. The heaviest species of bony fish, the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), {{has been found in}} great white shark stomachs.|$|E

2500|$|That day, the EU {{proposed}} issuing £135,000,000 {{in agricultural}} compensation to its farmers. The EU agriculture commissioner said the EU's farmers {{could get back}} up to 30% {{of the cost of}} vegetables they were unable to sell. The EU's health commissioner, John <b>Dalli,</b> had formally criticised Germany earlier that day for rushing out [...] "premature conclusions" [...] about the source of an outbreak, and only helped to spread alarm among the public and farmers and untimely leading to the damaging the EU's agriculture sector.

2500|$|On 22 May, Health Commissioner John <b>Dalli</b> of the European Commission {{declared}} {{the issue to}} be an 'absolute priority', saying [...] the Commission is working with member states, particularly Germany, to identify {{the source of the}} outbreak.

He also said he is working with Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Cioloş [...] "to address the hardship faced by this group of our citizens that has also been hit hard by the E. coli outbreak". He also said, [...] "In the future, we need to see how the timing of the alerts can be closer to the actual scientific basis and proof." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{board of}} inquiry {{was set up}} between 20 and 22 April, and their {{investigation}} uncovered the dubious recruiting of the regiment. They ordered it to be disbanded in June 1807. About 350 men were discharged and repatriated to the Balkans; others, who wanted to remain in British service, were reassigned to the Regiments of De Roll, Chasseurs Britanniques, and De Watteville. The government also published an eight-page report about the mutiny, entitled Rapporto di quanto è accaduto nel Forte Ricasoli <b>dalli</b> 4 fino alli 11 d'Aprile 1807 (Report of what happened at Fort Ricasoli from 4 to 11 April 1807), which was probably written by [...]|$|E
2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John <b>Dalli</b> called upon E.U. member states {{to take a hard look}} at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E
