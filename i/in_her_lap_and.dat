500|$|K. M. Munshi had {{a totally}} {{different}} take on the myth in his Krishnavatara series. Though Putana came with evil intentions, she is portrayed as being happy to see Krishna and her maternal instinct rises, telling her [...] "Take this lovely boy to your breast. You are a wicked and miserable woman. You have never seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight." [...] Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> suckled him. In the process, she surrenders to Krishna saying [...] "I give you all, my beloved child... I am yours." [...] Further, Putana is purified and liberated from her mortal body by Krishna.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E

2500|$|Riko Tachibana {{was born}} in Tokyo on November 10, 1984. Tachibana is tall for a Japanese woman, {{reportedly}} standing 172cm (nearly 5' 8") in early publicity, though her height was later reported to be 168cm (5' 6"). Tachibana was not comfortable with her above-average size, saying, [...] "I {{used to have a}} real inferiority complex about my height. I always thought guys liked little girls better." [...] Tachibana's inferiority complex began to dwindle as she noticed that many men were attracted to her because of her height, wanting her to baby them. For example, when she was in a relationship with a high-level salaryman in his 30s, he asked her to pat his head while he lay <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> tell him, [...] "Good boy, good boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The topic most {{conclusively}} investigated was [...] "slate writing," [...] {{in which}} the medium has two slates fastened together, so that the writing surfaces faced each other, {{out of reach of}} the medium, with a small piece of pencil between the two slates. [...] The medium holds the slates <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> spirits purportedly write on the slates, sending the pencil outside the slates when finished. The Commission investigated Mrs. S.E. Patterson and Dr. Henry Slade, both widely respected practitioners of slate writing. Mrs. Patterson proved unable to perform when under the scrutiny of the Commission, while Dr. Slade was found to be practicing fraud: either composing long, well-written messages before the séance, or loosening the screws holding the slates together and scrawling nearly illegible messages while holding the slates in his lap. The Commission also requested that a [...] "professional juggler" [...] attempt slate writing, and found {{that he was able to}} provide demonstrations [...] "much more remarkable" [...] than the [...] "puerile" [...] attempts at fraud by Dr. Slade. The Commission concluded that slate writing ...|$|E

The husband accepted it and read a poem including the same phrase, and this continued until everybody in the company, but the king, had recited a poem with this phrase.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood and}} looked through the grating at my new secretary. I am not {{generally}} a diffident man, and have never been so with persons in my employment; but now, I must admit, I did not feel at my ease.

60|$|A woman, who {{was sitting}} in the cold gray light of the window, with a child <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> rose listlessly, <b>and</b> came toward him. Ah Fe {{instantly}} recognized Mrs. Tretherick; but not a muscle of his immobile face changed, nor did his slant eyes lighten as he met her own placidly.

5000|$|In 1921 {{she moved}} to London and in 1922 she began writing a column for the paper called [...] "The Week on the Screen". In 1925 she married Edward Rolfe Thompson, later editor of John Bull, and moved to Pinner Hill, Middlesex. In 1928 she left the Manchester Guardian for The Observer (which then had no {{connection}} with the Guardian group), where she remained for the next 32 years, although she also contributed to publications as diverse as The New York Times and Farmers' Weekly. She also wrote an early {{book on the subject}} of Cinema (1931), and her film reviews are anthologised <b>in</b> Chestnuts <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>Lap</b> (1947) <b>and</b> posthumously <b>in</b> The C.

60|$|After a while, {{they began}} {{to think he was}} not going to wake up till night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There {{probably}} were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>lap</b> <b>and</b> told <b>her</b> trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.|$|R
60|$|The {{other party}} now came up. The seats {{were taken out}} of the wagon. The buffalo-skins, doubled in fours, were spread all along one side, and four men, with great difficulty, lifted the heavy form of Tom into it. Before he was gotten in, he fainted entirely. The old negress, in the {{abundance}} of her compassion, sat down on the bottom, and took his head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> Eliza, George <b>and</b> Jim, bestowed themselves, as well as they could, in the remaining space and the whole party set forward.|$|R

Hermann Struck was born Chaim Aaron ben David in 1876 in Germany. He {{is best known as}} a master etcher, lithographer and early Zionist. He studied for five years at the Berlin Academy and in 1908 wrote Die Kunst des Radierens (The Art of Etching), while mentoring artists such as Marc Chagall, Max Liebermann and Lesser Ury. His art was included in an exhibition at the Fifth Zionist Congress and he helped establish the religious Zionist movement called Mizrachi. Struck was an Orthodox Jew but believed that culture and religion could thrive cooperatively in Israel. He immigrated to Haifa where he created an artistic community and participated {{in the development of the}} Tel Aviv Museum and the Bezalel art school in Jerusalem. He died in 1944. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
60|$|It {{was summer}} when I first arrived at Kalbsbraten. The little court was removed to Siegmundslust, his Highness's country-seat: no balls were taking place, and, in consequence, I held my own with Dorothea pretty well. I treated her admirer, Lieutenant Klingenspohr, with perfect scorn, had a {{manifest}} advantage over Major Schnabel, and used somehow {{to meet the}} fair one every day, walking <b>in</b> company with <b>her</b> mamma <b>in</b> the palace garden, or sitting under the acacias, with Belotte <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> the favorite romance beside her. Dear, dear Dorothea! what a number of novels she must have read <b>in</b> <b>her</b> time! She confesses {{to me that she}} had been in love with Uncas, with Saint Preux, with Ivanhoe, and with hosts of German heroes of romance; and when I asked her if she, whose heart was so tender towards imaginary youths, had never had a preference for any one of her living adorers, she only looked, and blushed, and sighed, and said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sudden change}} in tone might perhaps be {{owing to the}} skipper's {{attention}} having been called by a sign {{from one of his}} men to a boat coming up from Woolwich, rowed by men of the Royal navy, who were certain to take part with an officer; but Sir Amyas and Betty were only intent on receiving the inanimate form wrapped up in its mantle. What a meeting it was for Betty, and yet what joy to have her at all! They laid her with <b>her</b> head <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sister's <b>lap,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Amyas hung over her, clasping one of the limp gloved hands, while Eugene called [...] "Aura, Aura," [...] and would have impetuously kissed her awake, but Loveday caught hold of him.
