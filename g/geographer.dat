40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} what California <b>geographers</b> say {{geography is}} and what <b>geographers</b> actually do, both in California and at our flagship national conference, the Association of American <b>Geographers.</b> The paper begins with an examination of definitions of geography placed on the Web pages of university departments of geography in the State of California. It then characterizes the distribution of tenured and probationary faculty interests, as listed on department Web pages. These 202 California <b>geographers</b> are then categorized into broad specialties (e. g., physical, environmental, human, GIScience, and regional <b>geographers)</b> and their proportions discussed. Lastly, the distribution of topics for sessions at the Association of American <b>Geographers</b> 2008 annual meeting is described. Quite a disparity emerges among what California <b>geographers</b> tell the public geography is, their own interests and specialties, and the foci of the national conference. Implications {{for the health of}} the discipline are disquieting...|$|R

5|$|Russian <b>geographer</b> Andrey Kapitsa used seismic {{soundings}} in {{the region}} of Vostok Station made during the Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1959 and 1964 to measure the thickness of the ice sheet.

5|$|After Crawford graduated, Professor A. J. Herbertson {{offered him}} {{a job as a}} junior {{demonstrator}} in the university's geography department. Crawford agreed, and served in the teaching position over the ensuing year. Through Herbertson, Crawford was introduced to the <b>geographer</b> Patrick Geddes. Crawford then decided to focus his attentions on archaeology rather than geography even though few professional positions in the field existed in Britain at the time. Looking elsewhere for archaeological employment, he unsuccessfully applied for a Craven Fellowship and for a post at Bombay Museum.|$|E
5|$|Among Imperial {{historian}}s {{who wrote in}} Greek are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Jewish historian Josephus, and the senator Cassius Dio. Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer and antiquarian Plutarch, the <b>geographer</b> Strabo, and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian. Popular Greek romance novels {{were part of the}} development of long-form fiction works, represented in Latin by the Satyricon of Petronius and The Golden Ass of Apuleius.|$|E
50|$|In particular, {{physical}} <b>geographers</b> {{study the}} natural environment while human <b>geographers</b> study human society.

5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and <b>geographer</b> C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E

5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian <b>geographer</b> Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (probably a bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed instruments, including the violin.|$|E

The city then was known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek <b>geographer</b> Ptolemy in 150CE. The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were built between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.|$|E

5|$|A keen <b>geographer,</b> Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|According to Béla Miklós Szőke's theory, the {{detailed}} description of the Magyars by western contemporary sources and the immediate Hungarian intervention in local wars give the presumption that the Hungarians had already lived on the eastern territories of the Carpathian Basin since the middle of the 9th century. Regarding the right location of early Hungarian settlements, the Arabic <b>geographer</b> al-Jayhani (only snippets of his work survived in other Muslim authors' papers) in the 870s placed the Hungarians between Don and Danube rivers. Szőke identifies al-Jayhani's Danube with the middle Danube region, as opposed to the previously assumed lower Danube region, because following al-Jayhani's description the Christian Moravians were the western neighbors of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Al-Rahba {{came under}} Hamdanid rule {{a few years}} later, {{becoming}} part of the Euphrates district (tariq al-Furat) of the Mosul-based emirate. At the time, the town was described by the Persian <b>geographer</b> al-Istakhri, as being larger than the ancient Circesium {{on the opposite side of}} the Euphrates. The lord of al-Rahba, Jaman, rebelled against the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla (r. 929–967). Jaman fled the town and drowned in the Euphrates but not before al-Rahba was heavily damaged in the rebellion's suppression. Nasir al-Dawla granted his favored son, Abu'l Muzzafar Hamdan, control of al-Rahba, its district of Diyar Mudar, and the district's revenues.|$|E
