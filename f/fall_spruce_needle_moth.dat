50|$|Archips packardianus, {{the spring}} <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> <b>moth</b> or <b>spruce</b> needleworm, is {{a species of}} moth of the family Tortricidae. <b>Spruce</b> <b>needle</b> worms are {{commonly}} found in small numbers on spruce and trees of other coniferous genera throughout most of Canada and northeastern USA (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Archips packardiana Fernald overwinters as a tiny larva in a mined needle. Needle mining is resumed in the spring, the larvae later moving to feed on new foliage, where they spin considerable webbing. Full grown larvae have a pale green head, sometimes patterned with brown, and a pale body and pale thoracic legs, and are about 20 mm long. The larva pupates, usually in the webbed needles, and the adult emerges in summer to early fall. The closely related Archips strianus Fernald is much less common, but probably has a habitat {{similar to that of}} A. packardiana (Rose and Lindquist 1985). The larvae have dark thoracic legs and small dark areas {{around the base of the}} thoracic hairs. The habitat consists of coniferous and mixed woods.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In a {{two years}} project <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> {{samples of the}} Austrian Bioindicator Grid were {{analysed}} by gamma spectrometry to detect the geographical and temporal distribution of radionuclides in <b>spruce</b> <b>needles</b> of the last 25 years with the main focus on the radioactive contamination {{before and after the}} Chernobyl fallout in 1986. This radioecological evaluation {{is an important part of}} an existing environmental surveillance programme in Upper Austria in order to gain basic information on the impact of environmental changes on the radioecological behaviour of spruce trees. Moreover, the results of the current studies can be an important input for the discussion of using whole trees for biomass energy. Every year <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> samples of the two youngest needle sprouts are taken from two spruce trees at each location of the Bioindicator Grid. For this study samples of selected locations — evenly spaced out among the area of Upper Austria — were analysed for different natural and anthropogenic radionuclides: 137 Cs, 40 K, 210 Pb, 226 Ra, 228 Ra, 238 U. Additionally, soil samples were taken at selected sites to study the relationship between 137 Cs- and 40 K-activity concentrations in soils and <b>spruce</b> <b>needles</b> and to estimate transfer factors. Another important question of the study is the correlation between anthropogenic pollutants and radionuclides. To date more than 500 <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> samples were analysed. 137 Cs- activity concentrations reach D. L.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2000 The global {{distribution}} of {{persistent organic pollutants}} has initiated considerable effort towards understanding long range atmospheric transport and partitioning of these potentially damaging compounds. Apparent latitude dependent concentration gradients of organic pollutants in otherwise pristine environments {{has given rise to}} a global fractionation model, coined the cold finger effect. According to the cold finger theory, semi-volatile persistent organic pollutant will show a preference for partitioning from the atmosphere to the ground and vegetation at northern latitudes. Here we present a study of hexachlorobenzene in <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> samples across Alaska, which offers a large range of climates, from its southern coastal rain forests to the northern arctic. The large variation in climate across Alaska should result in a measurable latitude dependent concentration gradient for HCB, if the cold finger effect is being realized. <b>Spruce</b> <b>needle</b> samples were extracted, cleaned, and analyzed by GC/MS. According to principle component regression analysis, HCB concentrations in all the <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> samples across Alaska show a strong positive correlation with lipid content of the needles. The HCB concentrations also show two distinct latitude trends. The <b>spruce</b> <b>needle</b> samples taken from the coast to approximately 63 ° north show relatively high HCB concentrations and a possible negative correlation with latitude. The samples between 63 ° and 68 ° north show a definite positive correlation between HCB concentration and latitude, which is consistent with the cold finger effect...|$|R

40|$|The Hyrcanian {{forests in}} the Northern Iran are {{originally}} poor of coniferous and are considered as a refugium of temperate broad-leaved trees during the Quaternary glaciations. In this study mass loss and nutrients dynamic of Norway <b>spruce</b> <b>needles</b> when combined with oriental beech litter was investigated in a 50 -year plantation of pure Norway spruce in the Hyrcanian forests. The litter bags technique was used to monitor the mass loss and nutrients concentration after 60, 120, 180, 270 and 400 days. The results showed that when decomposed alone the mass loss rate of spruce needles was generally lower than what reported in Europe. However, when combined with oriental beech litter the mass loss rate was hastened compared to when decomposed alone. A positive non-additive effect of beech leaf litter was observed on spruce nutrients dynamic. The concentration of N, P, K, and Mg in combined <b>spruce</b> <b>needles</b> with beech litter was generally higher compared to when <b>spruce</b> <b>needles</b> decomposed alone during decomposition time. While the concentration of Mn and Ca in combined spruce needles with beech litter was generally higher than when spruce needles decomposed alone.

The {{first part of}} thesis summarizes literature dealing with methods of estimating lignin and other biochemicals content.

The largest amount of chlorophyll in needles is accumulated towards late summer and autumn, the smallest one – in winter and is determined by forest growth and environmental conditions.

The models show that three possible sources of PAHs exist in eastern Alaska, urban sites (Fairbanks, Anchorage and Valdez), ocean air, and forest fires. Distribution of PAHs away from these sources is strongly correlated with elevation. The general trend shows that PAH concentrations increase as elevation and proximity to sources decrease...|$|R
