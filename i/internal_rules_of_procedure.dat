50|$|The National Archives of Egypt {{are among}} the oldest in the world, for while the National Archives of France were {{established}} in 1794 and the Public Record Office, London, wasn't established until 1838, the National Archives were founded in Cairo in 1828. It dates, therefore, to the 19th century when Mohammed Ali Pasha constructed {{a place in the}} Cairo Citadel to preserve official records and named it Daftarkhana (House of Documentation). The main aim behind its construction was collecting written documentation of the state’s activities and maintaining it in one place; thus, it eventually turned to a storehouse of Egypt's national heritage. The first to head Daftarkhana was Ragheb Effendi; whereas, the first to set its <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> was John, the expenditure clerk. The Egyptian House of Documentation (Daftarkhana) accumulated so many governmental documents after they were no longer needed that Mohammed Ali was forced to construct Archival Storehouse in governmental ministers and agencies in the capital as well as the provincial governorates.|$|R

This work reviews the key revisions of the Single European Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties relative to the EP to gain an understanding of what types of internal EP reform were required by each new treaty.

This research highlights some broad patterns of Rules reform, but also how these have changed over time. In particular the balance between required Rules reforms and internally and externally oriented strategic reforms is examined...|$|E
5000|$|Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent are {{distinct}} from Royal Assent. Royal Assent is granted after a bill has passed through parliament, whereas Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent, where required, are granted before parliament has debated or voted {{to pass a}} bill. Royal Assent is also required for all legislation, whereas Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent are only required for legislation affecting specific topics. In practice, Royal Assent is less frequently denied than is Queen's Consent or Prince's Consent. Royal Assent forms part of the constitution and lies under the Royal Prerogative, while Queen's Consent and Prince's Consent are <b>internal</b> parliamentary <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> that could, in principle, be dispensed with by parliament. As Erskine May wrote: These several forms of communication are recognised as constitutional declarations of the Crown, suggested by the advice of its responsible ministers, by whom they are announced to Parliament, in accordance with established usage. They cannot be misconstrued into any interference with the proceedings of Parliament, as {{some of them are}} rendered necessary by resolutions of the House of Commons, and all are founded upon parliamentary usage, which both houses have agreed to observe. This usage is not binding upon Parliament; but if, without the consent of the Crown, previously signified, Parliament should dispose of the interests or affect the prerogative of the Crown, the Crown could still protect itself, in a constitutional manner, by the refusal of the royal assent to the bill. And {{it is one of the}} advantages of this usage, that it obviates the necessity of resorting to the exercise of that prerogative.|$|R

40|$|The European Union (EU) is an {{extraordinary}} achievement. From a regional economic organization, it grew into a polity within fifty years. The original EU of six members expanded incrementally to 27 over forty years, and it now comprises a population of almost 500 million people. While the five expansions of the European Economic Community/European Community/European Union (EU) have received considerable scholarly attention, surprisingly {{little attention has been}} given to their impacts on 2 ̆ 2 Europe 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 only legislative body, currently known as the European Parliament (EP). More specifically, little is known about how waves of new members (from widely diverse parties and national backgrounds) affected—and were affected by—the EP 2 ̆ 7 s organizational structure and its internal processes. The purpose of this study therefore is to help fill this gap by describing and explaining how the various EEC/EC/EU expansions or 2 ̆ 2 membership shocks 2 ̆ 2 (1973, 1981, 1986, 1995, and 2004) affected the EP 2 ̆ 7 s organizational structure and its <b>internal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Procedure</b> (RoP). ^ The central research question of this dissertation is the following: What were the major structural and procedural effects of the five membership expansions of what eventually became the European Union on the European Parliament? This dissertation answers this question by using concepts and measures drawn from organizational theory. While other studies have applied concepts and hypotheses from organizational theory to legislatures, such an approach has never been used to analyze the EP, which is conceptualized here as a 2 ̆ 2 membership organization. 2 ̆ 2 This study, through an analysis of the EP, demonstrates that organization theory can help us fully understand the effects of membership expansions on any membership organization. That is, understanding how this particular organization responded to change can inform not only how others in this class (legislatures) do so, but how this process unfolds in a variety of times and places. ^ The principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) EP staff growth revealed an interesting pattern: Staff did not increase concurrently with EP membership. That is, {{it turned out that the}} rate of membership growth exceeded the rate of staff increase, suggesting professionalization of EP staff and their relative empowerment vis-à-vis MEPs; (2) The number of rules and the precision within them increased; (3) the largest number of EP rule changes focused on increasing EP efficiency; and (4) The authority was centralized in the hands of EP leadership, that is, the EP President, the Conference of Presidents and also two major political groups. ...|$|E

Išanalizuoti pacientų nuomonę apie konfidencialumo užtikrinimą. Įvertinti pacientų socialinių ir demografinių veiksnių sąsajas su konfidencialumo principo užtikrinimu. Nustatyti pacientų nuomonę apie konfidencialios informacijos nutekėjimo priežastis. Tyrimo metodika. Keturiose skirtingo dydžio stacionarinėse asmens sveikatos priežiūros įstaigose atlikta anoniminė anketinė pacientų apklausa. Apklausos metu išdalintos 382 anketos (atsako dažnis 69, 1 proc.). Statistinė duomenų analizė atlikta naudojant SPSS programinį paketą (versija SPSS 20). Tarpusavyje susijusių požymių hipotezėms tikrinti skaičiuotas Chi kvadrato ( 2) kriterijus. Statistinių hipotezių reikšmingumui įvertinti pasirinktas 95 proc. reikšmingumo lygmuo (p< 0, 05). Rezultatai. Tyrimo duomenų analizė atskleidė, kad respondentų žinios apie LR PTŽSAĮ ir jo garantijas yra nepakankamos. LR PTŽSAĮ žinojo tik trečdalis (31, 0 proc.) pacientų. Statistiškai reikšmingai daugiau pacientų su aukštuoju išsilavinimu žinojo įstatymo garantijas, nei turintys žemesnį išsilavinimą respondentai. Daugiau nei pusė (57, 9 proc.) pacientų teigė, kad patekę į skyrių, buvo supažindinti su vidaus tvarkos taisyklėmis. Savo sveikatos informacijos konfidencialumu susirūpinęs trečdalis (35, 2 proc.) respondentų. Likusiai apklaustųjų daliai (16, 9 proc.) informacijos konfidencialumo klausimas svarbus iš dalies. Mažiau nei dešimtadalis (8, 1 proc.) teigė, kad jų konfidenciali sveikatos informacija, be jų sutikimo buvo atskleista kitiems asmenims. Labiausiai suinteresuoti pacientai dėl savo sveikatos informacijos konfidencialumo gydosi pačioje mažiausioje ligoninėje, turinčioje iki 150 lovų. Ten daugiau nei pusė (56, 7 proc.) pacientų išreiškė nuomonę, kad jiems yra svarbu kaip gydytojas ir kitas medicinos personalas elgsis su sveikatos informacija. Išvados. Tyrimas parodė kad, pacientų nuomone, jų teisė į konfidencialios informacijos saugumo užtikrinimą yra įgyvendinama gerai. Trečdaliui respondentų (35, 2 proc.) svarbu, kad jų konfidenciali sveikatos informacija būtų saugoma. Daugiausiai tokių pacientų gydėsi mažiausioje ligoninėje. Didžiausia dalis mažoje ligoninėje besigydžiusių pacientų prašė gydytojų neatskleisti informacijos susijusios su jų sveikata. Nedidelė pacientų dalis (8, 1 proc.) teigė, kad jų konfidenciali sveikatos informacija buvo atskleista. Tokių atvejų taip pat daugiausiai buvo mažiausioje ligoninėje. Tyrimas parodė, kad savo sveikatos informaciją labiau linkę saugoti mažoje ligoninėje besigydantys pacientai. Praktinės rekomendacijos. Siekiant gerinti pacientų konfidencialios informacijos užtikrinimą stacionarinėse ASPĮ reikėtų iki minimumo sumažinti paciento sveikatos, gydymo ir tyrimų rezultatų aptarimą palatose, girdint kitiems pacientams. Pacientams turėtų būti sudarytos sąlygos, esant pageidavimui, sveikatos būklę, tyrimų rezultatus, gydymo galimybes su gydytoju aptarti negirdint kitiems pacientams, ramiai gydytojo kabinete, ar kitoje, specialiai tam pritaikytoje patalpoje. Aim of the study: To {{evaluate}} patient {{opinions about}} the confidentiality in inpatient health care institutions. Objectives. To analyze the patients' views on confidentiality assurance. To assess the relations of the socio-demographic factors of patients to the assurance of the confidentiality principle. To determine the patients' opinion {{about the causes of}} leakage of confidential information. Methods: The anonymous survey of patients was carried out in four in-patient health care institutions of different sizes. A total of 382 questionnaires were distributed during the survey (response rate 69. 1 per cent). The statistical data analysis was performed using the SPSS software package (SPSS 20 version). The Chi-square ( 2) criteria was calculated to check the hypotheses of interrelated signs. Inferential statistical significance assessment was {{made on the basis of}} 95 per cent significance level (p < 0. 05). Results. Analysis of data revealed that the respondents' awareness of the Law on the Patient Rights and Compensation of Damage to Health of the Republic of Lithuania and its guarantees is insufficient. 31. 0 per cent of patients were aware of the Law on the Patient Rights and Compensation of Damage to Health. Statistically significantly more patients with higher education were aware of the guarantees offered in the law, as compared to the respondents with lower education. 57. 9 per cent of patients said that they have been introduced to the <b>internal</b> <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedure</b> upon arrival to the institution. Confidentiality of their health information was a concern to a third (35. 2 per cent) of respondents. For the rest of the respondents (16. 9 per cent), the issue of confidentiality was important partially. 8. 1 per cent said that their confidential health information has been disclosed to others without their consent. The patients most concerned in their health information confidentiality were treated in the smallest hospital, which has up to 150 beds. There, more than half (56. 7 per cent) of patients stated that handling of their health information by the doctor and other medical staff is important to them. Conclusions. The study showed that in the opinion of the patients their right to assuring the confidentiality of information is implemented well. For one third of the respondents (35. 2 per cent) it was important that their confidential health information is protected. Most of these patients sought treatment in the smallest hospital. The largest part of patients treated in the small hospital asked doctors not to disclose information relating to their health. A small proportion of patients (8. 1 per cent) said that their confidential health information has been disclosed. The highest number of such cases also were reported in the smallest hospital. The research showed that the patients treated in a small hospital are more inclined to protect their health information. Practical recommendations. In order to improve the security of patients' confidential information in inpatient PHIs it is necessary to minimize the discussion of patient's treatment, health and test results in the wards, where it can be overheard by other patients. Patients should be provided with an opportunity, upon request, to discuss their medical condition, test results and treatment options with their doctor in absence of other patients, quietly in the doctor's office or in a specially adapted room...|$|E
