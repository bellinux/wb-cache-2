5|$|At that time, the Federal {{government}} was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not <b>even</b> <b>need</b> to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E

25|$|For this {{challenge}} teams were altered due to blue now having 4 members and red being left with 2 after Jason's departure. Ivan and Katie chose Fenton {{to join their}} team and even the stakes. Next the teams were taken to a sausage kitchen. They then made their own sausage meat and ground it up into one long sausage {{that had to be}} rolled into normal sized sausages. Ivan was quite adapt at creating objects out of balloons so he was named the 'balloon man' for the challenge and helped the red team make over 400 sausages and win the round. New red team member Fenton was given the nickname 'bacon' as he had the reputation of 'bringing home the bacon.' The next part to the challenge was to construct a BBQ straight out of a flat-pack box. The blue team came out on top this time. Once assembled, the two teams then had to cook the sausages they had made for children (and their parents) from the local athletics club, who were now cheering the teams on. Each sausage had to be served with a different condiment. Then as part of the presenting aspect of the show, the teams were each given a megaphone which they used to try to persuade the kids to try their sausages over the other teams. It seemed like an out of control bidding war and while Katie and Bill did well at the task, Fenton didn't <b>even</b> <b>need</b> a microphone. In the end the judges differed in their opinions of who won. Ben believed the red team made the better sausage sizzle while Mark thought blue had it in the bag. Blue were selected as the winners and two from the red team were sent home.|$|E

500|$|The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31, {{and arrived}} outside Charleston Harbor the next day. Moultrie noticed a British scout boat {{apparently}} looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island (now {{known as the}} Isle of Palms), {{just a few hundred}} yards from Sullivan's Island; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan's. By June 8, most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five Fathom Hole, an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance. With the fort on Sullivan's Island only half complete, Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls. Optimistically believing he would not <b>even</b> <b>need</b> Clinton's land forces, he wrote to Clinton that after the fort's guns were knocked out, he would [...] "land seamen and marines (which I have practiced for the purpose) under the guns" [...] and that they could [...] "keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper".|$|E
500|$|Brinkley {{used his}} new border blaster {{to resume his}} {{campaign}} for governor by using the telephone to call in his broadcasts to the transmitter. This approach did not work, and he lost yet another political campaign; he would lose again in 1934. Though Brinkley's American radio license had been revoked, XER's signal {{was so strong that}} it could still be heard in Kansas. In 1932, the Mexican government allowed Brinkley to increase his wattage to 150,000 watts. Several months later, Brinkley was allowed to increase to one million watts, [...] "making XER far and away the most powerful radio station on the planet" [...] that, on a clear night, could be heard as far away as Canada. According to accounts of the time, the signal was so strong that it turned on car headlights, made bedsprings hum, and caused broadcasts to bleed into telephone conversations. Local residents didn't <b>even</b> <b>need</b> a radio to hear Brinkley's station; ranchers reported that they received it through their metal fences and in their dental appliances.|$|E
500|$|Reviewer James Berardinelli {{found the}} {{production}} of Doomsday to be a mess, complaining, [...] "The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't obfuscated by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting." [...] Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines {{to be too much}} for the film, weakening the eventual payoff. Dennis Harvey of Variety said Neil Marshall's [...] "flair for visceral action" [...] made up for Doomsdays lack of originality and that the film barely had a dull moment. He added, [...] "There's no question that Doomsday does what it does with vigor, high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous." [...] Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the [...] "stellar" [...] work of the stunt personnel. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of [...] "the beauty of the exploitation film era". Hartlaub said of the effect, [...] "Hire a couple of great stuntmen and a halfway sober cinematographer, and you didn't <b>even</b> <b>need</b> a screenwriter." ...|$|E

500|$|Shero was an innovator, {{aside from}} being the first coach to employ systems, and {{known as one of}} the first Western coaches to study Soviet influences, he was the first coach to study film. His son Ray even recalls his father {{breaking}} down games from radio broadcasts. He was also the first to have his players use in season strength training, with the use of an Apollo machine, a precursor to Nautilus equipment. As well as one of the first coaches to adopt the morning skate. He was one of the first coaches to have a game plan specifically designed on how to attack opposing teams, although not all of them worked to plan. Bernie Parent recalls a game against Montreal in which Shero decided to out skate the highly skilled Canadiens. After the first period, during which the Flyers' goaltender faced 21 shots, he jokingly summed it up by saying, [...] "the Zamboni didn't <b>even</b> <b>need</b> to resurface the other end of the ice." [...] Yet it illustrates Shero's understanding that he didn't know everything about coaching and his pursuit to learn more.|$|E
