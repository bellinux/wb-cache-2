5|$|The built {{environment}} around Coatbridge's town centre is characterised by its mixture of late nineteenth- and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> sandstone buildings and late twentieth-century precast concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas {{to the west}} and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various twentieth-century local authority housing buildings. Several high rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.|$|E

In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of her is as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E
5|$|Designs for {{the asylum}} {{departed}} from comic interpretations {{of a large}} mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of Alcatraz prison, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive treatment unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, 3 exterior areas, and 3 Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.|$|E

40|$|This article {{stems from}} a key question: was Habsburg Trieste truly a {{cosmopolitan}} and tolerant city? Building upon the interpretative category of "port Jews", established by David Sorkin and Lois C. Dubin, this study examines the social, economic and political behaviour of the Triestine Jews in the nineteenth- and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-centuries,</b> and conducts a comparison with the other religious minorities present in the Adriatic port during this period: Greeks, Protestants, Serbians and Armenians. The picture which emerges allows for the proposition of a new interpretative model, that of the "port-merchant. " The {{second part of the}} article focuses on {{the second half of the}} nineteenth-century, when the model of Trieste as a tolerant city was challenged by the nationalist fights between Italians and Slovenians, and by the political antisemitism. The city lost its capacity to include the 'Other', and was rapidly transformed into a genuine breeding-ground of Italian racism...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{distinct}} {{uses of the}} word [...] "chorus." [...] In the thirty-two bar song form that was most common in the <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> popular music (especially the Tin Pan Alley tradition), [...] "chorus" [...] referred to the entire main section of the song (which was in a thirty-two bar AABA form). Beginning in the rock music of the 1950s, another form became more common in commercial pop music, which was based in an open-ended cycle of verses instead of a fixed 32-bar form. In this form (which is more common than thirty-two bar form in later-twentieth century pop music), [...] "choruses" [...] with fixed lyrics are alternated with [...] "verses" [...] in which the lyrics are different with each repetition. In this use of the word, chorus contrasts with the verse, which usually {{has a sense of}} leading up to the chorus.

40|$|Book synopsis: The Emergence of the Fourth Dimension {{describes}} {{the development and}} proliferation {{of the idea of}} higher dimensional space in the late nineteenth- and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-centuries.</b> An idea from mathematics that was appropriated by occultist thought, it emerged in the fin de siècle as a staple of genre fiction and influenced a number of important Modernist writers and artists. Providing a context for thinking of space in dimensional terms, the volume describes an active interplay between self-fashioning disciplines and a key moment in the popularisation of science. It offers new research into spiritualism and the Theosophical Society and studies a series of curious hybrid texts. Examining works by Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, H. G. Wells, Henry James, H. P. Lovecraft, and others, the volume explores how new theories of the possibilities of time and space influenced fiction writers of the period, and how literature shaped, and was in turn shaped by, the reconfiguration of imaginative space occasioned by the n-dimensional turn. A timely study of the interplay between philosophy, literature, culture, and mathematics, it offers a rich resource for readers interested in nineteenth century literature, Modernist studies, science fiction, and gothic scholarship...|$|R

40|$|This study {{yields a}} broader {{understanding}} of the 2 ̆ 2 development of rhetorical instruction in the American college 2 ̆ 2 (Gold 15) {{by focusing on the}} composition programs at two little studied universities. This dissertation addresses the descriptions of composition courses as these appear in the course catalogs of two different kinds of institutions for which detailed information is available: a private research university (Brown University) and a land-grant institution (University of Rhode Island) which are located in the same state. Through a content analysis of the course catalog descriptions from 1890 through 1940, this study finds that both Brown University and URI embraced the current traditional rhetoric of the late nineteenth- and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-centuries</b> but in differing ways. Brown, counter to the current historical accounts of composition scholars, formed a composition program that maintained elements from its earlier classical curriculum while adopting many elements from current traditional rhetoric. With a strong departmental focus on literature, Brown 2 ̆ 7 s English department focused the first-year composition course on writing alone. URI, however, produced a composition program that focused on writing through literature in a typical current traditional method. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1993 Michael Taussig's Mimesis and Alterity revitalized {{the power}} of the mimetic faculty to craft a vision of nature that was neither the alienated subject of modern science nor the passively {{malleable}} medium of late twentieth-century social constructivism. Taussig drew explicitly on a tradition of <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> scholarship—Walter Benjamin, Roger Caillois, and Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno—that located in the mimetic faculty a way out of a techno-fetishized social milieu. This essay explores how mimesis has once again been endowed with revolutionary potential in the contemporary moment through the growing field of biomimicry. I show how mimesis promises a way toward a future free from human hubris and ecological catastrophe—and {{a way out of the}} conditions that have created the Anthropocene. I explore how this works in biomimetics, with a detailed look at one of the most celebrated examples of the biomimetic paradigm: the gecko's foot. But, I ultimately suggest that what has been so seductive about mimesis throughout history is that it offers a “way out” of political confrontation. In doing so, I argue mimesis too easily serves as a double mirror—rather than transform production, nonhuman life at the level of biology becomes a force for production...|$|R
40|$|Faithful {{aggregated}} {{accounts of}} the advancement of science are invaluable for those setting scientific policy as well as scholars {{of the history of}} science. As science develops the scholarly communityiÌ s determination of the accepted knowledge undergoes shifts. Within medicine these shifts include our understanding of what can cause disease and what defines specific disease entities. Shifts in accepted medical knowledge are captured in the medical literature. The Index Catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon GeneraliÌ s Office, United States Army, published from 1880 - 1961, is an extremely large index to medical literature. The newly digitized form of this index, referred to as the IndexCat, allows us a way to generate faithful {{accounts of the}} development of medical science during the late nineteenth- and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-centuries.</b> My data looks at shifts within the IndexCat surrounding three disease entities: syphilis, Huntington's chorea, and beriberi, and their interactions with two disease causation theories: germ and hereditary, from 1880 - 1930. Temporal changes in the prominent subject heading words and title words within the literature of these diseases and disease theories corroborate qualitative accounts of this same literature, which reports the complex and sometimes oblique process of knowledge accretion. Although preliminary, my results indicate that the IndexCat is a valuable tool for studying the development of medical knowledge...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} written in Turkish. Written for the special {{issue of the journal}} Pasaj Edebiyat on the canon of Turkish literature, the article explores the {{relationship}} between the formation of the literary canon and the forging of the national identity. It argues that the modern canon of Turkish literature, much like other national literatures in the Balkans and the Middle East, has been politically constructed after the break with the Ottoman past. Turkish literature has been fashioned through a 2 ̆ 2 literary exchange, 2 ̆ 2 much like the 1924 “population exchange” between Greece and Turkey, insulating and sanitizing it from other literary traditions by deselecting ethnic and religious roots unfit for the nation in return for selecting those viewed as 2 ̆ 2 indigenous. 2 ̆ 2 The family of Anatolian and Balkan literatures, which have been cross-bred and cross-fertilized with each other for centuries, have been compartmentalized, sanitized and insulated from each other during the nation-building process of the late-nineteenth and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-centuries.</b> Inspired by the significance Benedict Anderson ascribes to print-capitalism in the imagining of national communities, the article suggests that re-imagining the nation as a more inclusive community might require the recognition of these cross-bred origins and the opening up of the literary canon to works excluded from the national literature due to their authors 2 ̆ 7 ethnic (non-Turkish) and religious (non-Muslim) backgrounds...|$|R
60|$|Always {{before in}} the {{development}} of warfare the shells and rockets fired had been but momentarily explosive, they had gone off in an instant once for all, and if there was nothing living or valuable within reach of the concussion and the flying fragments then they were spent and over. But Carolinum, which belonged to the beta group of Hyslop's so-called 'suspended degenerator' elements, once its degenerative process had been induced, continued a furious radiation of energy and nothing could arrest it. Of all Hyslop's artificial elements, Carolinum was the most heavily stored with energy and the most dangerous to make and handle. To this day it remains the most potent degenerator known. What the <b>earlier</b> <b>twentieth-century</b> chemists called its half period was seventeen days; that is to say, it poured out half of the huge store of energy in its great molecules in the space of seventeen days, the next seventeen days' emission was a half of that first period's outpouring, and so on. As with all radio-active substances this Carolinum, though every seventeen days its power is halved, though constantly it diminishes towards the imperceptible, is never entirely exhausted, and to this day the battle-fields and bomb fields of that frantic time in human history are sprinkled with radiant matter, and so centres of inconvenient rays.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explains {{processes of}} change and adaptation undergone by the early phonographs and talking machines, documenting social and musical forces through which consumers and businessmen shaped an in-home culture for sound recordings during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. As a force for change in music in the home, the early phonograph embraced middle-class ideologies exemplified in the parlor of the late nineteenth- and <b>early</b> <b>twentieth-centuries</b> in order to create a domestic market. Early phonograph companies realized that women maintained and managed the affairs of the parlor, deciding what items were purchased for display and what activities were morally acceptable. Other responsibilities included controlling the household funds and providing music education in the home. For these reasons, the developing recording industry targeted women as a specific consumer group ensuring the success of the talking machine and creation of an "in-home" culture for pre-recorded music in America, one that continues to affect the way we consume music today. Initially designed as a speech recorder, Edison's invention was viewed by the majority of Americans as a machine without daily application. Instead, the phonograph needed to be identified as a perfected instrument, a piece of parlor furniture, and a device capable of saving housewives time, labor and money. By providing pre-recorded music in the form of discs, this device replaced playing and singing around the piano in the home. Opera arias were featured in the early phonograph advertisements since they represented the "best music," sung by the "greatest singers," and provided an instant source of culture, quality entertainment, education and social status for those who purchased the pre-recorded discs. Capitalizing on the "prima-donna" complex prevalent among young women of the time, the early recording industry also promised superior voice lessons by the greatest singers on repeatable discs. Finally, the early phonograph companies placed a high priority on music appreciation. The ability to enjoy "quality music" and discuss merits of a particular piece became an important display of musical ability, one as relevant and refined as actual playing and singing...|$|R
