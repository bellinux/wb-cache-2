25|$|The biggest {{downside}} to the 200B was the noise the driver {{would have to}} endure. The 2-litre overhead cam engine could be very loud when pushed up through the rev range, and {{to make matters worse}} there was always plenty of <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.|$|E
25|$|At Loudon, Johnson {{finished}} 6th after {{blowing a}} tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes {{came to an}} end when his car broke a <b>drive</b> <b>line,</b> leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.|$|E
