5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design of tender, {{which came to}} be known as Type 'A' was designed for the first ten streamlined locomotives. These were of welded tank construction and included side sheets extending from the rear of the tender, which had the effect of reducing drag from eddies between the tender and the leading coach. 28 of these were constructed to be coupled with all the 24 streamliners (Nos. 6220–6229 and Nos. 6235–6248) as well as four of the unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6249–6252). In practice, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the side sheets made it more difficult to access the water filler as well as the couplings.|$|E
5|$|Depending on when Salmon graduated, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> cricket was {{a normal}} {{activity}} at Oxford for some time before Phillips wrote his pamphlet. It was certainly well established at Oxford by October 1728 when the 19-year-old Samuel Johnson entered Pembroke College. He told James Boswell that cricket matches were played during the one year he was at Oxford and this was recorded by Boswell in his Life of Samuel Johnson. A comment by Horace Walpole confirms that cricket was being played at Eton {{during the first quarter}} of the 18th century. The earliest reference to cricket being played at Cambridge University is dated 1710 and both of those establishments were attended by William Goldwin who, in 1706, wrote a Latin poem of 95 lines on a rural cricket match. It was called In Certamen Pilae (On a Ball Game) and it was published in his Musae Juveniles.|$|E

25|$|The shear {{threshold}} requirement seems counterintuitive because increasing shear elevates {{the force}} applied to adhesive bonds and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> this should increase the dislodging ability. Nevertheless, cells roll more slowly and more regularly until an optimal shear is reached where rolling velocity is minimal. This paradoxical phenomenon {{has not been}} satisfactorily explained despite the widespread interest.|$|E
25|$|The Millennium {{has brought}} forth {{new types of}} modern advertising.

They almost possess a soft-core pornographic theme to them.|$|E
25|$|Actually, the {{concession}} by Flook made the Flook case an easy one. But one could hardly expect any applicant {{in a subsequent}} case to make a similar concession. It is unclear how to apply {{the principle of the}} Flook case to other cases where no such concession exists. In one class of case, where the implementation is utterly trivial on its face, as in Funk v. Kalo Inoculant Co., the applicability of the same principle seems clear. But that appears to be the outer limit of the easy case. Once reasonable persons can differ on whether the implementation is barely removed from the natural principle, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the Flook principle cannot be employed. If a full-scale Graham v. Deere analysis must be used to evaluate the implementation, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> the case can no longer be disposed of on section 101 grounds. That is what appears to have happened in the next member of the trilogy, Diamond v. Diehr.|$|E

50|$|Thus <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> for {{at least}} some of members of the JCPC, {{geographical}} and psychological distance (often raised as necessary for greater objectivity and impartiality) {{does not seem to be}} an issue and what is more important is the need for the Caribbean (and other Commonwealth countries) to take care of its own affairs. In fact, the Privy Council has often been willing to accept findings by Caribbean courts on local matters because they recognize that such courts are more familiar with Caribbean matters.|$|R

25|$|In some respects, Thabit is {{critical}} of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, particularly regarding motion. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> here his ideas are based on an acceptance of using arguments concerning motion in his geometrical arguments.

25|$|During {{this time}} he lived principally at Dundee, and married on 6 June 1777 Henrietta, {{daughter}} of Robert Dundas of Arniston, Lord President of the Court of Session. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> his alliance with this influential family obtained him the employment {{which he had been}} vainly seeking during fifteen years.

Although she was a militant feminist and active suffragette, and published a perceptive and admiring profile of Emmeline Pankhurst, West also criticized the tactics of Pankhurst's daughter, Christabel, and the sometimes doctrinaire aspects of the Pankhursts' Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).|$|E
25|$|Where {{a tenant}} {{adversely}} possesses land, {{there is a}} presumption that he is doing {{so in a way}} that will benefit his landlord at the end of his term. If the land does not belong to his landlord, the land will become part of both the tenancy and the reversion. If the land does belong to his landlord, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> it will be gained by the tenant but only for the period of his term.|$|E
25|$|Because pronominal {{reference}} systems to the speaker, addressee, {{and a third}} person are so common (some argue universal) cross-linguistically, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> pronoun systems are quite stable. However, the changes involved in second-person pronouns in English call this stability into question and highlight the significance of social forces in language development. The spread of feudalistic ideology caused many European languages to develop two sets of second-person singular pronouns in order to reflect hierarchy. Therefore, pronouns encoded not only person or number, but also the speaker's assessment of the addressee's status and the speaker-addressee relationship.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> {{appropriate}} <b>that</b> {{the arrival}} of a volume would be a MediaArrival and {{the arrival of}} a non-volume a DeviceArrival, none of these Event types are used for volumes at all (See EventHandler (volume)).|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> the common-law {{position}} {{remains largely}} intact {{and that it}} is constitutionally permissible to take the late disclosure of an alibi into account in determining what weight should be attached to the alibi defence.|$|R

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> in {{the reign}} of Claudius (AD 41-54) the quaestors had become {{responsible}} for the paving of the streets of Rome, or at least shared that responsibility with the quattuorviri viarum.

There was certainly no lack of precedents for this enforced liberality, and the change made by Claudius may have been a mere change {{in the nature of the}} expenditure imposed on the quaestors.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a}} {{pleasant}} day out {{for a couple of}} the canons or friars of Wells to hire horses and ride over to talk business with Denys, perhaps an excuse to enjoy some all-expenses paid entertainment. It appears that Denys held the farm until his death in 1422, although records are not available to confirm this. A cadet branch of the Denys family became lords of the manor of Pucklechurch, probably in the 16th century, and continuing until the death of William Dennis in 1701, last of the male line.|$|E
25|$|This {{possession}} of the battlefield, and the capture of 21 pieces of cannon, were the only advantages of which the French could boast as the immediate result of so severe a struggle. With these, however, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>that</b> Napoleon was fully satisfied: if he had entertained any idea of pursuit, it was now abandoned; he took no measures for watching the movements and prying into the designs of the Prussians: but left his troops resting in their bivouacs, offering no molestation whatever to the Prussians, whilst he in person returned to Fleurus, where he passed the night.|$|E
