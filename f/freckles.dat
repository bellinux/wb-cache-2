5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more <b>freckles</b> than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E

40|$|Greater {{understanding}} of choroidal <b>freckling</b> in patients affected by {{neurofibromatosis type 1}} (NF 1) has changed the previous belief that choroidal lesions are unusual in eyes with this disease. In fact, the high frequency of <b>freckling</b> suggests that the choroid is a structure commonly affected in patients with NF 1. A review of patients aged 16 years or younger was performed. Recent studies using near-infrared reflectance imaging have shown that choroidal <b>freckling</b> frequently occurred in pediatric patients. As {{a result of these}} findings, some authors have suggested that choroidal <b>freckling</b> should be considered as a new diagnostic criterion for NF 1...|$|R
50|$|While {{there has}} been little {{research}} into the bathing behaviour of the <b>freckled</b> duck, it is known that a body of water (e.g. a swamp or dam) is essential for many natural behaviours such as feeding, mating and bathing. <b>Freckled</b> ducks have been observes preening both within water and after emerging from water while in a roosting position. There {{is no evidence that the}} <b>freckled</b> duck dust bathes or requires any other substrate for bathing.|$|R
5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial <b>freckles</b> and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship with a cool, adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristics}} of an organism arise {{to some extent}} deterministically (e.g., {{under the influence of}} genes and the environment) and to some extent randomly. For example, the density of <b>freckles</b> that appear on a person's skin is controlled by genes and exposure to light; whereas the exact location of individual <b>freckles</b> seems random.|$|E

50|$|The <b>freckled</b> duck (Stictonetta naevosa) is a {{waterfowl}} species {{endemic to}} Australia. The <b>freckled</b> duck {{has also been}} referred to as the monkey duck or the oatmeal duck. These birds are usually present in mainland Australia, but disperse to coastal and subcostal wetlands in the dry period. During such times it is common for the <b>freckled</b> duck population to congregate in flocks in the same area, giving the impression that they are more common than they really are.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, about 25% of the {{population}} carries the mutated melanocortin 1 receptor that causes red hair. With one in four people as carriers, the chance of two people having a child with red hair is about 2% (one in 64). The prevalence of red hair varies considerably worldwide. People with <b>freckles</b> and no red hair have an 85% chance of carrying the MC1R gene that is connected to red hair. People with no <b>freckles</b> and no red hair have an 18% chance of carrying the MC1R gene linked to red hair.|$|E

50|$|The diet of the <b>freckled</b> duck {{has been}} {{subjected}} to a degree of controversy and disagreement over the years, potentially due to the versatile diet of different populations and distributions of this duck. Despite this, it is widely agreed that the <b>freckled</b> duck is a resilient, specialist filter feeder that consumes a range of aquatic vegetation, insects, algae, larvae and crustaceans. Studies have found that the <b>freckled</b> duck prefers to feed in shallow water, using its bill to strain food particles from the mud or sand.|$|R

25|$|<b>Freckles</b> {{usually only}} occur {{in people with}} very lightly {{pigmented}} skin. They vary from very dark to brown in colour and develop a random pattern on {{the skin of the}} individual. Solar lentigines, the other types of <b>freckles,</b> occur among old people regardless of skin colour. People with very light skin (types I and II) make very little melanin in their melanocytes, and have very little or no ability to produce melanin in the stimulus of UV radiation. This can result in frequent sunburns and a more dangerous, but invisible, damage done to connective tissue and DNA underlying the skin. This can contribute to premature aging and skin cancer. The strongly red appearance of lightly pigmented skin as a response to high UV radiation levels is caused by the increased diameter, number, and blood flow of the capillaries.|$|E

His book was directed towards parents, and while some topics would be familiar to orthopedists today, it also included 'excessive sweating of the palms' and <b>freckles.</b>|$|E
