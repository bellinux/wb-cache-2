50|$|Following {{operational}} trials {{with the}} QT-2PC in Vietnam, a production aircraft, designated the YO-3A was ordered. This aircraft's design was {{also based on}} the Schweizer SGS 2-32 glider. Like the QT-2PC, the YO-3A has a large wingspan and a larger canopy area for observation. Two crew members (a pilot and an observer) are seated in tandem. The observer {{is located at the}} front of the cockpit. The YO-3 is an all-metal low-wing monoplane of semi-monocoque construction. The control surfaces of the YO-3 including the ailerons and rudder are fabric covered. The engine cover, canopy, engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>shroud,</b> wing-root fairings, and wheel-well fairings were constructed of fiberglass. The YO-3 has retractable tailwheel-type landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|In early Su-24 ("Fencer A" [...] {{according}} to NATO) aircraft these intakes had variable ramps, allowing a maximum speed of 2320 km/h, Mach 2.18, at altitude and a ceiling of 17500 m. Because the Su-24 is used almost exclusively for low-level missions, the actuators for the variable intakes were deleted to reduce weight and maintenance. This {{has no effect}} on low-level performance, but absolute maximum speed and altitude are cut to Mach 1.35 and 11000 m. The earliest Su-24 had a box-like rear fuselage, which was soon changed in production to a rear <b>exhaust</b> <b>shroud</b> more closely shaped around the engines in order to reduce drag. The revised aircraft also gained three side-by-side antenna fairings in the nose, a repositioned braking chute, and a new ram-air inlet {{at the base of the}} tail fin. The revised aircraft were dubbed [...] "Fencer-B" [...] by NATO, but did not merit a new Soviet designation.The Su-24's fixed armament is a single fast-firing GSh-6-23 cannon with 500 rounds of ammunition, mounted in the fuselage underside. The gun is covered with an eyelid shutter when not in use. The armament includes various nuclear weapons. Two or four R-60 (NATO AA-8 'Aphid') infrared missiles are usually carried for self-defence by the Su-24M/24MK.|$|E

50|$|Results from combat {{use were}} not {{dissimilar}} from {{experiences with the}} Strela-2/2M from Vietnam: while 42 helicopters were shot down by various Strela-2 variants (including a few Mi-24s until <b>exhaust</b> <b>shrouds</b> made them next to invisible to the short-wavelength Strela-2 seeker) only five fixed-wing aircraft were destroyed with the weapon. Due to its poor kinematic performance and vulnerability {{to even the most}} primitive infra-red countermeasures, the guerrillas considered the Strela-2 suitable for use against helicopters and prop-driven transports, but not combat jets.|$|R

50|$|The {{front-mounted}} bypass fan has two stages. The annular {{discharge duct}} for the bypass fan {{runs along the}} full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle. This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine <b>exhaust</b> is <b>shrouded</b> in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air. Thus the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced.|$|R

These results, the instrumentation techniques, and configuration changes to the engine installation that were required to test this model are described. In test runs at facility Mach numbers of 5 to 7, an exhaust instrumentation ring which formed {{an extension of the}} engine <b>exhaust</b> nozzle <b>shroud</b> provided diagnostic measurements at 10 circumferential locations in the HRE combustor exit plane. The measurements included static and pitot pressures using conventional conical probes, combustion gas temperatures from cooled-gas pyrometer probes, and species concentration from analysis of combustion gas samples. Results showed considerable circumferential variation, indicating that efficiency losses were due to nonuniform fuel distribution or incomplete mixing. Results using the Mach 7 facility nozzle but with Mach 6 temperature simulation, 1590 to 1670 K, showed indications of incomplete combustion.

40|$|The {{effective}} design of three-dimensional flow systems such as a clustered multinozzle <b>shrouded</b> <b>exhaust</b> system requires {{detailed analysis of the}} internal flowfield. It is pointed out that new numerical techniques on the most modern vector computers are making these analyses practicable. In this paper, the upwind differenced implicit conservative supracharacteristics method (CSCM) for three-dimensional viscous flow is presented. The new method is an implicit 'method of planes' symmetric Gauss-Seidel relaxation scheme. The data is conveniently stored on successive planes along the streamwise coordinate, and the system of equations is solved twice in each successive plane of the streamwise coordinate. The developed new three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes algorithm combines the best features of the storage and computationally efficient space marching procedures with the generality of time dependent techniques to solve flows with elliptic and streamwise separated flows...|$|R
40|$|Hot flow aero-acoustic {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with Pratt & Whitney's High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) Mixer-Ejector Exhaust Nozzles by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) in the GEAE Anechoic Freejet Noise Facility (Cell 41) located in Evendale, Ohio. The tests evaluated the impact of various geometric and design parameters on the noise generated by a two-dimensional (2 -D) shrouded, 8 -lobed, mixer-ejector <b>exhaust</b> nozzle. The <b>shrouded</b> mixer-ejector provides noise suppression by mixing relatively low energy ambient air with the hot, high-speed primary exhaust jet. Additional attenuation was obtained by lining the shroud internal walls with acoustic panels, which absorb acoustic energy generated during the mixing process. Two mixer designs were investigated, the high mixing "vortical" and aligned flow "axial", along with variations in the shroud internal mixing area ratios and shroud length. The shrouds were tested as hardwall or lined with acoustic panels packed with a bulk absorber. A total of 21 model configurations at 1 : 11. 47 scale were tested. The models were tested over a range of primary nozzle pressure ratios and primary exhaust temperatures representative of typical HSCT aero thermodynamic cycles. Static as well as flight simulated data were acquired during testing. A round convergent unshrouded nozzle was tested to provide an acoustic baseline for comparison to the test configurations. Comparisons were made to previous test results obtained with this hardware at NASA Glenn's 9 - by 15 -foot low-speed wind tunnel (LSWT). Laser velocimetry was used to investigate external as well as ejector internal velocity profiles for comparison to computational predictions. Ejector interior wall static pressure data were also obtained. A significant reduction in exhaust system noise was demonstrated with the 2 -D shrouded nozzle designs...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{respirable dust}} surveys were {{conducted}} at six surface coal mines {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of dust control methods used on rotary rock drills and bulldozers. Dust controls commonly used on drills include a dry dust collection system, <b>exhausting</b> from a <b>shrouded</b> area around the collared hole, and an enclosed drill operator cab, filtering airborne dust from the cab. Bulldozers are also typically equipped with an enclosed operator cab as a dust control measure. Airborne respirable dust sampling was conducted near each equipment's source of generation and inside its enclosed cab. Silica analysis {{was performed on the}} dust samples to determine the percent silica content in the dust generated at the six mining operations. An additional eight- month follow-up of dust sampling was also conducted in the enclosed operator cabs of several rock drills and bulldozers. Data were analyzed for long-term variability of accepted control methods to abate dust and silica levels. The highwall rock drill was the major and most variable dust source as compared to the bulldozer, generating dust levels, on average, one order of magnitude higher than dust levels of the bulldozer. Four of the six drills surveyed had dust containment and capture problems at the shrouded drill table above the lple. Repairs or modifications to three of the drill dust collection systems were shown to reduce dust levels by more that 50 % next to the shrouded drill table. The enclosed operator cabs provided more than 90 % and more than 40 % lower dust levels than at the dust source for the drill and bulldozer, respectively. Long-term sampling of several of these highwall drills and bulldozers showed that the dust levels in the drill cabs were frequently higher than 0. 2 mg/m 3 and more variable than in the bulldozers. The bulldozer dust levels were frequently below 0. 2 mg/m). Future research should focus on improving some of the deficiencies present in the drill's primary dust collection system, and developing quality control methods to ensure the integrity of enclosed cab protection for equipment operators...|$|R
