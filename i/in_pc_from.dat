40|$|Pyruvate {{carboxylase}} (PC) catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, {{an important}} anaplerotic reaction in mammalian tissues. To effect catalysis, the tethered biotin of PC must {{gain access to}} active sites in both the biotin carboxylase domain and the carboxyl transferase domain. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} a mutation of threonine 882 to alanine <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> <b>from</b> Rhizobium etli renders the carboxyl transferase domain inactive and favors the positioning of biotin in the biotin carboxylase domain. We report the 2. 4 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the Rhizobium etli PC T 882 A mutant which reveals the first high-resolution description of the domain interaction between the biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain and the biotin carboxylase domain. The overall quaternary arrangement of Rhizobium etli PC remains highly asymmetrical and is independent of the presence of allosteric activator. While biotin is observed in the biotin carboxylase domain, its access to the active site is precluded by the interaction between Arg 353 and Glu 248, revealing a mechanism for regulating carboxybiotin access to the BC domain active site. The binding location for the biotin carboxyl carrier protein domain demonstrates that tethered biotin cannot bind in the biotin carboxylase domain active sit...|$|E

Gene expression profiling of 2 MM cell lines (OH- 2 and IH- 1) indicated that expression of PRL- 3, a metastasis-associated tyrosine phosphatase, was induced by several mitogenic cytokines. Cytokine-driven PRL- 3 expression could be shown in several myeloma cell lines at both the mRNA and protein levels. There was significantly higher expression of the PRL- 3 gene <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering myeloma (SMM), and myeloma than <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> healthy persons.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe role of postmenopause on the {{pathogenesis}} of cartilage degeneration has been an open question. We assessed cartilage degeneration in estrogen receptor (ER) α null mice and examined the role of glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP 1) in the ERα-dependent transcription of a type II collagen gene (col 2 a 1) with special reference to a crosstalk with the transforming growth factor (TGF) -β signaling pathway. MethodsThe vertebral cartilaginous endplate from female ERα null mice was subjected to histological analyses. Col 2 a 1 expression of primary chondrocytes (PCs) obtained from ERα null mice after 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and TGF-β 1 stimulation was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Estrogen response element (ERE) or col 2 a 1 promoter–enhancer luciferase reporter system was used to investigate the crosstalk among ERα, GRIP 1, and MKK 6. Col 2 a 1 expression and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content were measured in ATDC 5 cells treated with GRIP 1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). ResultsERα deficiency clearly accelerated impairment of the vertebral cartilaginous endplate. E 2 and TGF-β 1 stimulation increased col 2 a 1 expression <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> <b>from</b> wild-type mice, but not that from ERα null mice. The same stimulation increased the col 2 a 1 promoter–enhancer reporter activity, and the elevated activity was decreased by dominant-negative ERα and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor. GRIP 1 increased the E 2 -dependent ERE activation {{in the presence of}} ERα and constitutive-active MKK 6. GRIP 1 siRNA repressed col 2 a 1 expression and GAG production in ATDC 5 cells. ConclusionsCrosstalks between ERα/GRIP 1 and TGF-β/MKK 6 /p 38 MAPK pathway have protective roles on cartilage metabolism via regulating the extracellular matrices expression.

Methods: As it is impossible to differentially diagnose <b>PC</b> <b>from</b> CMFP, 60 participants older than 65 years with focal pancreatic lesions were scanned by 18 F-FDG PET/CT and their CA 19 - 9 levels were tested. Diagnoses of all participants were confirmed by comprehensive methods including aspiration biopsy, surgical pathology, and clinical follow-up of 12 months. Twenty participants with CMFP were included in CMFP group and 40 participants with <b>PC</b> <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> group. Results: <b>In</b> CMFP and <b>PC</b> groups, 46 participants showed increased 18 F-FDG uptake, 43 had elevated CA 19 - 9 levels, and 38 participants had both increased 18 F-FDG uptake and elevated CA 19 - 9 levels. Standardized uptake value maximum of PC group (5. 98 ± 2. 27) was significantly different from CMFP group (2. 58 ± 1. 81, P< 0. 05). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18 F-FDG PET/CT <b>in</b> differentiating <b>PC</b> <b>from</b> CMFP were 95 %, 60 %, and 83. 3 %, respectively. CA 19 - 9 levels of PC group (917. 44 ± 1, 088. 24) were significantly different from CMFP group (19. 09 ± 19. 54, P< 0. 05). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CA 19 - 9 levels <b>in</b> differentiating <b>PC</b> <b>from</b> CMFP were 87. 5 %, 60 %, and 78. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{discover}} novel markers {{for improving}} the efficacy of pancreatic cancer (PC) diagnosis, the secretome of two PC cell lines (BxPC- 3 and MIA PaCa- 2) was profiled. UL 16 binding protein 2 (ULBP 2), one of the proteins identified <b>in</b> the <b>PC</b> cell secretome, was selected for evaluation as a biomarker for PC detection because its mRNA level was also {{found to be significantly}} elevated <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> tissues. METHODS: ULBP 2 expression <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> tissues <b>from</b> 67 patients was studied by immunohistochemistry. ULBP 2 serum levels <b>in</b> 154 <b>PC</b> patients and 142 healthy controls were measured by bead-based immunoassay, and the efficacy of serum ULBP 2 for PC detection was compared with the widely used serological PC marker carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9). RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analyses revealed an elevated expression of ULPB 2 <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Meanwhile, the serum levels of ULBP 2 among all PC patients (n =  154) and in early-stage cancer patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (p< 0. 0001). The combination of ULBP 2 and CA 19 - 9 outperformed each marker alone <b>in</b> distinguishing <b>PC</b> patients <b>from</b> healthy individuals. Importantly, an analysis of the area under receiver operating characteristic curves showed that ULBP 2 was superior to CA 19 - 9 in discriminating patients with early-stage <b>PC</b> <b>from</b> healthy controls.

40|$|Functional {{crosstalk}} between cell-surface and intracellular ion channels plays {{important roles in}} excitable cells and is structurally supported by junctophilins (JPs) in muscle cells. Here, we report a novel form of channel crosstalk in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). The generation of slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) following complex spikes <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> required ryanodine receptor (RyR) -mediated Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release and the subsequent opening of small-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK) channels in somatodendritic regions. Despite the normal expression levels of these channels, sAHP was abolished <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> mutant mice lacking neural JP subtypes (JP-DKO), and this defect was restored by exogenously expressing JPs or enhancing SK channel activation. The stimulation paradigm for inducing long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber–PC synapses adversely established long-term potentiation in the JP-DKO cerebellum, primarily due to the sAHP deficiency. Furthermore, JP-DKO mice exhibited impairments of motor coordination and learning, although normal cerebellar histology was retained. Therefore, JPs support the Ca 2 +-mediated communication between voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, RyRs and SK channels, which modulates the excitability of PCs and is fundamental to cerebellar LTD and motor functions...|$|R

40|$|Neural {{circuits}} are initially redundant but rearranged through activity-dependent synapse elimination during postnatal development. This {{process is}} crucial for shaping mature neural circuits and for proper brain function. At birth, Purkinje cells (<b>PCs)</b> <b>in</b> the cerebellum are innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) with similar synaptic strengths. During postnatal development, a single CF is selectively strengthened <b>in</b> each <b>PC</b> through synaptic competition, the strengthened single CF undergoes translocation to a PC dendrite, and massive elimination of redundant CF synapses follows. To investigate the cellular mechanisms of this activity-dependent synaptic refinement, we generated mice with PC-selective deletion of the Cav 2. 1 P/Q-type Ca 2 + channel, the major voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel <b>in</b> <b>PCs.</b> <b>In</b> the PC-selective Cav 2. 1 knockout mice, Ca 2 + transients induced by spontaneous CF inputs are markedly reduced <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>in</b> vivo.

However, the BC-PC may have been prepared in a different way. The cytokines measured are generally derived from white blood cells. The platelet units used in the present study were not leukocyte-reduced, suggesting that higher levels of leukocyte-derived cytokines could be expected than in leukocyte-reduced platelet units. Increasing, but similar, levels during storage were observed <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> PRP and <b>in</b> BC-PCs indicating continuous release of cytokines over time. A number of other in vitro parameters were also included, viz. pH, pO 2, pCO 2, bicarbonate, Na+, K+, Cl-, glucose, and lactate. No significant differences were observed that would indicate difference in quality between the two types of platelet preparations. Previous studies suggest that the pH tends to be lower <b>in</b> PRP <b>PCs</b> than <b>in</b> BC-PCs. The presence of cytokines in platelet preparations poses a potential risk for transfusion-related reactions. The concentrations can be reduced by using leukocyte-reduced platelet units to avoid release of cytokines from leukocytes during storage. In addition, release of platelet-derived cytokines such as RANTES, alpha-TG, PF 4, and IL- 7 can be reduced by using storage media that will reduce activation of platelets associated with release of alpha-granule content. The clinical consequences of the effects of passive transfusion of low concentrations of leukocyte- or platelet-derived cytokines need to be addressed in further studies...|$|R

A presynaptic variant of cerebellar LTP can be evoked <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> by raised frequency stimulation (RFS) of parallel fibre at 4 - 16 Hz for 15 s. This form of LTP is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) and nitric oxide (NO), and can spread to distant synapses. Application of an extracellular NO scavenger, cPTIO, was found {{to prevent the spread}} of LTP to distant PF synapses in rat cerebellar slices. G-substrate may be an important mediator of the NO-dependent pathway for LTD. 8 - 16 Hz RFS of PFs without a high concentration of calcium chelator in the postsynaptic cell evokes LTD. In cerebellar slices from wild-type and transgenic, G-substrate knockout mice, 8 Hz RFS was applied to PFs, with a low concentration of postsynaptic calcium chelator. <b>In</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> wild-type mice, LTD predominated, whereas in those from transgenic mice LTP predominated. The ascending axon (AA) segment of the granule cell axon forms synapses with PCs as well as the PF segment. PPF and fluctuation analysis of EPSCs <b>in</b> rat <b>PCs</b> confirmed that the release sites of AA synapses have a greater probability of transmitter release than PF synapses. Furthermore, AA release sites have greater mean quantal amplitude than PF synapses, which is not due to a different type of postsynaptic receptor. AA synapses were found to have limited capacity to undergo the presynaptic variant of LTP, and were potentiated less than PF synapses in the presence of the PKA activator, forskolin.

40|$|Although the immunophenotype of {{plasma cells}} (<b>PCs)</b> <b>from</b> {{multiple}} myeloma (MM) patients {{has been extensively}} explored, information on the phenotypic characteristics of <b>PCs</b> <b>in</b> monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) patients is scanty and frequently controversial. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not PCs are phenotypically different in the two disorders and whether this criteria could be useful for the differential diagnosis between MGUS and MM remains to be explored. In the present study, the immunophenotypic profile of bone marrow <b>PCs</b> (BMPCs) <b>from</b> a group of 76 MGUS patients has been analyzed by flow cytometry and compared with that of BMPCs present in both MM patients (n = 65) and control subjects (n = 10). For that purpose, a large panel of monoclonal antibodies against PC-related antigens was used together with a sensitive methodology in which a minimum of 10 (3) <b>PCs</b> were studied. <b>In</b> all MGUS cases studied, two clearly defined and distinct PC subpopulations could be identified. One PC subpopulation, population A (33 +/- 31 % of total PCs), constantly displayed a high CD 38 expression with low forward light scatter (FSC) /side light scatter (SSC) and was positive for CD 19 and negative for CD 56 (only a small proportion of these PCs were weakly positive for CD 56). The other PC subpopulation, population B (67 +/- 31 % of total PCs), showed the opposite pattern; the antigen CD 56 was strongly positive and CD 19 was constantly negative, and it showed a lower CD 38 expression and higher FSC/SSC values than population A. Clonality studies (cytoplasmic light chain restriction, DNA content studies, and polymerase chain reaction assessment) confirmed the clonal nature of <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> population B and the polyclonal origin of <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> population A. Moreover, the polyclonal <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> MGUS displayed a phenotypic profile identical to that found <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> healthy individuals. By contrast, clonal <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> all MGUS patients displayed a similar antigenic profile to myelomatous PCs, with clear phenotypic differences with respect to normal PCs: lower intensity of CD 38 expression and a variable reactivity for markers that were not expressed <b>in</b> normal <b>PCs,</b> such as CD 28, CD 117, and sIg. Although the presence of residual polyclonal PCs was a constant finding in MGUS patients, it was a rare event in MM and, when present (only 22 % of MM cases), its frequency was significantly lower than that observed in MGUS (0. 25 % versus 32. 9 %, respectively; P < 0. 0001). Only 1. 5 % of patients with MM had more than 3 % of normal PCs, whereas 98 % of patients with MGUS had more than 3 %. Moreover, as shown by multivariate analysis, the number of residual polyclonal PCs was the most powerful single parameter for the discrimination between MGUS and MM patients at diagnosis, even when only stage I MM cases were considered...|$|R

The intermediate scattering function provides access to the time-dependence of these two dynamic processes, and they appear to correspond to transitions between inherent states and between metabasins on a potential energy landscape. By fitting the full q-dependence of inelastic scattering, we confirm that that the Johari-Goldstein (β_JG) relaxation <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> is indistinguishable <b>from</b> metabasin transitions...|$|R

40|$|A disintegrin and {{metalloprotease}} 10 (ADAM 10) {{is a key}} regulator {{of cellular}} processes by shedding extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins. We have previously demonstrated that deletion of B cell expressed ADAM 10 results in changes in lymphoid tissue architecture and impaired germinal center (GC) formation. In this study, mice were generated in which ADAM 10 is deleted in B cells following class switch recombination (ADAM 10 (Δ/Δ) IgG 1 -cre(+/-) mice). Despite normal GC formation, antibody responses were impaired in ADAM 10 (Δ/Δ) IgG 1 -cre(+/-) mice, implicating ADAM 10 in post-GC and extrafollicular B cell terminal differentiation. Surprisingly, plasma cell (PC) numbers were normal in ADAM 10 (Δ/Δ) IgG 1 -cre(+/-) mice when compared to controls. However, <b>PCs</b> isolated <b>from</b> ADAM 10 (Δ/Δ) IgG 1 -cre(+/-) mice exhibited decreased expression of transcription factors important for PC function: Prdm 1, Xbp 1 and Irf 4. Bcl 6 is a GC transcriptional repressor that inhibits the PC transcriptional program and thus must be downregulated for PC differentiation to occur. Bcl 6 expression was increased <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> isolated <b>from</b> ADAM 10 (Δ/Δ) IgG 1 -cre(+/-) mice at both the mRNA and protein level. These results demonstrate that ADAM 10 is required for proper transcription factor expression <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> and thus, for normal PC function...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{expression}} and biomarker potential of zinc finger protein 132 (ZNF 132) <b>in</b> prostate cancer (<b>PC)</b> by transcriptional profiling and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays, including tumor specimens from 615 radical prostatectomy (RP) patients and 199 conservatively treated patients. Primary clinical endpoints were time to PSA recurrence and cancer-specific death, respectively. Compared to normal prostate epithelial cells <b>from</b> men without <b>PC,</b> ZNF 132 transcript levels were significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>PC</b> cells <b>from</b> patients with localized PC and further downregulated <b>in</b> metastatic <b>PC.</b> Likewise, ZNF 132 protein expression {{was significantly lower}} in primary tumors from patients with metastatic compared to localized PC and further reduced <b>in</b> castrate-refractory <b>PC,</b> indicating that ZNF 132 downregulation correlates with disease progression. Reduced ZNF 132 immunoreactivity {{was significantly associated with}} high Gleason score and advanced T stage <b>in</b> both <b>PC</b> patient cohorts. By univariate analysis, no/weak ZNF 132 staining was a significant adverse predictor of PSA recurrence after RP (p = 0. 024) and cancer-specific death following conservative treatment (p = 0. 009). In multivariate models, however, ZNF 132 did not add significant independent value to established prognostic factors. Finally, bisulfite sequencing revealed frequent promoter hypermethylation of ZNF 132 <b>in</b> both <b>PC</b> cell lines and PC tissue samples, indicating that ZNF 132 is epigenetically silenced <b>in</b> <b>PC.</b> <b>In</b> summary, our results show that downregulation of ZNF 132 is associated with aggressive PC and furthermore identify ZNF 132 as a new candidate methylation marker for PC...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} the ionic mechanisms controlling the dendrosomatic propagation of low-threshold Ca 2 + spikes (LTS) <b>in</b> Purkinje cells (<b>PCs),</b> somatically evoked discharges of action potentials (APs) were recorded under current-clamp conditions. The whole-cell {{configuration of the}} patch-clamp method was used <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>from</b> rat cerebellar slice cultures. Full blockade of the P/Q-type Ca 2 + current revealed slow but transient depolarizations associated with bursts of fast Na+ APs. These can occur as a single isolated event {{at the onset of}} current injection, or repetitively (i. e. a slow complex burst). The initial transient depolarization was identified as an LTS Blockade of P/Q-type Ca 2 + channels increased the likelihood of recording Ca 2 + spikes at the soma by promoting dendrosomatic propagation. Slow rhythmic depolarizations shared several properties with the LTS (kinetics, activation/inactivation, calcium dependency and dendritic origin), suggesting that they correspond to repetitively activated dendritic LTS, which reach the soma when P/Q channels are blocked. Somatic LTS and slow complex burst activity were also induced by K+ channel blockers such as TEA (2. 5 × 10 − 4 m) charybdotoxin (CTX, 10 − 5 m), rIberiotoxin (10 − 7 m), and 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP, 10 − 3 m), but not by apamin (10 − 4 m). In the presence of 4 -AP, slow complex burst activity occurred even at hyperpolarized potentials (− 80 mV). In conclusion, we suggest that the propagation of dendritic LTS is controlled directly by 4 -AP-sensitive K+ channels, and indirectly modulated by activation of calcium-activated K+ (BK) channels via P/Q-mediated Ca 2 + entry. The slow complex burst resembles strikingly the complex spike elicited by climbing fibre stimulation, and we therefore propose, as a hypothesis, that dendrosomatic propagation of the LTS could underlie the complex spike...|$|R
