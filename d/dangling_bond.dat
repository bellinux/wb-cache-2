40|$|The lattice-misfit InN/GaN (0001) {{interface}} {{supports a}} triangular network of alpha-core 90 degrees partial misfit dislocations. These misfit dislocations provide excellent strain relief. However, in their unreconstructed form the dislocation contains numerous high-energy N <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{which must be}} eliminated by reconstructing the dislocation core. Existing single-period (SP) and double-period (DP) dislocation reconstruction models eliminate these <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds</b> via a like-atom dimerization, such as N-N dimers. However, we show that these N-N dimers are unstable for the III-N materials, so an entirely new reconstruction mechanism is needed. A "triple-period" (TP) structural model is developed which eliminates N <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds</b> via the formation of N vacancies instead of N-N dimers. The model contains no N-N (or III-III) bonds, fully bonds all N atoms to four group-Ill neighboring atoms, and satisfies the "electron counting rule" by transferring charge from In <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds</b> to Ga <b>dangling</b> <b>bonds.</b> (c) 2012 Elsevier B.

5000|$|Compound semiconductors, such as GaAs, have <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> {{states that}} are nearer to the band edges (see Figure 2).

This {{is the cause of}} the well known difficulty of GaN p-type doping where N vacancies are abundant due to its high vapor pressure resulting in high Ga <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> density. These states are close to the conduction band edge and therefore act as donors. When p-type acceptor dopants are introduced, they are immediately compensated for by the N vacancies.

The 3s and 3p orbitals hybridize on a single Si atom which is energetically unfavorable because the 2 3s electrons gain more energy than the 2 3p electrons lose. Favorable dimer formation forms bonding (b) and anti-bonding (b*) states finally resulting in net energy loss and subsequent atom addition builds the crystal forming conduction (CB) and valence bands (VB). <b>Dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states (db) are equivalent to a missing sp3 bond.|$|E
50|$|Also {{amorphous}} solids {{may contain}} defects. These are naturally somewhat hard to define, but sometimes their nature {{can be quite}} easily understood. For instance, in ideally bonded amorphous silica all Si atoms have 4 bonds to O atoms and all O atoms have 2 bonds to Si atom. Thus e.g. an O atom with only one Si bond (a <b>dangling</b> <b>bond)</b> {{can be considered a}} defect in silica. Moreover, defects can also be defined in amorphous solids based on empty or densely packed local atomic neighbourhoods, and the properties of such 'defects' can be shown to be similar to normal vacancies and interstitials in crystals,.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the most}} favored {{model has been}} the {{hydrogen}} bond switching model. It proposes that an electron-hole pair formed by the incident light may recombine near a weak Si-Si bond, releasing energy sufficient to break the bond. A neighbouring H atom then forms a new bond {{with one of the}} Si atoms, leaving a <b>dangling</b> <b>bond.</b> These dangling bonds can trap electron-hole pairs, thus reducing the current that can pass through. However, new experimental evidence is casting doubt on this model. More recently, the H collision model proposed that two spatially separated recombination events cause emission of mobile hydrogen from Si-H bonds to form two dangling bonds, with a metastable paired H state binding the hydrogen atoms at a distant site.|$|E

5000|$|A {{simpler and}} more {{qualitative}} way of determining <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> energy levels is with Harrison diagrams. Metals have non-directional bonding {{and a small}} Debye length which, due to their charged nature, makes dangling bonds inconsequential if they can even be considered to exist. Semiconductors are dielectrics so electrons can feel and become trapped at defect energy states. The energy levels of these states {{are determined by the}} atoms that make up the solid. Figure 1 shows the Harisson diagram for the elemental semiconductor Si. From left to right, s-orbital and p-orbital hybridization promotes sp3 bonding which, when multiple sp3 Si-Si dimers are combined to form a solid, defines the conduction and valence bands. If a vacancy were to exist, such as those on each atom at the solid/vacuum interface, it would result in at least one broken sp3 bond which has an energy equal to that of single self hybridized Si atoms as shown in Figure 1. This energy corresponds to roughly the middle of the bandgap of Si, ~0.55eV above the valence band. Certainly this is the most ideal case whereas the situation would be different if bond passivation (see below) and surface reconstruction, for example, were to occur. Experimentally, the energies of these states can be determined using absorption spectroscopy or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, for example, if instrument sensitivity and/or defect density are high enough.|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of {{computer}} simulations {{of the light}} induced degradation of amorphous silicon solar cells. It is now well established that when amorphous silicon is illuminated the density of <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states increases. <b>Dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states produce amphoteric electronic mid-gap states which act as efficient charge trapping and recombination centres. The increase in <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states causes {{a decrease in the}} performance of amorphous silicon solar cells. To show this effect, a modelling approach has been developed which uses the density of localised states with exponentially increasing band-tails and <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> defect states distribution chosen according to the defect pool model. The calculation of the evolution of <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> state density during illumination has been achieved through a dynamic scaling relation derived from a defect creation model. The approach considers the amphoteric nature of the <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> state and thus accounts for the contributions of the different charge states of the <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> during the degradation process. This paper attempts to describe the simulation approach which calculates the defect density as a function of energy, position in the solar cell and illumination time. In excellent agreement with other workers, our simulation results show that the increase in the density of neutral <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> states during illumination is higher than of the charged states...|$|E

30|$|It {{was well}} known that {{single-crystal}} silicon shows strong anisotropic etching behavior in alkaline solutions. Based on the electrochemical model proposed by Seidel et al. [21], the anisotropic etching behavior of silicon was mainly attributed to the differences on {{the density of the}} <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> as well as the structure and energy level of the backbond on the silicon surface. When the density of the <b>dangling</b> <b>bond</b> and the energy level of the backbond are high, the etching rate of the silicon surface in alkaline solutions is fast.
