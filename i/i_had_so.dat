A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.|$|E
500|$|Growing up in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé was {{surrounded}} by the Spanish language, and learned some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect with all my fans. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much fun singing in Spanish. It reminded me of growing up in Houston". The Denver Post John Wenzel interpreted the release of Irreemplazable as [...] "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".|$|E

500|$|There {{were other}} factors at play. Balukas admits to having been under great pressure, {{much of it}} self-imposed. After she reached the {{pinnacle}} of her profession, [...] "That’s when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started {{putting a lot of}} pressure on myself." [...] "Playing against the men, I learned to lose,... but [...] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time." [...] Ultimately Balukas states that her break with the sport [...] "...was a buildup of everything,... A little burnout, a little frustration. It just got to a point where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much animosity toward the pool world. And that was my out. You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé Knowles {{began working}} on her second solo album B'Day {{following}} the conclusion of filming for Dreamgirls. She revealed: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many things bottled up, so many emotions, so many ideas". Beyoncé contacted American songwriter-producer Sean Garrett, and booked him at the Sony Music Studios in New York City, where [...] "Get Me Bodies" [...] was recorded. She also called American hip hop producer-rapper Kasseem [...] "Swizz Beatz" [...] Dean, her sister and singer, Solange, her cousin Angela Beyincé, and songwriter Makeba Riddick. Beyoncé took inspiration from Solange, who helped {{in the writing process}} of the song, and former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. In [...] "Get Me Bodied", she mentioned [...] "three best friends" [...] because she was thinking of them while writing. While working on the lyrics, Swizz Beatz and the other producers in the team handled its production.|$|E
500|$|As the Varner–Hogg {{restoration}} {{wound to}} a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend, which housed {{some of her}} personal collection of antiques and artwork. The New York Times described her [...] "superb Early American furniture" [...] collection in 1953, {{and she had a}} large collection of Americana and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house. In the late 1950s she said: [...] "I had been collecting American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much of it I didn't {{know what to do with}} it. I decided to give it to a museum." [...] She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum. She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.|$|E

500|$|Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra [...] "is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much trust on her that I felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance.|$|E
500|$|While {{having a}} month-long {{vacation}} after filming Dreamgirls, Beyoncé {{went to the}} studio to start working on the album. She said: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many things bottled up, so many emotions, so many ideas", prompting her to begin working without telling her father and then-manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé kept the recording of B'Day somewhat quiet, telling only her artists and repertoire man Max Gousse, and the team of producers they contacted to collaborate for the album. She began working with songwriter-producers Rich Harrison, Rodney Jerkins, Sean Garrett, Cameron Wallace; the Neptunes, Norwegian production duo Stargate, American hip hop producer-rapper Swizz Beatz, and Walter Millsap. Two female songwriters were {{also included in the}} production team who helped structure the album: Beyoncé's cousin Angela Beyincé, who had previously collaborated in Dangerously in Love, and up-and-coming songwriter Makeba Riddick, who made her way onto the team after writing [...] "Déjà Vu", the lead single off the album.|$|E
500|$|After Tuesday Night Music Club, Crow {{wanted to}} prove her {{authority}} as a musician. According to her, [...] "My only objective on this record was to get under people's skin, because I was feeling like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much shit to hurl at the tape." [...] Work on the new album began at Toad Hall in Pasadena, California, the same studio where Tuesday Night Music Club was recorded, but sessions were soon relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana because Crow [...] "was feeling ghosts in that room". Bottrell was designated to produce the record and co-wrote three songs that would appear on the album, but eventually left {{because he could not}} sort out his differences with Crow. As a result, Crow took over production duties and wrote most of the songs alone or with only one collaborator. She also played most of the instruments on the album, including bass and guitar work and nearly all the keyboard parts. Most of the album was recorded at Kingsway Studio in New Orleans, although Crow would later return to Los Angeles to complete work at The Sound Factory and Sunset Sound. Audio mastering took place at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine.|$|E

500|$|After {{six months}} of filming for the Broadway musical {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, Knowles was on vacation. Inspired by {{her role in the}} film, she said: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many things bottled up, so many emotions, so many ideas". After contacting American songwriters and record producers Sean Garrett along with Rodney Jerkins, Rich Harrison, and Kasseem [...] "Swizz Beatz" [...] Dean, Knowles rented Sony Music Studios to begin working on her second solo album B'Day. Garret said: [...] "I came to the studio and saw the zone...everybody in here is banging out. Rodney Jerkins had his session, Rich Harrison had his session going on...I started banging out some shit." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] was produced by Knowles, Garrett and Swizz Beatz; its lyrics were being written at the same time by the trio. Swizz Beatz stated: [...] " [...] {{just one of the many}} presents I gave [...] for her B'Day. I have the most tracks on her album as a single producer". [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] was co-arranged by Knowles and recorded in the same studio. She said about her collaboration with Swizz Beatz, [...] "I love working with Swizz. He's challenging. His beats are so complex it's hard to find a melody. But [...] just clicked".|$|E
500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? What have I done to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E

Therefore, I now understand that Kali-yug has taken his revenge on me. How shall I escape this grievous sin?" ...|$|E

She began {{a study of the}} history of painting and [...] "went through a progression of spatial conceptions" [...] (p.35) from cave painting through the Renaissance, then concentrating on Cézanne, Picasso, and De Kooning. [...] "I was also much concerned with texture, and heavy paint", she adds (p.35).|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Iuka {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a long professional enmity between Rosecrans and Grant. The Northern press gave accounts very favorable to Rosecrans at Grant's expense. Some rumors circulated that the reason Ord's column had not attacked in conjunction with Rosecrans was not that the battle had been inaudible, but that Grant had been drunk and incompetent. Grant's first report of the battle was highly complimentary to Rosecrans, but his second, written after Rosecrans had published his own report, took a markedly negative turn. His third statement was in his Personal Memoir, where he wrote [...] "I was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka—but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> high an opinion of General Rosecrans but I found no fault at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2003–04 season, Larsson left Celtic on a free {{transfer}} and signed a one-year contract with Barcelona with an option for a second year. Larsson's contribution in Barças La Liga win in his first season there was disrupted by serious injury. He scored 3 goals in 12 Liga games and one goal (against his former club Celtic) in four Champions League matches. After the match against Celtic, he said: [...] "It was {{very difficult for me to}} celebrate my goal because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many great times here." [...] On 20 November 2004, during the 3–0 victory in El Clásico against Real Madrid, Larsson tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his left knee.
