This paper presents knowledge based system for evaluating power generation system in PV model. The performance of a PV system depends on the environmental factors such as irradiation and cell temperature.

One of the most diffused method to increase the PV efficiency is the Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage (FOCV) that allows the PV to work around its <b>estimated</b> <b>Maximum</b> <b>Power</b> Point (MPP). To increase the solar harvesting system efficiency both static (in terms of efficiency) and dynamic (in terms of MPP tracking responsiveness) performances are of crucial interest. Most of works in the literature focus on improving the static system performance by giving a more accurate MPP estimation. In this paper, it is proposed a FOCV-based algorithm to improve system dynamic performance in terms of MPP tracking performance and energy conveyed to the load under varying solar irradiance conditions. The MPP system dynamically adapts the MPP estimation to the solar irradiance condition by mean of a ”smart timer” circuitry that continuously adjusts the operative frequency of the sample and hold component.

Fast sampling rates show that MFCs exhibit differential steady-state stabilisation behaviours depending on Rext, with consequences for time constant (tc) selection.

Three different monomers were investigated: aniline, phenol and pyridine. The power output of the aniline based BFCs reached 5. 97 mu W. mm(- 2) which {{is higher than the}} pyrrole based BFCs reported previously (3. 17 mu W. mm(- 2)). With phenol monomer, the <b>estimated</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> density was only 0. 276 mu W. mm(- 2). The pyridine based BFCs showed the lowest power density (0. 046 mu W. mm(- 2)) of all, even lower than the monomer-free BFC (0. 124 mu W. mm(- 2)). The evaluation of the BFCs in buffer solution pH 7. 4 under air at 37 degrees C for 3 days of continuous operation showed that pyrrole and aniline based BFCs are the most stable followed by phenol based BFCs.

The purpose of this thesis is to show the work done in the so far relatively uncharted territory of control systems for hydro kinetic energy conversion. The work is in its early stage and is meant {{to serve as a}} guide forfuture development of the control system. An experimental power station has been deployed and the first results are presented. A comparison between three load control methods has been made; a fixedAC load, a fixed pulse width modulated DC load and a DC bus voltage control of a DC load. Experimental results show that the DC bus voltage control reduces the variation of rotational speed with a factor of 3. 5. For all three cases, the tip speed ratio of the turbine can be kept close to the expected optimal tip speed ratio. However, for all three cases the average extracted power was significantly lower than the average power available in the turbine times the <b>estimated</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> coefficient. A maximum power point tracking system, with or without water velocity measurement, should increase the average extracted power. A simulation model has been validated using experimental data. The simulated system consists of the electrical system and a hydrodynamic vortex model for the turbine. Experiments of no load operation were conducted to calibrate the drag losses of the turbine. Simulations were able to predict the behaviour in a step response for a change in tip speed ratio when the turbine was operated close to optimal tip speed ratio. The start position of the turbine was varied in the simulation to view the influence on the step response from a changed turbine position relative to the direction of the water flow.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{demand for}} energy is increasing. At the same time, energy rich wastewaters are currently purified by oxygen supply, which {{costs a lot}} of energy. The Microbial Fuel Cell is a new technology that offers advantages in both directions: it produces electricity while purifying wastewaters. This research aimed at increasing the electricity production from wastewaters in the Microbial Fuel Cell. In a Microbial Fuel Cell, microorganisms grow on an electrode, the anode. These microorganisms convert biodegradable organic components in wastewater directly into electrons (electricity). The most important limiting factor is currently the cathode, where the electrons are accepted, normally by oxygen. Oxygen is the most desired electron acceptor because of its unlimited availability and its high potential. To drive the oxygen reduction reaction at the desired rate however, a catalyst is needed. The mostly used catalyst for oxygen reduction is Pt, however, its high cost requires development of other cost-effective and renewable catalysts. We followed three strategies to improve cathode performance: the use of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + as a mediator at the cathode, a biocathode, in which microorganisms were used to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction, and the reduction of Cu 2 + in the presence and absence of oxygen. This last process resulted not only in higher current production, but also in recovery of pure copper. Finally, we have tested a Microbial Fuel Cell on larger scale, with a surface area of 0. 5 m 2 and a volume of 5 L. Contrary to other studies, we have shown that a larger-scale Microbial Fuel Cell can produce similar power and current densities compared to small lab scale systems, when the distances between the electrodes are small, the electrodes are well flowed-through, and the reaction rate at the cathode is fast.

Based on that, a linear approximation of the MPP locus is derived, whose parameters are simply related to those of the electrical parameters of a PV cell. The proposed solution presents the same complexity but higher effectiveness when compared to other estimation MPPT methods. Furthermore, the estimation is inherently compensated for temperature variations by periodically sensing the module open circuit voltage (VOC). The proposed method is suitable for low cost PV systems and was successfully tested in a solar powered 55 W battery charger circuit...|$|R
40|$|While single {{junction}} {{solar cells}} are mainly influenced {{by changes in}} irradiance and temperature, multi junction concentrator solar cells show complex behaviour as their performance is also strongly influenced by changes in spectrum. Despite this, when studying the system, {{it is possible to}} reduce the problem to a set of parameters that could easily be measured and fitted. A simple model to obtain the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> point of multi junction solar cells under temperature and spectral changes is proposed. This model is based on a single diode model and is described by a simple set of equations that are easy to fit within a computational program. The model could be useful to understand the behaviour of multi junction solar cells and also CPV technology under real conditions. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to define a simple way to <b>estimate</b> the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> point of a multi junction solar cell under spectral and temperature changes at one sun conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a {{scenario in which}} frequency agile radios opportunistically share a fixed spectrum resource {{with a set of}} primary nodes. We develop a collaborative scheme for a group of frequency agile radios to <b>estimate</b> the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> at which they can transmit on a given frequency channel, without causing harmful interference to the primary receivers. The proposed scheme relies on signal strength measurements taken by a group of frequency agile radios, which are then used by a target node to characterize the spatial size of its perceived spectrum hole in terms of the <b>maximum</b> permissible transmit <b>power.</b> We derive an approximation to the <b>maximum</b> interference-free transmit <b>power</b> using the Cramér-Rao bound on localization accuracy. We present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under a variety of scenarios. Index Terms—Spectrum sharing, cognitive radio, radio re-source management, geolocation, Cramér-Rao bound. I...|$|R
40|$|A sliding mode {{controller}} {{is used to}} <b>estimate</b> the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> {{point as}} a reference for it to track that point and force the PV system to operate in this point. In sliding mode control, the trajectories of the system are forced to reach a sliding manifold of surface, where it exhibit desirable features, in finite time and {{to stay on the}} manifold for all future time. The load is composed of a battery bank. It is obtained by controlling the duty cycle of a DC-DC converter using sliding mode control. This method has the advantage that it will guarantee the <b>maximum</b> output <b>power</b> possible by the array configuration while considering the dynamic parameters solar irradiance and delivering more power to charge the battery. The proposed system with sliding mode control is tested using MATLAB / SIMULINK platform in which a <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> is tracked under constant and varying solar irradiance and delivered to the battery which increasing the current that is charging the battery and reduces the charging time. </p...|$|R

40|$|Power {{harvesting}} systems generate {{electric power}} from mechanical vibration using electromechanical transducers. To assess the practical performance of these systems, {{it is important}} to be able to <b>estimate</b> the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> that could be harvested from a specific structure and to derive the optimal conditions for the harvesting. We introduce a two-port network model which can fully describe the electromechanical coupled dynamics of the transducer, including the interaction between the structure and the electrical load in a unified manner. Electromagnetic and piezoelectric transducers are then considered as special cases of this general treatment. The power harvested by both types of transducer on a simply supported beam is derived and the optimal matching conditions and the <b>maximum</b> harvested <b>power</b> are obtained theoretically. In this numerical example, a piezoelectric transducer would have higher potential than an electromagnetic device of equal mass for the harvesting, but only when the transducer parameters are tuned optimally...|$|R
