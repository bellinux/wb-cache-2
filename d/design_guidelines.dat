40|$|In {{this work}} we {{identify}} a seminal <b>design</b> <b>guideline</b> that prevents current Full-Duplex (FD) MAC protocols to scale the FD capacity gain (i. e. 2 x the half-duplex throughput) in single-cell Wi-Fi networks. Under such guideline (referred to as 1 : 1), a MAC protocol attempts to initiate {{up to two}} simultaneous transmissions in the FD bandwidth. Since in single-cell Wi-Fi networks MAC performance is bounded by the PHY layer capacity, this implies gains strictly less than 2 x over half-duplex at the MAC layer. To face this limitation, we argue for the 1 :N <b>design</b> <b>guideline.</b> Under 1 :N, FD MAC protocols 'see' the FD bandwidth through N> 1 orthogonal narrow-channel PHY layers. Based on theoretical results and software defined radio experiments, we show the 1 :N design can leverage the Wi-Fi capacity gain more than 2 x at and below the MAC layer. This translates the denser modulation scheme incurred by channel narrowing {{and the increase in}} the spatial reuse offer enabled by channel orthogonality. With these results, we believe our <b>design</b> <b>guideline</b> can inspire a new generation of Wi-Fi MAC protocols that fully embody and scale the FD capacity gain.

25|$|Design work on {{the future}} HUD {{building}} began immediately. Karel Yasko, Assistant Commissioner for Design and Construction in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), oversaw the design process {{in accordance with the}} Ad Hoc Committee's guidelines. In 1946, the Congress had passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency and provided for clearance of land and redevelopment funds in the capital. After a decade of discussion, public comment, and negotiations with landowners and developers, the Southwest Urban Renewal Plan was approved in November 1956. In part, the plan cleared the way for GSA to build new large federal office buildings between Independence Avenue SW and Southeast Freeway to its south. The HUD building, the only office building south of the railroad tracks (which bifurcated the area on an east-west axis), was designed to be a showcase for the Ad Hoc Committee's <b>design</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Internationally known architect Marcel Breuer submitted the building's winning design. Breuer became the building's lead architect, assisted by his associate Herbert Beckhard and the firm of Nolen-Swinburne.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study is to {{investigate}} the possibility of achieving global hotel design diversification through the utilization of traditional cultural characteristics. The focus of this study is global hotel design in local countries of China. The research investigates using glocalisation design (which means the localization plus the globalization) in hotels, to challenge the global hotels’ design style that the same in many different countries and cities. This research addresses the relationship between local cultural element styles and the design of global branding hotel style efficacy within hotel in local countries of China. Relevant literature on the nature of global hotel design style was reviewed. Three stages of primary research (a critical review, observations and interviews) were also conducted in this study. The critical review examined the use of traditional local cultural elements in contemporary hotels. The observation studies identified the relationship between visitor behaviors and local cultural information within a range of global hotels. However, {{due to the fact that}} international tourists have different backgrounds and cultural knowledge, the international guests are not necessarily able to understand traditional local cultural information. In response to primary research findings, a novel <b>design</b> <b>guideline</b> will be created, this guideline is based on traditional design method and links between locations' culture and global hotel design style. Initial user testing indicated that the guideline was appropriate and did significantly improve global hotel design style. Hence, developing a common cultural symbol is becoming main research direction in this study which links with proportion, visual and local symbolism. The interviews further elicited interior design staff views and were used to test the hotel <b>design</b> <b>guideline.</b> A theoretical <b>design</b> reference model was developed. Initially based on the Le Corbusier design model, the model consists of three phases: analysis, design and assessment. A hotel <b>design</b> <b>guideline</b> was built and tested through user experience testing and expert interviews. Evaluation of this showed that the <b>design</b> <b>guideline</b> blending with global cultural points and local elements. The global cultural points can easy be accept and understand by foreign guest, meanwhile add some local cultural characteristic that can help guest understand local cultural information. The hotel <b>design</b> <b>guideline</b> that has been developed encourages the related global hotel design style, further shows the local cultural elements and ultimately improving global hotel design style...|$|R

For most minor changes, homeowners can consult with local preservation staff at the municipal office and receive guidance on and permission for the changes. Major changes however, require homeowners to apply for a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA), and the changes may be decided upon by the historic commission or architectural review board. The COA process is carried out with all aspects of due process, with formal notification, hearings, and fair and informed decision making.|$|E
500|$|To avoid some of {{the design}} {{mistakes}} made in Baldur's Gate, guidelines were drawn up for each department; the level designers had the longest set of guidelines. These lists continually changed and evolved as the development progressed. The main <b>design</b> <b>guidelines</b> for the entire project were that the players should feel like their actions {{have an effect on}} the game world, and good versus evil options should be available depending on which path the player takes. Guidelines for the story were to keep the focus on the player's character, keep the player updated on the activities on the game's villain, add a significant plot twist, and make the ending of the game open enough so that there would be room for more sequels. Environment guidelines were to break the game into chapters, make some locations key to the central plot, keep areas interesting and easy to quickly navigate, and showcase areas before they were available to explore to capture player interest. For the game systems, guidelines focused on character customization and a well-crafted reward system. The writing guidelines were concerned mainly with dialogue: limiting the number of sentences NPCs spoke at a time, keeping the number of player response choices at three as often as possible, avoiding profanity and accents, and having a small set of random dialogue for unimportant NPCs. [...] Many early design decisions did not follow the guidelines, and programming constraints were not always followed by other departments, such as design and art, leading to slowdowns in some parts of the game that were difficult or impossible to fix.|$|E
