40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years, the {{development}} of disability studies as an academic discipline has in turn ensured that interest <b>in</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> historical periods has steadily increased. Initially, scholars presented an overwhelmingly negative view of <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> antiquity, proceeding {{under the assumption that}} babies born displaying visible signs of deformity or disability were subjected either to infanticide or exposure, and that individuals who were subsequently identified as suffering from a deformity or disability, or developed either one later in life, were ostracized and unable to make any meaningful contribution to society. It is only over the last decade that this reductive approach has been gradually discredited, and the understanding of <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> antiquity has become increasingly nuanced. To date, one monograph has been published on deformity and <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the Graeco-Roman world, one monograph on <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the Greek world and one on <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the Roman world, and one edited volume on <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> antiquity and another on <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the Roman world.

SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual <b>disabilities</b> <b>in</b> 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation, the Association for the Educationally Subnormal (AESN), in 1976.

After numerous injuries over the years from his energetic clowning, his health was also declining rapidly, and he retired in 1823. He appeared occasionally on stage for a few years thereafter, but his performances were restricted by his worsening physical <b>disabilities.</b> <b>In</b> his last years, Grimaldi lived in relative obscurity and became a depressed, impoverished alcoholic.

40|$|This study investigates whether {{very low}} birth weight (VLBW) preschoolers {{experience}} <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> daily activities and what the risk factors for <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> daily activities are. The Dutch Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI-NL) was used to detect <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> daily activities in 143 VLBW children without cerebral palsy (CP) at 44 months of corrected age (CA). Data from the psychomotor-developmental index (PDI) and the mental developmental index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID II) at 24 months CA, and data relating to perinatal and socio-economic status were available. <b>Disability</b> <b>in</b> daily activities was found in 27 (19 %) VLBW children without CP. High frequencies of <b>disability</b> were found <b>in</b> 19 (13 %) children on the mobility domain and in 12 (8 %) children on the social functioning domain. The multiple logistic regression analyses showed that low BSID II outcomes (< 2 SD) were risk factors for <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the mobility domain, but not for <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the social functioning domain. The predictive value of the BSID II outcomes is moderate, 46 % of the VLBW children with a low PDI and 44 % with a low MDI developed a <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the mobility domain. This study showed a higher frequency of <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> daily activities in VLBW preschoolers compared to term born peers.

5|$|Although {{there was}} a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} about how it was possible for the brain's neural circuitry to change through experience, the potential effect of web technologies on the brain's neural circuitry was unknown. On the topic of the Internet's effect on reading skills, Guinevere F. Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning at Georgetown University, remarked that the question was whether or not the Internet changed the brain {{in a way that was}} beneficial to an individual. Carr believed that the effect of the Internet on cognition was detrimental, weakening the ability to concentrate and contemplate. Olds cited the potential benefits of computer software that specifically targets learning disabilities, stating that among some neuroscientists {{there was a}} belief that neuroplasticity-based software was beneficial in improving receptive language disorders. Olds mentioned neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, who had formed several companies with his peers in which neuroplasticity-based computer programs had been developed to improve the cognitive functioning of kids, adults and the elderly. In 1996, Merzenich and his peers had started a company called Scientific Learning in which neuroplastic research had been used to develop a computer training program called Fast ForWord that offered seven brain exercises that improved language impairments and learning <b>disabilities</b> <b>in</b> children. Feedback on Fast ForWord showed that these brain exercises even had benefits for autistic children, an unexpected spillover effect that Merzenich has attempted to harness by developing a modification of Fast ForWord specifically designed for autism. At a subsequent company that Merzenich started called Posit Science, Fast ForWord-like brain exercises and other techniques were developed with the aim of sharpening the brains of elderly people by retaining the plasticity of their brains.|$|E

Adopting a critical disability studies approach coupled with insights from cultural and media studies, Goggin and Newell carefully trace and diagnose the “social apartheid” of <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> Australia. Their central argument is that <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> Australia has been ‘reinstitutionalised’. [...] Looking at an assemblage of texts, institutions, social and cultural practices mobilised around health and welfare, sport, biotechnology, genetics, politics and migration; they establish the way power has manifested to exclude and marginalise people with disabilities.
