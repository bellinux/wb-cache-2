40|$|Investigations {{carried on}} in these {{laboratories}} concerning the r 6 le of surface tension in certain bacteriological phenomena (Larson, 1921), {{have led to}} the development of an apparatus for the rapid determination of surface tension by the drop-weight method. After using the more common methods of surface tension measurement the belief is expressed that the most reliable and constant results for bothpureand biological liquids can be obtained from their drop weights. The apparatus here described repre-sents a means of determining the surface tension of a liquid by the drop-weight method without any mathematical calculation or the determination of the drop weights and is termed a surface tension balance. The apparatus is designed primarily for rapidity of measurement and an accuracy is obtained which is consistent with ordinary experimental conditions. In general the apparatus consists of three mechanical parts, a <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette,</b> a balance beam mounted on a torsion wire and an adjustable scale. The <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette</b> (A) differs in no way from those already in use and all the inaccuracies and corrections, which have been recorded for this method, occur but such errors may be mini-mized and reduced to an order of magnitude which is of no concern to the biologist, by using a dropping surface of the proper dimensions (Morgan, 1911). The rate at which the drops fall may be easily controlled by using a fine capillary tube for an air inlet protected by larger tubing (I) ...|$|E
40|$|THE {{method of}} Miles, Misra and Irwin (1938) has {{for many years}} been the {{standard}} tech-nique for the determination of viable bacterial counts by surface inoculation of solid media. However, this method requires precision and skill if accurate results are to be obtained. One problem is the difficulty of preparing pipettes that accurately and consistently deliver 50 drops per ml. The method is also not without hazard to the operator. Johannson and Ferris (1946) have demonstrated aerosol formation when a liquid is dropped on to an agar surface, and the necessary agitation of dilutions during mixing also produces airborne bacteria. We describe and evaluate a procedure in which a semi-automatic pipette with glass capillary tubes is used. This method {{does not require the}} preparation and calibration of accurate <b>dropping</b> <b>pipettes</b> but has the accuracy of the Miles, Misra and Irwin technique; it also has the advantages of being faster and of producing less bacterial contamination of the working surface.

In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of nanogap capacitor in detecting the changes of pH measurement via Dielectric analyzer (C-V and C-F characterization) as its stables under each reading and repeatability. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report on the fabrication and electrical characterization of nanogap device. We introduce the conventional lithographic combined with the size expansion technique for the transition from micro (3. 13 µm) to nano-sized (42 nm) gap. The evolution of gaps nanogap pattern expansions were verified by using SEM by controlling the dry oxidation time of device. Then, Ti/Au layer were deposited onto the final device for probing purpose. Different level of pH (3, 5, and 10) has been tested and conformed by repeating each test. About 10 µm of pH liquid were <b>dropped</b> using <b>pipette</b> in the middle of gap probing (2 -wire measurements) is done on the Au pad fabricated on the nanogap device. 10 µm of pH liquid were <b>dropped</b> using <b>pipette</b> onto the target and the reading will be taken.

40|$|SUMMARY: Equipment can {{be readily}} made in the {{laboratory}} for the mechanical preparation of roll-tubes. Roll-tubes so prepared can largely replace Petri dishes both for counting and for single colony isolations. The recent shortage of Petri dishes has compelled the adoption of an alternative method for counting viable bacteria. The roll-tube method, which consists essentially in the replacement of Petri dishes by test-tubes, was chosen (Wilson, 1922). Apart from considerations of accuracy, rolled tubes are more economical than Petri dishes since ordinary test-tubes may be used; only one-fifth of the medium is required {{and the number of}} dilutions is reduced since it is customary to use a standardized <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette</b> to deliver a known volume of inoculum into the tube. Against this must be set the disadvantage that streaking and picking of individual colonies requires a greater manipulative skill than with Petri dishes. Withell (1938) obtained a standard error of & 5 yo with roll-tube counts. Using similar statistical methods Jenninson & Wadsworth (1940) obtaine...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{literature}} contains {{a number of}} reports regarding the bactericidal efficiency of certain specified concentrations of sodium hydroxide against various test organisms, very little of this information is presented in a manner suitable for mathematical analysis. To obtain the data required for analysis, an experi-mental study {{was made of the}} bactericidal efficiency of sodium hydroxide. This study was conducted along the lines of a previously described study of the bactericidal efficiencies of some of the phenols and alcohols (Tilley, 1939). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Bactericidal efficiency was determined by the Rideal-Walker technique, modified as follows: Either infusion broth or FDA beef extract broth was used instead of R-W standard broth; instead of a standardized <b>dropping</b> <b>pipette</b> a 1 -ml pipette graduated into tenths was used to measure out the 0. 5 ml of culture required for the test; medication temperatures were sometimes 20 C and some-times 30 C instead of 15 C to 18 C; dilutions were made in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks instead of in cylinders; fixed amounts of the stock solution of disinfectant were added to varying amounts of distilled water, all measured with sterile standardized pipettes; the time of exposure was extended beyond 15 minutes, subcultures being made at 2. 5 -minute intervals when exposure varied from 2. 5 to 30 minutes, at 5 -minute intervals when exposures varied from 30 to 80 minutes, and at 10 -minute intervals when exposures were beyond 80 minutes; and Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were used as test organisms instead of Eberthella typho 8 a. The bactericidal efficiency of sodium hydroxide was determined by the tech-nique described above, and from the experimental data thus obtained values of the concentration exponent, n, were calculated as described in a previous paper (Tilley, 1939) by the equation, n = log- log C etc., for results presented in tabular form, and by the equation, n = Y 2 - Yfor results presented graphically...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new microrobotic {{system for a}} crystallographic task called protein crystal mounting, which is the {{transfer}} of a crystal from its growth solution onto a tool designed to hold it for X-ray data collection. The system operates autonomously using feedback from a camera looking at the workspace through a microscope. Visual tracking is employed to monitor {{the location of the}} selected crystal and control a range of actuators for successful extraction. The task is performed in two stages: First, the crystal is taken from its <b>drop</b> into a <b>pipette</b> and is transported into a cryoprotecting liquid. Second, while in the cryoprotector, it is transferred from the pipette onto a tool to be used for data collection. Key features of this approach are the increased robustness of the system and the avoidance of the damaging effect of direct exposure of the crystal to room conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT Slide {{making is}} the most {{critical}} aspect of good banding preparations. Slide making is best done after the cells have been in fixative at 4 ºC overnight. Variables affecting preparation includes relative humidity, room temperature, drying time and number of cells per slide. Increased height {{is often used to}} increase spreading. We have designed a simple Dropper device for our slide preparations. This facilitates easy operation and well spread chromosomes are obtained. This device is made of stainless steel with a broad base where a main rod is fixed. Two side rods are fixed with clamps, attached to the main rod. Both can be raised or lowered according to the requirement. The upper one is provided with a pipette-holder where the pipette with the material can be inserted. The lower one is provided with a grooved plate with a ball and a socket to adjust the angle. The slide is pushed gently from the plate lengthwise as the material is <b>dropped</b> from the <b>pipette.</b> We have been using this for our lymphocyte culture slide preparations and we are quite satisfied of its use...|$|R
30|$|Lab scale {{infiltration}} of both cathode and anodes {{has been demonstrated}} by various groups [9, 10] in laboratory conditions. The infiltration is usually performed with micro <b>pipette</b> <b>drop</b> delivery or sample immersion. The procedure often involves several loading steps with intermediate vacuum treatments to increase the mass load of the infiltrate. An appropriate heat treatment is performed after each step to form either a nanodecoration composed of discrete nanoparticles or interconnected nanoparticle coverage on the electrode scaffold. The process is cumbersome and slow resulting in non-uniform ink distribution (both lateral and in-depth) and waste of expensive ink. Liu et al. [11] infiltrated 1  M water based inks of Sm doped ceria (Sm 0.2 Ce 0.8 O 1.9 —SDC) into laboratory produced anode-supported button cells (NiO-SDC/SDC/Sm 0.5 Sr 0.5 CoO 3) with an SDC electrolyte densification temperature of 1250  °C. The ink was manually dropped onto the porous anode under vacuum and the infiltration was driven by capillary action. After drying, the pellets were fired at 800  °C for 2  h to decompose the nitrate salts and form corresponding metal oxides. Different loading levels were achieved by repeating the infiltration cycle. It was demonstrated that the cell performances at 600  °C in humidified H 2 changes with SDC loading. Loadings of 0.96  mmol cm− 3 (two infiltration cycles) and 1.41  mmol cm− 3 (three sequential infiltration cycles) led to an increase of the maximum power output by 8 and 22 %, respectively. Timurkutluk et al. [12] infiltrated gadolinium doped ceria (CGO) precursor ink into the anode and cathode of NiO-ScSZ/ScSZ/LSF-ScSZ button cells. After five infiltration passes {{it was found that}} at 700  °C the cell impregnated with 1.5  M solution provides peak power density of 1.34  W cm− 2 compared to the cell without impregnation producing only 0.78  W cm− 2. They also noticed that infiltration with more concentrated precursor solutions reduced power output due to a reduction in open porosity. Sholklapper et al. [13] reported that {{infiltration of}} SDC into a composite NiO-ScSZ anode led not only to an increase in fuel electrode performance (from 348 to 403  mW cm− 2) but more importantly to a significant increase in sulphur tolerance. Single step infiltration of the cathode of commercially available cells has been reported by Dowd et al. [14]. They could load ~ 8 – 10  wt% La 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3 -d (LSCo) into a composite LSCF/SDC cathode that had a thickness of ~ 50 – 60  μm in a single step using an ultrasonic spray nozzle. The samples showed improved power performance and increased durability at 200  h operation compared to a reference. Jiang [15] provided a comprehensive review of the benefits and challenges facing infiltrated SOFC electrodes. Based on data from various authors the improved performances of the anodes infiltrated with mixed conducting oxides could be attributed to the extension of TPB as well as enhanced catalytic activities of the anodes.|$|R
40|$|Authors: Wei Zou ### Abstract Fatty acids {{are major}} energy {{provider}} {{for the human}} body. Over intake of fatty acids causes obesity. ### Reagents 1. CM mixture: chloroform: methanol: butylated hydroxytolune (BHT) = 2 L : 1 L : 100 mg. - 0. 5 N methanolic sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (10 g NaOH in 500 mL methanol) : mix the solution for 15 minutes with a stir bar. Don’t heat the mixture because methanol is highly flammable. - 14 % Boron Trifluoride (BF 3) in methanol (commercially available from Sigma) - HPLC grade petroleum ether (3. 3 mg BHT in 100 mL petroleum ether) - Saturated aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) : Add some NaCl into 500 mL D. I. water. Stir the solution until it is clear. Add more NaCl until it does not disappear any more. Wait until the NaCl crystal precipitate. Pour the clear solution into a glass bottle. - Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 - Internal standard (10 mg nonadecanoic acid in 100 mL CM mixture 2 : 1 = 100 ng/µL, 200 mg heptadecanoic acid in 100 mL CM mixture 2 : 1 = 2000 ng/µL) As ISTD, C 17 : 0 is better than C 19 : 0 because {{the peak of the}} former one has better resolution than that of the latter one. Procedure: Weigh 10 mL beaker (about 8 g), add some nonadecanoic acid into it, weigh it again to get net weight of 10 mg. Add some CM mixture (2 : 1) into the beaker to dissolve the powder. Weigh 200 mg C 17 : 0 in the same way. Pool the solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Wash the beaker 10 times and pool the washing solution into the flask. Tip off the flask to the mark with CM mixture. Shake the flask to dissolve the nonadecanoic acid totally. Wrap the mouth of the flask with Teflon tape. Wrap the flask with alumnium foil. ### Procedure **I. External Standard Curve Setting Up** 1. Estimate the ranges of fatty acids species in the sample and determine calibration points. For example: ![E 1]([URL] "E 1 ") 2. Make standard FAME solutions for the calibration curves (FAME standards are from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc.) : - Choice 1 : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 1 A in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 100 ml volumetric flask. Weigh about 100 mg 3 A in the same way. Collect the wash in the same 100 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng/inj. vol.) - Choice 2 : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 68 A in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 10 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng / inj. vol.) 3. Preparation and injection of different concentrations of standard FAMEs: Concentrate or dilute the standard FAMEs according to the values of the calibration points. At least 3 injections are needed at each concentration level for each fatty acid. Average the peak area for the injections. Type the theoretic amount and average peak area into the calibration table. Save the method. 4. Make standard FAME solutions for the determination of the retention time (RT) : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 68 D in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 10 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng / inj. vol.). 68 D is better for the determination of the RT because it has a unique fatty acids profiles. **II Procedure**: i. Pre-experiment: 1. Turn on the boiling water bath, the evaporator’s water bath, and the centrifuge. - Check the tube mouth carefully and wash with CM mixture and dry. - Put the sample in ice. - Check the pipette or syringe accuracy before pipetting. ii. Extraction of fatty acids: - Proper amount of sample and internal STD should be determined for each kind of biological sample. If GC system conditions are changed, this step should be done also. Less sample amount won’t show all interested peaks, while greater sample amount will introduce some unknown peaks and affect the baseline and resolution. - The data should be in the range of calibration curves. Otherwise, the new calibration curve should be done. For lymph/bile/serum: 1. Use the 100 µL automatic pipette to add 100 µL lymph into the 16 × 100 mm tube. Wash the tip with 100 µL D. I. water. - Use 5 mL dispenser to add 4 mL CM mixture (2 : 1) into the tube. - Use 250 µL syringe to add 200 µL internal standard (C 19 : 0 or C 17 : 0) into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Wait 30 minutes. To denature protein and extract fatty acids. - There are two ways {{to get rid of the}} aqueous residue: - I. “Water Washing”: - Fill the dispenser with fresh D. I. water everyday. Use dispenser to add 900 µL D. I. water. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. - Let the tube stand at RT for 10 min until two distinct layers show. Siphon off the upper aqueous layer with negative pressure system. - Evaporate the lower solvent layer under N 2. - II. “Filtering”: - Apply 0. 45 mm PTFE filter to filter the lipid extract. - Evaporate the solvent under N 2. For tissue lipid extract: 1. Use the 500 µL syringe to add 500 µL tissue lipid extraction into the 16 × 100 mm tube. - Use 500 µL syringe to add 500 µL internal standard (C 19 : 0 or C 17 : 0) into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. - Evaporate under the N 2. Typical applications for different tissues: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") iii. Sample preparation: 5. Add 2 mL 0. 5 N methanolic NaOH into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Cap tightly. 6. Heat the tube in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. 7. While waiting, prepare another set of 12 × 100 tubes. Add 0. 15 g anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. Prepare pasteur pipettes. 8. After cooling the tube for 5 minutes, add 2 mL 14 % BF 3. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Cap tightly. After using the BF 3, blow some N 2 into the BF 3 bottle and seal it. 9. Heat another 15 minutes. Cool down the tube in ice for 5 minutes. 10. Use a dispenser to add 2 mL petroleum ether and 2 mL automatic pipette to add 2 mL saturated aqueous NaCl into the tube. 11. Vortex the tube vigorously for 2 minute with the “vortex rack”. Centrifuge the tube for 5 minutes. 12. Use a pasteur pipette to transfer carefully the upper petroleum ether layer into the tube with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. Cap the tube and vortex 9 seconds. Let the tube stand for 20 minutes. Petroleum ether is very easy to <b>drop</b> from the <b>pipette.</b> Be careful! Don’t take all of the upper layer. It is better not to disturb the lower layer. 13. While waiting, choose a set of brown color glass vials and check the mouth of the tube. Wash the tubes with CM mixture and Pet ether. The cap of the vial should be Teflon. 14. Transfer the solution with pasteur pipette into the vials. Wash the tubes once with 2 mL petroleum ether. Add the washing solution into the vials. Be careful not to transfer the aqueous layer, otherwise the evaporation will take much longer time and there will be NaSO 4 residue on the wall of the vial. The residue might affect the GC separation of fatty acids. 15. Evaporate the vials at 30 - 40 C under a very gentle stream of N 2. Stop evaporating immediately after the vials are dry because FAMEs are very easy to evaporate. 16. Take out the vial and put it into the ice box to cool down for 15 seconds. Put the bottle of petroleum ether with BHT in ice also to avoid evaporating. 17. Use 250 µL syringe to add exactly 100 µL petroleum ether with BHT into the vial. Vortex gently. Cap tightly. Wrap the cap with Teflon tape. 18. Wait 3 - 4 hours for GC injection, otherwise the recovery rate will be low. From my experience, overnight standing is OK. iv. GC injection: For the GC 6890 system, check handbooks for the installation and hardware information. Check the online tutorial and printout help files for the software information. 19. Check if the gas tanks are full. The tanks should be changed to avoid GC column contamination if the pressure is below 400 psi. 20. Before GC warming on, check if the septa need to be changed. To change the new septa, wash it with HPLC graded methanol and put it on the inlet. Set GC temperature to 250 °C for 30 min. to clean the residues from the new septa. 21. GC warming up. At least half an hour before the sample injection, click the icon “instrument 1 online” on the desktop. In the popup windows, type in the name of the operator. In the ChemStation desktop, click the menu “File” – “Load Method” to choose the right method. After the warming up, run the “Instrument” – “StartColumnComRun” to set blank injection. 22. Click the “RunControl” – “Sample Info” to change the name of the operator, file prefix, and subdirectory for the file storing, etc. 23. Before injection, wash the 10 µL GC syringe with D. I. water, then acetone, then petroleum ether. 24. Put the vials in ice. Apply “Hot Needle Solvent Flushing Method” to inject sample into the GC. Wash 10 µL GC syringe with petroleum ether, take 2 µL pet ether, pull the needle a lot bit more in the air to make a small air plug in the syringe, then take exactly 3 µL sample final solution into the syringe (try to avoid contacting the vial with bare hands), measure the amount exactly, wipe the syringe needle with tissue paper, pull again to take some air into the syringe to avoid evaporation of the solution. Push the syringe needle into the GC inlet. Count 9 (3 seconds) to make the needle hot. Inject the sample as fast as you can. Pull the syringe out quickly. Push the “Start” button on the GC panel. 25. For the purpose of quality control, inject external STD first, then inject samples, finally inject external STD again to check if the GC is stable. Inject one ESTD for every 10 samples. 26. After injection, wash the 10 µL GC syringe with D. I. water, then acetone. Detailed information regarding the Gas Chromatography Method can be found in the following Word Document.
