40|$|Abstract Background Identifying {{corresponding}} features (LC peaks registered by identical peptides) {{in multiple}} Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) datasets plays {{a crucial role}} in the analysis of complex peptide or protein mixtures. Warping functions are commonly used to correct the mean of elution time shifts among LC-MS datasets, which cannot resolve the ambiguity of corresponding <b>feature</b> <b>identification</b> since elution time shifts are random. We propose a Statistical Corresponding <b>Feature</b> <b>Identification</b> Algorithm(SCFIA) based on both elution time shifts and peak shape correlations between corresponding features. SCFIA first trains a set of statistical models, and then, all candidate corresponding features are scored by the statistical models to find the maximum likelihood solution. Results We test SCFIA on publicly available datasets. We first compare its performance with that of warping function based methods, and the results show significant improvements. The performance of SCFIA on replicates datasets and fractionated datasets is also evaluated. In both cases, the accuracy is above 90 %, which is near optimal. Finally the coverage of SCFIA is evaluated, and it is shown that SCFIA can find corresponding features in multiple datasets for over 90 % peptides identified by Tandem MS. Conclusions SCFIA can be used for accurate corresponding <b>feature</b> <b>identification</b> in LC-MS. We have shown that peak shape correlation can be used effectively for improving the accuracy. SCFIA provides high coverage in corresponding <b>feature</b> <b>identification</b> in multiple datasets, which serves the basis for integrating multiple LC-MS measurements for accurate peptide quantification. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{evolutions}} on forging process induce {{more complex}} shape on forging die. These evolutions, combined with High Speed Machining (HSM) process of forging die lead to important increase {{in time for}} machining preparation. In this context, an original approach for generating machining process based on machining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core {{of this approach is}} to decompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometric features. Technological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric feature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as material, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging process and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and machining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between the surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining <b>features</b> <b>identification</b> cutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die, are associated to them in order to generate machining sequences.

Geometrical <b>features</b> <b>identification</b> is based on machining knowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL models.
