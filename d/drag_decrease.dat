50|$|An {{aircraft}} able {{to operate}} for extended periods at supersonic speeds has a potential range advantage over a similar design operating subsonically. Most of the drag an aircraft sees while speeding up to supersonic speeds occurs just below the speed of sound, due to an aerodynamic effect known as wave drag. An aircraft that can accelerate past this speed sees a significant <b>drag</b> <b>decrease,</b> and can fly supersonically with improved fuel economy. However, due to the way lift is generated supersonically, the lift-to-drag ratio of the aircraft as a whole drops, leading to lower range, offsetting or overturning this advantage.|$|E

The installation of Very High and Ultra High Bypass Ratio engines requires a close coupling with the wing. It becomes therefore essential to accurately determine the installation drag of a powered configuration. Experimental and numerical research on this topic has been performed within various European projects. The results of the experimental data show very little influence of the bypass ratio on the drag and secondly, a <b>drag</b> <b>decrease</b> with increasing engine thrust settings. Since thrust cannot be measured directly in the wind tunnel, {{it has to be}} evaluated by a valid bookkeeping procedure. Within this contribution the shortcomings of the standard, static engine calibration bookkeeping procedure are identified when external flow at wind tunnel conditions is present. Additional terms of the thrust equation, which only result from effects of external flow, are presented and analysed using the experimental data as well as complementary CFD simulations. The paper will further give an insight on the effect of external flow on pressure distributions on engine parts, wetted by the fan jet.

40|$|Steep {{mountain}} streams {{have higher}} {{resistance to flow}} and lower sediment-transport rates than expected by comparison with low gradient rivers, and often these differences are attributed to reduced near-bed flow velocities and stresses associated with form drag on channel forms and immobile boulders. However, few studies have directly measured drag and lift forces acting on bed sediment for shallow flows over coarse sediment, which ultimately control sediment transport rates and grain-scale flow resistance. Here we report on particle lift and drag force measurements in flume experiments using a planar, fixed cobble bed {{over a wide range}} of channel slopes (0. 004 [*]<[*]S[*]<[*] 0. 3) and water discharges. Drag coefficients are similar to previous findings for submerged particles (C_D ∼ 0. 7), but increase significantly for partially submerged particles. In contrast, lift coefficients decrease from near unity to zero as the flow shallows, and are strongly negative for partially submerged particles, indicating a downward force that pulls particles towards the bed. Fluctuating forces in lift and <b>drag</b> <b>decrease</b> with increasing relative roughness, and they scale with the depth-averaged velocity squared rather than the bed shear stress. We find that, {{even in the absence of}} complex bed topography, shallow flows over coarse sediment are characterized by high flow resistance because of grain drag within a roughness layer that occupies a significant fraction of the total flow depth, and by heightened critical Shields numbers and reduced sediment fluxes because of reduced lift forces and reduced turbulent fluctuations...|$|E

40|$|Automotive {{aerodynamics}} {{measurements and}} simulations now routinely use a moving ground and rotating wheels (MVG&RW), {{which is more}} representative of on-road conditions than the fixed ground-fixed wheel (FG&FW) alternative. This {{can be understood as}} a combination of three elements: (a) moving ground (MVG), (b) rotating front wheels (RWF) and (c) rotating rear wheels (RWR). The interaction of these elements with the flow field has been explored to date by mainly experimental means. This paper presents a mainly computational (CFD) investigation of the effect of RWF and RWR, in combination with MVG, on the flow field around a saloon vehicle. The influence of MVG&RW is presented both in terms of a combined change from a FG&FW baseline and the incremental effects seen by the addition of each element separately. For this vehicle, noticeable decrease in both drag and rear lift is shown when adding MVG&RW, whereas front lift shows little change. The same trends are seen in both CFD and experimental data. The addition of MVG alone increases both drag and front lift, whereas rear lift decreases significantly. The addition of RWF alone has little effect on the global results (aside from lift), whereas the addition of RWR alone decreases both drag and rear lift significantly. Combining the incremental changes produces values that align well to the MVG&RW case, with the exception of front lift. This shows similar trends to previously published work, both the noticeable <b>drag</b> <b>decrease</b> due to the addition of MVG&RW, and the contributions of the individual components...|$|E
