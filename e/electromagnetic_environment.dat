40|$|Complex <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>environments</b> {{represent}} a difficult challenge to be tackled from the electromagnetic compatibility point of view. In such structures, the field dynamics present strong {{dependence on the}} complex and (very often) changing boundary conditions. Solving the electromagnetic field in such structures is extremely complex, making the calculation problem quickly intractable. In this work we make use of state-of-the-art statistical models already developed {{for the study of}} reverberation chambers. The assumption is that an imperfectly-performing reverberation chamber works statistically analogous to a semi-reverberant complex structure. Various configurations of reverberation chambers can be easily implemented in practice. In this sense, reverberation chambers have the main advantage to act as laboratory-controlled <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>environments,</b> being able to mimic real-life complex enclosures...|$|R
