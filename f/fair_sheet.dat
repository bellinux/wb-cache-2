He then walked across the room and locked the door; and having so prepared himself, he threw himself into his easy-chair, took from a secret drawer beneath his table a volume of Rabelais, and began to amuse himself with the witty mischief of Panurge; and so passed the archdeacon's morning on that day.|$|E

40|$|In GIS {{applications}} on {{marine and}} coastal environment, models concerning both bathymetric and topographic representation are necessary: nautical charts and territorial maps are particularly useful {{because the first}} supply the morphology of sea bottom and the second the relief of mainland. Integration between these different data is possible only when files in object are referenced to the same datum, same representation, same coordinates system. These conditions are not satisfied: nautical charts produced by IIM (Istituto Idrografico della Marina) are generally in Direct Mercator Representation, while maps produced by IGM (Istituto Geografico Militare) {{as well as by}} local Administrations, are in Universal Transverse of Mercator; for consequence direct layers overlay is not possible. Also the construction of 2, 5 models, such as TINs (Triangulated Irregular Networks) and DEM (Digital Elevation Models), requires uniformity about datum, cartographic representation and coordinate system. In this paper operations to obtain 2 and 2, 5 models of Procida isle and surrounding sea bottom are illustrated: two maps, one in scale 1 : 25. 000 produced by IGM, the other in scale 1 : 30. 000 by IIM, have been used. Both two raster files are georeferred and their elements concerning altimetry are vectorised. Reduced all data to the same cartographic representation (Gauss), TIN and DEM have been constructed. More detailed models have been realised using one <b>fair</b> <b>sheet</b> and one map produced by Province of Naples in scale 1 : 5. 000.

40|$|Several {{investigators}} have tackled {{the problem of}} the main causes that produce the slopes of volcanic cones, especially with a view to explaining the characteristic concave profiles of strato-volcanoes *). A satisfactory result has not been arrived at, however. This became evident to the present author while studying the submarine slopes of volcanoes in the East Indies. A number of submarine sections of isolated volcanic piles were constructed from the echo-soundings of the Snellius Expedition and from the data contained in the <b>fair</b> <b>sheets</b> of the Hydrographical Survey. These sections combined with the corresponding subaerial profiles will be reproduced in the Scientific Results of “the Snellius Expedition, Volume V: Geology, Part 1 : Geological Interpretation of the Bathymetrical Results”, together with a discussion of their shapes and the mode of their formation. An explanation of the wet part of the slope is not possible, however, until we understand the agents influencing the dry part. But as we said, this subject has not been adequately treated. An attempt had therefore first to be made to analyse the factors that play a part in the production of subaerial slopes of volcanoes. In order to test the validity of the deductions an experimental investigation was undertaken that will be described below. These experiments were carried out in the laboratory for experimental geology in the Leyden geological institute...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the {{relation}} between the real option accounting and the fair value accounting, and describe the calculation method of the fair value income. The followings are stated: (1) Current cost, sale value, and present value are the special concepts of fair value, and real option value is the general concept. (2) The method of preparing a <b>fair</b> value balance <b>sheet</b> is to calculate corporate value by present value accounting first, then calculate corporate value by real option accounting, and prepare the <b>fair</b> value balance <b>sheet</b> based on these proceedings. (3) There are general approach and individual approach as the method of calculating fair value income, and the difference between both fair value incomes is the change of the good will in one period. (4) The general approach is the real option accounting, and this accounting can calculate the true income of a corporation. The conclusion is that the real option accounting is the general forms of contemporary fair value accounting theoretically and play an important role of a general theory of contemporary accounting not only practically but also theoretically...|$|R

50|$|In 1983, Peterffy {{sought to}} computerize the options market, and he first {{targeted}} the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). At the time, brokers still used <b>fair</b> value pricing <b>sheets,</b> which were by then updated {{once or twice}} a day. In 1983, Timber Hill created the first handheld computers used for trading. As Peterffy explained in a 2016 interview, the battery-powered units had touch screens for the user to input a stock price and it would produce the recommended option prices, and it also tracked positions and continually repriced options on stocks. However, he immediately encountered opposition from the heads of the exchange. When he first brought a 12 in by 9 in device to the exchange floor, a committee in the exchange told him it was too big. When he made the device smaller, the committee stated that no analytic devices were allowed to be used on the exchange floor. Effectively blocked from using the CBOE, he sought to use his devices in other exchanges.|$|R

In 1987, Peterffy also created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system, to automatically create and submit orders to a market. Between 1993 and 1994, the corporate group Interactive Brokers Group was created, and the subsidiary Interactive Brokers LLC was created to control its electronic brokerage, and to keep it separate from Timber Hill, which conducts market making. In 2014, Interactive Brokers became the first online broker to offer direct access to IEX, a private forum for trading securities. Currently about 16.6 percent of the company is publicly held, while the remainder is held by employees and their affiliates; Thomas Peterffy is the largest shareholder.|$|R

60|$|AT {{five o'clock}} Lisbeth came downstairs {{with a large}} key in her hand: it was the key of the chamber where her husband lay dead. Throughout the day, except in her {{occasional}} outbursts of wailing grief, {{she had been in}} incessant movement, performing the initial duties to her dead with the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites. She had brought out her little store of bleached linen, which she had for long years kept in reserve for this supreme use. It seemed but yesterday--that time so many midsummers ago, when she had told Thias where this linen lay, that he might be sure and reach it out for her when SHE died, for she was the elder of the two. Then there had been the work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the sacred chamber, and of removing from it every trace of common daily occupation. The small window, which had hitherto freely let in the frosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working man's slumber, must now be darkened with a <b>fair</b> white <b>sheet,</b> for this was the sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in ceiled houses. Lisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and unnoticeable rent in the checkered bit of bed-curtain; for the moments were few and precious now in which {{she would be able to}} do the smallest office of respect or love for the still corpse, to which in all her thoughts she attributed some consciousness. Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten them: they can be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our penitence, all our aching sense that their place is empty, all the kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence. And the aged peasant woman most of all believes that her dead are conscious. Decent burial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of for herself through years of thrift, with an indistinct expectation that she should know when she was being carried to the churchyard, followed by her husband and her sons; and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life were to be done in seeing that Thias was buried decently before her--under the white thorn, where once, in a dream, she had thought she lay in the coffin, yet all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white blossoms that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be churched after Adam was born.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Thomas Peterffy {{left his}} job {{designing}} commodity trading software for Mocatta Metals, {{and bought a}} seat on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) as an individual market maker. The following year, he formed his first company, named T.P. & Co., to expand trading activities to several members under badge number 549. At the time, trading used an open outcry system; Peterffy developed algorithms to determine the best prices for options and used those on the trading floor, and thus the firm became the first to use daily printed <b>fair</b> value pricing <b>sheets.</b> In 1979, the company expanded to employ four traders, three of whom were AMEX members. In 1982, Peterffy renamed T.P. & Co. to Timber Hill Inc.; he named it after a road to a favorite retreat, one of his properties on Hutchin Hill Road in Woodstock, New York. By 1983, Peterffy was sending orders to the floor from his upstairs office; he devised a system to read the data from a Quotron machine by measuring the electric pulses in the wire and decoding them. The data would be then sent through Peterffy's trading algorithms, and then Peterffy would call down the trades. After pressure to become a true market maker and keep constant bids and offers, Peterffy knew that he would need his employees to closely pay attention to market movements, and that handheld computers would help. At the time, the AMEX didn't permit computers on the trading floor. Because of this, Peterffy had an assistant deliver market information from his office in the World Trade Center. In November 1983 he convinced the exchange to allow computer use on the floor.|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} {{decision}} {{usefulness of the}} equity method of accounting from two perspectives. First, I examine the value relevance of information provided under the equity method relative to the value relevance of information resulting from measuring investments in affiliates at fair value. For a sample of 221 U. S. investors with publicly-traded affiliates during 1993 - 2011, I find that balance sheet measures of investments in publicly-traded affiliates provided under the equity method are associated with investors' stock prices, but income from these affiliates recognized under the equity method is not associated with investors' stock prices. In addition, <b>fair</b> value balance <b>sheet</b> and income measures of investments in publicly-traded affiliates are incrementally associated with investors' stock prices after controlling for information provided under the equity method. The incremental value relevance of fair value measures for investments in publicly-traded affiliates exists for both investments identified as held for sale and those identified as strategic, with {{no evidence that the}} incremental value relevance is higher (lower) for investments identified as held for sale (strategic). This result suggests that the 2010 and 2013 proposals by the U. S. Financial Accounting Standards Board to distinguish between investments in affiliates based on management's intended method of value realization are not supported by differences in the relative value relevance of fair value measures for these types of investments. Second, I evaluate whether equity method investors use their significant influence to manage income reported under the equity method. For a sample of 202 U. S. firms from 1993 - 2011, I find that signed discretionary accruals of affiliates are higher when income from affiliates allows investors to meet earnings targets. This result is consistent with equity method investors influencing the financial reporting of affiliates to achieve earnings targets. Dissertatio...|$|R

[...] Of course they had to feed him without dishes. [...] They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded [...] With his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes. [...] Cruel--it sounds. I 'spose they did the best [...] They knew. And just when he was at the height, [...] Father and mother married, and mother came, [...] A bride, to help take care of such a creature, [...] And accommodate her young life to his. [...] That was what marrying father meant to her. [...] She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful [...] By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout [...] Until the strength was shouted out of him, [...] And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion. [...] He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string, [...] And let them go and make them twang until [...] His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow. [...] And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play-- [...] The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though, [...] They found a way {{to put a stop to}} it. [...] He was before my time--I never saw him; [...] But the pen stayed exactly as it was [...] There in the upper chamber in the ell, [...] A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.

40|$|We cannot {{ignore the}} fact that since the {{inception}} of civilization, both women as well as Nature are the integral parts of any society or culture. The reason {{is that it is a}} woman whois the pillar of a home because of being the creator of the hand that rocks the cradle, rules the human beings on earth, the same woman makes a family and these families lay the base of a nation. Like woman, Nature too gives her offerings to the ‘man-made society and never demand anything for that. In this way, we can say that though the maker of a nation is undoubtedly women yet the role of Nature cannot be underestimated. The reason is that since the birth of a child, it is both mother as well as Nature who polish the personality of a person—mother as a social teacher and Nature as a moral one. Thus, their role cannot be overlooked. But despite this, they both have been marginalized from ancient times. The so-called patriarchal society always negated women and Nature and treat them as their own property. The male-oriented society regards women and Nature as subservient who are created by God for their comfort. On the one hand, women are regarded as weak and palpable; Nature too is crushed by man and used as a stair to the way of development. But the worst fact is that this patriarchal society regard that the whole burden of the journey of life is on the strong shoulders of men because women do not have the capacity to do so and in order to live an ultra-comfortable, luxurious materialistic life, man did not stumble even on the path of deforestation. But one must keep in mind the fact that these two inseparable parts of our society which are considered to be the inferior parts in the eyes of the patriarchal society, are the wheels on which this earth depends on account of the fact that women give existence to men in this world physically and Nature controlled that existence throughout our lives since we depend on Nature for food, air and other life-giving objects. In fact, the same patriarchal society never gave chance to women to come forward and to go shoulder to shoulder with men. It is one of the barest facts that though we have reached on Moon and Mars in this modern era and still moving forward day by day, yet in the case of women; our thoughts are still circumscribed to the primeval times. In most of the parts; not only of India but of the world, women are still subjugated on the name of culture, family, tradition and many others. The same can be noted in case of Nature. Though there was an eco-friendly relationship between Nature and men in ancient times as men’s life is merely confined to Nature those days but with the progress of the time, men esteemed Nature and women merely as ‘objects’ who must have to yield to the wishes of men. In fact, since the birth of a daughter, she is trained to various roles into which she will have to fit. It is our society which teaches how a girl should behave, talk, walk and think, just as we compress Nature according to our own wishes. Moreover, Rousseau’s saying that “man is born free; but is everywhere in chains” is applicable mostly in case of women and Nature as well. The same negligible condition of the two gave rise to the movement Eco-Feminism (1970 s) with the intention of dismantling the chains which women and Nature are bound with and to give equal rights to both. The Eco Feminists are of the opinion that “patriarchal society’s values and beliefs have resulted in the oppression of both women and nature. It ignores women’s work, knowledge and ‘situatededness’ (her immediate location in nature, where the relationship with the environment is far more intimate than that of a man’s) ”(Nayar 88). The Chipko movement is nothing but the outcome of the colonization of Nature, the chief exponent of which is a woman Vandana Shiva as the two—women and Nature bears semblance with each other and in the same way as Nature is crushed by man-made society, women too never got any chance to come forward or to express their views. Women were merely confined to their domestic works. In their view both Nature and women are debased on the basis of caste and class. In the view of Vandana Shiva, “National colonization brought with it a colonization of living natural resources such as the forests, and then a mental colonization in its prescription of technological and market-oriented responses to farming and environment” (Young 100). In fact, this marginalization has its roots in heaven. Being a ‘man’ God himself is patriarchal in His attitude as He produced ‘man’ first and thereafter created ‘woman’ out of the ribs of man. Meaning that woman is represented even by God as the second fiddle despite the fact that it is woman who is the maker of the human beings on earth because of genetic force. God’s patriarchy can be defined through the fact that “the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof” (Nagarajan 209). In connection to this, God reserves the same attitude for Nature as well. Because of being the supreme power and mainly a ‘male’, God adopted the tyrannical attitude and kept the ‘Tree of Knowledge’ for His own. Furthermore, it is not only in Greek Mythology that women are negated as they were not even considered as a parent at all; even the poetry of Milton is not left untouched from this mentality. In Paradise Lost, Milton stated, “He for God only: she (Eve) for God in him”(Nagarajan 207). These lines leave the impression that women have always been maltreated, subjugated and underestimated in all the ages. Thus, the proposed methodology that has been used to define how nature and women both are trapped in this patriarchal society is Eco-Feminism through which Robert Frost has tried to demonstrate that both nature and women are earth’s essential parts, in the absence of which our lives will come to an end. Robert Frost’s poetry tries to contribute to the same efforts of Eco Feminists much before them. He deals with the rural life and in this regard Nature always provides the background. Frost's best poetry shows man's activities in Nature. His attitude towards Nature is one of armed and amicable truce and mutual respect interspersed with crossing of the boundaries, separating the two principle forces of the world and individual. But if we delve deep into his poems, we come across the fact that nature is the replica of women and by dictating the dreadful activities of man towards Nature, Frost tries to bring into limelight the all-pervading lamentable condition of women. In the same way as the patriarchal society is deaf to the sighs of women and tries to press it down with the utmost power, when Nature shows her outrage towards men because of their interference with the natural surroundings in the form of snowfalls, storms, melting of the glaciers and other natural disasters, human beings try to overpower them by cutting down the trees because they opine that both women and Nature have their existence just to offer their services to men. Like Eco Feminists, Robert Frost “gives women in his poetry enormous vocal presence and power: they speak for themselves. Few modern poets give women as much vocal prominence as Frost in lyrics, dramatic narratives, and dramatic monologues in which we find the speakers struggling against the entanglements of social and sexual domination of their own voice and sanity” (Faggen 92). The reason is that when commercial gain tempted the local men and they tried to subjugate the voice of women connected with the movement, women crossing the old erected boundaries of custom and culture and put their view that they will not be mesmerized by the short term advantages. As women are the source of food production and fetching fuels at homes; our ecology is the source of our vegetation, supply of water, fresh air and soil. In fact, “the women challenged the principles of the whole system, charging that the men had been ideologically colonized by the short-term commercial values of the market place, trying to take control of nature just as patriarchy tries to control women” (Young 102). In addition to this, Frost’s poetry delineates the aftermath of the over indulgence of man in the deeds of Nature in the form of scenes of draughts, battles over public land use, protests over nuclear waste dumps and many others which make our lives inhospitable to live. But it is a well-known fact that there are layers of meanings wrapped in a single word in Frost’s poetry. The exploitation of Nature as represented by Frost resemblesthe pathetic condition of women. His poem “A Servant to Servants”is “a voice for a woman trapped in the daily cycle of drudgery and a family cycle of madness and sexual trauma” (Tuten and Zubizarreta 324). It is a dramatic monologue where a woman stated the trauma of life imposed on her by the patriarchal society. As suggested by the title, the woman of the poem is available all the time in the service of her husband and his hired persons but the indifferent attitude of the male society makes her exhausted from her own life. Even the serene and mesmerizing atmosphere of Nature brings desolation to her as it reminds of her own situation and here Frost has put the ground of the Eco Feminist theory. The lines: I look and look at it. I see it’s a <b>fair,</b> pretty <b>sheet</b> of water. I stand and make myself repeat out loud The advantages it has, so long and narrow, Like a deep piece of some old running river Cut short off at both ends. (Lathem 63, lines 16 - 21) The image of the lake resembles with that of the woman. Just as the lake has been shrunken from both the sides because of human activities for developing themselves socially and technologically, women too have always been dominated, first at their father’s homes, thereafter by their in-laws. Moreover, as Nature took revenge from man by overpowering man|$|R
