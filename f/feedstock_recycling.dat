40|$|For a {{long time}} plastic {{packaging}} {{was considered to be}} a major problem in the sales packaging sector because of the apparently limited number of recovery and recycling techniques. Today, the situation has changed dramatically: Used plastic packaging has now become a new raw material. Three different methods are available for recycling and recovering this packaging: Mechanical recycling, <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> and energy recovery. In compliance with the provisions of the German Packaging Ordinance, however, plastic packagiong collected by the Dual System may only be reycled using mechanical or feedstock techniques. In the recent past, the environmental impacts caused by the individual techniques have attracted much more attention, leading to controversial discussions in some cases. This study showes that the ecological significance is not, as is often falsely assumed, dependent on whether post-consumer plastics are recycled into their starting products. On the contrary, the efficiency with which primary resources are replaced with post-consumer plastics is of primary importance. The suitability of mechanical recycling, <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> and energy recovery techniques for this purpose naturally differs depending on the initial situation. Therefore it is impossible to make a global statement such as: Mechanical recycling is better than <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is a diploma thesis from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Department of Machine Design and Materials Technology, and covers {{the following research}} questions: What is the composition of plastics household waste in Trondheim, Norway, how should it be collected out of the alternative curbside containers plastdunk (container for plastics only) and miljødunk (container for plastics, metal and other fractions not suitable for incineration), and how should it be processed, out of the alternatives mechanical and chemical/feedstock recycling? The report includes the results from {{a detailed analysis of}} the plastics content in the plastdunk, as well as the findings in a literature study of mechanical and <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling.</b> These are the main conclusions: - The calculated plastics amount from the examined area of Heimdal in Trondheim, shows an increase of 48 %. As this is unlikely, there is probably one or more errors in the analysis from this year, or the similar analysis done last year. This adds some uncertainty to some of the conclusions. The calculated total amount of households plastics in Trondheim per year is 3736 tons. This is a very different amount from the previous estimate of 1174 tons (packaging only). As only 25, 4 % of the total plastics ends up in the plastdunk, there is a loss of 74, 5 % of the plastics because of erroneous sorting from consumers. - Plastic shopping and garbage bags amount to 40, 2 % of the plastic film fraction. Of the bottle fraction, plastics from dairy products amount to 21, 7 %, while plastics from packaging of car-maintenance products (motor oil etc.) add up to 33, 6 %. There is 5, 5 % more plastics in absolute amounts in the plastdunk compared to the miljødunk. When implementing a curbside system based on the plastdunk in Trondheim, 41 % more film and 75 % more bottles can be recovered from the wasteflow, compared to the existing system based on the miljødunk. The {{reason for this is that}} it is easier to sort plastics from the plastdunk. Thus, I can conclude that the plastdunk is the better alternative compared to th miljødunk. - A comparison of the environmental properties of the alternatives mechanical and <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> shows that mechanical recycling has the least environmental load. Comparing by total costs shows that the two alternatives cost roughly the same per ton treated, while <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> has the better potential for cost savings over time, as technology progresses. The cost-data involve a fair degree of uncertainty. The smallest facilities for <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling,</b> with a annual capacity of 15 000 tons, are based on the method of BASF thermolysis. This method has a relatively low environmental load. However, the method demands a refinery for its products.

These have attempted to support decisions {{in the formulation of}} waste management strategies and policies. In light of the introduction of life cycle thinking into European waste policies, specifically in relation to the waste hierarchy, a literature review of publically available LCA studies evaluating alternative end-of-life treatment options for plastic waste has been conducted. This has been done in order to: establish if a consensus exists as to the environmentally preferable treatment option for plastic waste; identify the methodological consid- erations and assumptions that have led to these conclusions; and determine the legitimacy of applying the waste hierarchy to the plastic wastestream. The majority of the LCA studies concluded that, when single polymer plastic waste fractions with little organic contamination are recycled and replace virgin plastic at a ratio of close to 1 : 1, recycling is generally the environmentally preferred treatment option when compared to municipal solid waste incineration. It has been found that assumptions relating to the virgin material substitution ratio and level of organic contamination can have a significant influence upon the results of these studies. Although a limited number of studies addressed <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling,</b> <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> and the use of plastic waste as a solid recovered fuel in cement kilns were preferred to municipal solid waste incineration.

40|$|Americans {{generated}} {{more than}} 254 {{million tons of}} municipal solid wastes (MSW) with plastics comprising 12. 1 % of the total amount. Of this waste component, only 6. 8 % was recycled. The traditional ways of handling non-recycled plastic wastes are landfilling and incineration. It can be argued however that neither of those approaches are adequate solutions. Landfills require large areas which may be challenged by increasing population. Furthermore, there is no energetic incentive to sequester these polymers for decades. A better approach to land filling is energy recovery via incineration, which uses the heat of combustion to generate electricity. However, the necessity for considerable pollution control, the difficulty of burning plastics, and their chemical composition suggest that some type of recycling is more valuable. Tertiary recycling (also known as <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling)</b> is the processing of waste into fuels or basic chemicals.

In the 1990 s, various firms took initiatives to set up dedicated plants capable of breaking the plastics waste down to a hydrocarbon feedstock via processes such as cracking, liquefaction and gasification.

40|$|Bench {{and pilot}} scale {{membrane}} reactors were designed and assembled {{to carry out}} the transesterification of different lipids with methanol. The membrane reactors integrate many procedures and reach several process integration objectives such as combining reaction and separation in a single unit, continuous mixing of raw materials, maintaining high mass transfer between the immiscible phases and maintaining two phases during the reaction. Several factors affecting the biodiesel production process and the biodiesel purity such as membrane pore size, volume ratio of <b>feedstocks,</b> <b>recycling</b> of the polar phase, catalyst (NaOH) concentration, and feedstock type and quality were investigated. Thus, a series of experiments using canola, palm, soybean and waste oils were performed at various alcohols to oil ratios, recycling proportions, catalyst (NaOH) concentrations, and residence times. Carbon membranes of different pore sizes (namely, 0. 05, 0. 2, 0. 5 and 1. 4 micron) were shown to retain the unreacted lipid feedstock in the reactor, which indicated that the oil droplets present in the reactor were larger than all the pore sizes; no triglycerides were found in the permeate. The effects of initial methanol/canola oil loading were also studied in semi-continuous mode. Permeate was observed at the 0. 38, 0. 47, and 0. 64 initial methanol volume fractions (&phis; 1) whereas it was not observed at &phis; 1 = 0. 29, which indicated that initial volume fractions of methanol up to 0. 38 could be treated in the membrane reactor. A semi-empirical model was developed and validated as a predictive equation to determine phase inversion in the reactor. The membrane reactor produces a permeate stream which readily phase separates at room temperature into a FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) -rich non-polar phase and a methanol- and glycerol-rich polar phase. To decrease the overall methanol:oil molar ratio in the reaction system, the polar phase was recycled. Three recycle ratios were tested: 100, 75 and 50 %, at the same residence time and operating conditions. The permeate consistently separated to yield a FAME-rich non-polar phase containing a minimum of 85 wt. % FAME (the remainder being methanol) as well as a methanol/glycerol polar phase. At the highest recycle ratio, the FAME concentration ranged from 85. 7 to 92. 4 wt. % in the FAME-rich non-polar phase. The total glycerine and free glycerine contents of the FAME produced were below the ASTM D 6751 standard after only a single reaction step. Under essentially the same reaction conditions, a conventional batch reaction was not able to achieve the same degree of FAME purity. A kinetic study was conducted to seek the rate constants of transesterification in the membrane reactor at various catalyst (NaOH) concentrations and RTs. The proposed mathematical kinetic model fitted the experimental results well. It was found that the catalyst (NaOH) concentration increased the reaction rates, and the RT had no significant influence on the reaction rates. The forward rate constants were over 450 % higher than previous work using a batch process. This was attributed to the excellent mixing in the membrane reactor loop, the higher methanol:oil molar ratio used in the study and the continuous removal of product from the reaction medium. The work shows the advantages of product removal in enhancing the reaction rate in transesterifying canola oil in a membrane reactor. In conclusion, this work presents the first systematic study of biodiesel production using a membrane reactor. Among the most significant factors investigated were the completion of high purity biodiesel production process based on the permeate de-phasing discovery. Empirical models were selected for prediction of phase inversion in the reactor. Lower catalyst (NaOH) concentration than conventional process can be used in membrane reactor, and a very broad range of feedstocks can be used in the membrane reactor to produce biodiesel.

40|$|The second {{generation}} of biofuels processes should differ from the first in a) utilizing the whole plantas a feedstock and b) use of “non-food” perennial crops (woody biomass and tall grasses) andlignocellulosic residues and wastes. Possible options for the conversion of these lignocellulosic plantmaterials include: thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, pyrolysis, carbonisation, catalytic reforming,steam reforming, gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydro-dehydrogenisation, hydrocracking,hydrorefining and decarboxylation. The main goal of biorefinery is to produce high-value low-volumechemicals (levoglucosan) and low-value high-volume fuels {{with a series of}} unit operations. Thermal processes must be included among the attractive basic recycling technology for polymersfor which thermal cracking and pyrolysis enable the conversion of polymer materials into fuels,monomers and other valuable products. The subject of the research were the thermal and catalyticprocesses for the production of motor fuels from polymer material from industrial material or municipaltrash sources turning it into sulfur free, non-aromatic and ecological fuel via chemical recycling toreplace fossil fuels mainly from oil sources. The key is the liquefaction of polymer materials tooil/waxes that can be distilled to provide gasoline, diesel fuels and heating oils that can be useddirectly or after hydrorefining. We found a way, how incorporate polymer waste into conventional liquid steam cracking feedstocks. Polyalkene oils and waxes decompose during co-pyrolysis.

30|$|Local {{biodiesel}} production holds {{great promise}} {{to solve the}} above mentioned energy and environmental related concerns; however {{there are two major}} challenges that inhibit biodiesel production: 1) cost of the feedstock; and 2) conversion process of oils to biodiesel. While using low cost <b>feedstock</b> and <b>recycling</b> waste cooking oils and animal fats can be an alternative to reduce the feedstock costs; process improvements and optimization help reduce the biodiesel conversion process costs. Biodiesel production involves two main steps: 1) extraction of oils from the feedstock, and 2) conversion (transesterification) of oils (fatty acids) to biodiesel (alkyl esters). Without these steps biodiesel production is not possible, as such, these two steps play important role and need detailed attention. Common methods employed to demonstrate these two steps simultaneously or in series include conventional heating, high pressure and temperature reactions such as thermal liquefaction and pyrolysis. These methods are employed based on the feedstock type and quality [11]. These methods are not energy-efficient and are expensive and offer scope for further improvements. Several process modification and improvements were performed both at laboratory research and industrial levels [11 – 13]. In this category, the effect of radiofrequency and ultrasound waves has been tested [4, 7]. Ultrasonic production has shown improvements in extraction and transesterification processes; however, the technology may require longer reaction times and larger volumes of solvents possibly with excess energy consumption compared to microwave based process [12]. Recently, microwaves have received increased attention due to their ability to complete chemical reactions in very short times. Microwaves have revolutionized the way chemical reactions can be performed with unexplainable results. This amazed the entire scientific and industrial community and resulted in “curious chemists” who applied microwaves in different areas of chemistry to benefit from these results. Few advantages with microwave processing can be listed as: rapid heating and cooling; cost savings due to energy, time and work space savings; precise and controlled processing; selective heating; volumetric and uniform heating; reduced processing time; improved quality (“reportedly”) and properties; and effects not achievable by conventional means of heating [14 – 20]. Microwaves have been used by many researchers around the world in many organic and inorganic syntheses at exploratory levels [14 – 20]. Recently, many industries have successfully implemented microwave based processes, examples include: ceramic/ceramic matrix composite sintering and powder processing, polymers and polymer-matrix composites processing, microwave plasma processing of materials, and minerals processing [14]. Microwaves have the ability to induce reactions even in solvent-free conditions offering “Green Chemistry” solutions to many environmental problems related to hazardous and toxic contaminants [19]. Due to these advantages, microwaves provide for tremendous opportunities to improve biodiesel conversion processes from different feedstock and oils. The intention of this review is to provide the basics of microwave energy applications specific to biodiesel preparation and processing, preliminary understanding and explanation of microwave effect on the chemical reactions (extraction and transesterification), update on process utilization and improvements, and information related to different process configurations and reactor designs available for biodiesel production. This review paper provides basic information related to microwave based biodiesel processing for novice researchers and those actively practicing in the biodiesel industry.|$|R
40|$|The {{comparison}} of the ecological benefit of different waste management and recycling strategies {{has to deal with}} the problem, that different strategies deliver different products. A new methodological approach, the so called "Utility Basket Method" is proposed. It takes into account that different recycling products are able to substitute different conventional products. This approach is applied to the {{comparison of}} 12 recycling/recovery options for post consumer plastics waste which are discussed in Germany. It results in a set of 12 systems which all process the same amount of waste and deliver all the same set of different products. For these systems 6 of 11 evaluated environmental criteria were found to be relevant for assessment. These criteria were deduced from complete mass and energy flux inventories which are established in the way of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is being operating as it is presently being subjected to standardization activities in the ISO. The resu lts are presented as the quantified reduction or enlargement of each environmental criterion versus conventional landfilling. It becomes obvious that the classification of recycling/recovery strategies in Mechanical Recycling, <b>Feedstock</b> <b>Recycling</b> and Energy Recovery gives no information about ecological advantages or disadvantages.

40|$|Due to the {{migration}} of scientists towards green chemistry, landfilling and incineration {{will no longer be}} acceptable options for plastics waste disposal in the future. Consequently new methods for recycling plastics and plastic products such as carpets are being researched. This study serves as a preliminary effort to study the catalytic <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> of polyolefins, specifically PP and PE, as source for gasoline range fuels, as well as an alternative for plastic waste disposal. Several studies have been conducted on the pyrolysis of waste polyolefins using commercial cracking catalysts (FCC), however, the effect of catalyst size and mode of catalyst dispersion have been studied sparsely. This thesis proposes to study these effects in the catalytic pyrolysis of polypropylene (PP), a component of carpets, using both fresh and used FCC catalysts. The same study will be applied to polyethylene (PE), which accounts for an enormous amount of municipal solid waste in the US today. Furthermore, the catalytic impact of calcium carbonate, a filler component of tufted carpet, will be investigated. Using thermogravimetric analysis, the global kinetics of the PP pyrolysis using various FCC catalysts will be derived and applied in the modeling of the pyrolysis reaction in a twin screw extruder. Furthermore, an economic analysis on the catalytic pyrolysis of PP is presented. M. S. Committee Chair: Muzzy, John; Committee Member: Jones, Christopher; Committee Member: Realff, Matthe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> of {{thermosets}} {{using the}} transfer hydrogenolysis with partially hydrogenated aromatics such as tetraline (1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthaline) or 9, 10 -dihydroanthracene was studied. It {{was possible to}} cleave an epoxy resin cured with phthalic anhydride with a yield of more than 99 wt. -% soluble products at a temperature of 340 C in 2 h. A reaction mechanism was proposed. First the thermally most labile bonds in the resin suffer homolysis, then the radicals formed that way are saturated by abstraction of hydrogen from the hydrogen donor. The most important reaction products like phenol, p-isopropylphenol and phthalic anhydride were quantitatively analyzed by gas chromatography. The method also worked with a technical epoxy resin sheet reinforced with glass fiber mats and covered with copper foil. Grinding of the resin was not necessary and {{it was possible to}} recover the glass fiber mats and copper foils with very little pollution. Carbon fibers could be recovered too from a reinforced epoxy resin. The hydrogenolysis was successfully applied to liquefy other thermosets like phenolic resins, melamine resins and crosslinked unsaturated polyesters. It could be shown that the degradation of crosslinked polymers can be carried out at lower temperatures with a mixture of a hydrogen donor and an amine, such as tetraline and ethanolamine. (orig.)

A kinetic study {{has been carried out}} by thermogravimetry in order to compare the thermal behavior of printed circuit boards of mobile phones before and after the removal of the metallic fraction. Experiments were performed in nitrogen atmosphere (pyrolysis runs) as well as in an oxidative atmosphere (10 % and 20 % oxygen in nitrogen). Several dynamic and dynamic + isothermal runs have been carried out at different heating rates (5, 10 and 20 K min− 1), from room temperature to more than 900 K. Moreover, TG–MS experiments were performed (in inert and oxidizing atmosphere) in order to better understand the thermal decomposition of these wastes. Different reaction models are proposed, one for pyrolysis and one for combustion of the two kinds of wastes studied, which proved to simulate appropriately the experimental results at all the heating rates simultaneously. Regarding the analysis of pollutants evolved, pyrolysis and combustion runs have been carried out at 600 ºC and 850 ºC in a horizontal laboratory furnace in order to analyze a wide range of gases, hydrogen halides, carbon oxides, light hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated phenols (ClPhs), chlorinated benzenes (ClBzs) and brominated phenols (BrPhs), among others.

40|$|Plastic debris (marine litter) {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{pollution}} problems in the marine environment. Nets, ropes, packaging, and pellets are the most common items that are spread around the world’s oceans causing an impact on wildlife and human health, and economic loss. Although mitigation is tantamount, the question remains for what can be done with the plastics that are already in the oceans. Studies as shown that much of the collected marine debris goes to landfilling because it is little-known, diverse, salty, and too dirty for both incineration and recycling. We conducted a literature review of research on debris and plastics waste management. It showed that there is a strong focus on describing the environmental problems of marine and plastic debris, and that plastic debris is described in natural science terms that the waste management industry cannot use for determining suitable treatments. In order to better translate beach debris data into waste management data, we have collected beach debris from the Swedish West coast and conducted physical and chemical analyses in order to characterise the debris in waste management terms. Based on this data and the literature review, we have identified several recycling options for the plastic debris. In order to identify environmental pros and cons with the different treatment, we will conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparing mechanical treatment, incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, and others processes to establish an appropriate and practical approach towards closing the loop for plastic debris. Preliminary analyses suggest that mechanical treatments are not suitable for most the plastics (due to they are fragmented, degraded and with a wide range of additives) whereas chemical treatments are suggested as a suitable solution. <b>Feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> allows the production of raw material, as well as it may have fewer emissions in contrast with combustion which has operational problems and the gas cleaning might be insufficient since litter has pollutants such as chloride.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} presentada en el Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Tencnología del Medio Ambiente de la Universidad de Oviedo. 2011. Directores: Ramón Álvarez García y Mª Antonia Díez Díaz-EstébanezThe {{environmental impact}} due to waste production, {{both domestic and}} industrial, has become a maximum priority of environmental policies in developed countries. Even though waste management has undergone a significant evolution in the last decades, the waste recovery continues being of great importance to achieve sustainable development and compatible with the environmental protection; so it has been necessary to allocate time and resources to develop processes to ensure that plastic recycling is an economically profitable process, and in this way, it helps to decrease the amount of residues designated to landfill disposal. As a result of recent European legislation for management and recovery of plastic wastes from packaging, is being promoted {{the development of new}} processes of mechanical and chemical recycling and energy recovery, in order to achieve the recycling objectives. Other type of wastes which gives good reasons for special attention are used oils, so common in our daily lives, and used in the operation of industrial machinery, automotive vehicles or transmission hydraulic systems, to mention some of the most significant examples. The loss of their properties after the continued use is unfortunately accompanied by the generation of residual oils, therefore, it is necessary to establish measures to minimize as much as possible the production of these hazardous wastes and promote that the generated wastes are managed by the alternatives which ensure environmental protection and health of people. The development of new recycling ways to allow the recovery of both types of residues is very important in order to keep as many options open, especially when an existing industrial process can be used and it is not necessary any operational variation made by the industry. In this sense, integrated steel plants can be considered as an option for those wastes with technical limitations for conventional recycling. The combination of the blast furnace route and coke plant in the steel industry, provide a way to expand <b>feedstock</b> <b>recycling</b> with economic, social and environmental benefits. In the present work we have studied the viability of this action via, the cocarbonization of the wastes with coal for the production of coke, which feeds the blast furnace to produce iron which subsequently will be transformed into steel. To achieve this general objective, the specific objectives focus on the study of the influence on the coking properties of an individual coal and three coal blends used by the industry for blast-furnace coke production, of the six more common thermoplastics in the domestic wastes (LOPE, HOPE, PP, PS, PET and PVC), and six mixtures of them, covering a wide range of compositions. Also, nine lube-oils were used. Oils have paraffin nature except one of them which is a synthetic oil containing organic esters. Two oils mixtures were prepared based on their thermal behaviour and as reference materials a coal-tar and a coaltar pitch were used. Peer reviewe...|$|E
