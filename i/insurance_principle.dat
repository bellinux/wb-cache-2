50|$|In 1989 Chen {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} “trading off“ {{a small portion of}} Social Security benefits (exempting low earners from the trade-off for this benefit) to create a “Social Security/Long-Term Care Plan” (SS/LTC) that would provide a basic level of long-term-care protection using the social insurance mechanism. The plan is based on a new model of public and private partnership consisting of a public social insurance benefit as a base, with supplementation from private long-term-care insurance and individual payments, while Medicaid (a welfare program) is kept as a safety net for the poor. SS/LTC is designed to make paying for long-term care more rational and dependable by (1) employing the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle</b> in the design of both private- and public-sector programs and (2) creating linkages to combine several sources of funds that currently exist both privately and publicly.|$|E
40|$|Book synopsis: Two {{aspects of}} the {{structure}} of existing social security systems limit the scope for containing costs by increasing targeting: the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle,</b> and the use of category membership to establish eligibility for benefits. The first aspect is antithetical to targeting because the most needy people are also the most likely to fail to establish an adequate contributions record. Some countries appear committed to maintaining the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle</b> because {{it is part of the}} fabric of the relationship between employers, employees and the State. The second aspect can be seen as an effective way of identifying groups whose income is likely to fall short of their needs. However, the primary function of category definition is to establish the legitimacy of claims—to examine why a shortfall of income in relation to needs has arisen, what personal responsibility the claimant bears, and what alternative mechanisms might be available. Several countries have revised category definitions in response to issues about the motivation and “deservingness” of claimants. We designate as “pseudo-targeting” reforms of this type, which are not likely to result in the allocation of a higher share of social expenditure to the worst-off. The scope for increasing targeting in existing systems is very restricted, reflecting the limitations of the concept. Non-categorical social assistance is the archetypal targeted benefit, and it has serious limitations. The obstacles to targeting are integral to the legitimation of social security. If targeting reforms undermine this legitimating structure, they risk undermining the claim on resources exercised by the social security system...|$|E

Due to these uncertainties, emergence of risks is unavoidable. Dealing with these risks is a major area of concern in construction industry. One method to deal with these risks is to transfer it to a third party known as an insurer through an insurance contract.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to many {{contributions to the}} literature on the transformation of the German welfare state, this article emphasizes the continuing influence of conservative principles on the direction of change. Liberalization is certainly a central aspect of reform processes, but this liberalization has not strongly challenged several core conservative principles: occupational fragmentation and family-based benefit entitlement. In other words, pension and health benefits have been reduced, but this has occurred within the basic structure of conservative welfare statism, and has been counter-balanced by compensatory mechanisms. There is one exception to this trend: reforms significantly weaken the effectiveness of the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle</b> in pensions. Incremental cost-cutting measures, especially in the pension system, will result in significantly lower average pensions for future retirees. Likewise, the strengthening of market principles in the health care system will lead to higher costs for low-income groups.|$|E

40|$|How {{realistic}} are {{proposals to}} expand the financing of Canadian health care through private insurance, either in a parallel stream or an expanded supplementary tier?

40|$|Catastrophe bonds feature full {{collateralization}} of {{the underlying}} risk transfer, and thus abandon the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle</b> of economizing on collateral through diversification. We examine the theoretical foundations beneath this paradox, finding that fully collateralized instruments have important uses in a risk transfer market when insurers cannot contract completely over the division of assets {{in the event of}} insolvency, and, more generally, cannot write contracts with a full menu of state-contingent payments. In this environment, insureds have different levels of exposure to an insurer's default. When contracting constraints limit the insurer's ability to smooth out such differences, catastrophe bonds can be used to deliver coverage to those most exposed to default. We demonstrate how catastrophe bonds can improve welfare in this way by mitigating differences in default exposure, which arise with: (1) contractual incompleteness, and (2) heterogeneity among insureds, which undermines the efficiency of the mechanical pro rata division of assets that takes place in the event of insurer insolvency. ...|$|E

The extent of non-contributory periods considered in the pension system represents one of the theoretical possibilities of parametric changes to the pension insurance system. The amount of non-contributory periods or the proportion between non-contributory periods and years worked, or the proportion between paid insurance and non-contributory periods (potential loss of insurance contributions) has, to date, merely been estimated in the Czech Republic. The study presents the first accurate figures, based on unique individual data on insured persons.

The selection of the discourse is always crucial, as it has important implications for the social policy pursued, including its institutional arrangements. The paper advocates that social policy, as a whole, can fundamentally be based on a general insurance discourse, thus providing an understanding of social security that differs from approaches based on social assistance and mere income redistribution. It is also claimed that this approach, emphasizing a risk-centred concept of social security and a well-established legal, actuarial and institutional framework, is capable of dealing with the various pressures on social security created by globalization.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} German miners' model of mutual {{insurance}} from its introduction in 1854 to its basic reformation in 1923. Its core feature was {{the provision of}} cash benefits for compensation of income losses due to temporary sickness and permanent invalidity or death of the bread-winner. The carriers of the insurance scheme, the Knappschaften, date back to medieval times, and the Knappschaft is still present today as the second pillar of the German statutory old-age insurance. This paper aims to establish the Knappschaft insurance's main characteristics in the period under consideration. These include, for example, compulsory membership, shared financing between employed miners and entrepreneurs, selfmanagement, financing based on earnings-related social insurance contributions, a strong emphasis of the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle,</b> and application of the pay-as-you-go mechanism. The organisational analysis is complemented quantitatively, on the one hand, by evidence on increasing generosity and, on the other hand, evidence on increasing financial distress substantiating the shadow side of a maturing pay-as-you-go based scheme. In particular, Knappschaften experienced all trends we commonly associate with today's systems {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century as early as in the 19 th century, even before the Bismarckian insurance was installed from 1883 on: Increasing social security spending, rising pensioners-tocontributors ratios, concentration and pressure on finances forcing Knappschaften to adjust their fiscal policy according to the mechanics of pay-as-you-go.

30|$|This article enters {{these debates}} by {{analyzing}} policy shifts in two core programs: old-age pensions and health care. Both programs are prototypes of Bismarckian/conservative program design, and both systems have experienced tremendous cost pressures because of demographic change and rising non-wage labor costs (Häusermann 2010). The article makes three central claims. First, reforms have indeed brought about significant change, {{but the basic}} structures and redistributional profile of the German welfare state nevertheless remain intact. A series of reforms has reduced benefit generosity, and have aimed to change the governance structures of both pension and health care programs. The introduction of voluntary private pension provision (the Riesterrente) in 2001 and the Health Care Fund (Gesundheitsfonds) in 2009, in particular, {{should be seen as}} reforms that reconfigure the incentives both to the insured and to providers. Although political compromises watered down these reforms, they introduce changes in pension and health care financing that may serve as institutional templates for future reforms. At the same time, however, key conservative principles concerning benefit entitlement and financing remain largely intact. In both programs, derived rights based on family status remain strong. Similarly, occupational fragmentation continues to characterize the overall structure of both systems. Weak attempts to incorporate all income-earners (wage-earners, tenured civil servants, and self-employed professionals) into one universal scheme have been notable failures. Thus, the liberalization of health care and pension provision has not seriously challenged the occupational fragmentation and breadwinner orientation of social policy. In the field of pensions, however, 3 decades of reform have significantly weakened the <b>insurance</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E
