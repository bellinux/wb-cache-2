25|$|Unemployment in India is characterised by chronic (disguised) unemployment. Government {{schemes that}} target {{eradication}} of both poverty and unemployment – which {{in recent decades}} has sent millions of poor and unskilled people into urban areas in search of livelihoods – attempt {{to solve the problem}} by providing financial assistance for starting businesses, honing skills, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decline in organised employment, due to the decreased role of the public sector after liberalisation, has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and created political pressure for further reforms. India's labour regulations are heavy, even by developing country standards, and analysts have urged the government to abolish or modify them {{in order to make the}} environment more conducive for <b>employment</b> <b>generation.</b> The 11th five-year plan has also identified the need for a congenial environment to be created for <b>employment</b> <b>generation,</b> by reducing the number of permissions and other bureaucratic clearances required. Inequalities and inadequacies in the education system have been identified as an obstacle, which prevents the benefits of increased employment opportunities from reaching all sectors of society.|$|E

Low human development indicators among local Khuzestanis are contrasted with the wealth generation of the local oil industry. Minority rights are frequently identified with strategic concerns, with ethnic unrest perceived by the Iranian government as being generated by foreign governments to undermine the country's oil industry and its internal stability. The politics of Khuzestan therefore have international significance and go beyond the realm of electoral politics.|$|E

The Philippines is also considered as a location of choice due to its many outsourcing benefits such as less expensive operational and labor costs, the high proficiency in spoken English of a significant number of its people, and a highly educated labor pool. In 2011, the business process outsourcing industry in the Philippines generated 700 thousand jobs and some US$11 billion in revenue, 24 percent higher than 2010.

25|$|Industry {{accounts}} for 26% of GDP and employs 22% {{of the total}} workforce. According to the World Bank, India's industrial manufacturing GDP output in 2015 was 6th {{largest in the world}} on current US dollar basis ($559 billion), and 9th largest on inflation-adjusted constant 2005 US dollar basis ($197.1 billion). The industrial sector underwent significant changes due to the 1991 economic reforms, which removed import restrictions, brought in foreign competition, led to the privatisation of certain government-owned public-sector industries, liberalised the foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, improved infrastructure and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector was faced with increasing domestic and foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, and relying on cheap labour and new technology. However, this has also reduced <b>employment</b> <b>generation,</b> even among smaller manufacturers who previously relied on labour-intensive processes.|$|E

40|$|Based on two {{snapshots}} {{from the}} Australian economy,this study quantifies {{the impacts of}} final demand aggregates on output and employment in various sectors using the 1989 and 1997 conversions matrices. The sectoral output and employment are linked with final demand deliveries on {{such a way that}} one can measure the impacts on changes in each component of aggregate demand, other components remaining unchanged, on output and employment. A comparison of the aggregate output and employment multipliers in 1989 to 1997 indicates that while the output multipliers have increased, the employment multipliers have declined. This means that through time, due to rising labour productivity, the various components of aggregate demand would need to grow at a faster rate in order to achieve a certain employment growth. It was also found that almost all employment generated between 1989 to 1997 was in three service industries, namely community, social and personal service; whole sale retail; restaurants and property: and business services. These are industries that are lest likely to have benefited from the productivity gains and resulted from the microeconomics reforms that characterised the Australian economy during this period. On a relative basis, a rise in various components of aggregate final demand can lead to a higher <b>employment</b> <b>generations</b> in these three industries...|$|R
