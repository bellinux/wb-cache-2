25|$|Perfume oils {{are often}} diluted with a solvent, {{though this is}} not always the case, and its {{necessity}} is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is an alcohol solution typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a rectified spirit. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated coconut oil, or liquid waxes such as <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

50|$|Jojoba esters are proper waxes; {{there is}} no {{triglyceride}} component of jojoba esters.Chemically, jojoba esters are a complex mixture of long chain (C36-C46) fatty acids and fatty alcohols joined by an ester bond. Jojoba esters are produced by the interesterification of <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil,</b> hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil,</b> or a mixture of the two. Pure <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> and pure hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> are also correctly described as jojoba esters. The CTFA does not regard partially-hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> as jojoba esters. For this reason, jojoba esters must not contain any trans-unsaturation. Jojoba esters' chemical structure {{is very similar to}} that of human sebum and of whale oil.|$|E
40|$|Microencapsulation is a {{technique}} that allows liquid or solid agents, such as pharmaceutical agents, pesticides, insect repellent agents, dyes, cosmetics and fragrances, to be encapsulated by a suitable barrier wall. Liquid or solid agents that are encapsulated are called core material. The importance of functional finishes have been increasing rapidly in the World. Microencapsulation is an alternative way to achieve the functional finishes because of their unique properties, such as controlled release, protection against to hazardous and destructive media, and providing higher surface area. In this study, jojoba, jasmine and St. John's Wort oils, were encapsulated according to spray drying method. St. John's Wort and <b>jojoba</b> <b>oils</b> were used at 1 : 1 ratio as fixed oil. Jasmine essential oil was added to fixed oil mixture at two different ratios. After preparing the core mixture, encapsulation studies were performed three different core : wall ratios. Morphological analyses of microcapsules were carried out using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). FTIR spectroscopy spectrums of microcapsules were determined (Fourier Transform Infrared). Particle size distribution microcapsules were analyzed by laser scattering measurement method. DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) thermographs of microcapsules were obtained. All microcapsules were applied to 100 % cotton knitted fabrics. Strength to washing of fabrics were observed by SEM micrographs...|$|R

50|$|Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> is a hard, {{crystalline}} wax ester. The {{melting point}} is 68-70 °C and the iodine value is < 2.0, {{making it one of}} the very few commercially available, high-melting-point wax esters of botanical origin. Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> is relatively colourless and odourless. Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> contains no trans isomers.|$|E
50|$|Unrefined <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> {{appears as}} a clear golden liquid at room {{temperature}} with a slightly nutty odor. Refined <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> is colorless and odorless. The melting point of <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> is approximately 10 °C and the iodine value is approximately 80. <b>Jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> is relatively shelf-stable when compared with other vegetable oils mainly because it contains little triglycerides, unlike most other vegetable oils such as grape seed oil and coconut oil. It has an oxidative stability index of approximately 60, which means {{that it is more}} shelf-stable than safflower oil, canola oil, almond oil or squalene but less than castor oil and coconut oil.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{analysis was}} done using a four-stroke, single cylinder, constant speed, water-cooled diesel engine, which was interfaced with Engine software. Performance and emission characteristics were evaluated for three non-edible vegetable oils, i. e. thumba, <b>jojoba,</b> neem <b>oil,</b> {{as well as}} jojoba methyl ester, to study the effect of injection pressure at 205, 220, 240 and 260 bar with a variation in injection timing at 23 °bTDC and 28 °bTDC. The performance of jojoba methyl ester improved {{with an increase in}} injection pressure. A maximum brake thermal efficiency of 29. 72 % was obtained with lower emissions compared to the other vegetable oils; this might be explained by low viscosity and better combustion. Further investigations were carried out with a new lubricant, SAE 5 W- 30, which improved the performance of the CI engine by 1. 59 %. All of the abovementioned investigations were fruitful and these results are expected to lead to substantial contributions {{in the development of a}} viable vegetable oil engine...|$|R

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Universidad del Bío-Bío {{and can be}} found at: [URL] potential effects of plant derived oils on survival of dampwood termite (Zootermopsis augusticollis) workers was explored on western white pine sapwood blocks. All of the oils rapidly affected protozoa in the hindgut of termite workers and protozoa loss was closely followed by worker mortality. The effects were most rapid with wood treated with Neem, Eucalyptus or Jatropha oils, but mortality also occurred within 7 days with workers exposed to blocks treated with <b>Jojoba</b> or linseed <b>oil.</b> The results illustrate the relatively high sensitivity of dampwood termites to these types of treatment and suggest the potential for natural product control of this termite species...|$|R
40|$|World {{chemical}} and energy supplies for industry are today {{highly dependent on}} unsustainable fossil reserves. Vegetable lipids with similar chemical structures to fossil oil could be the ultimate renewable solution to replace fossil oil and provide environmentally friendly feedstocks and energy resources. Wax esters and triacylglycerols (TAG) are two groups of lipid with applications in industry as lubricants, surfactants and biodiesel. However, global production of wax esters and TAG {{is limited to a}} few crop species such as <b>jojoba,</b> carnauba, <b>oil</b> palm, soybean and rapeseed. Further, there are restrictions on arable land for oilseed crop growth, and the demand for vegetable lipids is predicted to increase in coming decades. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish sustainable technologies and develop new alternative oil crop species to meet an expected future vegetable lipid demand. This thesis examined the potential for production of wax esters and TAG with different qualities in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves, and in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm by metabolic engineering. In tobacco leaves, a new metabolic pathway was introduced into chloroplasts by combining bacterial- and plant-derived genes (AtFAR 6, AtPES 2, MaFAR, MhWS, tpMaFAR::MhWS, AtWRI 1) for wax ester biosynthesis. Combinations of the gene functions resulted in production of wax esters with differing composition to a level of 0. 9...|$|R
50|$|Its use as {{biodiesel}} fuel {{is becoming}} more and more important. <b>Jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> consists of long straight monoesters of 22 to 44 carbon atoms (as opposed to most vegetable oils which consist of triglycerides), which makes it comparable to diesel in terms of energy density. The pretreatment of <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> for the use of biofuel is simpler compared to that of other mineral and bio-oils and it is expected that combustion of <b>jojoba</b> <b>oil</b> leads to smaller NOx-emissions compared to diesel and does not lead to any SOx emissions.|$|E
