5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued to plow and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E

25|$|The Orissa Gazette of 1956 {{mentions}} some occasions {{where the}} devadasis danced. They had two daily rituals. The Bahar Gaaunis would {{dance at the}} Sakaala Dhupa. Lord Jagannath, after breakfast, would give Darshan to the bhaktas (the devotees). In the Main hall, a devadasi accompanied by musicians and the Rajguru, the court guru, would dance, standing near the Garuda sthambha (pillar). This dance could be watched by the audience. They would perform only pure dance here. The Bhitar Gaunis would sing at the Badashringhar, the main ceremony for ornamenting and dressing the God. Lord Jagannath, at bedtime, would be first served by male Sebaets- they would fan Him and decorate Him with flowers. After they would leave, a Bhitar Gaauni would then enter the room, stand near the door (Jaya Vijay) and sing Gita Govinda songs, and perhaps perform a ritualistic dance. After a while, she would come out and announce that the Lord has <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and then the guard would close the main gate.|$|E

25|$|In {{her junior}} year, Krieger made 20 {{appearances}} for Penn State, ten of those appearances being in conference matches. She made seven {{goals in the}} season, which tied for second in the season at Penn State. Three of those goals were game winning goals. Penn State was the 2004 Big Ten Conference regular season champion and was No.1 seed in the Big Ten Women's Soccer Tournament. They {{made it to the}} quarterfinals of the tournament, when they were defeated by Michigan on November 3. Penn State earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed ever. However, two days before the tournament, Krieger broke her leg while playing against a men's soccer team in preparation for the tournament. The injury required surgery, where they inserted a plate and five screws in her leg. A few months later in January, after traveling to visit her family, Krieger began experiencing shortness of breath and checked into the hospital as a precaution. As a result of her broken leg and subsequent plane rides, she had developed blood clots in her legs that traveled up to her lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism, affecting her blood flow and triggering multiple mini-heart attacks. The doctor informed her that if she had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> that night, there as a high probability that she would not have woken up. She was required to do a series of self-injections of enoxaparin for several months, but eventually made a full recovery and joined the Nittany Lions for her senior season. At the end of her shortened 2004 season, Krieger was given NSCAA All-America First Team honors, NSCAA All-Mid-Atlantic Region First Team honors, All-Big Ten First Team honors, and Academic All-Big Ten honors.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{many other}} Thanhouser productions, no {{details on the}} {{director}} or cast are cited by Q. David Bowers. Prompt Payment was likely shot at the Thanhouser Studio in New Rochelle, New York and Stealing a Ride was likely shot in the surrounding area. Identification of the cast for Prompt Payment may be possible due to a surviving film still {{that was used in}} a Thanhouser advertisement. Both films are listed as comedies, despite the more serious nature and dramatic element of two children being lost in the woods during the winter. A detail in a review from The New York Dramatic Mirror states that the children are tracked [...] "to shelter behind some rocks, where the boy had built a fire by which the little girl had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> After reaching home each youngster was spanked, but the punishment was eased by hearty kisses."

He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds {{clashed with}} Maj. Gen. Hooker, his {{predecessor}} at I Corps, but {{by this time}} the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker's nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat.

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less.

Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship.

It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover.
