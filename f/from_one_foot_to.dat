5000|$|The knee raise {{exercise}} {{will work}} the lower abdominals, {{and can also}} work the obliques (see abdominal external oblique muscle and abdominal internal oblique muscle) if one twists the torso during the exercise. This version of the knee raise has been praised by fitness communities for its effectiveness as working the abdominal muscles. Previous {{research has shown that}} a captain's chair knee raise will elicit a greater electromyography (EMG) response than the standard crunch. This means that the knee raise in the captain's chair will have more activation in the muscle than the standard crunch. However, 2013 research has shown that it has the same EMG activity as the standard crunch. This newer research is yet to be published. One aspect that both research agree on {{is that there is no}} difference in activation of upper rectus abdominis and lower rectus abdominis as it is speculated that the muscle acts as one and cannot be differentiated.

2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> the other to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E

40|$|Robots on the NASA {{space station}} have a {{potential}} range of applications from assisting astronauts during EVA (extravehicular activity), to replacing astronauts {{in the performance}} of simple, dangerous, and tedious tasks; and to performing routine tasks such as inspections of structures and utilities. To provide a vehicle for demonstrating the pertinent technologies, a simple robot is being developed for locomotion and basic manipulation on the proposed space station. In addition to the robot, an experimental testbed was developed, including a 1 / 3 scale (1. 67 meter modules) truss and a gravity compensation system to simulate a zero-gravity environment. The robot comprises two flexible links connected by a rotary joint, with a 2 degree of freedom wrist joints and grippers at each end. The grippers screw into threaded holes in the nodes of the space station truss, and enable it to walk by alternately shifting the base of support <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> (gripper) <b>to</b> the other. Present efforts are focused on mechanical design, application of sensors, and development of control algorithms for lightweight, flexible structures. Long-range research will emphasize development of human interfaces to permit a range of control modes from teleoperated to semiautonomous, and coordination of robot/astronaut and multiple-robot teams...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{of visual}} {{perception}} {{have long been}} interested in surfaces. Most psychologists {{have been interested in}} the perceived slant of a surface and in the gradients that purportedly specify it. Slant is the angle between the line of sight and the tangent to the planar surface at any point, also called the surface normal. Gradients are the sources of information that grade, or change, with visual angle as <b>one</b> looks <b>from</b> <b>one's</b> <b>feet</b> upward <b>to</b> the horizon. The present article explores three gradients—perspective, compression, and density— and the phenomenal impression of flat and curved surfaces. The perspective gradient is measured at right angles to the axis of tilt at any point in the optic array; that is, when looking down a hallway at the tiles of a floor receding in the distance, perspective is measured by the x-axis width of each tile projected on the image plane orthogonal to the line of sight. The compression gradient is the ratio of y/x axis measures on the projected plane. The density gradient is measured by the number of tiles per unit solid visual angle. For flat surfaces and many others, perspective and compression gradients decrease with distance, and the density gradient increases. We discuss the manner in which these gradients change for various types of surfaces. Each gradient is founded o...|$|R

I was hungry, and, furthermore, a committee of public safety had just been organized to rid the town of just such hungry mortals as I.

40|$|Adult-Acquired Flatfoot is a {{degenerative}} {{condition in}} which the ligaments and tendons supporting the arch deteriorate eventually leading to arch collapse. This deterioration can occur at various locations along the arch creating {{a number of different}} patterns of collapse. Surgical treatment for adult acquired flatfoot consists of a combination of various osteotomies. Although general guidelines exist, there is no systematic way to determine which combination of osteotomies should be used to correct a given foot deformity. Computer simulation with finite element analysis might provide an analytical tool to optimize the choice of osteotomy location and size. By dividing a complex problem into simpler components, finite element analysis allows for the solution of complex problems by solving a large set of simple equations. Finite element analysis has previously been used to study effects of diabetes, shoe design, and gait analysis in the foot. These studies have oversimplified geometry and material properties of foot tissues which limits the true mechanical behavior. The goal {{of this study was to}} create an anatomically and physiologically correct finite element model of the <b>foot</b> and ankle. <b>To</b> create a healthy foot model, CT scans were collected <b>from</b> <b>one</b> cadaver <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> create a three-dimensional cortical bone model in 3 D Slicer software. The cortical bone model was imported into SolidWorks to create the geometry for trabecular bone, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Journal articles, textbooks, and other resources were used in order to create realistic cartilage, ligament, and tendon models (Netter & Colacino, 1997; see also Boss & Hintermann, 2002; Campbell et al., Apr. 2014; Golanó et al., 2010; Mahadevan). Final approval of the model’s geometry was obtained from the orthopaedic surgeon supervising this study. After completing the anatomically correct geometry of the foot, it was imported into finite element software (ANSYS, [URL] The model was meshed with solid elements only: tetrahedral elements for the foot and hexahedral elements for the ground support. Linear elastic material properties were assigned to all bodies. Boundary conditions and contacts were created including a fixed ground support and bonded and frictionless contacts. A body weight force was applied to the tibia and tendon forces were applied to simulate loading during midstance. The frictionless contacts created a nonlinear problem that caused the simulation to fail to converge to a solution. Abnormally high stresses and deformation were found in the results. The <b>foot</b> model failed <b>to</b> converge to realistic results because of the current model’s complexity. An anatomically correct foot model was successfully created, but simplifications need to be made to the model in the future for convergence. Recommendations for simplification include modeling ligaments as truss elements, adding spring elements to tendons, and adding soft tissue or fat pads to the model. After simplifications are completed and realistic results are obtained, Flatfoot conditions and surgeries can be simulated and analyzed...|$|R
