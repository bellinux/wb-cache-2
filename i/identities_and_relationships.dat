2500|$|In general, a world {{citizen is}} a person who places global {{citizenship}} above any nationalistic or local <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships.</b> An early expression of this value is found in Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 B.C.; mentioned above), the founding father of the Cynic movement in Ancient Greece. [...] Of Diogenes it is said: [...] "Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitês)'". This was a ground-breaking concept because the broadest basis of social identity in Greece at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Tamil poet Kaniyan Poongundran wrote in Purananuru, [...] "To us all towns are one, all men our kin." [...] In later years, political philosopher Thomas Paine would declare, [...] "my country is the world, and my religion is to do good." [...] Today, the increase in worldwide globalization has {{led to the formation of}} a [...] "world citizen" [...] social movement under a proposed world government. In a non-political definition, it has been suggested that a world citizen may provide value to society by using knowledge acquired across cultural contexts.|$|E

5000|$|A gender {{script is}} a concept in feminist studies of science and {{technology}} and refers to how designers' ideas about gendered <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> translate into the design and use of technical artifacts. It comes from science and technology scholar Steve Woolgar's notion of [...] "configuring the user", where designers and advertisers struggle to define, enable, and constrain users in particular ways. It also comes from science and technology scholar Madeline Akrich's concept of [...] "script", which illustrates how designers ideas about users influence development, and how that use shapes users' environments.|$|E

40|$|Sibling <b>Identity</b> <b>and</b> <b>Relationships</b> {{explores the}} special place that {{siblings}} occupy {{in the lives}} of children and young people, providing new insights into sibling <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships.</b> Drawing on social constructionist and psychodynamic perspectives, it discusses who constitutes a sibling, emotional connections and separations, conflict and aggression and how siblings construct <b>and</b> conduct their <b>relationship</b> out of the home, at school and in local communities. Shedding light on broader debates about social and psychic divisions in wider society, this book explores the ways that siblings are important for children and young people’s social and emotional sense of self in relation to others. Reviewing current literature on sibling relationships as well as proposing alternative theoretical perspectives, Sibling <b>Identity</b> <b>and</b> <b>Relationships</b> will be a valuable resource to academics and students of childhood studies and social work as well as health and social care professionals...|$|R
40|$|Dance is a {{potential}} asset for peacebuilding, creating opportunities for nonverbal, embodied learning, exploring <b>identity,</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships.</b> Peace scholars consider <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> to the ‘other’ as key components in transforming conflict. Focusing on {{a case study in}} Mindanao, the Philippines, this paper explores the potential of dance in a peacebuilding context through embodied <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships.</b> In Mindanao, deep-seated cultural prejudices contribute to ongoing conflict entwined with identity. The permeable membrane (Cohen, Gutiérrez & Walker, 2011) is the organising framework describing the constant interaction between artists, facilitators, participants, and communities. It expands peace scholar John Paul Lederach’s concept of the moral imagination, requiring the capacity to envisage one’s self within a web of relationships. In this paper multiple methods of qualitative research including personal interviews are used to further the discussion regarding dance’s potential to diversify the nonverbal tools available for peacebuilding...|$|R

After this date, we know nothing more about Saint Evrard until his Testimony, a very interesting/curious/strange document, whose authenticity is certain and {{in which we are}} given information on the life of Saint Evrard. This Testimony was made in Italy, at Musiestro Castle, in the county of Trévise, in 867. Evrard and his consort meticulously recorded not only their lands and possessions within a prepared will, but the <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> of family members and neighboring royals. With the agreement of his spouse, Princess Gisèle, Saint Evrard portioned his goods among his seven children.|$|E
5000|$|The sexual {{orientation}} {{of a police}} officer can also influence the experiences of that officer. Women with non-hetero{{sexual orientation}}s deal with an additional set of stereotypes, exclusion, and harassment. Galvin-White and O'Neil (2015) recently examined how lesbian police officers negotiate their <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> in the workplace. As they note, lesbian police officers must negotiate an identity that is [...] "invisible" [...] {{in that it is}} not necessarily detected by sight. Therefore, it is largely up to the individual {{to decide whether or not}} they come out to her colleagues. Many decide not to come out due to the stigmas surrounding LGBT identities, which may manifest themselves through discriminatory hiring processes and promotions. Galvin-White and O'Neil demonstrate that the decision to come out varies by individual and across the profession. The most salient factor influencing an individual's decision to come out is the extent of homophobia in the work environment.|$|E
50|$|Queer theory's {{emergence}} in the 1990s {{built upon}} certain principles of lesbian feminism, including {{the critique of}} compulsory heterosexuality, the understanding of gender as defined in part by heterosexuality, and the understanding of sexuality as institutional instead of personal. Despite this, queer theory is largely set in opposition to lesbian feminism. Lesbian feminism is traditionally critical of S&M, butch/femme <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships,</b> transgenderism and transsexuality, pornography, and prostitution, whereas queer theory tends to embrace them. Queer theorists have critiqued lesbian feminism as having an essentialist understanding of gender that runs counter to their stated aims, and subsequently embrace gender fluidity. Lesbian feminists have critiqued queer theory as implicitly male-oriented, and a recreation of the male-oriented Gay Liberation Front that lesbian feminists initially sought refuge from; queer theorists have countered {{by pointing out that}} the majority of the most prominent queer theorists are feminists, and many (including Judith Butler, Judith Halberstam, and Gayle Rubin) are lesbians.|$|E

50|$|The poststructualist part of FPDA views {{language}} as social practice and considers that people's <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> are 'performed' through spoken interaction. FPDA analyses {{the ways in}} which speakers are 'positioned' by different and often competing 'discourses' according to Michel Foucault's (1972: 49) definition as 'practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak'. According to this, speakers constantly move between powerful and powerless 'subject positions' as they talk and interact. FPDA is influenced by a poststructuralist rather than a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) perspective: that is, the method is informed by the view that no speaker is wholly a victim and powerless, nor wholly dominant and powerful. Rather, speakers are constantly shifting their subject positions according to the interplay of discourses within specific settings. The feminist part of FPDA considers gender difference to be a dominant discourse among competing discourses when analysing all types of text. According to Baxter (2003), FPDA does not have an 'emancipatory' agenda for women but a 'transformative' one. This means that it aims to represent women's voices that have been 'silenced' or marginalised since FPDA considers that these have been historically absent in many cultures. For example, Kamada (2008a; 2008b and 2010) uses FPDA to show how a friendship group of half-Japanese girls, who are seen by their culture as 'less than whole', draw upon competing discourses to negotiate more positive versions of their 'hybrid' ethnic and gender identities.|$|E
