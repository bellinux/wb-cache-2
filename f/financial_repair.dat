40|$|Stability Report, {{risks to}} global {{financial}} stability have increased (Figures 1. 2 and 1. 3), signaling a partial reversal in progress {{made over the}} past three years. The pace of the economic recovery has slowed, stalling progress in balance sheet repair in many advanced economies. Sovereign stress in the euro area has spilled over to banking systems, pushing up credit and market risks. Low interest rates could lead to excesses as the “search for yield ” exacerbates the turn in the credit cycle, especially in emerging markets. Recent market turmoil suggests that investors are losing patience with the lack of momentum on <b>financial</b> <b>repair</b> and reform (Box 1. 1). Policymakers need to accelerate actions to address longstanding financial weaknesses to ensure stability. Overall macroeconomic risks have increased, reflecting a significant rise in sovereign vulnerabilities in advanced economies. The World Economic Outlook (WEO) baseline has shifted downward since April 2011, as the recovery appears more fragile. Weaker growth prospects and higher downside risks have contributed to concerns about debt sustainability, especially in the euro area periphery. Downgrades in sovereign ratings have sprea...|$|E

We argue that the impact of this distortion should not be high (see the Appendix B for a detailed explanation for this affirmation).

40|$|Until {{households}} and <b>financial</b> institutions <b>repair</b> their balance sheets, recovery in many advanced economies will be halting GOING down a mountain is usually easier than going up. But finance {{seems to work}} differently from the law of gravity. Reducing debt, that is, “deleveraging, ” {{has proven to be}} a much harder slog than the climb up the debt mountain. This is why balance sheet recessions, like the one many advanced economies recently suffered, are much worse than recessions in which balance sheets are not overloaded with unsustainable debts (see “Tracking the Global Recovery ” in this issue of F&D). Until financial institutions, households, and governments in advanced economies return their balance sheets to sustainable levels of assets and debt, recovery from the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930 s will be retarded. At issue is why deleveraging is so hard, what governments can do to help, how far the world has come in shedding debt, and what policies for the future are best. Origins of the crisis Most financial crises involve too much borrowing. Who does the excess borrowing, though, varies. In the past, it was often governments or corporations that borrowed too much. Before the recent crisis, it was financial institutions and households in advanced economies, as well as some governments, that took on too much debt. Financial corporations in some key advanced economies registered the sharpest increase in debt. Before the crisis, their balance sheets multiplied relative to the total size of their underlying economies (see Chart 1, top panel). The debt-toequity ratio (leverage) of financial institutions also often ros...|$|R

In some cases, appropriate maintenance of plant equipment and machinery reduces the tendencies of injuries to personnel in the job floor. But before the maintenance process can be carried out, proper and effective work order planning and scheduling must be in place in other to achieve the set goals and objectives of a maintenance shop. Brief reviews of common planning tools which include the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) are presented.
