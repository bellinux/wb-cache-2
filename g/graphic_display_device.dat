50|$|A {{trade show}} display is a <b>graphic</b> <b>display</b> <b>device</b> {{designed}} to be used at a trade fair or trade show. These may include table top displays, banner stands, pop up displays, flat panels displays, and other paraphernalia used to fill a temporary stall or booth at a trade fair or convention. The displays vary greatly in size, cost and complexity, but all are designed to visually represent a specific interest of the company. Trade show displays use bold images and catch phrases, {{in an attempt to}} attract visitors to their exhibit space, so that sales representatives can give a sales pitch or hand out brochures.|$|E
50|$|A {{volumetric}} display device is a <b>graphic</b> <b>display</b> <b>device</b> that forms a visual representation {{of an object}} in three physical dimensions, {{as opposed to the}} planar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of different visual effects. One definition offered by pioneers in the field is that {{volumetric display}}s create 3D imagery via the emission, scattering, or relaying of illumination from well-defined regions in (x,y,z) space. Though there is no consensus among researchers in the field, it may be reasonable to admit holographic and highly multiview displays to the volumetric display family if they do a reasonable job of projecting a three-dimensional light field within a volume.|$|E
50|$|Users {{generally}} operated RT-11 via {{a printing}} terminal or a video terminal, originally via a strap-selectable current-loop (for conventional teletypes) or RS-232 (later RS-422 as well) interface {{on one of}} the CPU cards; DEC also supported the VT11 and VS60 <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> (vector <b>graphics</b> terminals with a graphic character generator for displaying text, and a light pen for graphical input). A third-party favorite was the Tektronix 4010 family.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of QFX had no brushes; {{the program was}} used for image processing and color correction, rather than image creation, providing basic filters (blur, noise, glow etc.) that were a collection of MS-DOS programs that could be run from the command line and included in batch files. This functionality continued with all Targa and Vista {{versions of}} the program, and allowed operation on images with a resolution far greater than the <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>device.</b> Later Windows releases introduced an internal scripting facility that pre-dated Photoshop's actions by many years. The early version ran on both Intel and DEC Alpha processors.|$|R
50|$|Electrically {{operated}} <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> {{have developed}} from electromechanical systems for display of text, up to all-electronic devices capable of full-motion 3D color <b>graphic</b> <b>displays.</b> Electromagnetic <b>devices,</b> using a solenoid coil {{to control a}} visible flag or flap, were the earliest type, and were used for text displays such as stock market prices and arrival/departure display times. The cathode ray tube was the workhorse of text and video display technology for several decades until being displaced by plasma, liquid crystal (LCD) and solid-state devices such as LEDs and OLEDs. With the advent of microprocessors and microelectronic devices, many more individual picture elements ("pixels") could be incorporated into one <b>display</b> <b>device,</b> allowing <b>graphic</b> <b>displays</b> and video.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe growing {{market for}} {{flexible}} electronics devices {{is asking for}} reduction of manufacturing process complexity. One way to reduce complexity is to decrease the number of single components of a device by using integrated modules, i. e. device components providing multiple functions. In this article, {{the concept of a}} self-powered electrochromic <b>graphics</b> <b>display</b> <b>device</b> is demonstrated. The device is based on a three electrode system comprising an electrochromic electrode, a battery anode and a battery cathode, all in contact with a common electrolyte. The electrochromic electrode can be charged and discharged directly when connected to either the anode or cathode. Such a self-powered display integrates the functions of both a display and a battery. As part of a flexible electronics <b>device,</b> a self-powered <b>display</b> would be able to power other components, such as driver electronics...|$|R

The war game was automated by previous thesis students to run on a VAX. VMS computer. The thesis further modified COMEL to eliminate the manual gameboard and totally automate the game using Ramtek <b>graphic</b> <b>display</b> <b>devices.</b> The game has two portions, an Acquisition Phase and an Operations Phase. In the Acquisition Phase, players budget for research and development, manufacturing, purchase and operations and maintenance of communications and electronic equipment for a Joint Task Force (JTF). In the Operations Phase, players allocate the available communications and electronic equipment to unites, physical locations, or special missions and then direct the employment of the units and equipment in a war game.

50|$|Due to {{its origins}} on IBM Selectric-based teleprinters, APL symbols have {{traditionally}} been represented on the wire using a unique, non-standard character set. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices which could reproduce them—the most popular ones being the IBM 2741 and IBM 1050 fitted with a specific APL print head. Over time, with the universal use of high-quality <b>graphic</b> <b>display,</b> printing <b>devices</b> and Unicode support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated.|$|R

25|$|Over time, {{with the}} {{universal}} use of high-quality <b>graphic</b> <b>displays,</b> printing <b>devices</b> and Unicode support, the APL character font problem {{has largely been}} eliminated. However, entering APL characters {{requires the use of}} input method editors, keyboard mappings, virtual/on-screen APL symbol sets, or easy-reference printed keyboard cards which can frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages. With beginners who have no prior experience with other programming languages, a study involving high school students found that typing and using APL characters did not hinder the students in any measurable way.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fact that}} the term [...] "server" [...] {{is applied to the}} {{software}} in front of the user is often surprising to users accustomed to their programs being clients to services on remote computers. Here, rather than a remote database being the resource for a local app, the user's <b>graphic</b> <b>display</b> and input <b>devices</b> become resources made available by the local X server to both local and remotely hosted X client programs who need to share the user's graphics and input devices to communicate with the user.|$|R

40|$|Virtual reality, VR, is an {{emerging}} computer interface that strives to make simulations so realistic that users believe, {{if only for}} a moment, that they are experiencing "the real thing. " Highly realistic and believable simulations are accomplished using high-speed graphics supercomputers, three-dimensional <b>graphics</b> accelerators, head-mounted <b>display</b> <b>devices,</b> wired gloves, spatial audio processing, psychological and cognitive skills and numerous other technologies and techniques [7]. Less realistic though still effective VR is available on modern personal computers. As the speed and capabilities of personal computers rapidly increase, and as the cost of high-performance graphics computers continues to drop, we can expect to see high-quality VR on the average desktop within the next 5 to 10 years. The question then, is “How can we take advantage of this new technology to enhance and improve engineering education, and how can the skills we gain as a result be applied to other areas of engineering? ” In order to answer these questions, work has been conducted at the University of Michigan to develop a series of VR-based educational modules [1 - 2]. This paper will briefly discuss these modules, {{as well as some of}} the things that have been learned during their development, and how educators can download and implement the modules...|$|R

40|$|<b>Graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be of}} {{significant}} aid in accomplishing a teleoperation task throughout all three phases of off-line task analysis and planning, operator training, and online operation. In the first phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> provide substantial aid to investigate work cell layout, motion planning with collision detection and with possible redundancy resolution, and planning for camera views. In the second phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> can serve as very useful tools for introductory training of operators before training them on actual hardware. In the third phase, <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> {{can be used for}} previewing planned motions and monitoring actual motions in any desired viewing angle, or, when communication time delay prevails, for providing predictive graphics overlay on the actual camera view of the remote site to show the non-time-delayed consequences of commanded motions in real time. This paper addresses potential space applications of <b>graphics</b> <b>displays</b> in all three operational phases of advanced teleoperation. Possible applications are illustrated with techniques developed and demonstrated in the Advanced Teleoperation Laboratory at JPL. The examples described include task analysis and planning of a simulated Solar Maximum Satellite Repair task, a novel force-reflecting teleoperation simulator for operator training, and preview and predictive displays for on-line operations...|$|R
