5|$|At the County Route 61 (Farview Avenue) {{interchange}}, {{the road}} regains a third lane in each direction. Route 17 passes by Westfield <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Plaza {{on the west}} side of the road before coming to an interchange with Route 4. Route 17 is flanked by businesses and shopping malls for most of its length in Paramus. Following Route 4, the road interchanges with Century Road. Route 17 comes to a partial interchange with the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway (exit 163), with access limited to northbound-to-northbound and southbound-to-southbound movements between the two roads. North of the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway, Route 17 features interchanges for Midland Avenue, the Paramus Park shopping mall and an industrial park, and County Route 80 (Ridgewood Avenue) just north of the Fashion Center shopping mall.|$|E
5|$|Route 72 {{is a major}} route {{providing}} {{access to}} Long Beach Island, a popular Jersey Shore resort, from Philadelphia via Route 70 and from New York City via the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway. As such, {{the portion of the}} route east of the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway interchange sees congestion during the summer months.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, many {{improvements}} {{have been}} made to the Atlantic City Expressway. A new interchange with County Route 689 on the Gloucester Township/Winslow Township border was completed in 2000 at a cost of $5 million. The Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector was completed on July 31, 2001 to connect the Atlantic City Expressway to the Marina district and Brigantine. In 2005, the Atlantic City Expressway added a third lane in both directions between the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway and Atlantic City and in the eastbound direction between Route 73 and the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway. In addition, the Pleasantville Toll Plaza was reconstructed, replacing the older cash booths with newer technology.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, a limited-access {{toll road}} called the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Thruway was planned along the US 9 {{alignment}} between Toms River and Woodbridge. This freeway {{was intended to}} serve all vehicles and provide a shortcut to the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway and US 9 through central New Jersey but was never built. In the early 1970s, another plan surfaced for a US 9 freeway from Route 34 in Madison Township (now Old Bridge Township) north to Route 35 in Sayreville. The freeway, which was to cost $17 million, was not built due to financial problems. A freeway was also proposed for US 9 in Atlantic County in the late 1960s, running from the proposed Route 60 freeway in Somers Point to CR 575 in Smithville. This freeway, which was to cost $35 million and intended to alleviate traffic on the current US 9 and the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway, was also never built due to financial and environmental issues.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the portion}} between Route47 in Port Elizabeth and the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway in Middle Township was {{canceled}} in 1975 {{due to the}} impact the highway {{would have on the}} surrounding environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{concurrent}} US 9 and Route 35 head northwest on a four-lane {{divided highway}} through commercial areas and woodland, crossing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations before turning north and interchanging with Raritan Street and Kearney Road, crossing back into Sayreville at the interchange with the former. At this point, the road widens to six lanes. The two routes split at an interchange (the former Victory Circle) that {{has access to}} the southbound <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway and from the northbound Parkway by way of Chevalier Avenue. From here, US 9 closely parallels {{the east side of the}} <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway as it crosses the Raritan River on the Edison Bridge, with the parkway crossing the river on the Driscoll Bridge. Upon crossing the Raritan River, US 9 enters Woodbridge Township, where it reaches a complex interchange with the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway, Route 440, and CR 656. Within this interchange, the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway’s travel lanes run in between the travel lanes of US 9, with this configuration continuing past the interchange for a short distance. Along this stretch, there are ramps to and from CR 616 and to the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95).|$|E
5|$|This river {{crossing}} takes the two roads into Bass River Township, Burlington County, where US 9 merges off the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway. The route heads northwest onto two-lane undivided New York Road through woods, intersecting the northern terminus {{of the northern}} segment of Route 167. At this point, the route turns north and comes to a junction with CR 542. US 9 turns east into residential New Gretna before crossing under the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway without an interchange and passing over the marshy Bass River. This section runs along {{the eastern edge of}} the heavily forested Pine Barrens, with occasional areas of development.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway {{started in}} the summer of 1962. The design was to feature a 300- to 400-foot-wide roadway with 12-foot-wide travel lanes and right {{shoulders}} as well as 3-foot-wide left shoulders. The portion between Route 42 in Turnersville and the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway in Egg Harbor Township was completed on July 31, 1964, and the portion between the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway and Atlantic City was finished in July 1965. Construction of the Atlantic City Expressway cost a total of $48.2 million. Tolls on the Atlantic City Expressway initially cost $0.75 at the Egg Harbor toll plaza and $0.15 at the Pleasantville toll plaza. In 1991, the South Jersey Transportation Authority was created by the New Jersey Legislature to operate the Atlantic City Expressway, the Atlantic City International Airport, and operations of the Atlantic County Transportation Authority.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} the North Branch Metedeconk River, I-195 continues into Howell Township, Monmouth County and turns northeast, reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 9. At this point, the road turns east again and soon heads back into dense woods, passing over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line. After {{crossing the}} Manasquan River, the expressway interchanges with CR 547, which {{provides access to}} CR 524 and CR 549. Shortly after CR 547, I-195 enters Wall Township and passes through Allaire State Park. The eastern end of I-195 is located at Exit 35, its junction with Route 34 that {{has access to the}} southbound <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway from the eastbound direction. At the exit for Route 34, I-195 ends and Route 138 begins, but the highway and exit numbering continue onto Route 138, marking the interchange with the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway as Exit 36. Past this interchange, Route 138 continues east to Belmar on the Jersey Shore as an arterial boulevard, making connections with Route 18 and Route 35.|$|E
5|$|After the split, US 46 {{turns into}} a limited-access road again and passes under Main Avenue/CR 601 and former Erie Railway tracks before coming to an {{interchange}} with the northern terminus of Route 21. From this interchange, the route turns north along {{the west bank of}} the Passaic River, crossing the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway again before widening to six lanes and meeting the southern terminus of Route 20 at an interchange near the border of Paterson.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, US 9 {{had been}} {{extended}} south on Route 4 to Cape May and rerouted to current Route 4 between Lakewood and South Amboy. In addition, the route {{was moved to}} its current alignment between South Amboy and Jersey City, following Route 35 and Route 25, and routed to cross the Hudson River on the George Washington Bridge, using a part of Route 6. The state highway concurrencies were removed in 1953 and two realignments occurred to the route {{as a result of}} the construction of the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway in the 1950s. In the 1970s, US 9 was extended across the Cape May–Lewes Ferry to continue into Delaware with the former route into Cape May becoming Route 109. Also around this time, two freeways were proposed for US 9 in Atlantic and Monmouth counties, but never built. The Beesley's Point Bridge over Great Egg Harbor Bay was closed in 2004, with US 9 rerouted to use the Great Egg Harbor Bridge along the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway.|$|E

5|$|Due to the area's vacationers, many {{of which}} come from New York and Northern New Jersey, Route 37 is {{routinely}} congested with seasonal traffic in the summer, especially on and around the Mathis and Tunney Bridges and at the <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway interchange as heavy tourist traffic converges on the shore. Additionally, the road sees congestion due to the area's rapid growth in commercial development.|$|E
5|$|NY45 runs {{parallel}} to the {{small portion of the}} <b>Garden</b> <b>State</b> Parkway (GSP) that enters New York. Officially this portion is considered an extension of the New York State Thruway. While NY45 never intersects the GSP, it provides a link to the parkway. South of the New Jersey border in Bergen County, CR73 intersects the GSP, and in New York, NY45 intersects CR41, which intersects the parkway. Through Chestnut Ridge (where it is known as Chestnut Ridge Road, just as CR73, its southern extension, is in New Jersey), it crosses the New York State Thruway.|$|E
