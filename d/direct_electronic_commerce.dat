If an electronic market is suplimentary used as a meeting place for the offerors and customers, it is an indirect form of e-commerce. In the case of the totally electronic commerce (<b>direct</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce),</b> the goods to be sold are exposed to the public, are digitalised. These goods can be directly distributed via the Internet. The role of the e-commerce is that of a mediator among the producers, distribution networks, other facilitators and the consumers. The e-commerce can contribute to the diminishing of a certain offeror’s costs by a series of mechanisms, thus it can increase the capacity of competitionof a firm. Using the Internet there can be done comparisons and price analyses, while the costs for the changing of an offeror who has more attractive prices are more diminished. As it can be noticed according to the eProcurement development, the increases of the efficiency can be obtained by diminishing the aquisition costs. Important costs are to be seen {{in the development of the}} sale process, as well as in the marketing sector. The Internet technology offers various possibilities of saving money. Advertising is easy to be accessed today, so that the clients may benefit of information immediately, while the offeror saves money with multiplication and dispatch. cost, commerce, technology...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{commerce}} {{has become}} a global phenomenon. “Online is now becoming {{an integral part of}} any country’s economy …… [...] it is important for businesses to understand where the future opportunities will be” (Interactive Media in Retail Group, 2012). By 2017 60 % of all U. S. retail sales will involve the Internet in some way, either as a <b>direct</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> transaction or as part of a shopper’s research on a laptop or mobile device (internetRetailer. com, 2014). With worldwide electronic commerce increasing exponentially, there are significant opportunities available for businesses that are competent in the online environment (eMarketer. com, 2013). However the inauthenticity of online; brands, services and communities hinders the potential efficacy of electronic commerce in New Zealand and probably the World. The research reveals that consumers that can appropriate authenticity in their online; brands, community, and service {{will be more likely to}} engage in positive consumption behaviour. Moreover, with online consumer purchases in 2014 involving 3. 5 billion global consumers spending $ 1. 5 trillion euro’s the online retail opportunities are significant (eMarketer. com., 2013). Yet while there have been numerous studies focused on various aspects of electronic commerce, a review of academic research identifies a knowledge gap in the conceptualisation and measurement of consumer authenticity online. In order to fill that deficit a literature review is conducted. The literature review reveals the following nine primary constructs of authenticity: Approximate (Iconic), Identification, Production, Situation, Social, Moral, and Pure (Indexical) Authenticity, Virtuous and Practical Self and Interpersonal Self-authentication. The research uses these constructs (in addition to: consumption behaviour and its two constructs - rational and experiential thinking) to build a conceptual model and develop hypotheses to explain consumer authenticity online. In order to test the theoretical model a survey instrument is constructed using measures selected from academic articles based on their ability to validly measure the constructs in the model. The survey is then used to collect data from five hundred randomly selected online consumers from the wider Auckland district of New Zealand. The data collections method is via surveys administered on a face-to-face basis. After data collection and cleaning a two-stage data analysis procedure begins: The first stage comprises descriptive data analysis to identify the trends of the dataset. The second stage or model development stage uses a two-phase process of confirmatory factor analysis to develop the model and determine its validity, and structural equation model analyses to test the hypothetical relationships. This is achieved by measuring the hypotheses of the original model and then modifying the model to better represent the characteristics of the dataset as advised by the AMOS analysis output. Finally, both the accepted and rejected hypothesised relationships conceptualised in the alternative SEM model are analysed from; theoretical, consumption modes and consumer interpretation perspectives and the managerial implications determined...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the {{issues related to}} the implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. To illustrate the main features of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services, we have selected legal and administrative services. We describe in the paper the actors who take part in these services, the system architecture and the workflow that defines the interactions and interchange of information among actors. With these elements we have implemented an <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> application inside the TRADE project 2 that demonstrates how these services can be offered in an electronic manner. 1 <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of legal and administrative services This section attempts to describe in a general way the characteristics of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. In particular, we have selected legal and administrative services to show the advantages of providing services through electronic means. 1. 1 <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services vs. <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products When we talk about <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> we are usually thinking about <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products, but there is also another kind of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce,</b> the <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services. Whilst <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of products consists on selecting the items we want to buy from a catalog and pay for them, <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> of services consists on searching for a professional or company that offers the service and contract him. During service development, there can be information request, payment or contacts with another users. 1. 2 Characteristics of legal and administrative services We have studied in detail the legal and administrative services in order to describe them. These are their main features: • There is a purchase of services. The result of these services (normally documents) is delivered after off-line development. • Many official documents must be interchanged. 1 Working in her Ph.

40|$|The study {{reported}} in this paper was undertaken {{in an attempt to}} identify and understand the impacts of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in the car retail industry in Western Australia. Much of the existing literature in <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> puts forward theoretical models and speculative argumentation in an attempt to describe and understand the <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> phenomenon. In contradistinction to this type of approach, this paper reports on an empirical investigation of the perspectives of senior executives (CEOs and/or owners) as to their actual experiences of and beliefs about the impacts of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in the retail car industry in Western Australia. These viewpoints and perspectives were elicited during face-to-face, semistructured interviews lasting between 1. 5 and 3 hours. Generally speaking, the executives interviewed are experiencing great uncertainty with respect to <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> and its effect on their business: they are uncertain about its likely impacts long term (although not much is currently happening), they are uncertain about the ultimate magnitude of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> in their industry, they are uncertain about {{the costs and benefits of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> investments, but they are unwilling not to be involved at all.

The literature on <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> to date does not provide adequate guidance about the ways that local merchants can exploit synergies between their local physical presence and <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> on the Web. In this paper, potential synergies, such as using a combined physical and virtual presence to improve trust, help consumers manage risk, meet diverse shopping preferences, and taking advantage of natural physical-virtual complementarities, are developed.

To understand the factors for the successful implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> applications in the long term insurance environment the current internet usage and needs of the market is investigated. It is found that internet usage is growing phenomenally. <b>Electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> is thus a viable business-to-consumer option for insurers and can provide an insurer with a significant competitive advantage. The study shows that the current legislative environment allows for the increased use of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> by accepting <b>electronic</b> data as sufficient for evidentiary purposes in courts of law and allowing electronic contracting. This enhances the attractiveness of <b>electronic</b> <b>commerce</b> for long term insurers.
