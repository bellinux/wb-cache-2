5|$|Despite {{the club}} failing to {{formally}} identify a site {{by the end}} of 2007, financial penalties were not incurred, as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made. However, McGill said plans with the preferred site had ground to a halt by March 2008. City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008, which would be used by York and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights. In July 2010, the council chose the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, on the site of Huntington Stadium. In August 2014, Greenwich Leisure Ltd were named as the council's preferred bidder to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> 8,000 all-seater stadium, a leisure complex and a community hub. Construction is expected to start in the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018.|$|E

Construction was due to start during spring 2015, for a completion date of July 2016. York City were given responsibility for operating and managing the stadium on an initial 13-year contract. A planning application for the GLL plan was submitted to the council in December 2014, which was passed in March 2015. The cost of the stadium and leisure complex, including a replacement athletics track at another site, stood at £37million.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{strove to}} organise and protect supply convoys {{in order to}} get the German-Italian Panzer Army the {{resources}} it needed. He succeeded in establishing local air superiority and neutralising Malta, which provided a base from which British aircraft and submarines could interdict Axis convoys headed for North Africa. Without the vital supplies they carried, particularly fuel, the Axis forces in North Africa could not conduct operations. Through various expedients, Kesselring managed to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> increased flow of supplies to Generaloberst Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps in Libya. With his forces thus strengthened, Rommel prepared an attack on the British positions around Gazala, while Kesselring planned Operation Herkules, an airborne and seaborne attack on Malta with the 185 Airborne Division Folgore and Ramcke Parachute Brigade. Kesselring hoped to thereby secure the Axis line of communication with North Africa.|$|E

Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

Muta tried to <b>deliver</b> <b>a</b> Moonsault for the victory but Sting {{moved out of the}} way. Muta started dominating the match but Sting <b>delivered</b> <b>a</b> Clothesline to gain advantage. Sting dropkicked Muta down and the two continued to exchange momentum and moves. The match started to change when Muta tried to <b>deliver</b> <b>a</b> Red Mist to Sting but Sting moved out and the referee Nick Patrick was hit with it. Sting attacked Muta and tried to <b>deliver</b> <b>a</b> Stinger Splash but Muta avoided it and <b>delivered</b> <b>a</b> Moonsault. Tommy Young replaced Nick Patrick as the referee and entered the ring to count the pinfall for Muta but Sting kicked out at 2 and became the first wrestler to kick out of Moonsault. Muta tried to <b>deliver</b> <b>a</b> Spin Kick but Sting countered it and <b>delivered</b> him <b>a</b> Belly To Back Suplex to win the match and retain the title. However, controversy surrounded the match as both men had their shoulders up at two count. The referees argued over it and Muta stole the title belt.|$|R

5|$|The 1938 Polish {{ultimatum}} to Lithuania was {{an ultimatum}} delivered to Lithuania by Poland on March 17, 1938. The Lithuanian government had steadfastly refused {{to have any}} diplomatic relations with Poland after 1920, protesting the annexation of the Vilnius Region by Poland. As pre-World War II tensions in Europe intensified, Poland perceived the need to secure its northern borders. Five days earlier, Poland, feeling supported by international recognition of the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, decided to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum to Lithuania. The ultimatum demanded that the Lithuanian government unconditionally agree to establish diplomatic relations with Warsaw within 48 hours, and that the terms be finalized before March 31. The establishment of diplomatic relations would mean a de facto renunciation of Lithuanian claims to the region containing its historic capital, Vilnius (known in Polish as Wilno).|$|E
5|$|The only success the British {{managed to}} achieve was to damage both the Gneisenau and Scharnhorst (the latter seriously). Scharnhorst hit two mines, one at 14:31 GMT, and a further one at 21:34 GMT. Gneisenau also struck a mine at 18:55 GMT. Both ships {{recovered}} and steamed on. Scharnhost had been {{stopped dead in}} the water with engine damage after the first hit. The failure to alert Bomber Command earlier meant a chance was missed to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> attack on Scharnhorst when it was most vulnerable. The second and third mine hits came after nightfall, which enabled both vessels to avoid further attacks. The last RAF sighting of the ships had occurred at 18:00 GMT.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} a refit {{in the early}} months of the war, Provence conducted anti-raider patrols with Force Y, based in Casablanca. Bretagne was also overhauled early in the war; in March 1940 she escorted a convoy to Halifax and returned with another convoy loaded with aircraft for the French Air Force. She was then ordered to join Lorraine in Force X, to be based in Alexandria to operate in concert with the British Mediterranean Fleet. Two weeks later, Bretagne was instead ordered to steam at high speed to Bizerte, to join the Force de Raid with Provence. The ships put in at Mers-el-Kébir and remained there until after the fall of France in June 1940. To prevent the ships of the French Navy from falling {{into the hands of the}} occupying Germans, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the neutralization of all French warships. Force H was to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum to the ships based at Mers-el-Kébir; on 3 July, the British squadron arrived outside the harbor and demanded that the ships sail with them to Britain or they would be sunk.|$|E
5|$|No prototypes for the {{painting}} are known in Sweden, and while {{the painting}} is occasionally associated with the Danube school, much about its stylistic and iconographic history remains to be investigated. A possible stylistic prototype is the illustrated Bible of Erhard Altdorfer (brother of the more famous Albrecht Altdorfer). Begun in 1530, it {{was inspired by the}} works of Cranach and Dürer, but also renewed the genre by combining commonplace details with an undertone of approaching disaster. In particular, Altdorfer's apocalyptic illustrations for the Revelation to John <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> evangelic message {{similar to that of the}} Vädersolstavlan. Historical documents show that Olaus Petri, who commissioned the painting, combined biblical quotations related to the Apocalypse with the painting hanging in the church. Copies of Erhard Altdorfer's apocalyptic woodcuts may have been available in Stockholm through the German merchant Gorius Holste who lived by Järntorget square and who was a friend of both Petri and Martin Luther.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, she ferried Captain Cedric Holland, the {{emissary}} of Admiral James Somerville, commander of Force H, to meet with Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul, commander of the Vichy French forces at Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria. Holland was to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum regarding the disposition of the French ships there {{to ensure that they}} could not {{fall into the hands of}} the Germans. Gensoul initially refused to meet with such a low-ranking envoy, but later relented and negotiations were underway that afternoon to disarm the French ships in place when the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered the talks terminated to forestall the impending arrival of French reinforcements. The British opened fire a half-hour later, including Foxhound. A month later the ship escorted Force H during Operation Hurry, a mission to fly off fighter aircraft for Malta and conduct an airstrike on Cagliari on 2 August. Shortly afterwards, she escorted Hood back home and began a refit at Sheerness that lasted until October.|$|E

5|$|X-Men vs. Street Fighter {{debuted in}} Japan in September 1996 for the CP System II arcade board, and was {{released}} worldwide later on in 1996. The game received a port to the Sega Saturn in Japan on November 27, 1997. The port utilized the Saturn's 4MB RAM cartridge peripheral, which was packaged alongside the game, to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> arcade-perfect conversion. It was not officially released in North America due to the Saturn's low sales numbers in the North American market. An imported version was sold at certain Electronics Boutique locations. Sega had initially intended to release the game in Europe bundled with the expansion cartridge; however, these plans were eventually shelved. The game was then ported to the PlayStation on February 26, 1998 in Japan, where it was renamed X-Men vs. Street Fighter: EX Edition. The PlayStation port was also released in North America on June 11, 1998, and Europe in November 1998.|$|E
5|$|Pre-production was {{originally}} estimated at ten months, but ultimately extended to fourteen months. Each {{time a new}} movement or ability was created for the Prince, it required adjustments to multiple other systems, as leaving them alone would have damaged the game. They also needed to make adjustments to the enemy and partner artificial intelligence, {{and they did not}} have time to polish those systems. All this meant that the debugging started much later than originally scheduled. The Prince had over 780 scripted movements, far more than any other character in the game. This caused problems with creating the movements for other characters. To make the character movements realistic, the team used motion capture to animate their movements. Art director Raphael Lacoste did not join the team until July 2002, well into the game's production, resulting in multiple delays in creating the game's environments. This issue was compounded by the need to produce a demo for the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, then to <b>deliver</b> <b>an</b> entire game at the same if not a higher quality than the demo. Each environment needed to work for the Prince's set of movements and abilities: the work needed involved checking each rewind sequence, and each of the Prince's movement in and effect on the environment worked. These issues were compounded by the late delivery of environmental maps. In hindsight, producer Yannis Mallat lamented the fact {{that they did not have}} enough time to work out the problems caused by these issues. Despite these problems, other parts of production including play-testing, management of creative tools, and the integrated testing system worked smoothly. A cited example was the team discovering a tester that was good at finding severe bugs, so they included her in one of their testing groups, giving her a development kit she could use to sort out those bugs. This was replicated, and managed to greatly increase the amount of bugs that could be found and fixed. The development team's enthusiasm was also high, which enabled the problems during development to be overcome. During the aftermath of E3, the team considered release The Sands of Time as two games so they could include all the desired content, but the idea was dropped. Another element that needed to be cut after the demo was a griffin boss that would appear three times during the Prince's journey.|$|E
