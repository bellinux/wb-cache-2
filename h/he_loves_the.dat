5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) is {{organizing}} {{the making of}} a time capsule, meant to be opened 50 years in the future and filled with items that encapsulate the spirit of Pawnee. A citizen named Kelly Larson (Will Forte) comes to Leslie's office and makes a passionate plea for the Twilight books to be included. When Leslie refuses because the books have no connection to Pawnee, Kelly handcuffs himself to a pipe in her office until she reconsiders. He is able to stay several days because he brought food, water and a pillow. During his stay, Kelly notices Tom (Aziz Ansari) appears sad, and correctly deduces Tom is having romantic issues; Tom's girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) has dumped him because Tom cannot get over the fact that his ex-wife, Wendy (Jama Williamson), is dating Ron (Nick Offerman). Kelly encourages Tom to read Twilight, to which he initially scoffs, but after reading them finds <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> books. Lucy later visits Tom and tells him she still likes him, and if he ever gets past his Ron & Wendy-jealousy problems he should call her.|$|E
5|$|With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero {{begin to}} ascend the throne, but the {{ceremony}} {{is interrupted by}} the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by Otho, {{the commander of the}} army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.|$|E

But the thought refused to stay before his consciousness a moment.

The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the forms of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.|$|E

Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden.

God of Wars lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of Game Director. In an interview with Computer and Video Games (CVG) in June 2006, Barlog said that while working on the first few drafts of script, he studied the mythology extensively. He said that the mythology is so large that [...] "the real difficulty is picking things that really fit within the story of Kratos as well as being easy to swallow for audiences." [...] Although <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> idea of teaching things through storytelling (in this case Greek mythology), Barlog said, [...] "you can't let your story get bogged down by that."

500|$|Welles's biographer Simon Callow has {{compared}} Falstaff to Welles's father Richard Head Welles, {{stating that}} like Falstaff, Welles's father was [...] "a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmerand he is {{rejected by the}} person <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> most." [...] Welles's father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along {{with him when he}} was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young protÃ©gÃ© to bail him out of trouble. The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles's relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill. Both of Welles's surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles's lifestyle and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until he cleaned up his act and stopped drinking; Welles's father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, [...] "I always thought I killed him." ...|$|E

Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E

500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no interest in what is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E
500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake." ...|$|E

[...] Gandert said the episode [...] "doesn't have quite as many truly classic moments as the show's peaks in seasons one and two" [...] but that [...] "it also never really hits a sour note." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the economic crisis, cutbacks, and corporate bonuses theme in the episode, explaining {{that one of the}} reasons <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> show [...] "is because it can take something that's in the news and make it the plot of an episode without it feeling weird or forced." [...] Sassone wrote that despite [...] "Season 4" [...] not being the best episode of 30 Rock [...] "it was still very good." [...] TV Guides Michael Anthony commented that Steve Buscemi is [...] "so weird and yet does it in such an endearing way." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times called Kenneth's strike one of the more hilarious strikes in history. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons noted that this episode of 30 Rock had strong moments [...] "and was a solid start to the new season". David Zurawik, a contributor for The Baltimore Sun, liked the episode and enjoyed Buscemi's appearance, noting he [...] "brings just the right mix of sleaze and smiles to the role." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times Paige Wiser noted, [...] "...tonight's season premiere, the hype is warranted: 30 Rock is in all its glory."

2500|$|The {{subject of}} Sonnet 73 is under debate among many critics.

[...] After going through a lengthy description that, on the surface, describes {{the passage of time}} and the coming of death, he concludes his dissertation by saying that the reader perceives this eminent death and, because he does, <b>he</b> <b>loves</b> <b>the</b> author even more. [...] However, an alternative understanding of the sonnet presented by Prince asserts that the author does not intend to address death, but rather the passage of youth. [...] With this, the topic of the sonnet moves from the speaker's life to the listener's life.|$|E
