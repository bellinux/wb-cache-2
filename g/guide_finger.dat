40|$|The Cayuga Lake Watershed (CLW) {{is home to}} many {{municipal}} agencies, educational institutions, non-governmental {{environmental organizations}} and citizens? groups with significant interests {{in the quality of}} the lake and its tributaries. As a result, numerous studies and monitoring programs have been, and will continue to be, conducted throughout the watershed. However, water quality monitoring studies have differed widely in purpose and scope, corresponding to the interests and funding of scientific investigators, the information needs of specific agencies and the enthusiasm of volunteers. Therefore, any plan for a comprehensive monitoring plan becomes very complicated due to the immense diversity of interests and study questions that drive water quality monitoring in the CLW. The unfeasibility of a monitoring plan lead to the creation of this Guide to Surface Water Quality Monitoring in Cayuga Lake Watershed, which achieves some of the goals of a comprehensive plan while still accommodating the needs and scopes of current and future monitoring activities. The Guide provides an introduction to study design, five objectives for CLW monitoring and the types of sampling programs that could meet the objectives, and an overview of a data clearinghouse begun as part of this project. Appendices provide supporting information such as questions to inform study design, sample field data sheets and explanations of key parameters suggested in the <b>Guide.</b> <b>Finger</b> Lakes-Lake Ontario Watershed Protection Allianc...|$|E
40|$|The Magnetic Guidance Keyboard System (MaGKeyS) embodies a new haptic {{guidance}} technology {{designed to}} facilitate sensorimotor training and rehabilitation. MaGKeyS works by employing active magnetic force to <b>guide</b> <b>finger</b> pressing movements during sensorimotor learning that involves sequential key presses, such as playing the piano. By combining this haptic guidance with an audiovisual learning paradigm, {{we have created}} a core technology with possible applications to such diverse fields as musical training, physical rehabilitation, and scientific investigation of sensorimotor learning. Two embodiments of this new technology were realized in this thesis. The first embodiment, the MaGKeyS Prototype, is a 5 -key acrylic USB keyboard designed for a stationary right hand. A set of three behavioral experiments were executed to investigate {{the manner in which}} haptic guidance, via the MaGKeyS Prototype, facilitates rhythmic motor learning. In particular, the experiments examined the independent effects of haptic guidance on ordinal learning, which is the order of notes in a sequence, and temporal learning, which is the order of timing variations in a rhythmic sequence. A transfer test and 24 -hour retention test were also administered. Our results provide conclusive evidence that haptic guidance can facilitate learning the ordinal pattern of a key press sequence. Furthermore, our results suggest that the advantage gained with haptic guidance can both transfer to learning a new rhythmic sequence, as well as extend to a demonstrable advantage a day later. The second embodiment, the MaGKeyS Trainer Piano, is an upright piano in which the keyboard has been modified and outfitted with electromagnets {{in a manner similar to}} the MaGKeyS Prototype. The Trainer Piano helps to teach by "feel" by providing an experience in which the user feels his or her fingers being pulled down into the correct piano keystrokes as the piano plays itself. by Craig Edwin Lewiston.

40|$|A {{possible}} {{functional role}} of finger representations {{for the development}} of early numerical cognition {{has been the subject of}} recent debate; however, until now, only behavioral studies have directly supported this view. Working from recent models of number processing, we focused on the neural networks involved in numerical tasks and their relationship to the areas underlying finger representations and saccades in children aged 6 – 12 [*]years. We were able to differentiate three parietal circuits that were related to distinct aspects of number processing. Abstract magnitude processing was subserved by an association area also activated by saccades and visually <b>guided</b> <b>finger</b> movements. Addition processes led to activation in an area only engaged during saccade encoding, whereas counting processes resulted in the activation of an area only activated during visually <b>guided</b> <b>finger</b> movements, namely in the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Apart from this area, a large network of specifically finger-related brain areas including the ventral precentral sulcus, supplementary motor area, dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, insula, thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellum was activated during (particularly non-symbolic) exact addition but not during magnitude comparison. Moreover, a finger-related activation cluster in the right ventral precentral sulcus was only present during non-symbolic addition and magnitude comparison, but not during symbolic number processing tasks. We conclude that finger counting may critically mediate the step from non-symbolic to symbolic and exact number processing via somatosensory integration processes and therefore represents an important example of embodied cognition...|$|R

50|$|After the June meetings, Johnson had put Bill Creasy and his {{mechanical}} {{designers to}} work on the preliminary design of a docking mechanism. By the time the NASA delegation left for Moscow, Creasy's crew had designed and built a 1-meter double ring and cone docking system that had four <b>guide</b> <b>fingers</b> and attenuators on both rings, so either half could be active or passive during docking. The Structures and Mechanics Laboratory at MSC made 16-millimeter movies demonstrating this system in action, which Johnson took to Moscow in November, along with a booklet describing the system and a model of the capture latches. To Johnson's surprise, Vladimir Syromyatnikov had been working on a variation of NASA's ring and cone concept since the previous October. Instead of the four <b>guide</b> <b>fingers</b> in the American proposal, Syromyatnikov suggested three, and in lieu of hydraulic shock-absorbers, he proposed electromechanical attenuators. In essence, the Soviets had accepted the idea of using a set of intermeshing <b>fingers</b> to <b>guide</b> the two halves of the docking gear from the point of initial contact to capture. The concept of using shock absorbing attenuators on the active spacecraft's capture ring to buffer the impact of two spacecraft coming together was also acceptable. Both groups of engineers planned to retract the active half of the docking gear using an electrically powered winch to reel in a cable. Once retracted, structural or body latches would be engaged to lock the two ships together. Three basic issues had to be resolved - the number of guides, the type of attenuators, and the type of structural latches - before the design of a universal system could proceed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA new {{surgical}} technique to define intra-operatively segmental and subsegmental {{areas of the}} liver using ultrasound-guided bimanual liver compression has been recently described. However, this technique does not allow disclosure of the subsegmental ventral (S 8 v) and dorsal (S 8 d) portions of segment 8 (S 8). Another technique that overcomes these limitations is described. MethodsSix patients with hepatoma, cirrhosis and no evidence of portal vein thrombosis were submitted to the procedure. Demarcation of the resection area was achieved using ultrasound-guided finger compression of the S 8 subsegmental portal branches (P 8 v and P 8 d). ResultsThe procedure was feasible in all patients and demarcation was always obtained within 1 min of bimanual ultrasound-guided compression. In one patient, the entire S 8 was resected. In the remaining five patients, the dorsal (four patients) or the ventral (one patient) portion was removed, respectively. There was no mortality or morbidity and no blood transfusions were administered. ConclusionsDisclosure of the subsegmental portions of S 8 using the ultrasound-guided compression technique was feasible, safe and effective, and represents {{the completion of the}} ultrasound-guided compression technique for performing segmental and subsegmental anatomical resection of the liver.

40|$|Visually <b>guided</b> <b>finger</b> {{movements}} include online {{feedback of}} current effector position to guide target approach. This visual feedback may be scaled or otherwise distorted by unpredictable perturbations. Although adjustments to visual feedback scaling {{have been studied}} before, the underlying brain activation differences between upscaling (visual feedback larger than real movement) and downscaling (feedback smaller than real movement) are currently unknown. Brain activation differences between upscaling and downscaling might be expected because within-trial adjustments during upscaling require corrective backwards accelerations, whereas correcting for downscaling requires forward accelerations. In this behavioural and fMRI study we investigated adjustments during up- and downscaling in a target-directed finger flexion-extension task with real-time visual feedback. We found that subjects made longer and more complete within-trial corrections for downscaling perturbations than for upscaling perturbations. The finger task activated primary motor (M 1) and somatosensory (S 1) areas, premotor and parietal regions, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. General scaling effects were seen in the right pre-supplementary motor area, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stronger activations for down- than for upscaling were observed in M 1, supplementary motor area (SMA), S 1 and anterior cingulate cortex. We argue that these activation differences may reflect differing online correction for upscaling versus downscaling during finger flexion-extension...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} area of guitar education, whether {{in a private}} studio or a public school classroom, is that of guitar "fingering" [...] the exact, well-planned, and deliberate designation of fingers to a musical passage. Knowledge, understanding, and application of basic fingering principles will aid students in such parameters as technical proficiency, expression, phrasing, memorization, and performance security. This dissertation supplies the teacher with a theoretical basis from which to present this important topic. The basis is built on two sets of principles: (1) the physical properties of the guitar and its tone production (guitar size, distance between the frets, sustaining quality of the strings, and varying timbre of the strings), and (2) the physiological structure of the human hand and arm (length of the fingers, alignment of hands with the strings, strong and weak finger combinations, changing positions, fatigue, and string crossing). This study is divided into seven chapters. The first serves as {{an overview of the}} current status of guitar education and provides an introduction to the topic of fingering. Chapter 2 describes the notation used throughout the document and defines such fundamental concepts as basic position for the left and right hand, the names of positions, stretch and squeeze positions, the bar and hinge-bar, and rest and free strokes. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 present information that constitutes the main conclusions of this study. They deal with the left hand fingering of melodies played on a single string, left hand fingering of melodies played on two or more strings, left hand fingering of homophonic and contrapuntal music, and right hand fingering. Included in these areas of discussion are basic left and right hand positions, minimum movement, pivot and <b>guide</b> <b>fingers,</b> position playing, changing positions, strong and weak finger combinations, and fingerings which complement musical phrasing and expression. Chapter 7 summarized the major concepts presented in the dissertation, gives guidelines to teaching the topic of guitar fingering, and supplies suggestions for future research in this subject area...|$|R

40|$|Stably {{planning}} a joint motion of humanoid fingers {{is very important}} for precise hand operations. In this paper, an ef-fective joint motion planning method for humanoid fingers is proposed. Our approach consists of two folds. One is to determine an adequate initial configuration of a finger. The other one is to plan real-time joint configurations of the fin-ger during a manipulation process. For the second purpose especially, an empirical model that describes an interpha-langeal coordination in a human finger is suggested and in-corporated into the proposed joint motion planning method. Various simulation results show us practical merits of our approach that <b>guides</b> a <b>finger</b> to an effective trajectory for precise manipulating tasks. The effect of two different ap-proaches is contrasted. As a result, it is illustrated that our approach enables a finger to get a more natural movement and thus, it is useful for humanoid fingers as well as pros-thetic fingers.

40|$|Although bimanual finger {{coordination}} {{is known}} to decline with aging, it still remains unclear how exactly the neural substrates underlying the coordination differ between young and elderly adults. The present study focused on: (1) characterization of the functional connectivity within the motor association cortex which is required for successful bimanual finger coordination, and (2) to elucidate upon its age-related decline. To address these objectives, we utilized {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in combination with structural equation modeling (SEM). This allowed us to compare functional connectivity models between young and elderly age groups during a visually <b>guided</b> bimanual <b>finger</b> movement task using both stable in-phase and complex anti-phase modes. Our SEM exploration of functional connectivity revealed significant age-related differences in connections surrounding the PMd in the dominant hemisphere. In the young group who generally displayed accurate behavior, the SEM model for the anti-phase mode exhibited significant connections from the dominant PMd to the non-dominant SPL, and from the dominant PMd to the dominant S 1. However, the model for the elderly group’s anti-phase mode in which task performance dropped, did not exhibit significant connections within the aforementioned regions. These results suggest that: (1) the dominant PMd acts as an intermediary to invoke intense intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity with distant regions among the higher motor areas including the dominant S 1 and the non-dominant SPL in order to achieve successful bimanual finger coordination, and (2) the distant connectivity among the higher motor areas declines with aging, whereas the local connectivity within the bilateral M 1 is enhanced for the complex anti-phase mode. The latter may underlie the elderly’s decreased performance in the complex anti-phase mode of the bimanual finger movement task...|$|R
