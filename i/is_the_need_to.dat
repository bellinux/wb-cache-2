5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of}} the world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{means by}} which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into {{radiation}} remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 {{there was still no}} generally accepted model for how this process occurs. Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves, spectra, and other characteristics. Particularly challenging <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays. Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB 990123 and to GRB 080319B, whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma-ray light spectra, have suggested that inverse Compton may be the dominant process in some events. In this model, pre-existing low-energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes. For chemical studies {{to be carried out}} on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 281Rg, the most stable known roentgenium isotope, is 26seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium, despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the ns subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium.|$|E

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of this approach}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> dispose of the ammonium sulfate byproduct.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{altering}} cloud precipitation {{can be done}} with the use of dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 60s before it was replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice has the advantage of being relatively cheap and completely non-toxic.

Other benefits from digital coding of voice transmissions include decreased susceptibility to electrical interference and jamming.

Another factor delaying the move to any digital mode <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> retain the ability for one station to override another in an emergency.|$|E
25|$|Julius Caesar {{is seen as}} {{the main}} example of Caesarism, a form of {{political}} rule led by a charismatic strongman whose rule is based upon a cult of personality, whose rationale <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> rule by force, establishing a violent social order, and being a regime involving prominence of the military in the government. Other people in history, such as the French Napoleon Bonaparte and the Italian Benito Mussolini, have defined themselves as Caesarists. Bonaparte did not focus only on Caesar's military career but also on his relation with the masses, a predecessor to populism. The word is also used in a pejorative manner by critics of this type of political rule.|$|E
25|$|Although {{urban water}} tariffs are high by {{regional}} standards (60 KSh or US$0.60 per m3 on average in 2014), these tariffs only allow {{the recovery of}} operating costs, but not the recovery of capital costs. Full cost recovery is not achieved due to various reasons, including {{a high level of}} non-revenue water (average of 42%). Based on the unit cost of production, the nationwide losses due to non-revenue water in 2014 were estimated at 5.2 billion KSh, equivalent to US$52 million. Another reason <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> tap distant water sources at a high cost in some locations. For example, Mombasa is supplied from a source located 220km from the city. Although 16% of Kenyans in urban areas have access to sewerage, there is no sewerage levy in Kenya, making this expensive service essentially free of charge.|$|E

25|$|An article {{published}} by Vietnam News echoed {{some of the}} challenges and opportunities that Vietnam faces {{in preparation for the}} AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Import-Export Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises' lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study the ASEAN market, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge for Vietnam, the article stated, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.|$|E
500|$|Noting the {{attention}} to detail of the series' launch sequences, Jonathan Bignell argues {{that part of the}} motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the Thunderbird craft <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast. The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian Nicholas J. Cull, who comments that of all the Andersons' series, Thunderbirds is the most evocative of a recurring theme: the [...] "necessity of the human component of the machine", whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by [...] "brave human beings and technology working together". This makes the series' vision of the 2060s [...] "wonderfully humanistic and reassuring". O'Brien similarly praises this optimism, comparing the Tracy family to guardian Übermensch. Writing for Wired UK magazine, Warren Ellis asserts that the series' scientific vision could inspire the next generation of [...] "mad and frightening engineers", adding that Thunderbirds [...] "trades in vast, demented concepts... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems." ...|$|E
500|$|Central to Franklin's pacifism and {{her view}} of life is what she calls [...] "the Quaker vision of the world". Individual {{conscience}} {{is at the heart}} of that vision. So too, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place [...] "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology has changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a [...] "technological imperative" [...] which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution: ...|$|E
