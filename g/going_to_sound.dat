That's not to say they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Warner Bros. Records {{commissioned}} {{the release of}} You Can Dance—Madonna's first retrospective—which was aimed at the dance segment of her audience. It was an album containing seven of Madonna's songs in remixed format, which was still a revolutionary concept in the 1980s. By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular {{and the concept of}} remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Mixing was an interpretative process, where the artist was usually involved, but the development was generally looked after the record producer. The different parts of a song, including the lead vocals, background vocals, guitars, bass, synths, drum machine—all went through the process of mixing to sound considerably different from their original counterpart. Mixing determined how loud these instruments were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> in relation to each other and what particular sound effects should be added to each instrument. Improvements in studio technologies meant the possibility of shaping the sound of a song in any way, after it has been recorded. The arrangements were itself created at the mixing stage, rather than being created previously. A particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed up and down in pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.|$|E
500|$|The title The Cookbook derived of Elliott feeling [...] "no two {{records are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> alike; each record {{has its own}} spices and herbs. Each record is cooking up a hot recipe for a hot album." [...] The black and white cover {{features}} Elliott posing with a vintage microphone in a 1920s juke joint. She explained the cover, saying, [...] "I wanted people to see I was taking music back to the roots—not just hip hop, but our ancestors. Whether they was on railroad tracks or cooking in somebody's kitchen, they was always singing." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Raekwon {{was asked}} about the album in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, he explained [...] "It’s not nothing derogatory towards Wu. It’s just that Shaolin (i.e. Staten Island) is the place, Wu-Tang is the crew that came from that place. It’s like me just <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> my history of being an emcee first, before I actually became part of Wu-Tang. I always give RZA that support as far as saying he brought Wu-Tang to the table. It was his philosophy. He picked certain dudes {{to be part of this}} group, and he said, 'This is what it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be called'. Before that, I was on the block. I was living in Shaolin. So this album just shows the street side of me, challenging the great side of Wu-Tang. Which is almost like how T.I. did T.I. vs. T.I.P. You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>sounds</b> that relate <b>to</b> Wu-Tang. You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get <b>sounds</b> that relate <b>to</b> great Rae at his best shit, too. You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get a lot of animation as far as the skits are concerned. It’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a hot one. Everyone’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> love it." ...|$|R
500|$|Demolition Plot J-7 was, like Slay Tracks and the Pa demos, {{recorded}} by Gary Young at his Louder Than You Think studios in Stockton. The recording {{took place on}} October 16 and October 17, 1989. Malkmus {{was influenced by the}} rehearsal style of jazz musicians as significant to the EP's recording, saying [...] "When we start recording, we're really focused on what we're doing. We know how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> in the studio. We don't have to worry if it's sounding good in the rehearsal space. We take those prescriptions from the great jazz people and applied them to our own framework." ...|$|E
500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step {{at the time and}} just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{expanding}} their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock, the band {{decided not to}} worry about what their next album was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like. Tucker explained, [...] "It was so spontaneous [...] The songs just kept popping up one after another. We didn't really talk about anything. It just kind of happened." [...] She also said that they wanted to write songs that were [...] "really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [...] earlier songs." [...] All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater-Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks. Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock, but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album's complex melodies. All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson, who previously produced the band's third studio album, Dig Me Out. The band decided to work with him again because, according to Weiss, Goodmanson [...] "has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it, so we sound better". The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Recording Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington.|$|E

5000|$|Albini critiqued Jay Z's subscription-only, {{lossless}} {{audio streaming}} service Tidal in an April 2015 interview with Vulture.com, arguing that streaming services {{would eventually be}} usurped by a more convenient technology, that [...] "if you want your music {{to play at the}} push of a button, convenience is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> trump <b>sound</b> quality 100 percent of the time", and that audiophiles would prefer vinyl to streaming.

500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E

Clinkle confirmed that the product would not require near field communication, a wireless technology used by Google Wallet and Apple Pay.

Those songs came out and people are like, 'Oh my God, what direction is Kelly going?' I think what made me mad was that. People stole from me, everybody had no idea what my next album was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like. That really caused a lot of confusion. Here’s the best part though, nothing that’s leaked is the final version. Those are all demos." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yusuf {{actively}} promoted this album, {{appearing on}} radio, {{television and in}} print interviews. In November 2006, he told the BBC, [...] "It's me, so it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like that of course... This is the real thing... When my son brought the guitar back into the house, you know, that was the turning point. It opened a flood of, of new ideas and music which I {{think a lot of}} people would connect with."

500|$|In 1995, Green Day {{released}} Insomniac, {{which did}} not perform as well commercially as the band's breakthrough major-label debut Dookie (1994). Speaking of Insomniac, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong noted, [...] "It did {{a lot better than}} I thought it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do...From the <b>sound</b> of it, we knew it wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sell as much as Dookie." [...] The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote Insomniac in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing. [...] The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, [...] "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas. [...] It was beginning to be not fun anymore." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{learned so}} much working on the record with Damon", claimed Danger Mouse. [...] "...and it was sink or swim. You just pick it up.

All {{you have to do is}} figure out the best thing they're doing and how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fit within the context of the whole project. That goes back to putting together a song on a computer-based program. You're looking for all the parts that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make something <b>sound</b> right.

But we still maintain the album weight, balancing it with a number of rock ballad too and of course will be working hard on it to maintain the quality of the whole album soon". However, despite the band’s fifth album title has been confirmed and finalized, Masterpiece stated that they will reveal it at a later date.|$|E
2500|$|Underwood {{confirmed}} that she began planning {{a new album}} in August 2013 and would start prep work sometime in 2014.

[...] Underwood also stated she has been planning another tour, which might be toned down from her earlier ones, stating, [...] "I haven't thought about it much because I don't know what the next album is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like, but I like just standing there and singing, too. I may take a different approach, a more simple approach on the next one. I loved the energy that rock concerts had," [...] Underwood told Billboard. Underwood is featured on Miranda Lambert's album Platinum, on a song called [...] "Somethin' Bad".

2500|$|Ross and Urie {{soon began}} to commit to their laptops the demos they had been {{developing}} and posted three early demos ("Time to Dance," [...] "Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks" [...] and [...] "Camisado") on PureVolume. On a whim, they sent a link to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time {{with the rest of}} Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing [...] "two to three" [...] songs during band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group. [...] "Almost right away we {{knew what was going to}} happen," [...] Ross explained in a 2006 interview. [...] "We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band we were and what we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like." ...|$|E

Further details were released on August 15, when Carey confirmed {{that there would be a}} new musical number featured in the episode.

I can't tell you anything because it's not finalized, but it involves special effects and really cool music." [...] It was later announced that James Gang musicians Joe Walsh, Jim Fox and Dale Peters would be guest starring in the episode as members of Drew's band.
