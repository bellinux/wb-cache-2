5|$|Branches also <b>innervate</b> {{muscles of}} the {{perineum}} and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal branch), and male or female external urethral sphincter.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system <b>innervate</b> the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that <b>innervate</b> the {{laryngeal}} and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
50|$|The {{corticobulbar tract}} <b>innervates</b> cranial motor nuclei bilaterally with the {{exception}} of the lower facial nuclei which are <b>innervated</b> only unilaterally (below the eyes) and cranial nerve XII which is <b>innervated</b> unilaterally as well. Both the lower part of cranial nerve VII and XII are <b>innervated</b> by the contralateral cortex. Among those nuclei that are bilaterally <b>innervated</b> a slightly stronger connection contralaterally than ipsilaterally is observed. The corticobulbar tract directly <b>innervates</b> the nuclei for cranial nerves V, VII, XI, and XII. The corticobulbar tract also contributes to the motor regions of X in the nucleus ambiguus.|$|R
50|$|The {{muscles of}} the upper limb are <b>innervated</b> segmentally {{proximal}} to distal so that the proximal muscles are <b>innervated</b> by higher segments (C5-C6) and the distal muscles are <b>innervated</b> by lower segments (C8-T1).|$|R
50|$|Unlike most of {{the other}} facial muscles, which are <b>innervated</b> by the facial nerve (or CN VII), the muscles of {{mastication}} are <b>innervated</b> by the trigeminal nerve (or CN V). More specifically, they are <b>innervated</b> by the mandibular branch, or V3.|$|R
5|$|At {{each level}} of the spinal column, spinal nerves branch off from {{either side of the}} spinal cord and exit between a pair of vertebrae, to <b>innervate</b> a {{specific}} part of the body. The area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome, and the group of muscles innervated by a single spinal nerve is called a myotome. The part of the spinal cord that was damaged corresponds to the spinal nerves at that level and below. Injuries can be cervical 1–8 (C1–C8), thoracic 1–12 (T1–T12), lumbar 1–5 (L1–L5), or sacral (S1–S5). A person's level of injury is defined as the lowest level of full sensation and function. Paraplegia occurs when the legs are affected by the spinal cord damage (in thoracic, lumbar, or sacral injuries), and tetraplegia occurs when all four limbs are affected (cervical damage).|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which <b>innervate</b> the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Alpha motor neurons {{are located}} in a {{specific}} region of the spinal cord's gray matter. This region is designated lamina IX in the Rexed lamina system, which classifies regions of gray matter based on their cytoarchitecture. Lamina IX is located predominantly in the medial aspect of the ventral horn, although there is some contribution to lamina IX from a collection of motor neurons located more laterally. Like {{other regions of the}} spinal cord, cells in this lamina are somatotopically organized, meaning that the position of neurons within the spinal cord is associated with what muscles they <b>innervate.</b> In particular, α-MNs in the medial zone of lamina IX tend to <b>innervate</b> proximal muscles of the body, while those in the lateral zone tend to <b>innervate</b> more distal muscles. There is similar somatotopy associated with α-MNs that <b>innervate</b> flexor and extensor muscles: α-MNs that <b>innervate</b> flexors tend to be located in the dorsal portion of lamina IX; those that <b>innervate</b> extensors tend to be located more ventrally.|$|E
50|$|The nasal glands are <b>innervated</b> with secretomotor {{from the}} greater {{petrosal}} nerve. Likewise, the palatine glands are <b>innervated</b> by the nasopalatine, greater palatine nerve and lesser palatine nerves. The pharyngeal nerve <b>innervates</b> pharyngeal glands. These are all branches of maxillary nerve.|$|R
40|$|A {{battery of}} histochemical stains {{was used to}} {{differentiate}} the component fibre populations in rat superior oblique muscle. Seven histochemical fibre types were identified and found to be comparable to those observed in a prior light and electron microscopic study of the muscle. The global region of the muscle contained three singly <b>innervated</b> fibre populations (pale, intermediate and red) and one of multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres. THe global singly <b>innervated</b> fibre populations produced a spectrum of fibre types with trichrome, succinate dehydrogenase and Sudan black. The overlying orbital surface layer contained two populations of singly <b>innervated</b> fibres and an additional population of multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres. All the singly <b>innervated</b> fibres (both global and orbital) exhibited a high mATPase activity at pH 10. 4 and a low mATPase activity at pH 4. 6. The global multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres had low mATPase activity at pH 10. 4 and high mATPase activity at pH 4. 6. The multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres of the orbital surface layer exhibited high mATPase activity at pH 10. 4 and at pH 4. 6. The global multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres {{are similar to the}} tonic fibres found in amphibian muscle, both histochemically and ultrastructurally. Based upon their histochemical reactivities with the various stains, the multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres of the orbital surface layer appear to be faster acting than the global multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres. Furthermore, it is postulated that the former have polyneuronal innervation and are capable of dual mATPase synthesis...|$|R

25|$|Generally, motor nuclei found {{higher in}} the {{brainstem}} (i.e., more rostral) <b>innervate</b> muscles that are higher on the face. For example, the oculomotor nucleus contains α-MNs that <b>innervate</b> muscles of the eye, and {{is found in the}} midbrain, the most rostral brainstem component. By contrast, the hypoglossal nucleus, which contains α-MNs that <b>innervate</b> the tongue, is found in the medulla, the most caudal (i.e., towards the bottom) of the brainstem structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{trigeminal nerve}} carries general somatic afferent fibers (GSA), which <b>innervate</b> {{the skin of}} the face via {{ophthalmic}} (V1), maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions. The trigeminal nerve also carries special visceral efferent (SVE) axons, which <b>innervate</b> the muscles of mastication via the mandibular (V3) division.|$|E
25|$|Alpha (α) motor neurons (also called alpha motoneurons), are large, multipolar {{lower motor}} neurons of the {{brainstem}} and spinal cord. They <b>innervate</b> extrafusal muscle fibers of skeletal muscle and are directly responsible for initiating their contraction. Alpha motor neurons are distinct from gamma motor neurons, which <b>innervate</b> intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{composite}} muscle as the adductor and hamstring portions of the muscle are <b>innervated</b> by two different nerves. The adductor portion is <b>innervated</b> by the posterior division of the obturator nerve while the hamstring portion is <b>innervated</b> by the tibial nerve.|$|R
50|$|The pectineus is {{the only}} {{adductor}} muscle that is <b>innervated</b> by the femoral nerve. The other adductor muscles are <b>innervated</b> by the obturator nerve {{with the exception of}} a small part of the adductor magnus which is <b>innervated</b> by the tibial nerve.|$|R
50|$|The parietal pleura is <b>innervated</b> by the {{intercostal}} {{nerves and}} the phrenic nerve. The costal pleura is <b>innervated</b> by the intercostal nerves. The diaphragmatic {{portion of the}} parietal pleura overlies the diaphragm and is <b>innervated</b> by the phrenic nerve in its central portion and by the intercostal nerves in its peripheral portion. The mediastinal portion of the parietal pleura forms the lateral wall of the mediastinum and is <b>innervated</b> by the phrenic nerve.|$|R
25|$|Because they <b>innervate</b> many muscles, some {{clusters}} of α-MNs receive {{high concentrations of}} neurotrophic factors and survive this stage of neuronal pruning. This {{is true of the}} α-MNs innervating the upper and lower limbs: these α-MNs form large cell columns that contribute to the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord. In addition to receiving neurotrophic factors from muscles, α-MNs also secrete a number of trophic factors to support the muscle fibers they <b>innervate.</b> Reduced levels of trophic factors contributes to the muscle atrophy that follows an α-MN lesion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spinal}} cord, α-MNs are {{located within the}} gray matter that forms the ventral horn. These α-MNs provide the motor {{component}} of the spinal nerves that <b>innervate</b> muscles of the body.|$|E
25|$|While {{their cell}} bodies {{are found in}} the central nervous system (CNS), α motor neurons are also {{considered}} part of the somatic nervous system—a branch of the peripheral nervous system (PNS)—because their axons extend into the periphery to <b>innervate</b> skeletal muscles.|$|E

40|$|Rat {{superior}} oblique extraocular muscle {{was examined}} in serial sections by light and electron microscopy. By such analysis, {{it was possible}} to discriminate single versus multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres, characteristics of the internal structure of fibres, and topographical distribution of the respective fibre populations within the muscle. The superior oblique muscle was observed to consist of two distinguishable muscle portions; one portion originated proximally and the other muscle portion originated distally after passing through the trochlea tendon. Seven morphologically distinct fibre populations were discernible. Four populations, three singly <b>innervated</b> fibre populations and one multiply <b>innervated</b> fibre population, were localised in the global region; these differed in terms of diameter, mitochondrial richness, development of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrillar size. The orbital surface layer contained two singly <b>innervated</b> and one multiply <b>innervated</b> populations; all of these exhibited systematic morphological variability. The multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres displayed multiple, relatively superficial, neuromuscular junctions along their length, as well as end plate-like junctions which were apparently confined to the region of the singly <b>innervated</b> fibre innervation band, thus suggesting polyneuronal innervation. In the latter region, the multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres displayed morphological features characteristic of "twitch' fibres; away from this region these cells appeared to have morphological features typical of "tonic' fibres. In contrast, the global multiply <b>innervated</b> fibres were constant diameter and form along their length, and displayed only relatively superficial neuromuscular junctions...|$|R
50|$|All {{intrinsic}} laryngeal muscles {{except the}} cricothyroids are <b>innervated</b> by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The cricothyroid muscles are <b>innervated</b> by the superior laryngeal nerve.|$|R
25|$|The {{aberrant}} {{nerve regeneration}} hypothesis {{is the most}} widely accepted mechanism for synkinesis. The hypothesis states that, after trauma, axons project from the facial nucleus to incorrect peripheral muscle groups. These aberrant branches can simultaneously <b>innervate</b> different subdivisions of the facial nerve.|$|E
25|$|In general, α-MNs on {{one side}} of the {{brainstem}} or spinal cord <b>innervate</b> muscles on that same side of body. An exception is the trochlear nucleus in the brainstem, which innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye on the opposite side of the face.|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} of sea urchins has a {{relatively}} simple layout. With no true brain, the neural center is a large nerve ring encircling the mouth just inside the lantern. From the nerve ring, five nerves radiate underneath the radial canals of the water vascular system, and branch into numerous finer nerves to <b>innervate</b> the tube feet, spines, and pedicellariae.|$|E

50|$|The radial nerve <b>innervates</b> {{the skin}} {{the back of}} the hand from the thumb to the ring finger and the dorsal aspects of the index, middle, and half ring fingers as far as the {{proximal}} interphalangeal joints.The median nerve <b>innervates</b> the palmar side of the thumb, index, middle, and half ring fingers. Dorsal branches <b>innervates</b> the distal phalanges of the index, middle, and half ring fingers.The ulnar nerve <b>innervates</b> the ulnar third of the hand, both at the palm and {{the back of the}} hand, and the little and half ring fingers.|$|R
25|$|The vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that <b>innervate</b> {{the heart}} release {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) {{as their primary}} neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi-protein; therefore, vagal activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of motor neuron axons that branch {{out to the}} muscles from the ganglia of the central nervous system, parts of the sympathetic nervous system and the sensory neurons of the cuticular sense organs that receive chemical, thermal, mechanical or visual stimuli from the insects environment. The sympathetic nervous system includes nerves and the ganglia that <b>innervate</b> the gut both posteriorly and anteriorly, some endocrine organs, the spiracles of the tracheal system and the reproductive organs.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} and atrophy are inevitable consequences of α-MN lesions as well. Because muscle {{size and strength}} {{are related to the}} extent of their use, denervated muscles are prone to atrophy. A secondary cause of muscle atrophy is that denervated muscles are no longer supplied with trophic factors from the α-MNs that <b>innervate</b> them. Alpha motor neuron lesions also result in abnormal EMG potentials (e.g., fibrillation potentials) and fasciculations, the latter being spontaneous, involuntary muscle contractions.|$|E

40|$|Glycogen {{levels were}} studied in 15 Sprague-Dawley adult male rats. Three aspects of {{glycogen}} metabolism were considered. First, the glycogen concentrations of normally <b>innervated</b> red (soleus) and white (gastrocnemius) muscles were compared. Second, the glycogen content of <b>innervated</b> {{red and white}} muscles were compared to chronically denervated red and white muscles. Third, the effect of insulin upon glycogen stores in <b>innervated</b> and chronically denervated red and white muscles was examined. <b>Innervated</b> white muscles had higher glycogen levels than <b>innervated</b> red muscles. However, chronic denervation resulted in statistically significant decreases in red and white muscle glycogen content. In addition, insulin markedly increased glycogen stores in <b>innervated</b> red muscles, but not in white muscles. Further, the increase in glycogen levels in red muscle caused by insulin was abolished in chronically denervated preparations. The {{results suggest that the}} effects of insulin on skeletal muscle glycogen stores could be related to trophic influences of motor nerves. Ball State UniversityMuncie, IN 47306 Thesis (M. S.)
