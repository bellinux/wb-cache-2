5|$|Into Temptation is a 2009 {{independent}} drama film {{written and}} directed by Patrick Coyle, and starring Jeremy Sisto, Kristin Chenoweth, Brian Baumgartner, Bruce A. Young and Amy Matthews. It {{tells the story of a}} prostitute (Chenoweth) who confesses to a Catholic priest (Sisto) that she plans to kill <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> birthday. The priest attempts to find and save her, and in doing so plunges himself into a darker side of society.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{families}} were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even {{father and son}} have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 {{years of age and}} the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband's funeral pyre) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.|$|E
5|$|The novel first follows Kallik {{who lives}} {{with her mother and}} brother. However, they are {{separated}} on ice when a group of killer whales attacks them and Kallik must survive by <b>herself.</b> <b>On</b> <b>her</b> own, Kallik decides to go to a gathering place for polar bears that her mom told her about. At the gathering, Kallik asks other polar bears if they have seen her brother, but no one has. Alone, Kallik meets a female bear Nanuk who helps Kallik around the area. However, Nanuk is killed by a helicopter crash shipping her and Kallik back to the wild. Before she dies, Nanuk tells Kallik about a place where the ice never melts. Hearing this, Kallik sets off to this place.|$|E

5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Veerashaivaism was revolutionary and {{challenged}} the prevailing Hindu caste system which retained royal support. The social {{role of women}} largely depended on their economic status and level of education in this relatively liberal period. Freedom was more available to women in the royal and affluent urban families. Records describe the participation {{of women in the}} fine arts, such as Chalukya queen Chandala Devi's and Kalachuris of Kalyani queen Sovala Devi's skill in dance and music. The compositions of thirty Vachana women poets included the work of the 12th-century Virashaiva mystic Akka Mahadevi whose devotion to the bhakti movement is well known. Contemporary records indicate some royal women were involved in administrative and martial affairs such as princess Akkadevi, (sister of King Jayasimha II) who fought and defeated rebellious feudals. Inscriptions emphasise public acceptance of widowhood indicating that Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow used to immolate <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband's funeral pyre) though present was on a voluntary basis. Ritual deaths to achieve salvation were seen among the Jains who preferred to fast to death (Sallekhana), while people of some other communities chose to jump on spikes (Shoolabrahma) or walking into fire on an eclipse.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Telegraph {{reported}} on 3 July that host Gretel Killeen is {{being accused of}} being aggressive towards some housemates, in particular Jamie during his eviction interview after he suggested the video package shown of him crying and sitting alone was biased towards the negative. Later she was criticised for being particularly aggressive towards Rebecca, Thomas and Jamie. Killeen was also criticised for hypocrisy having aggressively questioned why Jamie did not intervene when Michelle argued with Aleisha, and yet she was receptive towards Michelle <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> eviction, and even rationalised Michelle's behaviour during the argument. Michelle was also named the most unpopular housemate ever to inhabit the Australian Big Brother House.|$|E

25|$|The Crown Princess Victoria Fund’s means mainly {{derive from}} {{donations}} by the public, but large {{companies such as}} Arla Foods, Swedbank and AB Svenska Returpack are constant sponsor partners. Additional support comes from The Association of Swedish Bakers & Confectioners who every year arrange a national “princess cake week” during which the participating cafés and bakeries give 2,50 SEK per sold princess pastry and 10 SEK per sold princess cake to the fund. The result of this fund-raising drive is usually presented to Victoria <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> name day on 12 March every year; in 2007, the total amount was 200,000 SEK. Congratulatory and memorial cards are also issued by Radiohjälpen benefitting the fund, {{a simple way to}} pay respects and do a good deed in one act. In 2006, The Crown Princess Victoria Fund raised a total of 5,5 million SEK.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{effectively}} {{separated from}} Edward from here onwards, leaving {{him to live}} with Hugh Despenser. At the end of 1322, Isabella left the court on a ten-month-long pilgrimage around England by <b>herself.</b> <b>On</b> <b>her</b> return in 1323 she visited Edward briefly, but refused to take a loyalty oath to the Despensers and {{was removed from the}} process of granting royal patronage. At the end of 1324, as tensions grew with Isabella's homeland of France, Edward and the Despensers confiscated all of Isabella's lands, took over the running of her household and arrested and imprisoned all of her French staff. Isabella's youngest children were removed from her and placed into the custody of the Despensers. At this point, Isabella appears to have realised that any hope of working with Edward was effectively over and begun to consider radical solutions.|$|E

500|$|Balzac's novel {{has been}} adapted several {{times for the}} screen. The first was in 1927, when French filmmaker Max DeRieux {{directed}} Alice Tissot in the title role. Margaret Tyzack {{played the role of}} Bette in the five part serial Cousin Bette made in 1971 by the BBC, which also starred Helen Mirren as Valérie Marneffe. The film Cousin Bette was released in 1998, directed by Des McAnuff. Jessica Lange starred in the title role, joined by Bob Hoskins as Crevel, and Elisabeth Shue as the singer Jenny Cadine. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr changed the story significantly, and eliminated Valérie. The 1998 film was panned by critics for its generally poor acting and awkward dialogue. Stephen Holden of the New York Times commented that the movie [...] "treats the novel as a thoroughly modern social comedy peopled with raging narcissists, opportunists and flat-out fools". The 1998 film changed the novel quite drastically, retaining the basic idea of Bette avenging <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> enemies, and not only eliminating Valerie, but letting Bette survive at the end.|$|E
500|$|The {{ending of}} Final Fantasy X {{meant that the}} Aeon {{summoning}} system from the game {{could not be used}} in the sequel, necessitating the team to make a new gameplay system. Because of the emphasis on a more optimistic setting, the game's dressphere system (inspired by the magical girl subgenre of anime and manga) was implemented, and the atmosphere of J-pop introduced right from the game's opening sequence. Additional allusions to popular culture in general were featured, such as the style of Charlie's Angels. The dressphere system, along with having a lead cast of three non-"macho" [...] girls were intended to keep the tone of the game light and lively. Lulu was excluded from the lead cast because, in addition to being married, her presence would have given her an [...] "older sister" [...] role to Yuna, rather than letting Yuna take the lead on discovering <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own. Though work on the opening song and motion capture began early in development, the opening sequence was actually the last portion of the game to be completed.|$|E

500|$|While {{working on}} Rebel Heart, Madonna enlisted {{a range of}} composers and {{producers}} to work with her. On April 9, 2014, she uploaded a picture of <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> Instagram with Natalia Kills and Martin Kierszenbaum, hinting that they were working in some songs for the album, by posting: [...] "Working the midnight shift with Natalia Kills. 2 girls on a couch... don't it taste like Holy Water? #artforfreedom #rebelheart #revolutionoflove". In the picture, Madonna was seen sitting with Kills in front of two microphones, and as noted by Keith Caulfield of Billboard, [...] "n the foreground is Martin Kierszenbaum, the founder and chairman of Cherrytree Records and senior executive of A for Interscope Records". In an interview for Paper, Kills revealed that Madonna's dancers used to play Kills' songs during their rehearsals and workouts every week, which interested Madonna to collaborate with her. Together they wrote eight songs in one week, with Kills commenting about Madonna: [...] "She writes incredible lyrics, sings beautiful melodies, {{but most of all}} she is so fucking funny".|$|E
500|$|Witherspoon shot a small role in Inherent Vice (2014), an {{adaptation}} of Thomas Pynchon's novel, in Pasadena, California in summer 2013. Through her company Pacific Standard, Witherspoon served as a producer in the film adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl, though she did not star. Indeed, Witherspoon and her producing partner [...] "had {{little to do with}} the production of Gone Girl", leaving it to director David Fincher while focusing their efforts on another adaptation produced via Pacific Standard, that of Cheryl Strayed's memoir , which began production in fall 2013 on the same day as Gone Girl. Witherspoon starred in the project, portraying Strayed <b>herself</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> [...] hike along the Pacific Crest Trail. Wild was released in December 2014 to critical acclaim; Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune wrote in his review, [...] "Witherspoon does the least acting of her career, and it works. Calmly yet restlessly, she brings to life Strayed's longings, her states of grief and desire and her wary optimism." [...] Wild was promoted as Witherspoon's primary [...] "comeback" [...] vehicle following her previous career slump, and she earned her second Academy Award nomination for the role.|$|E
