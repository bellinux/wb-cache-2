Sadly, she doesn't always bring that same {{sense of humor and}} self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational.....

500|$|Terri Schwartz of IGN {{scored the}} premiere 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, and praising {{the introduction of}} Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix". Schwartz was positive about the smaller cast compared to the previous season, which meant that the episode [...] "doesn't feel as overstuffed as it would have", and of Coulson not finding Johnson and asking her to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. straight away after the newly established status quo. Schwartz did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material, particularly criticizing the [...] "sexy" [...] opening of the episode with Johnson because [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. has already <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> establishing Daisy as a sexy character without needing to depict it in this unsubtle way.

[...] Jill Mader of Inside Pulse also gave the episode a {{more positive}} review, praising [...] "that the episode ended with a really sweet moment for Howard as, after all, he is a character who doesn't often get to be sweet" [...] and claimed that it was [...] "definitely about people changing and moving forward, and The Big Bang Theory has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>job</b> of emotionally maturing many of their characters {{over the past couple}} seasons". Despite this, she said that [...] "the episode wasn't as [...] as [...] hoped it would be" [...] and [...] "felt like there was more potential in Howard's bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to Bernadette." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode as 56 out of 100, describing Howard's [...] "little speech" [...] as [...] "very well written and performed". However, he considered most of the comedy [...] "generic", especially in regards to the jokes about Jewish stereotypes and Penny's dismissal of Leonard.
