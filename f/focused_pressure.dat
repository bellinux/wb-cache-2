In {{a letter to the}} Vallejo City Council dated September 11, 2006, he stated, [...] "In my {{capacity}} as provost, I apologize on behalf of the university that this controversy has arisen, and trust that my letter will lay this matter to rest." [...] In May 2008, Michael Harter, Ph.D., senior provost and CEO for Touro University said the executive team at the university never took any action to rescind funding for the gay-straight alliance and was not in agreement with the comments made by the university administrator at the student government meeting. This is the second major incidence of a Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender student group being banned from a United States (U.S.) medical school. The first occurred at New York Medical College (NYMC) in Valhalla, New York in Fall 2004. The situation garnered national media attention in the U.S. The Gay and Lesbian Medical Association and the American Medical Student Association spearheaded a campaign to raise awareness of the issue. NYMC came under an immense pressure from the Westchester County government, as well as other academic institutions with which it had affiliations, including Pace University Law School. [...] The Student Government association of NYMC, the faculty Senate, and the American Medical Student Association all also passed resolutions in support of the Gay and Lesbian student group. After a year of <b>focused</b> <b>pressure,</b> the school restored funding to the group.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study on the}} acoustic characterization of the laminar separation bubble on an airfoil is presented. The acoustic near- and far-fields are sampled by means of microphone arrays. Additionally the wall shear stresses are measured on the airfoil suction side by means of 24 MEMS surface hot wires in the region where the separation bubble was expected. Dierent processing strategies both in the frequency and in the time domain were applied for an acoustic characterization of the bubble. A focus of the study presented here is {{the application of the}} so called causality correlation method. The wall shear stresses on the airfoil surface together with the pressure fluctuations in the near- and far-field are recorded simultaneously. This enables the calculation of the cross-correlation between the measured quantities. An analysis of the resulting coecient matrix in the space-time domain identies perturbations traveling along the airfoil, showing a linear dependency on the sound generating process. For the case of the correlation between the wall shear stresses on the airfoil and the pressure fluctuations in the far-field the validity of the results were improved signicantly by using the <b>focused</b> <b>pressure</b> signals from the microphone-array...|$|E
40|$|Unfocused/weakly <b>focused</b> <b>pressure</b> pulses (UPP) are {{generated}} by an air-gun like mechanism, with a pro-jectile accelerated by pressurized air and impinging {{on a metal}} applicator. They were introduced in 1998 {{for the treatment of}} orthopedic soft tissue pain. The patient side of the applicator (a circular piston of 630 mm diam-eter) releases single pressure pulses of 210 MPa and 45 µs duration. Up today, there is no standard for the measurement of UPP sources (UPPS), so data are often reported {{on the basis of the}} focused lithotripter standard IEC 61846. The purpose of this research is to establish methods to reliably measure UPPS acoustic parameters and establish a parameter set based on definitions from focused lithotripsy sources as applicable. Therefore, acoustic characteristics and wave fields of the pressure pulses of UPPS from different manufacturers were measured in a water bath and in a dry test bench. It was demonstrated by comparison with optical hydrophones that piezo-electric hydrophones are appropriate for the measurements of UPP. For on-axis measurements at a fixed distance, measurements in the dry test bench can replace water-bath measurements. Additionally, the dry test bench allows for reliable results at pulse rates> 1 Hz...|$|E

E. 1. 1 Experiment Design Three test series addressing these different DDT modes were performed in the FZK combustion tube (12 m long, 35 cm ID). The corresponding test configurations are displayed in Figure E. 1. 1 - 1 : a. Shock tube with conus The tube was divided by a membrane into a low-pressure section (LPS, length 9 m) and a highpressure section (HPS, length 1 or 3 m). The experiments were conducted with a conical reflector {{at the end of}} the low-pressure section to <b>focus</b> the <b>pressure</b> wave and to reach self-ignition temperatures (Figure E. 1. 1 - 2). The main idea behind this experiment design is the observation that in many tests with fast combustion modes, DDT events are apparently triggered by waves reflected in corners or other converging multi-dimensional parts of the enclosure. The conus is used to produce local hot spots in the combustible gas because hot spots generally develop from the interaction of a pressure wave with a complex multi-dimensional target...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we examine a novel {{application}} of tensegrity structures, exploring their use as networks supporting energy transport through solitary waves. We {{show that the}} elastic potential of a ‘regular minimal tensegrity prism’ (Skelton and de Oliveira, 2010) belongs to the class of nonlinear potentials analyzed in Friesecke and Matthies (2002), which characterize lattices supporting solitary waves with profile dependent on the wave speed. We numerically study the shape of such a profile {{over a wide range}} of wave speeds, showing that it localizes on a single lattice spacing (i. e., on a single prism) in the limit for the wave speed tending to infinity. This feature of tensegrity structures has not yet been investigated in the literature, and could pave the way to the use of ‘tensegrity lattices’ (or ‘crystals’) as novel materials to control stress propagation and produce energy trapping (cf., e. g., Fraternali et al. (2010 a,b); Daraio et al.

40|$|Diseases {{which are}} {{prevalent}} in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as Crohn's disease, are a topic of increasing concern because diagnosis and specific treatment are difficult and may be ineffective. New techniques are therefore sought after and this paper describes a proof-of-concept tethered capsule for targeted drug delivery (TDD) in the GI tract. The capsule consists of a camera, illumination, a drug delivery channel and an ultrasound (US) transducer. The transducer is described in detail, including a comparison of different piezoceramic materials that has been carried out. It was found that PZ 54 (Ferroperm Piezoceramics, Kvistgaard, Denmark) was the most suitable material for our application. When driven at 4 Vpp, the outer diameter 5 mm PZ 54 transducer operates at a frequency f = 4. 05 MHz providing an acoustic pressure, Pac = 125 kPa, with a beam diameter, BD = 0. 75 mm at the <b>focus.</b> <b>Pressures</b> in the range 50 - 300 kPa have been previously reported as suitable for sonoporation, a process vital in many TDD applications, {{so this is a}} promising result. Basic functional testing of the capsule was performed by supplying glass microbubbles (MBs) through the drug delivery channel into the US focus, monitored via the onboard camera. It was found that the acoustic radiation forces have a clear influence on the MBs, significantly changing their direction at the US focus. This suggests that drugs may be targeted to specific tissue in the GI tract by the new capsule. The results translate into a capsule configuration with the potential to be clinically and biologically useful...|$|R
