5|$|The {{paternoster}} lifts {{that serve}} the nine <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> famous, and are {{popular with the}} university students. After the recent restoration, the university has pledged to preserve them in perpetuity.|$|E
5|$|All five <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. The rooms of the upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
5|$|Most of the UCSC {{undergraduate}} {{housing is}} affiliated {{with one of the}} ten residential colleges. The residence halls, which include both shared and private rooms, typically house fifteen to twenty students per floor and have common bathrooms and lounge areas. Some halls have coed floors where men and women share bathroom facilities, others have separate bathroom facilities for men and women. Single-gender, gender-neutral and substance-free <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> also available.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} occupies 900 sq metre. There <b>are</b> three <b>floors.</b> On {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> six departure service desks. On the first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> six arrival service desks. Second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> for office use.|$|R
5000|$|The southwestern {{interior}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> partly overlaid by {{the outer}} [...] of Ioffe. The northern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> marked by several small craters, while the southeastern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> impacted {{by a number}} of tiny craterlets.|$|R
50|$|From {{the fourth}} to the {{eleventh}} {{floor of the}} main building, there are 196 rooms. The eleventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> especially designed for business rooms; the tenth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> non-smoking and the twelfth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> for presidential suites.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning the upper <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> much smaller in area than lower levels. Outrigger trusses {{at the top}} of the building and at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area. The base of the building features a small park, for which the tower is named.|$|E
5|$|The {{premises}} at 6â€“9 Carlton House Terrace is a Grade I {{listed building}} and the current headquarters of the Royal Society, which had moved there from Burlington House in 1967. The ground floor and basement are used for ceremonies, social and publicity events, the first floor hosts facilities for Fellows and Officers of the Society, and {{the second and third}} <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> divided between offices and accommodation for the President, Executive Secretary and Fellows.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
50|$|The {{museum is}} a three-story building. The first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the lobby, {{entrance}} and administrative {{offices of the}} museum. The second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the handover gifts exhibition gallery and the special exhibition gallery. The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the auditorium.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, {{its first}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> a Trailways Bus station and its second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> unused.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as {{the library}} and the second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the meeting room.|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} original woodwork, sills, door frames, {{and interior}} doors, are all solid oak. The interior walls are 12inches thick and, either painted or covered with paneling. An open, double staircase leads {{from the first}} floor to {{the second and third}} floors and the center of the building houses an elevator which moves from the basement to the third floor. The interior <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> all white pine wood, though some of the floors have now been carpeted. First floor ceilings are 15feet high, with doors at a height of 12feet. The second floor features the courtrooms, which, through the 1980s remodel, had the ceilings lowered to 10feet. The interior renovation was completed at a cost of US$1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{restored}} east range measures around 31m by 10m, with a {{pitched roof}} and crow-step gables. It is entered through a richly carved doorway, dated 1622 and initialled SWS for Sir William Sinclair, which gives {{access to the}} third floor. The three lower <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> cut into the rock, and each has four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower. These lower levels were used for service rooms, with the principal rooms in the two upper floors. At the lowest level was a kitchen, with a bakehouse above. On the exterior, gunloops are found on the south wall, with several shot-holes on the east.|$|E
5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily {{in the fact that}} its rooms are single occupancy. The rooms are 2/3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B, and like Tower A and Tower B, every third floor has a lounge containing a television, couches, and tables for extra study. In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E
5000|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{interior}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> partly overlaid by the outer [...] and ejecta from Von Zeipel. The southern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> marked by an arc of small impacts. The northern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> more level and is marked only by a few small craterlets.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the {{interior}} has {{a mixture of}} timber boarded and concrete floors {{on the ground floor}} and timber boarded floors on the first floor. The interior walls of the ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered masonry and the internal walls of the first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> mostly rendered masonry with some timber boarded partitioning. The ceilings of the ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered plaster and plasterboard and the ceilings on the first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> timber boarded. Generally, {{the interior}} of the ground <b>floor</b> has <b>been</b> altered both in finish and planning and the interior of the first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> more intact. Features such as the ground floor fireplaces, coat of arms and the platform in the hall are no longer there.|$|R
50|$|As at March 2016, {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> {{occupied}} {{by a number of}} shops, while the upper <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a 3-bedroom apartment.|$|R
5|$|When the {{building}} {{was transformed into a}} mosque from a cathedral, most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced, but the mosque's facade with its arched entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture, and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style. Some of the columns have been identified as elements of an ancient synagogue, reused as construction material in the Crusader era and still forming part of the mosque. Internally, the wall surfaces are plastered and painted. Marble is used for the western door and the dome's oculus. The <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> covered with glazed tiles. The columns are also marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style.|$|E
5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third <b>floors,</b> <b>are</b> a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace {{the bottom of the stairs}} as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|The Museum {{building}} {{consists of}} a three-level base building that is {{closed to the public}} and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house light-sensitive art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.|$|E
50|$|Nightingale <b>floors</b> (uguisubari) , <b>were</b> <b>floors</b> {{designed}} to make a chirping sound when walked upon. These <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> used in the hallways of some temples and palaces, the most famous example being Nijo Castle, in Kyoto, Japan. Dry boards naturally creak under pressure, but these <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> designed so that the flooring nails rubbed against a jacket or clamp, causing chirping noises. The squeaking <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> used as a security device, assuring that none could sneak through the corridors undetected.|$|R
5000|$|The Warehouse {{houses the}} Syracuse University School of Design. The ground floor offers a cafe, reading room, {{community}} classrooms, lecture hall, and work spaces, a community exhibition space {{and an international}} contemporary art gallery, and is the most public space in The Warehouse. The first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the School of Design administrative offices, a large lecture space, a digital fabrication lab/wood shop, and the Genet Art Gallery. The second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a climate-controlled storage space for the SU library. The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Communications Design program; the fourth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the MFA in Collaborative Design, the Museum Studies program, and the Syracuse University Office of Community Engagement and Economic Development; the fifth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Industrial + Interaction Design program; the sixth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Environmental + Interior Design (EDI) program; and the seventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Fashion Design program. Part of The Warehouse's basement contains spray booths and a [...] "dirty room" [...] for messy projects.|$|R
50|$|QRE Plaza {{was home}} to China's only Fatburger, other than the Macau Fatburger inside The Venetian. Quemo Hong Kong, inaugurated {{in the spring of}} 2013, is a Spanish {{restaurant}} serving a capacity of about 50. It is situated on the fifth floor and contains a patio. On the seventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a branch of Happy Foot, a reflexology clinic, on the nineteenth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the VIM Pilates Studio, and on the twentieth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the Action Sports Academy.On the ninth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the W28 Steak House.|$|R
5|$|The {{central area}} of the city serves as a {{satellite}} of nearby Nagoya, which has larges offices of many international companies, including Toyota. The ease of commute between the two cities, {{as well as the}} plentiful apartment construction underway, has contributed to this distinction. Just west of Gifu Station is Gifu City Tower 43, a 43-story high-rise building developed by Takenaka Corporation that opened on October 13, 2007 as the tallest building in Gifu Prefecture. The upper 30 <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> divided into two- and three-bedroom apartments, including those for senior citizens. The lower floors will be used as offices or shops for targeted services such as medical care. Additionally, public space exists {{at the top of the}} building, allowing residents another 360-degree view of Gifu, complementing that offered from Gifu Castle.|$|E
5|$|The cratered terrain, {{a rolling}} surface covered by {{numerous}} impact craters and centered on Ariel's south pole, is the moon's {{oldest and most}} geographically extensive geological unit. It is intersected by a network of scarps, canyons (graben), and narrow ridges mainly occurring in Ariel's mid-southern latitudes. The canyons, known as chasmata, probably represent graben formed by extensional faulting, which resulted from global tensional stresses caused by the freezing of water (or aqueous ammonia) in the moon's interior (see below). They are 15â€“50km wide and trend mainly in an east- or northeasterly direction. The floors of many canyons are convex; rising up by 1â€“2km. Sometimes the <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> separated from the walls of canyons by grooves (troughs) about 1km wide. The widest graben have grooves running along the crests of their convex floors, which are called valles. The longest canyon is Kachina Chasma, at over 620km in length (the feature extends into the hemisphere of Ariel that Voyager 2 did not see illuminated).|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} has {{numerous}} classrooms, auditorium spaces, {{and support services}} for students, such as tutoring, the writing center, and technology assistance. Also {{on the first floor}} is a snack stop and a Starbucks. The second floor has the reference section, cartography (GIS Center), circulation, and numerous computer and printing labs. The third floor is the home of the Medical Library, and includes study lounges as well as a resource center for students of the Honors College. The fourth floor houses the special collections department and university archives. The fifth floor is the home of the School of Architecture Library, as well as the music and audiovisual collections. The sixth and seventh <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> strictly quiet floors, and contain the general book collection plus numerous student study lounges. The eighth floor contains the library's administration offices and technical services departments.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} masterâ€˜s {{thesis is}} to design a {{retirement}} home in SkrbeÅˆ. The building has three floors above ground with wall support system. In the first basement <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a technical background. The 1 st <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> rehabilitation, kitchen and dining room with facilities. In the 2 nd floor and 3 rd <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> the bed wards...|$|R
50|$|The building's ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> leased by the US Treasury Dept. from 1924-1935. The 10th-11th <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> the {{original}} {{location of the}} Arizona Club, including dining rooms, lounges, a library, and bedrooms for club members. When the Arizona Club {{moved out of the}} Luhrs Building in 1971, the upper <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> also converted to office floor space.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the first}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> not unusual. The stair to the vaults is not {{accessible}} {{in the present}} day. Some steps of the stairs {{that led to the}} second <b>floor</b> <b>are,</b> however, to be seen in a cupboard in the north-east corner. The second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> likely one room with plain stone corbels around the walls.|$|R
5|$|The latter, at the {{southwest}} corner of Southwest Third Avenue and Washington Street, is eight stories high, was built entirely of Oregon materials, and cost $300,000 in 1892 dollars. The first three stories of the Romanesque structure are of rough-cut sandstone; the top five <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> of red brick and unglazed terracotta with floral designs. Decorative machicolations (openings of the sort used in earlier eras for pouring pitch and dropping rocks on attackers) appear in the parapet {{at the top of the}} building. For eight years starting in 1893 Portland's government was headquartered in this structure, temporarily dubbed the Council Building. The exterior was renovated in 1987, and the interior opened to the nearby Hamilton Building in the 1990s. The Dekum Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and is part of the Skidmore/Old Town Historic District.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> uncertain; one theory is that the first floor was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{south tower}} forms an unequal {{pentagon}} in shape, and has three storeys with thick walls. The walls were built {{to contain the}} stairs and garderobes, the unevenly positioned empty spaces weakening the structure, and this meant that two large buttresses had {{to be added to}} the tower during its construction to support the walls. The current <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> Victorian in origin, having been built after the fire of 1830, but the tower remains unglazed, as in the 13th century, with shutters at the windows providing protection in winter. The basement was originally only accessible from the first floor, and would have provided a secure area for storage, in addition to also containing a well. The first floor, which formed the original entrance to the tower, contains a 17th-century fireplace, reusing the original 13th-century chimney. The second floor has been subdivided in the past, but has been restored to form a single chamber, as it would have been when first built.|$|E
50|$|The tower {{features}} {{three separate}} observation decks which constitute the floors {{above and below}} the aperture opening. The height of the lowest observation deck, located on the 94th <b>floor,</b> <b>is</b> 423 m; the second, on the 97th <b>floor,</b> <b>is</b> at a height of 439 m; and the highest, on the 100th <b>floor,</b> <b>is</b> 474 m high.|$|R
50|$|The mosque is {{a three-story}} {{building}} which covers {{an area of}} 1,890 m2 which can accommodate around 100 people. It has Arabic style with conical roof and arch-style doors and windows. The first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> used for restaurant area. The second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> used for meeting room, office room and dormitory room. The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the prayer hall.|$|R
5000|$|Helland Center - The Helland Center {{is home to}} the Student Life Center. On {{the first}} <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> tables and chairs, a {{convenience}} store, and service desk. On the second <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> the Student Life information desk, the Student Senate, and the college newspaper. On the third <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> the Student Health Center and student lockers.|$|R
