5|$|In September 2013, AMC {{announced}} they were developing a companion series to The Walking Dead which follows {{a different set}} of characters created by Robert Kirkman. On March 9, 2015, AMC announced it had ordered the show to series, with a two-season commitment. The show's title, <b>Fear</b> <b>the</b> Walking Dead, was revealed on March 27, 2015. The first season, consisting of six episodes, premiered on August 23, 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{the pilot}} {{episode of the}} AMC {{television}} series, <b>Fear</b> <b>the</b> Walking Dead, the novel Winesburg, Ohio is {{picked up in the}} church used as a drug den, from under a mattress, when character Madison Clark indicates it belongs to her son, Nick. Nick is shown reading and discussing the book in season 2, episode 1, which takes its title from the book's opening story.|$|E

5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European security arrangements. In the 1930s France started to <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public <b>fear.</b> <b>The</b> fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, {{but in the}} meantime, {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years.

5|$|The episode makes a {{reference}} to Blue Öyster Cult's hit song “(Don't <b>Fear)</b> <b>The</b> Reaper”, which also plays during the episode's end credits, and inspired {{the title of a}} later episode.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{shown at the}} 1994 Cannes Film Festival and {{broadcast}} on British television in 1995. Although originally intended for theatrical release, it failed to find a theatrical distributor, and was released straight to video in the United States in 1997 under the title Shades of <b>Fear.</b> <b>The</b> film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and while the lesbian sub-plot in particular was generally well received, Winterson's scripting was a focal point of criticism.|$|E
5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of <b>Fear.</b> <b>The</b> adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess.

Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing came of the submission.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{fear that}} is unlike all other fears. It has a special, clammy chill, a deadly gift for inspiring deeper, darker dread. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of unentered rooms, of bends in lonely roads. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> phone call {{in the middle of}} the night, of the {{stranger}} you recognize, perhaps from a nightmare. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> unexpected, the unfamiliar. It is <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of... <b>THE</b> UNKNOWN.|$|R
50|$|Some {{possible}} explanations of gephyrophobia may be <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of driving off <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of {{a gust of}} wind taking one off <b>the</b> bridge, a <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> structural integrity of the bridges itself, or <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that <b>the</b> bridge will collapse if they try to cross it. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> overlaps with acrophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of heights, as gephyrophobia tends to be exacerbated in tall bridges vs. ones close to the water/ground beneath.|$|R
60|$|But, <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> unknown? Is {{not that}} <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> unseen world? And {{is not that}} <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> spiritual world? Pardon me: {{a great deal of}} that fear--all of it, indeed, which is superstition--is simply not <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> spiritual, but of the material; and of nothing else.|$|R
5|$|Alien Rage {{was first}} {{announced}} in early April 2012, {{under the name}} Alien <b>Fear.</b> <b>The</b> game was to be developed using Unreal Engine 3 by City Interactive's Bydgoszcz Studio, and would have a cooperative gameplay (co-op) mode. The first screenshots from the game were released two months later, in June 2012. In May 2013 the game's name was changed to Alien Rage, and two months later {{it was announced that}} the game would be released on the personal computer, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on 24 September 2013.

5|$|In 2005, Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on <b>F.E.A.R.</b> <b>The</b> series was {{produced}} primarily by using the machinima technique of synchronizing video footage from video games to pre-recorded dialogue and other audio. The series was produced {{at the request of}} Monolith Productions {{as a part of a}} tie-in with the Director's Edition of the F.E.A.R., which the Rooster Teeth team used to produce the series. The mini-series consists of five episodes. Four of these have been released on the Rooster Teeth website, and one — episode 0, a prequel — originally shipped exclusively with the F.E.A.R. Director's Edition DVD. It is also included with the game's digital release on GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} been reintroduced to the gorge. White-tailed deer were {{imported}} from Michigan and released throughout Pennsylvania to reestablish {{what had once been}} a thriving population. The current population of deer in Pennsylvania are descended from the original stock introduced since 1906, after the lumbermen had moved out of the area. The deer population has grown so much that today they exceed their carrying capacity in many areas. River otters were successfully reintroduced in 1983 and now breed in the gorge. Despite the otters' diet of 5percent trout, some anglers <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> animals would deplete the game fish in the gorge.|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> in <b>the</b> human consciosness as natural and constructive psychological phenomenon indicating an objectless world. The author makes a conclusion as for emperical isolation of <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> determination in <b>the</b> applied psychology and its narrow phenomenological interpretation as well. It is analyzed <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> as <b>the</b> integral phenomenon. The author emphasizes that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> is objectivized {{in the culture}} and is undergone to the mechanism of minimization. Great {{attention is paid to}} <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> provocation of <b>the</b> depression interpreted as adaptive form of behaviour what in its turn allows a weak person to save power and prevent possible conflicts. Thus <b>fear</b> as <b>the</b> modus is considered to be the way of understanding its origin indicating not its substantial meaning but its peculiar «Ontological intensivity»...|$|R

After an earthquake and witnessing a nearby mountain begin to smoulder, he realises he has in fact materialised in Pompeii one day before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

5|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Indiana class included bilge keels, but with keels they would not fit {{in any of the}} American drydocks at the time, so they were omitted during construction. This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana, when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later, she promptly steamed back to port for <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels were necessary and they were subsequently installed on all three ships.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, {{to the extent that the}} jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E

5|$|Indiana was {{commissioned}} on 20 November 1895 {{under the command}} of Captain Robley D. Evans. After further trials, the ship joined the North Atlantic Squadron {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Francis M. Bunce, which conducted training exercises along the East Coast of the United States. In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for <b>fear</b> <b>the</b> clamps would break again. This convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because, with them, the ship could not fit in most American dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling, and they were subsequently installed on all three ships of the Indiana-class.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuya and Miyuki are {{siblings}} of {{the same}} year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba; their parents had a loveless forced marriage, and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves. Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the leader of the Yotsuba, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter. Out of <b>fear,</b> <b>the</b> Yotsuba rallied for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to take measures to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation, a powerful magician who will act as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second is to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her. During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya wards off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joins the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by major Kazama Harunobu. At some point during his life, Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the identity Taurus Silver.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Yokozuna and The Undertaker began at Survivor Series 1993. Yokozuna, who was pushed as an unstoppable monster, {{was unable to}} inflict any serious damage on The Undertaker when the two faced each other in an {{elimination}} match. Yokozuna slammed The Undertaker's head into the steel steps {{leading up to the}} ring, but The Undertaker was unharmed. Later, Yokozuna used his finishing move, the Banzai Drop, on The Undertaker. When he tried to repeat the move, however, The Undertaker became the first wrestler to sit up after the move, surprising Yokozuna and his managers. The Undertaker was granted a title shot, but Jim Cornette, Yokozuna's American spokesperson, included a clause in the contract that The Undertaker would not get a rematch if he lost. Paul Bearer, The Undertaker's manager, included a clause stating that the confrontation would take place in a Casket match. In the following weeks, it was revealed that Yokozuna had a fear of caskets. The Undertaker used this knowledge to gain a psychological advantage going into the match. On one occasion, Paul Bearer brought the casket to the ring to intimidate Yokozuna. When Yokozuna approached the casket to face his <b>fear,</b> <b>the</b> Undertaker popped out to scare Yokozuna.|$|E
