BAE Systems also offers various F-16 upgrades, receiving orders from South Korea, Oman, Turkey, and the US Air National Guard; BAE lost the South Korean contract {{due to a}} price breach in November 2014. In 2012, the USAF assigned the total upgrade contract to Lockheed Martin. Upgrades include Raytheon’s Center <b>Display</b> <b>Unit,</b> which replaces several analog flight instruments with a single digital display.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{predictive}} visual tracking {{is being}} studied as a screening technique to identify mild traumatic brain injury. A head-mounted <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> with eye-tracking capability shows a moving object in a predictive pattern {{for the person}} to follow with their eyes. People without brain injury {{will be able to}} track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory while it is hypothesized that those with mild traumatic brain injury cannot.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp {{in the nose}} was used to illuminate the target while the <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E

5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a direct indication of the target's relative position.|$|E

Alternative output devices are tape perforators and computer storage media.|$|E
25|$|Small {{compasses}} {{found in}} clocks, mobile phones, and other electronic devices are solid-state microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) compasses, usually {{built out of}} two or three magnetic field sensors that provide data for a microprocessor. Often, the device is a discrete component which outputs either a digital or analog signal proportional to its orientation. This signal is interpreted by a controller or microprocessor and either used internally, or sent to a <b>display</b> <b>unit.</b> The sensor uses highly calibrated internal electronics to measure the response of the device to the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|The GT-R reappeared in 1999, with {{a revised}} chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos {{received}} a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models. The biggest feature and most significant feature to the R34 GT-R that wasn't seen {{on any other}} model skyline was the <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> {{at the top of}} the dashboard. This <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> was very significant for the car at its time. This display showed many of the cars engine stats including boost pressure, oil temp, water temp and more. As a 1999 car this kind of technology was very rare and advanced at the time. The display was capable of showing the G-force that the car was under when driving and there was also a lap timer that could be started by a button that was located near the gear lever. There was a computer jack lead hidden underneath the left passenger side skirt that could be used to transfer driving data from the car to a laptop. This could only be done with a Japanese version of Windows and Japanese software, which today is very hard to come by.|$|E
25|$|On {{portions}} of the railroad equipped with ASC, Engineers consult the speed <b>display</b> <b>unit,</b> which is capable of displaying 7 speed indications. They are 80,70,60,40,30,15 on electric trains while some diesel locomotives have slightly lower speed-steps {{when compared to the}} electrics. As a result of a December 1, 2013, train derailment in the Bronx on the Metro-North Railroad, railroads with similar cab signal systems to Metro-North, such as the LIRR, were ordered to modify the systems to enforce certain speed limit changes, which has resulted in lower average speeds and actual speed limits across the LIRR.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} this {{directive}} in the United Kingdom is that most traders cannot legally use weighing devices calibrated in units other than SI units. In 2000, after the deadline for the cessation of selling loose produce by imperial units had passed, some traders continued to sell produce from their market stalls using imperial-only scales. They were variously prosecuted for using unlawful scales, giving short measure and failing to <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> price per kilogram.

25|$|The {{net sounder}} is an echo sounder with a {{transducer}} {{mounted on the}} headline of the net {{rather than on the}} bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the <b>display</b> <b>unit,</b> which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other <b>display</b> <b>unit</b> is fitted to the centre console and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in the front passenger seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to see around the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E

This problem could potentially be solved with modular smartphones or Phonebloks. These types of phones are more durable and have the technology to change certain parts of the phone making them more environmentally friendly. Being able to simply replace the part of the phone that is broken will reduce e-waste.|$|R
