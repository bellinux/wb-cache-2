25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler.

Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew.

40|$|Due to {{the great}} number of <b>greater</b> <b>flamingos</b> in captivity and their long life span, {{studying}} their behavior and welfare might be useful to improve the husbandry and breeding of this species in zoos. This study aimed to investigate factors affecting the breeding activity of captive <b>greater</b> <b>flamingos</b> (Phoenicopterus roseus) from 2012 to 2016. To estimate reproductive success, the number of pairs, eggs laid, and hatchlings were recorded. In addition, information on age, egg-laying history of the partners, and pair composition was collected. An {{increase in the number}} of pairs, eggs, and hatchlings was reported over the years. For each breeding season, there were pairs who laid more than once, especially in 2014 and 2015. Approximately 50 % of pairs were monogamous between consecutive years; however, the percentage dropped gradually when comparing nonconsecutive years. Senescence and previous experience seemed to affect the reproductive success of the study flamingos. In conclusion, different factors can influence the reproduction of <b>greater</b> <b>flamingos</b> in zoos. All these factors are related to nonhuman animal welfare and need to be considered in developing and improving management practices...|$|R
2500|$|Greater, {{also known}} as Flamingo One and Flamingo 1, [...] (died January 30, 2014) was the world's oldest <b>greater</b> <b>flamingo</b> (Phoenicopterus roseus), {{residing}} at the Adelaide Zoo in Adelaide, Australia. It was at least 83 years old, having arrived at the zoo from either Cairo or Hamburg (records are unclear) in either 1933, 1930, 1925, or 1919 (the dates {{of the last four}} importations of greater flamingos to the Adelaide Zoo) [...] at which point it was already a full-grown adult.

2500|$|Almost no {{species in}} the Persian Gulf is spared from the real estate {{development}} of UAE and Oman, including the hawksbill turtle, <b>greater</b> <b>flamingo,</b> and booted warbler, mainly due to destruction of the mangrove habitats {{to make way for}} towers, hotels, and luxury resorts. Even dolphins that frequent the gulf in northern waters, around Iran are at serious risk. Recent statistics and observations show that dolphins are at danger of entrapment in purse seine fishing nets and exposure to chemical pollutants; perhaps the most alarming sign is the [...] "mass suicides" [...] committed by dolphins off Iran's Hormozgan province, which are not well understood, but are suspected to be linked with a deteriorating marine environment from water pollution from oil, sewage, and industrial run offs.|$|E
