5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's <b>gift</b> <b>shop,</b> only {{to end up in}} another <b>gift</b> <b>shop.</b> The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to pass through a <b>gift</b> <b>shop.</b> The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production.
