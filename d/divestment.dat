40|$|Most {{studies on}} Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) {{focus on the}} impact of their {{expansion}} through inward or outward foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. However, <b>divestments</b> are quite common among the operations of MNEs. In order to derive their effects, we build a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that includes two non-standard characteristics: the presence of MNEs and unemployment. The model is applied to the Spanish economy, where FDI inflows have surpassed <b>divestments</b> at the aggregate level in the period 2005 - 2009, although <b>divestments</b> have been sizeable in ten sectors. We analyse two different scenarios: 1) <b>divestments</b> that involve the closure of plants of foreign affiliates and 2) <b>divestments</b> where national firms buy the plant of foreign affiliates. The model allows estimating the overall impact of the <b>divestments</b> occurring simultaneously in ten sectors and in particular sectors. Results not only show that national acquisitions are less harmful than closures, but quantify those effects, and provide information {{on the role of the}} divesting sector. Some adjustment costs arise in all scenarios...|$|R

5|$|Further student protests, {{including}} {{hunger strike}} and more barricades of Hamilton Hall and the Business School {{during the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following {{a celebration of the}} tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial <b>divestment</b> of a U.S. university.|$|E
5|$|The {{estate was}} first {{opened to the}} public in 1953 by Albert, to {{mitigate}} against taxation, and Althorp had its own railway station called Althorp Park on the Northampton Loop Line until 1960. After his death in 1975, Albert passed Althorp to his son Edward John, 8th Earl Spencer, who had served as Equerry to King George VI (1950–52) and to Queen Elizabeth II (1952–54). Edward was a wine connoisseur and had an extensive wine cellar at Althorp. He made his own wine and attracted fellow connoisseurs {{from around the world to}} Althorp, although he did not sell much of it. During Edward's ownership of Althorp approximately 20% of the furnishings of Althorp were sold off. The <b>divestment</b> included eleven Van Dykes and nearly every religious painting in the collection, as well as estate housing, and drew severe public criticism, including from the heir.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the adequacy of the present theoretical knowledge relating to <b>divestments</b> and de-internationalization in the context of explaining the backshoring phenomenon – a relatively new, but gaining in importance specific behaviour of companies in the process of internationalization. Research Design & Methods: The paper discusses various aspects of contemporary processes of internationalization. The employed research design is qualitative – the study has been based on conclusions drawn from critical literature studies. Findings: Although backshoring shares some common characteristics with the concepts of de-internationalization and international <b>divestments,</b> there are several noticeable differences: e. g. both de-internationalization and international <b>divestments</b> are rather related to wholly owned subsidiaries, while backshoring includes both activities outsourced to company’s foreign suppliers and to its subsidiaries. Implications & Recommendations: It is necessary to develop new concepts that in a holistic way will define the decision-making process of enterprises which use de-internationalization and backshoring of business processes as part of their long-term internationalization strategies. The article indicates some dependencies and issues that must be considered in formulating new theoretical proposals. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this study lies in the in-depth analysis of the similarities and differences between the processes of de-internationalization/international <b>divestments</b> and backshoring...|$|R

Excess returns are significantly both negative and higher for financially distressed firms than for healthy firms.

In April 2015, Divest Harvard and Harvard alumni carried out an announced week-long protest called Harvard Heat Week, which included rallies, marches, public outreach, and a continuous civil disobedience blockade of administrative buildings on campus.
