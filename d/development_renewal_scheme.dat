40|$|Irrigation <b>renewal</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are taking}} place {{globally}} for water conservation and gains in agricultural productivity, as competition for water resources increases. The publically-funded renewal of irrigation infrastructure is a key platform of water reform in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin; it is considered {{by some to be}} a policy that contradicts market-based approaches. In this Australian study, we examine an irrigation <b>renewal</b> <b>scheme</b> in northern Victoria resulting from a large investment by the State and Federal Governments. The long historical development of infrastructure and institutions for irrigation in the region led to technological lock-in and exposure to international terms of trade and climate change. From interviews with water professionals involved in the region, three key themes were identified through an adapted grounded theory approach: (1) a lack of an appropriate platform for fostering community involvement in what was a large-scale investment of public money; (2) issues in the way that water losses and savings were calculated; and (3) contradictions in policies for water buyback and irrigation renewal that lead to some irrigators being disadvantaged. To better understand the situation, we also applied a theoretical lens based on social learning. We conclude that the framing of a water ‘crisis’ was used to the benefit of some irrigators in attracting large-scale investment of public funds for irrigation renewal. The proposed solution, a technologically-driven irrigation <b>renewal</b> <b>scheme,</b> was implemented at a pace that didn’t match the planning horizons for many, leading many to exit from irrigated agriculture. Systemic insights for the design and implementation of irrigation <b>renewal</b> <b>schemes</b> internationally are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|In sensor networks, sensors {{are likely}} to be c aptured by attackers because they are usually {{deployed}} in an unprotected or even a hostile environment. If an adversarial compromises a sensor, he/she uses the keys from the compromised sensor to uncover the keys of others sensors. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} renew the keys of sensors in a proactive or reactive manner. Even though many group key <b>renewal</b> <b>schemes</b> have been proposed, they have some security flaws. First, they employ a single group key in a cluster so that the compromise of one sensor discloses the group key. Second, they evict the compromised nodes by updating the compromised keys with non-compromised keys. This eviction scheme is useless when the non-compromised keys are exhausted due to the increase of compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose a lightweight key <b>renewal</b> <b>scheme,</b> which evicts the compromised nodes clearly by reforming clusters excluding compromised nodes. Besides, in a cluster, each member employs a pairwise key for communication with its CH (Cluster Head) so that our scheme is tolerable against sensor compromise. Our simulation results prove that the proposed scheme is more tolerable against the compromise of sensors and it is more energy-saving than the group key <b>renewal</b> <b>schemes.</b> </span...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{conflict}} taking place between regional and community interests. This tension is nothing new. Often times this conflict is borne out of urban <b>renewal</b> <b>schemes</b> and major infrastructure interventions in core neighbourhoods. As the ‘back to the city’ trend increases however, these conflicts {{are more and more}} likely to push into first-ring and postwar suburbs. With intensification policy, like with urban <b>renewal</b> <b>schemes</b> of old, it is the small things that get lost in the shuffle. In Ottawa, Canada, this conflict is being fought over character; sun, trees, parking, landscaping, setbacks, and affordability. These are not the most glamorous aspects of architectural design and many would argue change is inevitable. But if these characteristics were in fact founding tenets of a residential community, then policy makers ought make every effort to protect them as they set and pursue intensification targets. Unfortunately these low-density residential streets have fallen into a policy blind-spot and city planners are currently scrambling to refine new bylaws aimed at curbing invasive, or excessive, developments. So how do we add more people to these neighbourhoods without the wholesale replacement of the existing housing stock? For the suburb of Overbrook the answer may be to take a page out of the 50 ’s and go small, extra small. The introduction of coach houses would unlock a much needed source of infill for this neighbourhood, and many like it across the country. This thesis proposes their regulation and deployment aided by a federal initiative inspired by the postwar Small House Design Scheme of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation...|$|R
