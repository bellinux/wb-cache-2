5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of central <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were central <b>government</b> <b>officials</b> delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment.|$|E

40|$|The {{lobbying}} {{process has}} been described as an auction (see, for instance, Bernheim and Whinston [4]). While the auction rules picked are supposed to be descriptive, they vary from author to author. Examples show that these different auction rules make different predictions of what policy is the outcome of the lobbying process. Further, which proposed auction rule is the most preferred by the <b>government</b> <b>official</b> depends on the preferences of lobbies. If off-the-equilibrium negative contributions (i. e., contributions from the <b>government</b> <b>official</b> to lobbies) are possible, there is a best possible auction for the <b>government</b> <b>official.</b> Such an auction leads to the same policy as in [4], although contributions are higher. If negative contributions are not possible, the <b>government</b> <b>official</b> is made worse off. It follows that since the auction rules used in the literature to describe lobbying do not allow negative contributions, none of them are optimal from the <b>government</b> <b>official's</b> perspective. ...|$|R
