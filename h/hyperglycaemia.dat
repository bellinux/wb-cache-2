500|$|The {{first time}} the church was held liable (overturned on appeal) was in 1993 after 11-year-old Ian Lundman died of <b>hyperglycaemia</b> in Minnesota in 1989. The church sent a Christian Science nurse to sit with him; doctors testified {{that he could have}} been saved by an insulin {{injection}} up to two hours before his death. The mother and stepfather were charged with manslaughter, but the charges were dismissed. The boy's father sued the mother, stepfather, practitioner, nurse, nursing home and church. He was awarded $5.2 million compensatory damages, later reduced to $1.5 million, and $9 million in punitive damages against the church. The Minnesota State Court of Appeals overturned the award against the church and nursing home in 1995, finding that a judgment that forced the church to [...] "abandon teaching its central tenet" [...] was unconstitutional, and that, while the individuals had a duty of care toward the boy, the church and nursing home did not.|$|E

50|$|The PPARGC1A gene regulates genes {{involved}} in energy metabolism.

50|$|Hyperglycemia, or {{high blood}} sugar (also spelled <b>hyperglycaemia</b> or <b>hyperglycæmia)</b> is a {{condition}} in which an excessive amount of glucose circulates in the blood plasma. This is generally a blood sugar level higher than 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), but symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher values such as 15-20 mmol/l (~250-300 mg/dl). A subject with a consistent range between ~5.6 and ~7 mmol/l (100-126 mg/dl) (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered slightly hyperglycemic, while above 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) is generally held to have diabetes. For diabetics, glucose levels that are considered to be too hyperglycemic can vary from person to person, mainly due to the person's renal threshold of glucose and overall glucose tolerance. On average however, chronic levels above 10-12 mmol/L (180-216 mg/dL) can produce noticeable organ damage over time.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} shown that cells that lack insulin (or are {{insensitive}} to insulin) overexpress PDK4.

50|$|Hyperinsulinemia, or hyperinsulinaemia is a {{condition}} in which there are excess levels of insulin circulating in the blood relative to the level of glucose. While it is often mistaken for diabetes or <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> hyperinsulinemia can result from a variety of metabolic diseases and conditions. While hyperinsulinemia is often seen in people with early stage type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is not the cause of the condition and is only one symptom of the disease. Type 1 diabetes only occurs when pancreatic beta-cell function is impaired. Hyperinsulinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, in neonates and in drug induced hyperinsulinemia. It can also occur in congenital hyperinsulism, including nesidioblastosis.|$|E
50|$|The hormone {{glucagon}} {{was discovered}} by C. P. Kimball and John R. Murlin in 1923 as a hyperglycaemic (blood-sugar elevating) substance along the pancreatic extracts. Its true biological importance was not known and the name itself was ignored. At the time de Duve joined Bouckaert at Leuven university to work on insulin, it still remained a mystery. Insulin was the first commercial hormonal drug originally produced by the Eli Lilly and Company since 1921, but their extraction suffered from impurity which caused mild <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> the very opposite of what they expected. In May 1944 de Duve realised that the insulin impurity could be removed by crystallisation. He demonstrated that the insulin produced of ELi Lilly was contaminated by the impurity, whereas that of the Danish Novo was not. The Eli Lilly insulin caused initial <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> and the Novo insulin did not when he injected them into rats. His experiments were published in 1947, following which the Eli Lilly upgraded its method to produce purified insulin. By then he had joined Carl and Gerti Cori's at Washington University in St. Louis, where he worked with a fellow researcher Earl Wilbur Sutherland, Jr. (who later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971). Sutherland {{had been working on}} the insulin-impurity substance and had named it hyperglycemic-glycogenolytic (HG) factor. He and de Duve immediately discovered that the HG factor was synthesised not only by the pancreas but, surprisingly, by the gastric mucosa and certain other parts of the digestive tract. They further found that the hormone was produced from pancreatic islets by cells differing from the insulin-producing beta cells, presumably the alpha cells. It was de Duve who realised that Sutherland's HG factor was glucagon, and this rediscovery led to its permanent name, which he reintroduced it in 1951. They showed that glucagon was the major hormone influencing the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis) in the liver, by which more sugars are produced in the blood. de Duve's original hypothesis that glucagon was produced by pancreatic alpha cells was proved right when it was demonstrated that selectively cobalt-damage alpha cells stopped producing glucagon in guinea pigs, and finally isolated the purified hormone in 1953, including those from birds.|$|E
50|$|In this approach, {{transcription}} {{factors from}} progenitor {{cells of the}} target cell type are transfected into a somatic cell to induce transdifferentiation. There exists two different means of determining which transcription factors to use: by starting with a large pool and narrowing down factors one by one or by starting {{with one or two}} and adding more. One theory to explain the exact specifics is that ectopic TFs directs the cell to an earlier progenitor state and then redirects it towards a new cell type. Rearrangement of the chromatin structure via DNA methylation or histone modification may play a role as well. Here is a list of in vitro examples and in vivo examples. In vivo methods of transfecting specific mouse cells utilize the same kinds of vectors as in vitro experiments, except that the vector is injected into a specific organ. Zhou et al. (2008) injected Ngn3, Pdx1 and Mafa into the dorsal splenic lobe (pancreas) of mice to reprogram pancreatic exocrine cells into β-cells in order to ameliorate <b>hyperglycaemia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} may have their C-peptide levels measured {{as a means}} of distinguishing type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes or Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Measuring C-peptide can help to determine how much of their own natural insulin a person is producing as C-peptide is secreted in equimolar amounts to insulin. C-peptide levels are measured instead of insulin levels because C-peptide can assess a person's own insulin secretion even if they receive insulin injections, and because the liver metabolizes a large and variable amount of insulin secreted into the portal vein but does not metabolise C-peptide, meaning blood C-peptide may be a better measure of portal insulin secretion than insulin itself. [...] A very low C-peptide confirms Type 1 diabetes and insulin dependence and is associated with high glucose variability, <b>hyperglycaemia</b> and increased complications. The test may be less helpful close to diagnosis, particularly where a patient is overweight and insulin resistant, as levels close to diagnosis in Type 1 diabetes may be high and overlap with those seen in type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|... miR-375 is {{specifically}} {{expressed in the}} pancreatic islets, brain and spinal cord. [...] miR-375 {{was one of the}} first miRNAs identified in the pancreas (Poy et al., 2004), and remains one of the best characterised in terms of function. It is expressed in the pancreas and pituitary gland, organs linked by their role in hormone secretion, and expression levels increase during pancreas organogenesis. Loss-of-function studies showed that miR-375 is essential for β-cell formation in zebrafish (Kloosterman et al., 2007). miR-375 knockout mice have decreased numbers of β-cells and increased numbers of α-cells. The increase in glucagon levels, combined with the reduction in insulin levels, results in <b>hyperglycaemia.</b> This shows the importance of miR-375 in the establishment of normal pancreatic cell mass through the targeting of a group of genes which control cellular growth and proliferation in the developing pancreas (Poy et al., 2009). Further evidence for the involvement of miR-375 in pancreas development includes the fact that its expression is regulated by several transcription factors important in pancreatic development and function, including HNF6, INSM1, NGN3, NEUROD1, and PDX-1 (Keller et al., 2007).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the time required for plasma fructosamine concentration to increase after the onset of <b>hyperglycaemia</b> and decrease after resolution of <b>hyperglycaemia.</b> Healthy cats (n = 14) were infused to maintain either moderate <b>hyperglycaemia</b> (n = 5) (actual mean glucose 17 mmol/l) or marked <b>hyperglycaemia</b> (n = 9) (actual 29 mmol/l) for 42 days. Fructosamine exceeded the upper limit of the reference range (331 μmol/l) after 3 – 5 days of marked <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> took 20 days to plateau and, after cessation of infusion, took 5 days to return to baseline. Fructosamine concentration for moderate <b>hyperglycaemia</b> took longer to exceed the reference range (7 days, range 4 – 14 days), and fewer days to plateau (8 days) and return to baseline (1 day). In cats with moderate <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> fructosamine concentration mostly fluctuated under the upper limit of the reference range.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis Acute <b>hyperglycaemia</b> rapidly {{suppresses}} endogenous glucose production (EGP) in non-diabetic indi-viduals, {{mainly by}} inhibiting glycogenolysis. Loss of this ‘glucose effectiveness ’ contributes to fasting hyperglycae-mia in {{type 2 diabetes}}. Elevated NEFA levels characteristic of type 2 diabetes impair glucose effectiveness, although the mechanism is not fully understood. Therefore we examined the impact of increasing NEFA levels {{on the ability of}} <b>hyperglycaemia</b> to regulate pathways of EGP. Methods We performed 4 h ‘pancreatic clamp ’ studies (somatostatin; basal glucagon/growth hormone/insulin) in seven non-diabetic individuals. Glucose fluxes (D-[6, 6 - 2 H 2] glucose) and hepatic glycogen concentrations (13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopy) were quantified under three condi-tions: euglycaemia, <b>hyperglycaemia</b> and <b>hyperglycaemia</b> with elevated NEFA (HY-NEFA). Results EGP was suppressed by <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> but not by HY-NEFA. Hepatic glycogen concentration decreased ∼ 14 % with prolonged fasting during euglycaemia and in-creased by ∼ 12 % with <b>hyperglycaemia.</b> In contrast, raising NEFA levels in HY-NEFA caused a substantial ∼ 23 % re-duction in hepatic glycogen concentration. Moreover, rates of gluconeogenesis were decreased with <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> but increased with HY-NEFA. Conclusions/interpretation Increased NEFA appear to pro-foundly blunt the ability of <b>hyperglycaemia</b> to inhibit net glycogenolysis under basal hormonal conditions...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: Diabetes is {{associated}} with increased mortality in older adults, but the specific contributions of diabetes-associated clinical conditions and of increasing <b>hyperglycaemia</b> to mortality risk are unknown. We evaluated whether cardiovascular disease, comorbidities, or degree of <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> particularly severe <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> affected diabetes-related mortality risk in older, disabled women. METHODS: Six-year mortality follow-up of {{a random sample of}} 576 disabled women (aged 65 - 101 years), recruited from the Medicare eligibility list in Baltimore (MD, USA). All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were evaluated by diabetes status: no diabetes; diabetes with mild, moderate, and severe <b>hyperglycaemia</b> [defined by tertiles of glycosylated haemoglobin (GHB) among women with diabetes]. RESULTS: Diabetes with mild, moderate, and severe <b>hyperglycaemia</b> was associated with an increased hazard rate (HR) for all-cause mortality, even after adjustment for demographics, risks for cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular conditions, and other known mortality risks. A dose-response effect was suggested [mild <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> HR 1. 81, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 03, 3. 17; moderate <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> HR 2. 02, 95 % CI 1. 34, 3. 57; severe <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> HR 2. 22, 95 % CI 1. 17, 4. 25]. Women with diabetes had a significantly increased HR for non-cardiovascular death, but not for cardiovascular death, compared with those without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, whether characterized by mild, moderate or severe <b>hyperglycaemia,</b> appears to be an independent risk factor for excess mortality in older disabled women and this risk may increase with increasing <b>hyperglycaemia.</b> This mortality risk is not completely explained by vascular complications, and involves non-cardiovascular deaths.
