It's {{been a year}} since he graduated law school with average grades and he still hasn't been able to land a job. Numerous rejections are starting to affect his self-confidence and he's beginning to feel inadequate in front of Branka who graduated medicine with top marks the same year he did, but, unlike him, right away found a job that she's now excelling at. Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity {{to tell him about}} it. At the unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up.
