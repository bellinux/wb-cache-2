The four current meter daily time series, at depths around 200 m, were smoothed over 1 month; the altimetric geostrophic velocities were computed from sea surface slopes over 142 km every 17 days. The correlation coefficients between the current meter and altimetric geostrophic velocities range between 0. 64 and 0. 90 for the moorings near 29 øN but between 0. 32 and 0. 71 for the two around 21 øN; the associated rms discrepancies between the two measurement ypes range between 1. 5 and 4. 4 cm/s, which is 49 % to 127 % of the rms of the respective current meter time series. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>heights</b> relative to 1950 dbar fo...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{sea surface}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>heights</b> (CSSDH) are {{calculated}} from both sea sur-face <b>dynamic</b> <b>heights</b> that {{are derived from}} altimetric data of ERS- 2 and mean sea surface that is calculated by a numerical model. The CSSDH are consistent with sea surface temperature obtained by satellite and observed water temperature. Assum-ing the geostrophic balance, sea surface current velocities are calculated. It is found that temporal and spatial variations of sea surface circulation are considerably strong. In order to examine the characteristics of temporal and spatial variation of current pattern, EOF analysis is carried out with use of the CSSDH for 3. 5 years. The spatial and temporal variations of mode 1 indicate the strength or weakness of sea surface circulation over the entire Japan Sea associated with seasonal variation of volume transport through the Tsushima Strait. The spatial and temporal variations of mode 2 mostly indicate the temporal variation of the second branch of the Tsushima Warm Current and the East Korean Warm Current. It is suggested that this variation is possibly associated with the seasonal variation of volume transport through the west channel of the Tsushima Strait. Variations of mode 3 indicate the interannual vari...|$|R

Further, the low-frequency variability is correlated with low-frequency changes in the depth of the pycnocline, which suggests a simple physical mechanism to account for the low-frequency modulations in the internal tidal amplitude. These modulations are coherent for long distances along the Hawaiian Ridge, indicating a coherent generation of the internal tide that is consistent with acoustic observations in the North Pacific and with recent analyses of sea surface heights from satellite altimetry...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Past {{experiences}} with ERS and Topex/Poseidon altimeter data {{have shown that}} rain can significantly alter the quality of altimeter measurements (<b>dynamic</b> <b>heights,</b> significant wave heights, wind speed) [1][2][3][4]. Among all the different atmospheric phenomena which can affect the altimeter measurement, rain {{is one of the}} less well understood and at present no reliable correction can be made for the whole range of geophysical parameters. To avoid any contamination by rain, the data which might possibly be affected are simply discarded using a flag set by using concurrent passive microwave radiometer measurements. These passive microwave data are also used to calculate an atmospheric water vapour correction to the height and can also give an estimate of atmospheric liquid water [5]. Recent studies [2][3] have analysed the effects of rain on the dual frequency (Ku and C band) Topex altimeter (NRA) data. They showed that the frequency dependence of the attenuation of electro...|$|R
5000|$|The NECC is {{a direct}} {{response}} to the meridional change of the wind stress curl near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). In part the NECC owes its existence {{to the fact that}} the ITCZ is not located at the equator, rather several degrees latitude to the north. The change in the coriolis parameter (a function of latitude) moving across the equator combined with the ITCZ being located north of the equator leads to areas of convergence and divergence in the oceanic mixed-layer. This result is obtained from Ekman theory. Using the larger Pacific basin as an example, the resulting <b>dynamic</b> <b>height</b> pattern consists of a trough at the equator, and ridge near 5° degrees north, a trough at 10°N, and finally a ridge closer to 20°N.

40|$|Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) is {{a crucial}} {{parameter}} for estimating dynamic topography, and, therefore, geostrophic circulation from satellite altimetry measurements. In this work we use drifting buoy measurements, hydrographic profiles and along-track Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) to reconstruct MDT of the Black Sea by the "synthetic" method. Obtained MDT shows a lot of mesoscale features, which are not present in previous MDT fields of the Black Sea, mostly based on climatic data. Moreover, gradients of sea level in the synthetic MDT are significantly higher compared to other fields, which is evidence of more intense currents in the basin. Validation of determined MDT field with independent <b>dynamic</b> <b>heights</b> and drifter buoy velocities shows good quantitative and qualitative coincidence over all Black Sea basin and improvements compare to previous fields.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{widespread}} computation of gravimetric geoid and quasi-geoid models for GPS height transformation, there is {{renewed interest in}} defining vertical datums using height systems that are fully compatible with GPS-derived heights. Although orthometric heights are commonly used for such purposes, computation of their true value from spirit leveling observations requires an exact knowledge of gravity along the (curved) plumbline above the geoid. Without direct gravity observa-tions, several hypotheses must be made, and as such, numerous variants (approximations) of the true orthometric height have been derived. This paper evaluates six height systems using a simulated (exact) gravity field from a well-defined prismoidal mountain mass for which the gravity field and plumblines are unambiguously defined. From this, the simulated (true) orthometric heights are computed and compared to various approximate orthometric heights. Geometric (ellipsoidal), nor-mal, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>heights</b> are also evaluated. Com-parisons of the height systems are made regarding their utility, accuracy, and compatibility with grav-imetric geoid and quasi-geoid models...|$|R
