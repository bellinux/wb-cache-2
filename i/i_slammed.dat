500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{began taking}} shape {{towards the end}} of the hiatus. Burnley stated that after growing {{frustrated}} with the lack of answers concerning his health condition, he decided to focus on writing music, saying on That Metal Show, [...] "I literally took my medical records [...] and <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> them down like, 'You know what, forget this, I'm not getting anywhere with this', so I just decided to stop trying to find out whatever it was and just focus on our music, and that's when Dark Before Dawn really started to take shape." [...] After the album was mostly written, Burnley began assembling new members of the band, including Jasen Rauch (lead guitar; originally from Red), Keith Wallen (rhythm guitar and backing vocals; originally from Adelitas Way), Aaron Bruch (bass), and Shaun Foist (drums; originally from Picture Me Broken).|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous {{localization}} and mapping (SLAM) {{consists in}} the concurrent {{construction of a}} model of the environment (the map), and the estimation {{of the state of the}} robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need <b>SLAM?</b> and <b>Is</b> <b>SLAM</b> solved...|$|R
6000|$|He arose {{suddenly}} to his feet. He {{was a large}} man. I was a stranger in a strange land, and John Law was looking for me. I went away hurriedly. [...] "But why ungrateful?"

He had returned to his pie.|$|E
6000|$|But I fooled {{the pair}} of them, and dosed them with their own medicine, which was faith-cure. They had faith in their funk {{that they were going}} to die. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> a lot of quinine down their throats and took their temperature. It was the first time I had used my medicine-chest thermometer, and I quickly {{discovered}} that it was worthless, that it had been produced for profit and not for service. If I had let on to my two patients that the thermometer did not work, there would have been two funerals in short order. Their temperature I swear was 105 degrees. I solemnly made one and then the other smoke the thermometer, allowed an expression of satisfaction to irradiate my countenance, and joyfully told them that their temperature was 94 degrees. Then <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> more quinine down their throats, told them that any sickness or weakness they might experience would be due to the quinine, and left them to get well. And they did get well, Wada in spite of himself. If a man can die through a misapprehension, is there any immorality in making him live through a misapprehension? ...|$|E
60|$|The thing I did, I did upon {{instinct}} {{rather than}} reason; and this again {{was not well}} done. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door, and turned the key, placing at least that poor barrier between myself and the man I had so deeply wronged, the man whom I had given the right to slay me. A second later the door shook as if a hurricane had smitten it. He had seized the handle, and he was pulling at it frenziedly with a maniacal strength.|$|E

But, even as I passed, I could swear I saw a second black window with something on it that was like a snail.|$|E
60|$|I {{stepped inside}} the wicket--backwards--and then <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> {{it in their}} faces, and putting the key in my pocket, walked up the wharf.

If she really thought I was her 'usband, and she 'ad lost me---- I put one or two things straight and then, {{for the sake of}} distracting my mind, I 'ad a word or two with the skipper of the John Henry, who was leaning against the side of his ship, smoking.|$|E
60|$|When I had finished, George {{asked if}} the soap was in.

It got shut up finally at 10.5 p.m., and then there remained the hampers to do.

60|$|That {{return to}} my inn sticks in my memory also as a thing apart, as an {{experience}} apart. Within was a subdued bustle of women, a flitting of lights, and the doing of petty offices to that queer, exhausted thing {{that had once been}} my active and urgent little uncle. For me those offices were irksome and impertinent. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door, and went out into the warm, foggy drizzle of the village street lit by blurred specks of light in great voids of darkness, and never a soul abroad. That warm veil of fog produced an effect of vast seclusion. The very houses by the roadside peered through it as if from another world. The stillness of the night was marked by an occasional remote baying of dogs; all these people kept dogs because of the near neighbourhood of the frontier.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} front door and they passed out. The {{automobile}} was still purring on the drive. Buck's pistol had disappeared. I supposed the chauffeur had picked it up, a surmise which was proved correct a few moments later, when, just as the car was moving off, there was a sharp crack and a bullet struck the wall {{to the right of the}} door. It was a random shot, and I did not return it. Its effect on me was to send me into the hall with a leap that was almost a back-somersault. Somehow, though I was keyed up for violence and the shooting of pistols, I had not expected it at just that moment, and I was disagreeably surprised at the shock it had given me. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door and bolted it. I was intensely irritated to find that my fingers were trembling.|$|E
60|$|I {{was still}} {{standing}} with my hand upon the latch, gazing after my unexpected visitor, when I became aware of yet another dweller in the wilderness. Some distance along the path which the stranger was taking there lay a great grey boulder, and leaning against this was a small, wizened man, who stood erect as the other approached, and advanced to meet him. The two talked {{for a minute or}} more, the taller man nodding his head frequently in my direction, as though describing what had passed between us. Then they walked on together, and disappeared in a dip of the fell. Presently I saw them ascending once more some rising ground farther on. My acquaintance had thrown his arm round his elderly friend, either from affection or from a desire to aid him up the steep incline. The square burly figure and its shrivelled, meagre companion stood out against the sky-line, and turning their faces, they looked back at me. At the sight, <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door, lest they should be encouraged to return. But when I peeped from the window some minutes afterward, I perceived that they were gone.|$|E
