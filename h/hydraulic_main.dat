50|$|In general, the {{temperature}} of the gas in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> varies between 140-160o F. The constituents most liable to be lost were benzene, toluene, and, to some extent, xylene, which had an important effect on the ultimate illuminating power of the gas. Tars were detrimental for the illuminating power and were isolated from the gas as rapidly as possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydrocarbon}} condensates {{removed in}} the order heavy tars, medium tars and finally light tars and oil fog. About 60-65% of the tars would be deposited in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main.</b> Most of this tar was heavy tars. The medium tars condensed out during {{the passage of the}} products between the hydraulic and the condenser. The lighter tars oil fog would travel considerably further.|$|E
50|$|The steam ejector/aspirator type {{exhauster}} used {{a substantial}} steam jet/venturi {{to maintain the}} negative pressure in the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> and condenser. This type of exhauster was mechanically simple, had no moving parts, and thus, had virtually no potential to fail. However, it consumed a comparatively large amount of steam. Often used as a backup exhauster; in this role it continued as a reliable backup {{until the end of}} the age of manufactured gas.|$|E

(1) Pattern I: The <b>main</b> <b>hydraulic</b> {{fracture}} initiated and propagated {{along the}} direction of natural fractures with some secondary fractures due {{to the effect of}} in situ stress (specimen 1 #, specimen 4 # in Fig.  5. For specimen 1 #, there was an inclined natural fracture crossing the borehole. Although diverting partially along the vertical stress direction, the <b>main</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fractures propagated along the natural fracture inside the coal seam and failed to extend to the sandstone layer. For specimen 4 #, the <b>main</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fractures also initiated and propagated along the natural fracture with a large aperture in the vertical direction. In the process of fracture propagation, the fracturing fluid was completely filtered along coal seams to form complex fractures. The hydraulic fractures eventually did not penetrate the layer interface.|$|R

50|$|The {{basic design}} of gaslight {{apparatus}} {{was established by}} Boulton & Watt and Samuel Clegg in the period 1805-1812. Further improvements were made at the Gas Light and Coke Company, {{as well as by}} the growing number of gas engineers such as John Malam and Thomas Peckston after 1812. Boulton & Watt contributed the basic design of the retort, condenser, and gasometer, while Clegg improved the gasometer and introduced lime purification and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main,</b> another purifier.|$|E
50|$|However, {{after the}} early years of gas, {{research}} proved that a very deep, excessive seal on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> threw a backpressure upon all the retorts as the coal within was gasifying, and this had deleterious consequences; carbon would likely deposit onto the insides of retorts and ascension pipes; and the bottom layer of tar with which the gas would have to travel through in a deeply sealed main robbed the gas of some of its illuminating value. As such, after the 1860s, hydraulic mains were run at around 1 inch of seal, and no more.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> had a {{level of}} a liquid mixture of (initially) water, but, {{following}} use, also coal tar, and ammoniacal liquor. Each retort ascension pipe dropped under the water level by at least a small amount, perhaps by an inch, but often considerably more in the earlier days of gas manufacture. The gas evolved from each retort would thus bubble through the liquid and emerge from it into the void above the liquid, where it would mix with the gas evolved from the other retorts and be drawn off through the foul main to the condenser.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} {{purposes}} to the liquid seal: first, {{to draw off}} some of the tar and liquor, as the gas from the retort was laden with tar, and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> could rid the gas of it, to a certain degree; further tar removal would take place in the condenser, washer/scrubber, and the tar extractor. Still, there would be less tar to deal with later. Second, the liquid seal also provided defense against air being drawn into the hydraulic main: if the main had no liquid within, and a retort was left open with the pipe not shut off, and air were to combine with the gas, the main could explode, along with nearby benches.|$|E
5000|$|Within each retort-house, the retort benches {{would be}} lined {{up next to}} one another in a long row. Each retort had a loading and {{unloading}} door. Affixed to each door was an ascension pipe, to carry off the gas as it was evolved from the coal within. These pipes would rise {{to the top of the}} bench where they would terminate in an inverted [...] "U" [...] with the leg of the [...] "U" [...] disappearing into a long, trough-shaped structure (with a covered top) made of cast iron called a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> that was placed atop the row of benches near their front edge.

5000|$|From the retort, the gas {{would first}} {{pass through a}} tar/water [...] "trap" [...] (similar to a trap in plumbing) called a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main,</b> where a {{considerable}} fraction of coal tar was given up and the gas was significantly cooled. Then, it would pass through the main out of the retort house into an atmospheric or water-cooled condenser, {{where it would be}} cooled to the temperature of the atmosphere or the water used. At this point, it enters the exhauster house and passes through an [...] "exhauster", an air pump which maintains the hydraulic mains and, consequently, the retorts at a negative pressure (with a zero pressure being atmospheric). It would then be washed in a [...] "washer" [...] by bubbling it through water, to extract any remaining tars. After this, it would enter a purifier. The gas would then be ready for distribution, and pass into a gasholder for storage.|$|E

Data analyzed includes National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB) accident data (1988 to 2003), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) incident data (1988 to 2003), and Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) incident data (1993 to 2008). Failure modes and effects analyses were examined to identify possible modes of SCFM. A table of potential adverse conditions was developed to help evaluate IVHM research technologies. Tables present details of specific SCFM for the incidents and accidents. Of the 370 NTSB accidents affected by SCFM, 48 percent involved the engine or fuel system, and 31 percent involved landing gear or hydraulic failure and malfunctions. A total of 35 percent of all SCFM accidents were caused by improper maintenance. Of the 7732 FAA database incidents affected by SCFM, 33 percent involved landing gear or hydraulics, and 33 percent involved the engine and fuel system. The most frequent SCFM found in ASRS were turbine engine, pressurization system, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> system, flight management system/flight management computer, and engine.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Banding of the {{pulmonary}} artery might {{be required to}} prevent pulmonary vascular damage in patients with increased {{pulmonary artery}} flow and to retrain the left ventricle in preparation for an arterial switch operation in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Readjustment of the pulmonary artery band might be required in the postoperative period. In this study we aimed to test the feasibility of a novel device for bidirectionally adjustable pulmonary artery constriction. Methods: A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>main</b> pulmonary artery occluder was implanted in lambs and gradually inflated to create right ventricular pressure overload at a systemic (aortic) level. During the following period (up to 12 weeks), this pressure overload was monitored by measuring aortic and right ventricular pressures by means of implanted subcutaneous reservoirs. If required to maintain the right ventricular pressure overload at a systemic level in the growing animals, the occluder was deflated through a third subcutaneous reservoir. Results: After the banding period (average of 64 ± 8 days), the main pulmonary artery cuff could still be adjusted, and the animals showed no clinical signs of heart failure. Histologic analysis of the pulmonary artery showed extensive fibrosis, a giant cell response around the device, and small areas of tissue necrosis; complete transmural necrosis was not detected. Conclusions: This device allows adjustment of the pulmonary artery cuff in a precise manner over a prolonged period of time without surgical reintervention. Potentially, the device might have applications for clinical use in children with congenital heart disease. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2003; 125 : 231 -...|$|E
