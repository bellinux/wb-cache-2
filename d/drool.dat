The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into <b>drool</b> in the English version.

40|$|<b>Drooling</b> is a {{well known}} problem in {{patients}} with Parkinson's disease (PD). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the severity and consequences of <b>drooling</b> in PD. A comprehensive <b>drooling</b> questionnaire was sent to 105 PD outpatients, who had volunteered <b>drooling</b> during a previous questionnaire (n = 216). Among 63 patients who responded and confirmed <b>drooling,</b> 27 % experienced severe saliva loss. Social and emotional consequences were reported by 17 % to 77 % of patients, and significantly more often by those with severe <b>drooling.</b> We conclude that <b>drooling</b> is a frequent, disabling and apparently undertreated symptom of PD. History taking ought to be detailed and specific to understand the full impact of <b>drooling</b> for an individual patient. Therapeutic options should be evaluated more intensively...|$|R

The impact of salivary flow reduction following medication (scopolamine and intraglandular Botulinum Toxin Type A injection in the submandibular glands) on daily life and provision of care, and on social interaction and self-esteem was evaluated in 45 children with Cerebral Palsy (3 - 16 years) who suffered from severe <b>drooling.</b> <b>Drooling</b> diminished substantially and this was accompanied by a significant reduction in care needs.

However, parents perceived that the impact of <b>drooling</b> had increased on the level of the child's satisfaction on physical appearance, relations within the extended family, and life in general.
