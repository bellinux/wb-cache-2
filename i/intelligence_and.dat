40|$|The present {{research}} contributes {{to an increased}} understanding of the potential relationships between multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>and</b> the choice and frequency of use of language learning strategies. Forty-one EFL students from Urmia University (Iran) completed Oxford’s (1990 a) Strategy Inventory for Language Learning and the McKenzie (1999) Multiple Intelligences Inventory. Data analyses revealed a moderately positive relationship between the participants’ multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>and</b> language learning strategy use (r =. 58). Pearson Product-Moment correlation also showed medium-to-large positive relationships within and among the categories of multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>and</b> the types of language learning strategies. Implications of this study for EFL education are discussed, and suggestions to improve students’ performance are provided...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between self-perceived multiple <b>intelligences</b> <b>and</b> five learning preferences among 604 Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong. These students perceived their strengths in interpersonal, intrapersonal, <b>and</b> verbal-linguis-tic <b>intelligences</b> <b>and</b> their weaknesses in bodily-kinesthetic <b>and</b> naturalist <b>intelligences.</b> They also indicated greater preferences in learning activities related to discussion, lec-ture, and peer teaching, followed by projects and simulations. In predicting the five learning preferences, personal intelligences generally emerged as common and signifi-cant predictors, suggesting that reflection and interpersonal skills contributed substan-tially to these learning activities. Students who reported having {{a greater number of}} learning preferences also gave themselves higher ratings on personal <b>intelligences</b> <b>and</b> verbal-linguistic <b>intelligence.</b> Implications of the findings in mapping learning prefer-ences on multiple <b>intelligences</b> for teaching <b>and</b> learning are discussed. Rather than subscribing exclusively to the notion of a general uni-tary intelligence that cuts across all areas of human competence to explain human performance, many psychologists and educator...|$|R
