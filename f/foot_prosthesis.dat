40|$|The human foot {{consists}} of complex sets of joints. The adaptive {{nature of the}} human foot enables it to be stable on any uneven surface. It {{is important to have}} such adaptive capabilities in the artificial prosthesis to achieve most of the essential movements for lower-limb amputees. However, many existing lower-limb prostheses lack the adaptive nature. This paper reviews lower-limb adaptive <b>foot</b> <b>prostheses.</b> In order to understand the design concepts of adaptive <b>foot</b> <b>prostheses,</b> the biomechanics of human foot have been explained. Additionally, the requirements and design challenges are investigated and presented. In this review, adaptive <b>foot</b> <b>prostheses</b> are classified according to actuation method. Furthermore, merits and demerits of present-day adaptive <b>foot</b> <b>prostheses</b> are presented based on the hardware construction.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{design and}} realization of testing device for dynamic tests of <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> made by methods of Rapid prototyping. Primary objective of design is {{to imitate the}} load on prosthesis during human gait. This task is accomplished by swing motion of prosthesis inside the frame of device during the loading of heel and tiptoe. Loading components can be removed and changed so the device {{can be used for}} different measurement like walking on an inclined plane. The result of this work is fully functional device including control program with many options to control the test. The result of test is to decide whether the <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> withstands the set of cyclic loads. The area of development of prosthesis by additive methods is young for the time being. It stands out especially with different materials, design, structure of prosthesis and fast process of production. Therefore this device can be used for testing of fatigue life of prosthesis made by additive methods...|$|E
40|$|Young disable {{people often}} require {{to have the}} {{possibility}} to lead not only an independent life, but also to behave in a completely normal way and even {{to take part in}} agonistic competitions. It is therefore a necessity to provide them with prostheses in new and advanced materials, allowing to express themselves as athletes. Object of this paper is a <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> for transtibial amputated athletes. The prosthesis is made of a single lamina reinforced in carbon fibre. The lamina has the functionality of the muscle-skeleton apparatus: not only its strength, but also its elasticity is important during the athlete’s run, since {{it is supposed to be}} comparable with a sane leg. Static and fatigue tests are experimentally performed on the prosthesis, by means of an uni-axial machine or an hydraulic actuator. A single force was applied to the prosthesis, generating mixed loadings in the carbon fibre lamina. In parallel to the experimental tests, a numerical model of the <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is also developed, validated by experimental results of strains and displacements. In this way, a valid tool to determine the stress state inside the prosthesis is obtained, useful to check the most important parameters of the material and quantify their influence in the stiffness and displacement variation. These are useful considerations to improve the athlete’s performances...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{two types of}} {{prostheses}} are described: the design is new and composite materials are used to save costs. The first is used for walking and it is made {{of a series of}} multi-layer composite laminas and combined with a pylon, which simulates the tibia and fibula. The second prosthesis is designed for running and it is made of a single multi-layer lamina. These prostheses have been experimentally tested by suitable equipments to perform static and fatigue tests. In the tests on prostheses for walking, the foot tip and heel region were alternatively loaded with an appropriate loading structure made of two hydraulic pistons, while a single load was applied on the specimens for running through a testing machine or again an actuator. The performed tests confirmed the structural resistance of the <b>foot</b> <b>prostheses</b> according to the standard. Finite element numerical models were analysed and validated by means of a comparison with the experimental results. These models are now a useful mean to optimize the prostheses design...|$|R
40|$|What is the {{structure}} of the social? If we accept organismic metaphors, the social is analogous to the body, usually the human body. The foot/shoe is the most basic foundation, the ground upon which the rest of the socialbody rests. By standing on two feet, the hands are freed to become tool making and using appendages, and the mouth is thereby freed from carrying to bear words instead. In structural terms, the foot/shoe functions as base to the face?s superstructure. But when a shoe is thrown at the face of power, a double inversion comes into play. On the one hand, the base rises up to strike directly at the superstructure and to challenge materially the basis of its legitimacy. On the other hand, the most basic sign of development and civilization ? the shoe ? is removed from the bare foot. As well as turning the <b>foot?s</b> <b>prosthesis</b> into a projectile weapon, this move symbolically reaffirms the body against a becoming-face or a becoming-technology. This moment of unshod insubordination asserts a basic, naked, human dignity in the face of dehumanization.

40|$|In running, large gait {{asymmetry}} {{is expected}} {{due to the}} inability of the <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to comply with the kinematic demands and produce a powerful plantarflexion moment. In this work, interlimb asymmetry in below-knee (BK) amputee running gait was assessed for one rigid ‘and three flexible keel prostheses, using vertical and anteroposterior ground reaction forces and respective impulses. Nine BK amputees and 6 controls participated in this study, The running speed was monitored by two light sensitive detectors while the ground reaction forces were measured with a Kistler force plate. Between the prosthetic side and the sound limb the impulse indicator showed greater asymmetry than the force. Interlimb asymmetry was very much present in all types of prosthesis tested but is less pronounced in the flexible keel prostheses. In the latter, the asymmetry may be associated with the force-time history modulation rather than its magnitude alone. Generally, the impulses better describe interlimb asymmetry and the forces allow a greater discrimination between prosthetic foot types...|$|E
40|$|A main {{effort has}} been devoted in this thesis to {{consider}} {{the effects of the}} actuator components (i. e. springs, dampers and motors) and their configuration (i. e. the way they are assembled) in power and energy requirement of powered foot prostheses. It has been investigated which actuation mechanism would have the least requirements to perform a certain human gait (e. g. walking, running, ascending or descending the stairs). This thesis shows that the components of the robotic foot and their configurations are important design factors. This information is fundamental for building mechanical prototypes of active foot prostheses. In addition, the human body is equipped with muscle assemblies to actuate a joint. In robotics this phenomenon is called over-actuation. In this thesis, it was investigated if and how this fact could be used to reduce power-energy requirements in active <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Furthermore, the control structures of the active foot prostheses are investigated and discussed and the results of the first laboratory experiments with the Powered Ankle Knee Ortho-prosthesis (the PAKO platform) are explained.

40|$|In {{traditional}} rehabilitation process, {{ankle movement}} ability is only qualitatively estimated by its motion performance, however, its movement is actually {{achieved by the}} forces acting on the joints produced by muscles contraction. In this paper, the musculoskeletal model is introduced {{to provide a more}} physiologic method for quantitative muscle forces and muscle moments estimation during rehabilitation. This paper focuses on the modeling method of musculoskeletal model using electromyography (EMG) and angle signals for ankle plantar-dorsiflexion (P-DF) which is very important in gait rehabilitation and <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> control. Due to the skeletal morphology differences among people, a subject-specific geometry model is proposed to realize the estimation of muscle lengths and muscle contraction force arms. Based on the principle of forward and inverse dynamics, difference evolutionary (DE) algorithm is used to adjust individual parameters of the whole model, realizing subject-specific parameters optimization. Results from five healthy subjects show the inverse dynamics joint moments are well predicted with an average correlation coefficient of 94. 21 % and the normalized RMSE of 12. 17 %.

Compared with the traditional structure of single axis with elastic unit, the geared five-bar spring mechanism has more flexible movements. The optimization and experiment results of the geared five-bar spring mechanism show that it can provide a better performance on impedance torque in controlled dorsiflexion phase.

50|$|A common {{trend in}} modern {{technology}} is the push to create lightweight devices. A 1981 collection of studies on amputees showed a 30% increase in metabolic cost of walking for an able-bodied subject with 2-kg weights fixed to each <b>foot.</b> Correspondingly, transfemoral <b>prostheses</b> are on average only about {{one third of the}} weight of the limb they are replacing. However, the effect of added mass appears to be less significant for amputees. Small increases in mass (4-oz and 8-oz) of a prosthetic foot had no significant effect and, similarly, adding 0.68-kg and 1.34-kg masses {{to the center of the}} shank of transfemoral prostheses did not alter metabolic cost at any of the tested walking speeds (0.6, 1.0, and 1.5 m/s). In another study, muscular efforts were significantly increased with added mass, yet there was no significant impact on walking speeds and over half of the subjects preferred a prosthetic that was loaded to match 75% weight of the sound leg. In fact, it has been reported in several articles that test subjects actually prefer heavier prostheses, even when the load is completely superficial.|$|R

Twenty male elite paratroopers with formal parachute landing training and over 2 years of parachute jumping experience were recruited. The subjects wore parachuting boots in which pressure sensing insoles were placed. Each subject was instructed to jump off a platform with a height of 60 cm, and land on either a hard or soft surface in a half-squat posture. Outcome measures were maximal plantar pressure, time to maximal plantar pressure (T-MPP), and pressure-time integral (PTI) upon landing on 10 plantar regions. Compared to a soft surface, hard surface produced higher maximal plantar pressure in the 1 st to 4 th metatarsal and mid-foot regions, but lower maximal plantar pressure in the 5 th metatarsal region. Shorter T- MPP was found during hard surface landing in the 1 st and 2 nd metatarsal and medial rear foot. Landing on a hard surface landing resulted in a lower PTI than a soft surface in the 1 stphalangeal region. For Chinese paratroopers, specific <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> should be designed to protect the 1 st to 4 thmetatarsal region for hard surface landing, and the 1 stphalangeal and 5 thmetatarsal region for soft surface landin...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{application}} of the dynamic walking approach to human gait. This work is motivated by the needs of persons with disabilities and by a desire to expand basic understanding of human walking. We address human gait from the perspective of dynamic walking, a theoretical approach to legged locomotion which emphasizes the use of simple dynamical models and focuses on behavior over the course of many steps rather than within a single step. We build on results from prior dynamic walking research and develop new areas of exploration, with energetics and stability providing context. We focus on three areas: improvement of prosthetic foot design, the function of arm swinging, and evaluation of balance among the elderly. These issues are addressed by use of dynamic walking models and controlled human subject experiments. We propose a Controlled Energy Storage and Return (CESR) <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to increase push-off work and reduce energy expenditure in amputees, and tested a prototype experimentally. To better understand the role of arms swinging in gait, we developed a simple dynamic walking model with free-swinging arms and performed human subject experiments in which subjects swung their arms in various ways. Finally, we studied the effects of aging on balance during walking using a computational model and a human subject experiment in which younger and older adults walked overground for hundreds of consecutive steps. These models and experiments each expand our understanding of the fundamentals of gait and indicate pathways toward assisting individuals with disabilities. Taken as a whole, this work emphasizes the utility of the dynamic walking approach...|$|E
40|$|Following a brief {{survey of}} the {{historic}} develop-ment of pneumatic prostheses the actual prin-ciples of prosthetic management in bilateral shoulder disarticulation or bilateral amelia are ex p 1 a i n e d. The active functions are restricted to active pronation and supination, active gripping of the terminal device “hook ” or “hand”, com-bined with pneumatic locking of free swinging shoulder and elbow jdints in one artificial arm; the cosmetic arm provides only space for the power package in the resin socket of the upper arm. Both arms are suspended on a Simpson frame. Thus optical control is concentrated on {{the movements of the}} functional arm. The reduction of valve control makes prosthetic training and use easier. Recently hybrid systems came into use be-cause electric power proved superior to pneu-matic power for pronation and supination and gripping, whereas CO, is still necessary for locking the elbow and the shoulder joint. The accumulator can be recharged daily at a plug socket, the CO container need only be refilled after one or two weeks ensuring more indepen-dence for the disabled. The advantage of such a prosthesis is the better appearance in public combined with a certain functional use. However only intensive <b>foot</b> training without <b>prostheses</b> provides independence in daily acti-vities, because even sophisticated prosthetic systems cannot make up completely for body loss...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction:The {{lower limb}} {{amputation}} have significant effects on {{physical and mental}} health of patients, {{while at the same time}} consists a serious socio-economic problem, as it is associated with increased morbidity, multiple surgeries, prolonged hospital stay and increased disability rates. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the amputation of the lower extremity in quality of life of these people. Methodology:The present systematic review included medical and nursing literature review using electronic databases such as MEDLINE, CINAHL, PUBMED and PsycINFO. The following keywords were used: amputee, leg, knee, <b>foot,</b> amputation, QoL, <b>prosthesis,</b> mobility, rehabilitation, psychology. Results: Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies were cross sectional, one prospective, one retrospective and one mixed study-design. The studies were found to be heterogeneous with respect to the study objectives and instruments used to assess QoL. The factors affecting the QOL in patients with lower limp amputation is depression, perceived prosthetic mobility, social support, comorbidity, addition problems, age, and participation in social activities. Immediately after the amputation, participants reported reduced QOL, but over time, the level increased due to the adjustment in position. The young age, the male gender, the highly education level and the traumatic origin were associated with better QOL. Conclusions: Amputee specific standardized and validated QoL instruments are needed to capture the multitude of facets influencing QoL in amputees, and thereby, facilitating direct comparison across studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: When trans-tibial amputees cross {{obstacles}} leading {{with their}} <b>prosthesis,</b> <b>foot</b> clearance is achieved using compensatory swing-phase kinematics. Such compensation would suggest able-bodied individuals normally use swing-phase ankle dorsiflexion to attain adequate obstacle clearance, however, direct {{evidence of such}} contribution is equivocal. The present study determined the contribution of sagittal plane ankle motion in achieving lead-limb clearance during obstacle negotiation. Methods: 12 male able-bodied individuals (ages 18 - 30) completed obstacle crossing trials while walking on a flat surface. Lead-limb (right) ankle motion was manipulated using a knee-ankle-foot orthosis. Trials were completed with the ankle restricted at a neutral angle or unrestricted (allowing ± 15 plantar/dorsiflexion). Findings: Restricted ankle motion caused significant increase in trail-limb foot placement distance before the obstacle (p= 0. 005); significant decrease in vertical toe clearance (p< 0. 003), vertical heel clearance (p= 0. 045) and lead-limb foot placement distance after the obstacle (p= 0. 045); but no significant changes in knee angle at instant of crossing or in average walking speed. Interpretation: The shifts in foot placements altered the part of swing that the lead-limb was in when the foot crossed the obstacle, {{which led to a}} decrease in clearance. These adaptations may have been due to being unable to dorsiflex the ankle to ‘lift’ the toes in mid-swing or to being unable to plantarflex the ankle during initial contact following crossing, which changed how the lead-limb was to be loaded. These findings suggest individuals using ankle bracing or those with ankle arthrodesis, will have reduced gait safety when negotiating obstacles...|$|R
40|$|Robust terrain {{detection}} {{system for the}} predictive control of active terrain-adaptive limb prostheses: Up until recent years prosthetic limbs had joints built with only energetically passive devices. This means that the joints could store and dissipate energy during a gait cycle, but could not provide net power back for adaptive foot control. This inability reduces the capability of the prostheses to completely restore locomotive functions such as walking upstairs or downstairs, up and down slopes and running or jumping. These functionalities require a simultaneous reaction of the prostheses joints to the ground. Recent developments don't imply priori reaction and {{focus more on the}} post adaption after the first contact to a terrain. The approach is a non tactile structure registration for the detection of the underlying terrain during the gait cycle. The system is designed for field of view in the walking direction and a field of view to the ground. The distance to the terrain will be measured with a combination of a laser scanner heading in the walking direction and ultrasonic sensors heading to the ground. The motion of the prosthesis causes scanning of the sensors in the vertical plane. An inertial navigation system provides position and orientation information of the prosthesis and the sensors. This gives the ability to extract three dimensional geometries like plains, stairs, obstacles, ramps and holes. The gathered information is the basis for the control process of the prosthesis. An active and predictive terrain adaption causes a gain of safety for the prosthesis user who needs a certain amount of attention to pass rough terrain. It will conduct to the process of the simulation of a more natural human gait with prosthesis foots too. The described sensors are applicable for above- and below knee prostheses and can be integrated as a separated module.

40|$|The {{work the}} legs perform {{on the body}} center of mass (COM) is an {{important}} determinant of the metabolic cost of walking. Much COM work is performed to redirect the center of mass from a downward to an upward velocity during transitions between successive stance legs, termed step-to-step transitions. We elucidate the links between COM velocity fluctuation, COM work, and metabolic cost through several experimental manipulations of gait. We show that foot length and foot bottom curvature affect COM work and metabolic cost in fixed-ankle walking. In dynamic walking models, longer feet lead to decreased work requirements for gait. We measured COM work and metabolic cost while subjects walked with locked ankles and artificial foot bottom shapes. COM work decreases with increasing foot length, because longer feet reduce the angular redirection of COM velocity during the step-to-step transition. Foot bottom curvature has no significant effect for humanlike foot sizes. In this range, COM work using arc shapes is less than for normal walking, though metabolic cost is higher. Metabolic cost is minimized by feet having length 28 % of leg length. We also show that COM work for mechanically unconstrained walking depends on COM speed and angular redirection of COM velocity during the step-to-step transition. We measured variations in COM velocity while subjects walked at {{a wide range of}} speeds and step lengths. COM work scales quadratically with COM speed at heel strike times angular redirection of COM velocity. We introduce a sagittal plane plot of COM velocity trajectory, called a hodograph, to visualize these variables and understand abnormal gait. We use these hodographs to show that unilateral transtibial amputees walk asymmetrically with respect to several kinetic variables of gait. Amputees exhibit higher mid-stance COM speed and weaker push-off on the prosthetic side, and more positive and negative step-to-step transition COM work on the intact side. Finally, we introduce the Rock’N’Lock foot, a reconfigurable <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> that implements a rigid foot bottom shape with the goal of reducing metabolic cost. In preliminary results this foot has cost equal to other prostheses’, but forthcoming design improvements may lower the cost further...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to describe}} work {{carried out at}} the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Architecture and Software Technology (FhG-FIRST), in particular at the research group for Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA), within the project "Brain-Computer Interface" (BCI). The goal of that project is to design and develop a hardware and software system {{that is capable of}} transforming, in real-time, electroencephalographic (EEG) signals (signals retrieved in a non-invasive way from surface electrodes placed over the user's head) into specific commands such that the user gains reliable control over a computer application or a device. In this dissertation, control over a computer application will be represented with "Brain-Gaming", i. e. simple computer games like Ping-Pong, Pacman or Tetris. To this end, substantial considerations were made on the design and realization of a communication interface and its corresponding protocol. A further important component of every control operation is its strategy and the control alphabet, i. e. the command set. For this purpose, several control strategies were developed, implemented and proved experimentally in different scenarios. The most important aspect of the design and development of these interfaces turned out to be their flexibility. Control over a device could include the steering and moving of a wheel-chair for paralyzed patients or the gaining of control over an arm or <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis</b> for patients with amputated limbs. The latter was realized here as a computer-based simulation of a virtual limb (e. g. arm), such that it can be tested in future experiments on patients with amputated limbs. In contrast to the "Brain-Gaming" experiments, where the player was equipped with an additional communication channel (one that exists independently of normal communication channels of the human neuromuscular system), the experiments with patients did not require an ultra-fast recognition of the intended movement; i. e. the command signal for a simulated movement can be recognized after the phantom movement is initialized and performed. In experiments with feedback scenarios, which can be resembled as competitive games, several aspects of ultra-fast movement detection could be investigated with reaction tests. This opens new perspectives for the execution of preventive actions in time-critical applications. This dissertation, and {{the development and implementation of}} the prototype, is based on well-founded insights into human neurophysiology; one chapter will deal exclusively with these insights. Moreover, a special chapter of this dissertation will also describe the development and implementation of an online prototype of the BBCI system (Berlin Brain-Computer Interface) from the software engineering viewpoint. A number of bio-feedback modules, for gaming and for rehabilitation purposes, were developed within this work and will be presented in detail. Special attention was paid to the influence of the online bio-feedback on the user's behavior...|$|E
40|$|Background Regaining {{effective}} postural control after {{lower limb}} amputation requires complex adaptation strategies {{in both the}} prosthesis side and the non-amputated side. The objective {{in this study is}} to determine the individual contribution of the ankle torques generated by both legs in balance control during dynamic conditions. Methods Subjects (6 transfemoral and 8 transtibial amputees) stood on a force platform mounted on a motion platform and were instructed to stand quietly. The experiment consisted of 1 static and 3 perturbation trials of 90 s duration each. The perturbation trials consisted of continuous randomized sinusoidal platform movements of different amplitude in the sagittal plane. Weight distribution during the static and dynamic perturbation trials was calculated by dividing the average vertical force below the <b>prosthesis</b> <b>foot</b> by the sum of forces below both feet. The Dynamic Balance Control represents the ratio between the stabilizing mechanism of the prosthetic leg and the stabilizing mechanism of the non-amputated leg. The stabilizing mechanism is calculated from the corrective ankle torque in response to sway. The relationship between the prosthetic ankle stiffness and the performance during the platform perturbations was calculated. Findings All patients showed a (non-significant) weight bearing asymmetry in favor of the non-amputated leg. The Dynamic Balance Control ratio showed that the contribution of both legs to balance control was even more asymmetrical. Moreover, the actual balance contribution of each leg was not tightly coupled to weight bearing in each leg, {{as was the case in}} healthy controls. There was a significant positive correlation between the prosthetic ankle stiffness and the Dynamic Balance Control. Interpretation The Dynamic Balance Control provides, in addition to weight distribution, information to what extent the stabilizing mechanism of the corrective ankle torque of both legs contributes to balance control. Knowledge of the stiffness properties may optimize the prescription process of prosthetic foot in lower leg amputee subjects in relation to standing stabilit...|$|R
40|$|The normal daily human {{activities}} include {{different levels of}} energy and strength needs, and this applies also for walking such that walking at high speeds needs more stiff muscles compared with walking slowly, and walking during carrying heavy loads or on inclined surfaces needs more energy than during doing the light housekeeping activities. For a healthy individual the human foot has already the ability to change its stiffness and to store and return {{a part of the}} elastic energy in a compliant structure of muscle fibres and series elastic elements. In the case of amputations in the lower limbs the amputated limbs are replaced with artificial limbs. A problem appears by this replacement that the new artificial limbs are designed to satisfy some described tasks and any change in these tasks or in the boundary conditions leads to an incompliance and unsatisfactory motion of the amputees. For example, the use of soft foot for walking at high speeds leads to a larger motion of the body centre of mass compared with walking at the preferred walking speed. In order to overcome these problems or reduce their effects, the need arises to design adaptive prostheses that have the ability to change their properties according to the surrounding conditions. This work has the goal to evaluate the usefulness of using adaptive elastic <b>foot</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> through the numerical modelling and simulation of the human gait of an above-knee amputee with an adaptive elastic foot. The body of the amputee is divided into a limited number of rigid bodies (segments) connected together by hinge joints. A two dimensional model of the human body is built from these segments using a commercial multibody simulation program. The initial conditions of the system, some of the body segments relative motions and forces are given as inputs in the model. In order to integrate the adaptive elastic foot in the rigid bodies system a numerical model of the foot is built using the finite element method and then reduced by static condensation. The reduced elastic model is then integrated in the rigid bodies’ model of the human gait. This model is used to simulate the stance period of the human gait. Four parameters, the vertical ground reaction force (GRF), the body centre of mass (BCoM), the ankle joint moment and the hip joint rotation are considered as defining characteristics of the human gait. These characteristics are used in the evaluation of the model results and latterly in the evaluation of the adaptive foot usefulness. The simulation model is validated through comparison with experimental results of the human gait. The model shows good consistency with experimental results and can be further used in simulating the human gait using prosthetic feet with different mechanical properties and positions. Different prosthetic foot properties and walking conditions are studied for the adaptive elastic prosthetic foot. The stiffness of the foot sole is changed for normal walking on level and inclined surfaces and for fast walking on level surfaces. The changes in stiffness show changes in the vertical BCoM motion which improve the gait form for walking faster than the normal walking speed but show no significant changes on the other parameters. The ankle joint inclination is also changed for walking on uphill inclined surfaces; the results show that increasing the inclination angle reduces the vertical GRF and increases the horizontal motion of the BCoM and relatively the step size, which improves the uphill motion on inclined surfaces. Also designs of beam elements with changeable stiffness {{that could be used in}} an adaptive prosthetic foot’s sole are considered. In this part two concepts are developed and studied theoretically then two models are manufactured and proved experimentally. The results show good changes in the stiffness of the models, then the first model consisting of two plates sliding one in the other shows experimentally a change of ± 8. 5 % in the stiffness and the second model consisting of two plates screwed together gives experimentally an average change of ± 18 % in the stiffness. Since these models are designed to be used as replacements for human limbs (where the available external energy sources are limited) attention was given to model a light weight system with minimum energy consumption for controlling and driving it. Also attention was given to design a system that could be used with the different commercially available prosthetic feet without the need to make large changes in the original models designs and sizes...|$|E
