It is also known that LK with a full cut rule in tree-form p-simulates LK in DAG form. In this paper, we show that LK (in <b>tree</b> <b>form)</b> with a cut rule, where the {{complexity}} of cut formulas is bounded by (k + 1) has an exponential speed-up over the one bounded by k. We also show that LK (in <b>tree</b> <b>form)</b> with a bounded complexity cut rule does not polynomially simulate cut-free LK in DAG form...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, the H/D ratio was {{negatively}} correlated with IAA amounts in the stem in June, August, and October. We reported that H/D ratio had a significantly positive effect on stem stiffness in sugi trees [4]. In addition, we reported that younger sugi <b>trees</b> <b>forming</b> juvenile wood with smaller stem stiffness had much larger amounts of IAA than older sugi <b>trees</b> <b>forming</b> mature wood with larger stem stiffness [6]. Therefore, large IAA amounts might have negative effects on stem stiffness in sugi trees.|$|R
30|$|For wood {{properties}} (e.g. Burdon 1977; Jayawickrama 2001; Wielinga et al. 2009) and <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> (Jayawickrama 2001), RC interaction has {{usually been}} found to be minor, unless for instance if one is dealing with differential susceptibility of genotypes to pests or pathogens that affect <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> or wood properties. Severe nutrient deficiency can differentially affect wood properties among genotypes (Burdon and Harris 1973), but badly affected genotypes would contribute little if anything to crop yields, meaning that such interactions may have virtually no practical importance.|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> {{has an impact}} on the productivity of single-grip harvesters. However, it remains unclear, which elements of <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> are significant and to what degree they impact harvesting productivity. This is of particular importance in hardwood dominated stands, where hardwood trees often exhibit complex and variable stem and crown architecture that can complicate and prolong the processing phase. With the development of specialized harvesting heads, hardwoods, which were mostly subject to motor-manual operations, are now increasingly being cut and processed with fully mechanized harvesting systems. The goal of this pilot project was to determine the effect of <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> on the productivity of mechanized cut-to-length harvesting. A time and motion study of a single-grip harvester, operating in a hardwood dominated stand, suggests that the presence of a fork or a large branch on the main stem can reduce machine harvesting productivity by 15 to 20 %...|$|R

This paper {{deals with}} the study of {{measuring}} the green-value in the landscaping. The author considers the method of the measurement and computation as follows: G_a=(1 -a) Σπr^ 2. G_c=cΣπr^ 2 (H-h). Remarks: G_a: Area occupied by tree- and shrub crowns. G_c: Cubic volume occupied by tree- and shrub crowns. r_ 1 : Major axis of the tree crown. r_ 2 : Minor axis of the tree crown, r: Radius of crown. 2 r=(r_ 1 +r_ 2) / 2 H: Height of the tree. h: Height from the ground to the lowest branch of the tree, c: Coefficient of the <b>tree</b> <b>form.</b> Coefficient of the <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> indicates the relation between eight <b>tree</b> <b>forms</b> and a circle inscribed about {{each one of the}} forms, a: Ratio of duplication in the area occupied by the trees and shrubs. In practical application of the above formula, it is necessary to measure height of the tree, axis of the <b>tree</b> crown, <b>form</b> of the <b>tree</b> and height from the ground to the lowest branch of the tree for each one of the trees and shrubs. The coefficient of <b>tree</b> <b>forms</b> and the duplication of area occupied by tree- and shrub crowns were determined by an actual survey on the landscaped area of the two city parks in Tokyo. From the above survey, the following results were obtained: 1) An average coefficient of the <b>tree</b> <b>form</b> was 0. 5. 2) Generally in the city parks, trees and shrubs were planted at a ratio of 30 0 uplication. 3) The greenery in the city parks measured were 0. 4 m^ 2 per sq. m. in the flat, and 1 m^ 3 in the cubic volume per sq. m. 4) As per the individual tree crown, the occupied area was about 2 m^ 2 and the occupied cubic volume was about 5 m^ 3 on an average...|$|R
