25|$|First of all, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> {{virtue of}} a man, it is easily stated that a man's virtue is this—that he be {{competent}} {{to manage the}} affairs of his city, and to manage them so as to benefit his friends and harm his enemies, and to take care to avoid suffering harm himself. Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband.|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E
500|$|Actor Paul McCrane, {{who later}} {{went on to}} play the noted role of Dr. Robert Romano on ER, was cast {{to play the role}} of Leonard Betts. Director Kim Manners urged McCrane {{to play the role of}} Betts with [...] "emotional conviction." [...] Manners later {{explained}} that [...] "I found that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> absurd and base it in the reality of human emotion, the audience is going to buy it as if it actually exists. You know?" ...|$|E

[...] "Anybody might say the saints had sent you a dead body; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> jewels, I hope you buried him--and {{you can afford}} a mass or two for him into the bargain." ...|$|R
500|$|In a 1996 interview, Deal {{said that}} for Pacer, she focused on the vocals: [...] "Usually, I tend {{to spend more time}} with the instruments. Last Splash had quite a few instrumentals and quite a few songs where I might say five words. [...] songs are all vocal-heavy. The vocal leads, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> vocal away, you don't have much of a song." [...] The sound of the album has been {{described}} as [...] "lo-fi".|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post concurred in this assessment, {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the show as [...] "Hey, what happens <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> characters from Seinfeld and give them eating disorders?" [...] While crediting Starved for [...] "a few inventive laughs," [...] the language and sexuality of the show are described as [...] "exceptionally coarse" [...] and [...] "outrageous for cable television, even later at night." [...] Worse than these issues, the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them. [...] "his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness, with a sour aftertaste. As if you had just, you know, hurled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Section 5: Keep to {{the right}} hand side of Meanwood Beck (though you can cross and re-cross the many little bridges) going {{upstream}} and north until you pass through an arch in a stone wall. (<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> {{left side of the}} Beck, there is a big stone arched bridge just before this point.) [...] Turn left across a wooden bridge, then right into woods.|$|E

2500|$|When {{one wants}} to find a gesture, {{when you want to}} find how to act onstage, {{all you have to do}} is [...] to the music. The {{composer}} has already seen to that. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say 'Soul' and 'Ears' because the Mind must work, but not [...] much also—you will find every gesture there.|$|E
2500|$|Of note in {{the camp}} is its {{repurposing}} of various areas of its two predecessor camps. [...] The Lodge, pool, and boating areas of Wolverine North retain their functions, while Wolverine South's Lodge is now the Handicraft area, the boat docks are now the Ecology-Conservation area, and the pool pumphouse now hosts the reservation's Photography Outpost as the pool has been filled in. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> time to hike around {{you will find the}} foundations of several shower houses, canoe racks, and ruins of other structures.|$|E
2500|$|The director, Luc Jacquet, has {{condemned}} such {{comparisons between}} penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune {{to comment on}} the documentary's use as [...] "a metaphor for family values – the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial", Jaquet responded: [...] "I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maloney {{assembled}} {{the rest of}} his production team and engaged Roger Murray-Leach, with whom he had worked on the Doctor Who serials Planet of Evil, The Deadly Assassin and The Talons of Weng-Chiang, as production designer. To ensure uniformity of concept, Maloney asked Murray-Leach to design both the interior and exterior of the Liberator spacecraft. Murray-Leach [...] "...turned the ship around, so it was drawn to look as if it were going one way but flew the other way. In fact, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> line of flow, the angles go with it {{to get a sense of}} speed, and we turned that around so the 'wings' all canted forwards, not backwards". Murray-Leach's role as designer of the ship proved to be contentious with the series' special effects designer, Ian Scoones. Scoones found Murray-Leach's design for the Liberator awkward to mount and film for the scenes of the ship in flight.|$|E
2500|$|In interviews, Foster rarely {{talks about}} her private life, and she has {{explained}} that she [...] "values privacy against all else" [...] due to having {{spent most of her}} life in the public eye. She lives in Los Angeles, and had two sons, Charles [...] "Charlie" [...] Foster (b. 1998) and Christopher [...] "Kit" [...] Foster (b. 2001), while partnered with Cydney Bernard. She met Bernard on the set of Sommersby (1993) and was in a relationship with her from 1993 to 2008. In April 2014, Foster married actress and photographer Alexandra Hedison. She stated in 2011 that having children has made her take on fewer projects: [...] "It is a big sacrifice to leave home. I {{want to make sure that}} I feel passionate about the movies I do because it is a big sacrifice... Even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> average movie shoot of four months – you have three weeks' prep, press duties here and abroad, dubbing and looping, magazine covers, events and premieres – that's eight months out of a year. That's a long time. If you do two movies back-to-back, you're never going to see your children." ...|$|E

That, you see, was {{reasonable}} enough; but if the senor wished to go, too, it might be managed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> boat between <b>you.</b> I would carry <b>you</b> cheaply, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would be willing to wait for an hour or two; so that I could go round to the other fishermen, and get a few dozen fish from one and a few dozen from another, to sell for them over there. That is the way we manage." ...|$|R
