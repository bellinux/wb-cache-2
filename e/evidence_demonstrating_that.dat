25|$|Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens, 574 U.S. ___ (2015), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{clarified}} procedures for removing a class action lawsuit from state court to federal court. The case involved a dispute about revenue from oil and gas leases in which the defendant filed a motion to remove the case from a state court in Kansas to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. However, the plaintiff argued that the defendant's motion was defective because the defendant's notice of removal did not include <b>evidence</b> <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the amount in controversy satisfied the jurisdictional threshold. The United States District Court for the District of Kansas ultimately ruled the case should be returned to the state court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit declined to review the district court's decision.|$|E
25|$|After Constantine, the Chi-Rho {{became part}} of the {{official}} imperial insignia. Archaeologists have uncovered <b>evidence</b> <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the Chi-Rho was emblazoned on the helmets of some Late Roman soldiers. Coins and medallions minted during Emperor Constantine's reign also bore the Chi-Rho. By the year 350, the Chi-Rho began to be used on Christian sarcophagi and frescoes. The usurper Magnentius appears to have been the first to use the Chi-Rho monogram flanked by Alpha and Omega, on the reverse of some coins minted in 353. In Roman Britannia, a tesselated mosaic pavement was uncovered at Hinton St. Mary, Dorset, in 1963. On stylistic grounds, it is dated to the 4th century; its central roundel represents a beardless male head and bust draped in a pallium in front of the Chi-Rho symbol, flanked by pomegranates, symbols of eternal life. Another Romano-British Chi-Rho, in fresco, was found at the site of a villa at Lullingstone (illustrated). The symbol was also found on Late Roman Christian signet rings in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{arguments}} {{that the entire}} story is a hoax, including the 1980 article [...] "A Dissenting Opinion" [...] by cryptographer Jim Gillogly, and a 1982 scholarly analysis of the Papers and their related story by Joe Nickell, using historical records that {{cast doubt on the}} existence of Thomas J. Beale. Nickell also presents linguistic <b>evidence</b> <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the documents could not have been written at the time alleged (words such as [...] "stampeding", for instance, are of later vintage). His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward, whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale Papers to light. Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction; specifically, a [...] "secret vault" [...] allegory of the Freemasons; James B. Ward was a Mason himself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, a U.S. Senate Resolution {{called for}} an {{investigation}} of violations {{of the right to}} free speech and assembly and of interference with the right of labor to organize and bargain collectively. At the time, thirty percent of Pinkerton's business resulted from its industrial services. Between 1936 and 1941, the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee of the U.S. Congress held hearings and published reports on the phenomenon of labor spying, and other aspects of industrial relations. The committee established that in some cases, a company was able to lock out its workers three days prior to a strike, based upon information that Pinkerton services provided.
