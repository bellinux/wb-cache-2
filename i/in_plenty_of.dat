25|$|Switching the attack: Using a 'square' or 'cross' pass {{across the}} whole width of the pitch to a player <b>in</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> space is a very {{effective}} way of both relieving pressure and building a fresh attack. The defending team {{will be required to}} adjust its positions and this usually creates spaces which can be exploited. In this example, the player numbered 1 has moved out of position, allowing more space for the opposing player. By playing the ball to the other side (the curved line represents an aerial pass), the recipient of the pass finds themselves in space which can be exploited.|$|E

Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist.

Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|Negotiations between PP and C's {{started on}} 22 August with early advances, but the PP's initial aim {{to try to}} persuade C's into a {{government}} coalition failed after disagreements in labor and economy matters.
