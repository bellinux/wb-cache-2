Nanoplasmonic structures for analyte detection typically require sophisticated nanofabrication techniques, as well as bioactivated nanostructures that need multistep conjugations for chemical ligation. An alternative to such complex processes is to rely on specific biomolecules adsorption for decoration or self-assembly of nanoparticles at solid/liquid interface. In principle, small biomolecules with specific binding properties to nanostructures could control the assembly without modifying the nanoparticle chemistry, pH of the solution or salt concentration.

40|$|The Carnot {{heat engine}} sets an {{upper bound on}} the {{efficiency}} of a heat engine. As an ideal, <b>reversible</b> <b>engine,</b> a single cycle must be performed in infinite time, and so the Carnot engine has zero power. However, {{there is nothing in}} principle forbidding the existence of a heat engine whose efficiency approaches that of Carnot while maintaining finite power. Such an engine must have very special properties, some of which have been discussed in the literature, in various limits. While recent theorems rule out a large class of engines from maintaining finite power at exactly the Carnot efficiency, the approach to the limit still merits close study. Presented here is an exactly solvable model of such an approach that may serve as a laboratory for exploration of the underlying mechanisms.

SulA did not inhibit the polymerization of purified FtsZ 2 mutant protein, which was originally isolated as insensitive to SulA.
