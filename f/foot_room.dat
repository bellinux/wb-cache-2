500|$|In 1962, {{the year}} of Middleton's {{retirement}} from LSU, Mississippi State University declared him the [...] "alumnus of the year," [...] joining the company of earlier honoree, John C. Stennis, {{who had been the}} 1958 designate. [...] On 10 September 1966, the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters awarded Middleton a bronze plaque, honoring him as the Louisianan of the Year for his accomplishments in racial peace-keeping while chairing the Commission on Human Relations, Rights, and Responsibilities. [...] On 24 March 1973, the Middleton Collection of Memorabilia was dedicated at LSU. Housed in a 24 by 54 <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> in the university's library, the collection included pictures, letters, citations, awards, plaques, a uniform, riding boots, a saber and numerous other artifacts and documents. [...] The room was maintained until 1999, when the space was given to other priorities, and all of the items were cataloged and moved to the university archives in the old Hill Memorial Library on campus.|$|E
500|$|Wonder Mountain is a steel structure, its meshing {{covered in}} autumn 1980 {{with three layers}} of gunnite, a special type of cement that was later {{roughened}} {{to make it look}} like rock. Pumps within the mountain push the water over at the rate of 35,000 gallons a minute. This water helped cool the park's air conditioning units, stored in a 100 by 40 <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> inside the mountain. The waterfall itself is named Victoria Falls, and was reportedly based on Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, which straddles the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 2011, the park's [...] "Victoria Falls" [...] was still listed as powering its air conditioning. The mountain itself was slow to be named. Park publicist Mike Filey suggested in July 1980 that it might be named after Canadian-born Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook. Beaverbrook is typically associated with New Brunswick, where he moved at age 13 and started his first newspaper, and with the United Kingdom, where he became a newspaper baron. The Globe and Mail speculated that it might be named Mount Maple, to soothe relations with the local community, or that there might be a naming contest.|$|E
2500|$|The Alliance was {{slightly}} smaller {{on the outside}} than the competing first-generation Ford Escort (North America), but it was somewhat bigger on the inside where it looked larger and more inviting. Interior space was good for four or occasionally five people, {{in part due to}} a cleverly engineered front seats—where each seat was mounted on a [...] wide central rail (rather than two side tracks) allowing for copious rear <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> {{on either side of the}} rail. In addition to the usual recline and fore-and-aft movements, the upscale DL models included a curved track that allowed the seat to be adjusted along the arc to find the most comfortable position for driver and passenger.|$|E

5000|$|Additional leg-room was {{gained by}} {{adopting}} a slim front seat back. The rear passenger floor was also made flatter by re-routing exhaust pipes beneath {{the vehicle to}} offer better middle position <b>foot</b> <b>room.</b> Rear seat comfort is also enhanced {{with the use of}} denser urethane pads and foam inserts within the seats.|$|E
2500|$|Samoa and American Samoa have local Red Cross offices. New Zealand Red Cross {{humanitarian}} aid workers {{are also on}} stand-by to travel to Samoa, and has started a fund for donations. [...] The Red Cross is building 76 ten foot by twenty <b>foot</b> single <b>room</b> homes and 23 twenty foot by twenty <b>foot</b> multi <b>room</b> homes in Nuiatoputapu to replace homes destroyed there by the tsunami.|$|R
50|$|Reed Arena is able {{to provide}} group {{accommodations}} on many different levels. Events can greatly vary in size; the Arena can accommodate an event involving thousands of patrons or a small meeting that contains only 15 participants on any given day. The arena floor contains 25,000 square feet of column-free space, {{large enough to accommodate}} 150 exhibit booths or a 1,800 seat banquet. This figure almost doubles the space any other building in the Bryan/College Station area.

50|$|It {{was widely}} criticized for its noisy engine, fuel consumption, lack of head and <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> (due to the {{placement}} of the steering column), and a dealer network who were uneducated on the product. The trucks many times sat, unsold, for several years. Production came to an end along with the Ford-Navistar relationship, and Ford divested itself of Blue Diamond.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable feature {{in the house is}} a wooden {{partition}} that can be removed (by taking out the baseboard and kicking the panels out on dowels) to join the drawing room and the central hall into a 20 x 30 <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> for great occasions. The partition is fully paneled on both sides, both above and below the chair rail. Complete with a 10-pane casement window {{on either side of the}} partition door, the design is extraordinary.|$|E
50|$|The {{start of}} the PMCC Museum, goes back to 1957. Margie Pfund of Columbiana, Ohio devoted a 7 foot by 10 <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> of her {{farmhouse}} for the museum. Pfund and her husband helped {{play an important role}} of the club. She, and her husband, Art, were the curators. Soon, they moved the PMCC Museum to a larger room in an added wing of the house.

The building (located at 188 Martin Luther King Drive, Atlanta, GA) was originally used as a warehouse for the Confederate Army during the civil war. The first practice was held on March 29, 2010.

50|$|Most supercars {{offer little}} <b>foot</b> <b>room</b> and {{little to no}} {{provision}} for luggage, but the Bora has a full-size trunk {{in the front of}} the vehicle, and was otherwise known as being much more civilized in comforts from its competitors, while still being rated at 171 mph by the Maserati factory. Unlike its competitors, the Bora used dual-pane glass separating its cabin from the engine compartment as well as a carpeted aluminum engine cap, greatly decreasing the engine noise in the cabin and increasing the comfort level for the driver.|$|E
50|$|In 1954 the {{courthouse}} underwent a major remodeling, {{in which the}} large circuit courtroom was split in half, {{to form a new}} district courtroom, a judges' office, and a 182-square foot conference room. The orientation of the circuit courtroom was changed from east and west to north and south in its remodeled form and the ceiling was lowered by one-third, to a height of 16 feet.

5000|$|Hirondelle Family - The Hirondelle Family {{was born}} {{as a result}} of a Hirondelle Mk III owner, David Trotter, and the {{original}} designer Chris Hammond, modifying the Mk III moulds. The most important differences were a wider beam (about 600mm extra), more freeboard (allowing more comfort in the cabin), the starboard forward berth was removed and replaced by a larger functional galley, the heads became much bigger and even able to sport a shower, the rudders were underslung (enabling [...] "sugar scoop" [...] transoms to be used), and windows were installed over the quarter berths.
