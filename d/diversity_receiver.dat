40|$|Ergodic {{capacity}} {{is an important}} performance measure associated with reliable communication at the highest rate at which information can be sent over the channel with a negligible probability of error. In the shadow of this definition, <b>diversity</b> <b>receivers</b> (such as selection combining, equal-gain combining and maximal-ratio combining) and transmission techniques (such as cascaded fading channels, amplify-and-forward multihop transmission) are deployed in mitigating various performance impairing effects such as fading and shadowing in digital radio communication links. However, the exact analysis of ergodic {{capacity is}} in general not always possible {{for all of these}} forms of <b>diversity</b> <b>receivers</b> and transmission techniques over generalized composite fading environments due to it's mathematical intractability. In the literature, published papers concerning the exact analysis of ergodic capacity have been therefore scarce (i. e., only [1] and [2]) when compared to those concerning the exact analysis of average symbol error probability. In addition, they are essentially targeting to the ergodic capacity of the maximal ratio combining <b>diversity</b> <b>receivers</b> and are not readily applicable to the capacity analysis of the other diversity combiners / transmission techniques.
