25|$|The dorsal and ventral {{profiles}} of the fish are nearly evenly , with the two lines intersecting at the pointed snout. There are two separate dorsal fins; the first consisting of eight moderately high spines and the second of a single spine followed by 22 to 25 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorally detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 18 to 21 soft rays. The terminal soft rays of both the anal and dorsal fins are nearly {{twice as long as}} the penultimate rays, forming distinctive finlet-like structures, although are still attached to the main <b>fin</b> <b>structure</b> by interradial membranes. The lateral line is slightly arched anteriorally, with the intersection of the curved and straight section occurring below the sixth to eighth dorsal soft ray. The curved section contains between 39 and 57 scales, while the straight section has no to 10 scales and 36 to 49 scutes. Another of the major distinguishing features of the species is an adipose eyelid which fully encloses the eye except for a small vertical slit over the pupil. This feature is only observable in individuals greater than 10cm, as juveniles below this length are still developing the eyelid. Both jaws have a single row of small teeth, although two or three rows of small canine teeth are present in older individuals. There are 37 to 44 gill rakers in total and 24 vertebrae. The yellowtail scad is a small species in comparison with many of the other fishes within the Carangidae, reaching a recorded maximum length of only 30cm, although is more often encountered around 20cm.|$|E

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory's {{graphite}} foam has {{the potential}} to be used as a heat exchanger for the Army's Future Combat System Manned Ground Vehicle and thus {{has the potential}} to improve its thermal performance. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLOW 3 D was used to develop a new CFD model for the graphite foam to be used in the development of a proper heat exchanger. The program was calibrated by first measuring the properties of the solid foams and determining the parameters to be used in the CFD model. Then the model was used to predict within 5 % error the performance of finned foam heat sinks. In addition, the f factors and j factors commonly used to predict pressure drop and heat transfer were calculated for both the solid and <b>finned</b> <b>structures.</b> There was some evidence that corrugating the foams would yield higher j/f ratios than state of the art heat exchangers, confirming previously measured data. Because the results show that the CFD model was validated, it is recommended that the funding for Phases 2 through 5 be approved for the design of both the finned heat exchanger using tubes and round <b>fin</b> <b>structures</b> and the solid foam design using corrugated foams. It was found that the new CFD model using FLOW 3 D can predict both solid foam heat transfer and finned foam heat transfer with the validated model parameters. In addition, it was found that the <b>finned</b> foam <b>structures</b> exhibited j/f ratios that indicate that significant heat transfer is occurring within the <b>fin</b> <b>structures</b> due to aerodynamically induced flow, which is not present in solid aluminum <b>fin</b> <b>structures.</b> It is possible that the foam surfaces can act as turbulators that increase heat transfer without affecting pressure drop, like the vortex generators seen in state of the art heat exchangers. These numbers indicate that the foam can be engineered into an excellent heat exchanger. It was also found that corrugating the solid foams would increase the j/f ratio dramatically, allowing the solid foams to compete directly with standard heat exchangers. Although corrugated L 1 foam samples have not been produced (attempts are under way), it is possible that their j/f ratio can be even higher than those of the <b>finned</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

By creating a circular foyer the architect has disguised this fact, as without obvious side and back walls the patrons were unlikely to notice the change in direction. From the foyer were doors to a small lounge (off to the left - originally they had gold coloured rattan chairs and glass topped rattan tables) and stairs to the café, above the foyer.

Extensive wind-tunnel tests have been conducted on a scaled model fin integrated with piezoelectric actuators and accelerometers to measure the afttip vibration responses under various freestream and vortical airflow conditions. Test results demonstrated that the airflow induced considerable damping to the <b>fin</b> <b>structure,</b> which generally increased with airflow speed {{as well as the}} vertical fin angle of attack relative to the airflow direction.

These aerodynamic effects may adversely affect the performance and robustness of the closed-loop control laws developed based on vertical fin dynamic model identified without considering the varying aerodynamic effects.

40|$|One {{major problem}} of modem {{military}} aircraft is the buffet loading on the fin structures. Flying the aircraft at high angles of attack allows vortices, evolving from {{the leading edge}} of the wing, to hit the fin and excite struc-tural vibrations.

In this paper an adaptive structural system is presented, that has been developed with the aim of reducing these fin vibrations. The adaptive system uses an ACTIVE INTERFACE to dynamically introduce counteracting forces that cancel out the aerodynamically induced vibrational loads. This interface concept is based upon the integration of piezoelectric elements directly into the bending support of the <b>fin</b> <b>structure.</b> Therefore, the piezoelectric materials were extensively tested in order to characterise their performance under the expected very high load levels. sub-sequently, a FE-model of the <b>fin</b> <b>structure</b> was investigated, mode shapes and eigenfrequencies were extracted.
