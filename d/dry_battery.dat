40|$|The {{problem of}} {{non-destructive}} {{determination of the}} state-of-charge of zinc- and magnesium-manganese dioxide <b>dry</b> <b>batteries</b> is examined experimentally {{from the viewpoint of}} internal impedance and open-circuit voltage at equilibrium. It is shown that the impedance is mainly charge-transfer controlled at relatively high states-of-charge and progressively changes over to diffusion control as the state-of-charge decreases in the case of zinc-manganese dioxide <b>dry</b> <b>batteries.</b> On the other hand, the impedance is mainly diffusion controlled for undischarged batteries but becomes charge-transfer controlled as soon as there is some discharge in the case of magnesium-manganese dioxide batteries. It is concluded that the determination of state-of-charge is not possible for both types of batteries by the measurement of impedance parameters due to film-induced fluctuations of these parameters.

50|$|Although not {{strictly}} a pentagrid (in {{that it has}} more than five grids), the octode (eight-electrode) nevertheless operates on the pentagrid principle.

5000|$|... in 1895, {{the first}} {{four-stroke}} engine {{was ready for}} production. The 138 cc (bore 50 mm, stroke 70 mm) single cylinder engine with a surface carburettor produced 0.5 HP at an engine speed of 1500 RPM, a remarkably high speed for the time. For comparison: Hildebrand & Wolfmüller reached 240 RPM, the Daimler Reitwagen motor ran at maximum 750 RPM. Bouton {{found out that the}} glowplug ignition was the obstacle to higher speeds. He developed a high voltage ignition system for the motor with circuit breaker. The <b>dry</b> <b>battery</b> for the ignition is located under the upper frame tube (in the case of a motor tricycle); ignition timing could be adjusted with a small lever. Side valves were driven via a gear-driven camshaft, with automatic snifting valve activation. The advantage of the design should have been very early (0-5 degrees before top dead centre) opening inlet valve. The cylinder head was removable and bolted with four bolts on the crank case. The weight of the existing cast iron engine including all auxiliary units amounted to less than 20 kg. [...] "The benefits of this engine were simplicity and ease." ...|$|E
