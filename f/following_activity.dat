5000|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} that music provides for {{children as they}} continue to grow. The benefits that young children acquire through music include social skills, emotional self-regulating abilities, cognitive benefits, and physical benefits. Socially, children have the opportunity to learn how to take turns and play with others while still playing individually, for example a band of little players each playing their instrument but yet looking at the big picture of playing with a group of little friends as well. Music also allows a smooth transitioning throughout daily activities, whether it be at home or in a classroom setting children get the idea of the <b>following</b> <b>activity.</b> [...] Allowing children to play with others, including adults or older siblings also gives them a boost of self-esteem. Also, different songs show children the different words used for emotions and body awareness, as well as extending their vocabulary in general. Additionally, by extending children’s vocabulary they can also learn of different cultural music and languages, for some the benefit to integrate home within their care-giving setting. Cognitive benefits also include learning how to count, recognizing sequencing and patterns, phonemic awareness, memorizing different songs for different experiences, and simply memorizing songs and their pace and tone. Physically, children’s all around gross and fine motor skills grow rapidly by learning how to move their body to music, moving their bodies to actions of a song, and as they grow by learning how to hold and play an instrument.|$|E

5000|$|Tejada {{perceived}} Traditionalism as {{a unique}} Spanish response to the 1515-1648 rupture in European political thought; the latter afterwards degenerated into absolutism, liberalism, totalitarism, and most recently into secular, parliamentarian, free-market, nation-state democracies. Traditionalism itself was politically best embodied in Carlism. Its essence was threefold. First, it consisted of Catholic unity; some scholars claim that Tejada was opposed to religious liberty, others maintain that he was opposed to equality of faiths and advocated a state-endorsed Catholic orthodoxy. Second, it embraced historical, social, accountable, representative, foral, federative, missionary, organic and hereditary monarchy. Third, {{it was based on}} a subsidiary state model. The latter marked total reversal from original Tejada's penchant for omnipotent leadership and reflected the Traditionalist logic of state serving society, society serving man, and man serving God. A de-centralized withdrawn state, with is functions reduced, is to provide merely a framework for communities making it up, developed historically and safeguarded by separate legal establishments; The communities in question are to be governed by autonomous intermediary bodies and should participate in state politics represented in the Cortes by delegates of various [...] "gremios, hermandades, agrupaciones, cámaras, comunidades y cofradías"; Tejada juxtaposed Spanish communitarian fueros against the French individual liberties. According to some, the proposal advanced by Tejada was intended as a discussion how Spain should look like after Franco.Tejada's works on theory of politics are visibly less numerous than those on theory of law or on history of political thought; moreover, some of them resemble political manifestos rather than scholarly writings.

40|$|We {{study by}} {{computer}} simulation the "Hawkes process" that was proposed {{in a recent}} paper by Crane and Sornette (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.

We test the claims made there that robust identification is possible for classes of dynamic response <b>following</b> <b>activity</b> bursts. Our simulated timeseries for the Hawkes process indeed fall into the different categories predicted by Crane and Sornette. However the Hawkes process gives a much narrower spread of decay exponents than the YouTube data, suggesting limits to the universality of the Hawkes-based analysis.

40|$|A {{series of}} Group VIII metal {{catalysts}} was {{obtained for the}} semi-hydrogenation of styrene. Catalysts were characterized by Hydrogen Chemisorption, TPR and XPS. Palladium, rhodium and platinum low metal loading prepared catalysts presented high activity and selectivity (ca. 98 %) during the semi-hydrogenation of styrene, being palladium the most active catalyst. The ruthenium catalyst also presented high selectivity (ca. 98 %), but the lowest activity. For the palladium catalyst, {{the influence of the}} precursor salt and of the reduction temperature on the activity and selectivity were studied. The <b>following</b> <b>activity</b> series was obtained: PdN- 423 > PdCl- 673 > PdCl- 373 > PtCl- 673 > RhCl- 673 >> RuCl- 673.

40|$|Homeostatic {{plasticity}} {{is important}} to maintain a set level of activity in neuronal circuits and has been most extensively studied in cell cultures <b>following</b> <b>activity</b> blockade. It is still unclear, however, whether activity changes associated with mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity occur in vivo, for example after changes in sensory input. Here, we show that activity levels in the visual cortex are significantly decreased after sensory deprivation by retinal lesions, followed by a gradual increase in activity levels in the 48 hr after deprivation. These activity changes are associated with synaptic scaling, manifested in vitro {{by an increase in}} mEPSC amplitude and in vivo by an increase in spine size. Together, these data show that homeostatic activity changes occur in vivo in parallel with synaptic scaling...|$|E

But in previous epochs the odd cycles could be less than the preceding even cycles, and it only proves the reversal of Gnevyshev-Ohl rule. Comment: 11 pages, 1 table, 4 figure...|$|E

To predict the starting time of the <b>following</b> <b>activity,</b> it incrementally utilizes mean and standard deviation of previous history which are applied according to the central limit theory of statistical probability. The prediction algorithm exhibits 88. 3 to 95. 3 % prediction accuracies for different ranges of mean and standard deviations when verified by practical smart home data. Further stochastic analyses prove that the time difference between the residents activities follows normal distribution which was merely an assumption previously...|$|E
