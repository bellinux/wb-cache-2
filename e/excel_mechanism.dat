40|$|Abstract––Cloud Computing {{provides}} robust computational {{power to}} the society at reduced cost that enables customers with minimum computational resources to outsource their large computation workloads to the cloud, and economically enjoy the massive computational power, bandwidth, storage, and even appropriate software that can be shared in a payper-use manner. Tremendous advantage is the primary goal that prevents {{the wide range of}} computing model for customers when their confidential data are consumed during the computing process. Problem solving is a technique to reach the practical goal of particular mechanisms that not only solves the problems but can also protect from malicious behaviors. Linear programming is an operation research technique formulating private data by the customer for LP problem as a set of matrices and vectors, to develop a set of efficient privacy-preserving problem transformation techniques, which allow customers to transform original LP problem into some arbitrary one while protecting sensitive input/output information. We identify that LP problem solving in <b>EXCEL</b> <b>mechanism</b> is efficient additional cost on both cloud server and comparative analysis presents the follow of Linear programming in cloud computing is practical mechanism design...|$|E

Through education, people become able to obtain information about their own abilities and aptitudes, which facilitates their choice of a field {{in which they can}} <b>excel.</b> A skill-acquisition <b>mechanism</b> based on this aspect of education is presented, in which people who are uncertain about their educational outcomes are sorted into distinct skill-learning paths. An educational choice depends not only on what one can expect from acquiring a particular skill, but also on the variety of skills and the proximity among skills...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{distinct}} longest prefix matching(LPM) lookup scheme {{able to achieve}} exceedingly concise lookup tables (CoLT), suitable for scalable routers. Based on unified hash tables for handling both IPv 4 and IPv 6 simultaneously, CoLT <b>excels</b> over previous <b>mechanisms</b> in: 1) lower on-chip storage for lookup tables; 2) simpler table formats to enjoy richer prefix aggregation and easier implementation; and 3) most importantly, deemed the only design able to accommodate both IPv 4 and IPv 6 addresses uniformly and effectively. As its hash tables permit multiple possible buckets to hold each prefix (following a migration rule to avoid false positives altogether), CoLT exhibits the best memory efficiency and can launch parallel search over tables during every LPM lookup, involving fewer cycles per lookup when on-chip memory is used to implement hash tables. With 16 (or 32) on-chip SRAM blocks clocked at 500 MHz (achievable in today’s 65 -nm technology), it takes 2 (or 1. 6) cycles on average to complete a lookup, yielding 250 (or 310) millions of packets per second (MPPS) mean throughput. Being hash-oriented, CoLT well supports incremental table updates, besides its high table utilization and lookup throughput.

40|$|Os mecanismos de ruptura por tombamento são movimentos devidos à força que causam momento, originando rotação e/ou flexão de colunas ou de blocos de rocha, originadas pela interceptação de diferentes famílias de descontinuidades. Tais mecanismos são divididos em três grupos principais: tombamento flexural, tombamento de blocos e bloco-flexural. Para o tombamento de blocos foi desenvolvida uma metodologia de análise, via equilíbrio limite, tendo por base a proposta clássica de Goodman & Bray (1976), onde se calcula um fator de segurança para um conjunto de blocos. Aplicou-se a metodologia a três taludes distintos, onde nota-se em campo a presença de tal mecanismo. Os três taludes analisados foram: um talude na entrada do bairro Vila Aparecida, em Ouro Preto, cuja litologia é um xisto; um talude em gnaisse, na cidade de Itabirito, próximo ao Acesso II; e o outro na Rodovia dos Inconfidentes no Km 45, próximo à lanchonete Jeca Tatu, também na cidade de Itabirito, cuja litologia é um quartzito. Fez-se um levantamento geológico-geotécnico em todos os taludes visando à obtenção de parâmetros de resistência e deformabilidade dos maciços. Entretanto, encontrou-se dificuldade em estabelecer quais valores deveriam ser utilizados, diante das incertezas e da falta de correlações confiáveis entre as equações e os métodos empíricos. Realizaram-se análises de estabilidades, tanto via equilíbrio-limite quanto via tensão-deformação para os taludes estudados. Compararam-se os resultados obtidos pelas análises numéricas e pela metodologia proposta e chegou-se a conclusão que esta responde bem à realidade em campo, apesar das suas simplificações, sendo sua {{principal}} vantagem a facilidade de uso, já que a mesma foi implementada em planilha <b>Excel.</b> ________________________________________________________________________________________________ABSTRACT: The <b>mechanisms</b> of rupture by act ing of toppling are movements due to {{the force}} that causes the momentum, originating the rotation and/or bending of columns or bloc ks of rocks, created by the interception {{of different kinds of}} discontinuities. Those mechanisms are divided into three main groups: block toppling, flexural toppling and block flexure toppling. For the block toppling, it was developed a methodology of ana lysis, by limit equilibrium analysis, having as base the Goodman & Bray's (1976) classical proposal, which suggests that a factor of safety should be calculated for a set of blocks. This methodology was applied to tree distinct slopes, where such mechanism can be found. The tree analyzed slopes were: one at the entrance of the neighborhood Vila Aparecida, in Ouro Preto, whose lithology is schist; one slope whose lithology is gneiss, in the city of Itabirito, next to the Acesso II; and the other in Inconfide ntes Road, Km 45, next to the Jeca Tatu Snack Bar, the slopes’ lithology is quartzite. A geological investigation was done in all of the slopes, angling for acquirement of parameters of elasticity and deformability of rock mass. However, difficulties on e stablish which value s should be used was found, towards the uncertainties and lack of reliable correlations between the equations and the empiric methods. For all slopes numerical analyses was done as far as for limit equilibrium analysis as for tension -deformation. The gotten results using the numeric analysis where compared to those found with proposed methodology, dropping into the conclusion that this m ethodology responds well to the reality found on the field, regardless its simplifications. Its main advantage is the ease of use, once it was implemented in Excel spreadsheet...|$|R
