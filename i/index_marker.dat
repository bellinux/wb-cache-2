30|$|In {{addition}} to the platelet production, decreased platelet survival time may be a mechanism related to thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients (Pradella et al. 2011; Witters et al. 2008). Thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients {{has been reported to}} have a remarkable homology with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as the reticulated platelet proportion (proportion of young platelets) and glycocalicin <b>index</b> (<b>marker</b> of platelet production) were significantly higher in both diseases as compared with healthy controls (Witters et al. 2008; Kajihara et al. 2003; Kajihara et al. 2007). Pradella et al. showed platelet-associated antibodies and anti-platelet antibodies were significantly higher in HCV-positive patients as compared to other etiologies of cirrhosis (Pradella et al. 2011). In this study, the correlation between platelet level and spleen volume was relatively weak (p[*]=[*] 0.364, Figure  6 f) in HCV. Thus, in {{addition to}} spleen sequestration, decreased survival {{may be one of the}} likely mechanisms for thrombocytopenia in HCV-positive cirrhotic patients, though direct evidence for platelet related antibodies was not investigated in this study.|$|E

Therefore, more-specific and -reliable serological methods have been sought. We have characterized major membrane protein II (MMP-II) as a candidate protein for a new serological antigen. In this study, we evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the MMP-II antigen (MMP-II ELISA) for detecting antibodies in leprosy patients and patients' contacts in the mid-region of Vietnam and compared to the results to those for the PGL-I method (PGL-I ELISA). The results showed that 85 % of multibacillary patients and 48 % of paucibacillary patients were positive by MMP-II ELISA. Comparison between the serological tests showed that positivity rates for leprosy patients were higher with MMP-II ELISA than with PGL-I ELISA. Household contacts (HHCs) showed low positivity rates, but medical staff members showed comparatively high positivity rates, with MMP-II ELISA. Furthermore, monitoring of results for leprosy patients and HHCs showed that MMP-II is a better <b>index</b> <b>marker</b> than PGL-I. Overall, the epidemiological study conducted in Vietnam suggests that serological testing with MMP-II would be beneficial in detecting leprosy...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic {{diseases}} {{are a major}} concern worldwide. Increased specific plasma enzyme activities are considered diagnostic features for liver diseases, since enzymes are released into the blood compartment following {{the deterioration of the}} organ. Release of liver mitochondrial enzymes is considered strong evidence for hepatic necrosis, which is associated with an increased production of ROS, often leading to greater hepatic lipid peroxidation. Lipotoxic mediators and intracellular signals activated Kupffer cells, which provides evidence strongly suggesting the participation of oxidant stress in acute liver damage, inducing the progression of liver injury to chronic liver damage. Elevated transaminase activities are considered as an <b>index</b> <b>marker</b> of hepatotoxicity, linked to oxidant stress. However, a drastic increase of serum activities of liver enzyme markers ought not necessarily to reflect liver cell death. In fact, increased serum levels of cytoplasmic enzymes have readily been observed after partial hepatectomy (PH) in the regenerating liver of rats. In this regard, we are now showing that in vitro modifications of the oxidant status affect differentially the release of liver enzymes, indicating that this release is a strictly controlled event and not directly related to the onset of oxidant stress of the liver...|$|E

We investigated the association between oral health and autoimmune diseases in a cohort of Swedish adults. Hypothesis was that poor oral health associates with incidence of autoimmune diseases. Overall 1676 subjects aged 30 – 40 years old from Stockholm County (Sweden) participated in this study in 1985. Subjects were randomly selected from the registry file of Stockholm region and were followed-up for 30 years. Their hospital and open health care admissions (World Health Organization ICD 9 and 10 codes) were recorded from the Swedish national health registers. The association between the diagnosed autoimmune disease and the oral health variables were statistically analyzed. In all, 50 patients with autoimmune diagnoses were detected from the data. Plaque index was significantly higher in the autoimmune disease group (≥median 35 (70 %) vs. ˂median 872 (54 %), p = 0. 030). No statistical difference was found in gingival index, calculus index, missing teeth, periodontal pockets, smoking or snuff use between patients with and without autoimmune disease.

40|$|Estrogen {{receptor}} (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) are hormone receptors {{found on}} breast cells that pick up hormone signals resulting in cell growth. Similarly, positive human {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor- 2 (HER 2 /neu) status of the breast carcinoma means that HER 2 /neu gene is making too many HER 2 /neu proteins, which acts as receptors on the cell surface and helps the cells to grow and divide. Hormone receptor studies such as ER, PR, and HER 2 /neu are routinely done in breast carcinoma. It not only helps in the prognosis of the tumor but also helps in deciding its treatment. The goal of doing this receptor status is to provide right treatment to the right patient. This hormone receptor status is graded using Allred scoring and grading system.

Prostate cancer is a complex multifaceted and biologically heterogeneous disease, and overtreatment of localized, low volume indolent tumors, is evident. Here, we aimed to assess Ki- 67 expression and related outcomes of 535 patients treated with radical prostatectomy. The percentage of tumor epithelial cells expressing Ki- 67 was determined by immunohistochemical assay, both digital image analysis and visual scoring by light microscope were used for quantification. The association of Ki- 67 and prostate cancer was evaluated, {{as well as its}} prognostic value. There was a positive correlation between high expression of Ki- 67 and Gleason score > 7 (p < 0. 001) as well as tumor size (≥ 20 mm, p = 0. 03). In univariate analyses, a high expression of Ki- 67 in tumor epithelium was significantly associated with biochemical failure (BF) (digital scoring, p = 0. 014) and (visual scoring, p = 0. 004). In the multivariate analyses, a high level of Ki- 67 was an independent poor prognostic factor for biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) (Visual scoring, Ki 67, p = 0. 012, HR: 1. 50, CI 95 % 1. 10 - 2. 06).

However, {{little is known about}} the clinical significance of hs-cTnT in metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study was to examine the factors affecting hs-cTnT elevation in Japanese metabolic syndrome patients. Patients and methods: We enrolled 258 metabolic syndrome patients who were middle-aged males without a history of cardiovascular events. We examined relationships between hs-cTnT and various clinical parameters, including diagnostic parameters of metabolic syndrome. Results: There were no significant correlations between hs-cTnT and diagnostic parameters of metabolic syndrome. However, hs-cTnT was significantly correlated with age (P< 0. 01), blood concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (P< 0. 01), reactive oxygen metabolites (markers of oxidative stress, P< 0. 001), and the cardio–ankle vascular <b>index</b> (<b>marker</b> of arterial function, P< 0. 01).

40|$|Individuals {{at risk of}} {{coronary}} heart disease (CHD) show multiple correlations across blood biomarkers. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) indexing biomarker differences could help distinguish causal from confounded associations because of their random allocation prior to disease. We examined the association of 948 SNPs in 122 candidate genes with 12 CHD-associated phenotypes in 2775 middle aged men (a genic scan). Of these, 140 SNPs indexed differences in HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, factor VII, apolipoproteins AI and B, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2, homocysteine or folate, some with large effect sizes and highly significant P-values (e. g. 2. 15 standard deviations at P = 9. 2 × 10 − 140 for F 7 rs 6046 and FVII levels). Top ranking SNPs were then tested for association with additional biomarkers correlated with the index phenotype (phenome scan).

An oversight on the cored Jurassic sections of the DSDP Legs 79 and the corresponding foraminiferal descriptions are given. The reddish brown, clayey and carbonaceous Cat Gap Formation (Oxfordian to Tithonian) of the Northern Atlantic Ocean, rich in radiolarians, yields less or more uniform, in most cases allochthonous foraminiferal faunas of Central European shelf character. No Callovian and Upper Tithonian foraminiferaI zones can be established. The zone of Pseudomarssonella durnortieri covers the Oxfordian/Kimmeridgian, the zone of Neobulimina atlantica the Kimmeridgian/Lower Tithonian interval. Characteristic foraminiferal faunas are missing since the Upper Tithonian to Valanginian for reason of a widely distributed regression which caused hiatuses observed all over the Northern Atlantic Ocean and in parts of Europe. The Upper Jurassic cannot be subdivided into single stages by foraminiferal biostratigraphy alone. The fovaminiferal zones established by Moullad (1984) covering a Callovian-Tithonian interval may be of some local importance in the Tethyan realm: It has too long-ranging foraminiferal species {{to be used as}} <b>index</b> <b>marker</b> in the word-wide DSDP boreholes.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Diffuse large B-cell {{lymphoma}} is a diffuse {{proliferation of}} large neoplastic B lymphoid cells {{with a nuclear}} size equal to or exceeding the normal macrophage nuclei. We report {{a case of a}} clear cell variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving a lymph node in the neck, which was clinically suspected of being metastatic carcinoma. Case presentation A 39 -year-old Caucasian ethnic Albanian man from Kosovo presented with a rapidly enlarging lymph node in his neck, but he also disclosed B symptoms and fatigue. A cytological aspirate of the lymph node revealed pleomorphic features. Our patient underwent a cervical lymph node biopsy (large excision). The mass was homogeneously fish-flesh, pale white tissue replacing almost the whole structure of the lymph node. The lymph node biopsy showed a partial alveolar growth pattern, which raised clinical suspicion that it was an epithelial neoplasm. With regard to morphological and phenotypic features, we discovered large nodules in diffuse areas, comprising large cells with slightly irregular nuclei and clear cytoplasm admixed with a few mononuclear cells. In these areas, there was high mitotic activity, and in some areas there were macrophages with tangible bodies. Staining for cytokeratins was negative. These areas had the following phenotypes: cluster designation marker 20 (CD 20) positive, B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) - 2 -positive, Bcl- 6 -, CD 5 -, CD 3 -, CD 21 + (in alveolar patterns), prostate-specific antigen-negative, human melanoma black marker 45 -negative, melanoma marker-negative, cytokeratin- 7 -negative and multiple myeloma marker 1 -positive in about 30 % of cells, and exhibited a high proliferation <b>index</b> <b>marker</b> (Ki- 67, 80 %).

The map comprises 26 markers, {{with a maximum}} intermarker interval of 13. 1 cM and only two intervals > 10 cM. Placement of all but one marker into the map was achieved with > 10, 000 : 1 odds. The sex-equal length is 151 cM, with male length of 121 cM and female length of 185 cM. The map extends to within 2 %- 3 % of physical length at the telomeres, and its coverage therefore {{is expected to be}} within 20 - 30 cM of full map length. The markers are all of the GT/CA repeat type and have average heterozygosity. 77, with a range of. 60 -. 89. The map shows both marked contraction of genetic distance relative to physical distance in the pericentromeric region and expansion in the telomeric regions. Genotypic data were carefully examined for errors by using the crossover routine of the program DATAMAN. Five new mutations were observed among 17, 316 meiotic events examined. There were two double-crossover events occurring within an interval of 0 - 10 cM, and another eight were observed within an interval of 10 - 20 cM. Many of these could be due to additional mutational events in which one parental allele converted to the other by either gene conversion or random strand slippage. When there was no correction for these possible mutational events, the number of crossovers displayed by the maternal and paternal chromosomes was significantly different (P <. 001) from that predicted by the Poisson distribution, which would be expected in the absence of interference. In addition, the observed crossover distribution for paternally derived chromosomes was similar to that predicted from cytogenetic chiasma frequency observations. In all, the data strongly support the occurrence of strong positive interference on human chromosome 9 and suggest that flanking markers at an interval of < or = 20 cM are generally sufficient for disease gene inheritance predictions in presymptomatic genetic counseling by linkage analysis...|$|E
40|$|Four {{sections}} of the Galala and Maghra El Hadida formations on the footwalls of {{the slopes of the}} northern and southern Galala plateaus in Wadi Araba (Eastern Desert) have been measured and sampled in great detail. The Galala Formation is ranging in thickness from 55 to 95 meters. It unconformably overlies the Malha Formation which forms the base of the studied sections. The upper boundary of the Galala Formation is characterized by a major unconformity which separates it from the overlying the Maghra El Hadida Formation. The Galala Formation can be subdivided into five shallowing-upward cycles, each cycle starting with deep-lagoonal, marly-silty deposits at the base and grading into highly fossiliferous shallow-lagoonal limestones at the top. Only the basal part of the Galala Formation consists of unfossiliferous, greenish sandy siltstones intercalated with thin cross-bedded, bioturbated, fine- to medium-grained sandstones. Despite the lack of biostratigraphic markers in that lower part, its age can be assigned to the late Middle Cenomanian, since the conformably overlying strata contain the ammonite Neolobites vibrayeanus (D’ORBIGNY), the <b>index</b> <b>marker</b> of the early Upper Cenomanian which extends into the top of the formation. The measured thickness of the overlying Maghra El Hadida Formation is ranging from 59 to 118 meters. This formation starts with the Ghonima Member, introduced in this work to distinguish a brown, fine- to medium-grained calcareous sandstone unit in its lower part. The Ghonima Member is erosionally incised into the Galala Formation, explaining its strong lateral variability in thickness, ranging from 3 to 21 meters. It is mostly unfossiliferous except for irregular bioturbation in its upper part. The Ghonima Member is assigned to the middle Upper Cenomanian, based on its stratigraphic position between the lower Upper Cenomanian Neolobites vibrayeanus Zone and the overlying upper Upper Cenomanian Metoicoceras geslinianum and Vascoceras cauvini zones. This means that {{the lower part of the}} Maghra El Hadida Formation, about 20 – 30 m thick, accumulated during the latest Cenomanian and that the base of the formation does not coincide with the base of the Turonian as commonly believed. The overlying succession of the Maghra El Hadida Formation is characterized by an increase of carbonate content, represented by yellow, soft marls intercalated with fine-grained wacke- to packstones containing a highly fossiliferous ammonite assemblage of the upper Upper Cenomanian and Lower Turonian (zones of Vascoceras proprium, Choffaticeras spp., and Wrightoceras munieri). The Middle Turonian part of the Maghra El Hadida Formation consists of poorly fossiliferous, thick-bedded yellowish marls with upward-increasing silt content, showing occasional intercalations of medium- to coarse-grained sandstones with hummocky cross-stratification. The topmost part of the Maghra El Hadida Formation consists of brownish, medium-grained sandstones topped by fossiliferous marly limestones yielding the Upper Turonian zonal ammonite Coilopoceras requienianum (D’ORBIGNY). Based on sequence stratigraphic analyses, four complete 3 rd order depositional sequences and the lower part of a fifth one, each bounded by major unconformities, can be recognized: depositional sequence DS WA 1 (upper Middle – lower Upper Cenomanian) includes the entire Galala Formation, while the Maghra El Hadida Formation comprises all the overlying depositional sequences: DS WA 2 (upper Upper Cenomanian – Lower Turonian) reaches from the base of the Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone to the top of Wrightoceras munieri Zone, DS WA 3 and DS WA 4 comprise the Middle Turonian, while Upper Turonian sequence DS WA 5 is not complete. The stratigraphic positions of the recognized sequence 2 boundaries SB WA 1 to SB WA 5 match well with contemporaneous sequence boundaries known from Europe and elsewhere. The stacking pattern of the basic cycles and bundles of the Galala Formation (5 : 1) and the Maghra El Hadida Formation (4 : 1) strongly suggest an orbital forcing by MILANKOVITCH periodicities. The Galala Formation is composed of five 5 th-order bundles which equal to ~ 500 kyr, each bundle equals to ~ 100 kyr (short eccentricity). Every bundle has five basic (6 th-order) cycles, each one representing ~ 20 kyr (precession). Based on this precession-short eccentricity syndrome, the accumulation rate of the Galala Formation therefore accounts for about 19 cm/kyr. The rate of sea-level fall at sequence boundary SB WA 2 (equivalent to the quasi-global mid-Late Cenomanian SB Ce V) estimated is with 35 cm/kyr which can be explained only by glacio-eustasy. The Upper Cenomanian and Lower Turonian part of the Maghra El Hadida Formation is considered to equal to ~ 1200 kyr, based on the existence of three 4 th-order bundles with an inferred duration of ~ 400 kyr for each bundle (long eccentricity of the MILANKOVITCH Band). Every bundle consists of four basic cycles with a duration of ~ 100 kyr. This means that the upper Cenomanian part of the Maghra El Hadida Formation is equivalent to ~ 400 kyr, while the Lower Turonian (consisting of the two upper bundles) lasted 800 kyr. This matches well with the recently proposed 785 kyr duration of the Early Turonian (SAGEMAN et al., 2006; VOIGT et al., 2008) and contradicts the 1300 kyr according to the standard time scale of GRADSTEIN et al. (2004). According to this temporal constrains, the accumulation rate of the Maghra El Hadida Formation is about 4. 25 cm/kyr. In addition, based on the cyclostratigraphic analysis, the range of the Early Turonian genus Choffaticeras (HYATT) is equivalent to ~ 325 kyr and morphological changes within its lineage can be quantified. The macrobenthos (bivalves, gastropods, echinoids) and cephalopods of the Galala and Maghra El Hadida formations were identified and illustrated in 24 figures. The ammonite taxonomy and palaeobiogeographic distribution is discussed in detail. Four genera and eight ammonite species are recorded from Egypt for the first time. The microfloral and -faunal assemblage identified in thin sections revealed two species of dasycladalean algae, two species of udoteacean algae, five species of benthic foraminifera, and two species of crustacean microcoprolites. The six facies types of the upper Middle – Upper Cenomanian Galala Formation document largely open-lagoonal, warm water conditions, while the depositional environment of the Upper Cenomanian – Turonian Maghra El Hadida Formation (16 facies types) is suggested to range from a deep-subtidal to intertidal...|$|E
50|$|Also in 1968, Omega transitioned {{the caliber}} 321 {{movement}} to the new caliber 861, also designed by Albert Piguet, {{with the introduction of}} the reference 145.022 Speedmaster. The 861 was very similar to the 321, but replaced its column wheel switching mechanism with a cam and increased the beat rate from 18,000 to 21,600 vibrations per hour. Most Speedmaster Professional watches from 1968 to the present have used variants of this movement, including the modern rhodium-plated caliber 1861 and decorated exhibition calibers 863 and 1863. A standard Speedmaster Professional model with Plexiglas crystal, solid caseback with anti-vibration and anti-magnetic dust cover, tachymeter scale, without date or day complications, and powered by a caliber 861-based movement has been continuously produced since. The tritium-powered phosphorescent lume on the hands and <b>index</b> <b>markers</b> of the original watches were replaced {{at the end of the}} 1990s with non-radioactive pigments, but the fundamental design, dimensions, and mechanism of these watches have remained unchanged. In this form, the basic Speedmaster line has remained flight-qualified for NASA space missions and EVAs, after re-evaluation by NASA in 1972 and for use in the Space Shuttle program in 1978. The current such model is reference 311.30.42.30.01.005 (since 2014).|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} histopathological {{progression}} of invasive tumors in the pituitary pars distalis due to estrogen, female Fischer 344 (F 344) rats were treated subcutaneously with 5 mg/animal of estradiol dipropionate (ED) once every 2 wk for 13 wk. The animals were killed serially at 2 -wk intervals during the investigation. The pituitaries with surrounding tissues were examined light micro-scopically. At week 7, pituitary cells showed proliferation and atypia with formation of blood-filled spaces. Lesions with these characteristics were diagnosed as adenomas. At week 9 or later, neoplastic cells exhibited extensive proliferation and infiltration {{into the surrounding}} tissues, suggesting development of carcinoma. Both proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and 5 -bromo- 2 ’-de-oxyuridine (BrdU) labeling <b>index,</b> <b>markers</b> of cell proliferation, were significantly increased in animals with adenoma or carcinoma. To detect sequential changes in pituitary weight, its signal intensity was periodically monitored in identical rats by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The estimated pituitary weights revealed by MR imaging were comparable to the tumor weights obtained from rats at scheduled sacrifices. These results indicate that ED possesses the potential to cause carcinoma in rat pituitary and MR imaging is an effective tool for estimating the pituitary weight...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInsulin {{resistance}} {{and risk of}} type 2 diabetes {{are the most important}} complications following exposure to organophosphorous (OPs) pesticides. Regarding the importance of liver on metabolic pathways regulation, in particular blood glucose homeostasis, we focused on liver inflammation and oxidative damages in a subchronic model of toxicity by malathion. Adult male Wistar rats of body weight 200 - 250 g were used for the study. Malathion (200 mg/kg b. w. /day) was administered to rats by oral intubation for 28 days. Glycemic and insulin resistance <b>indices,</b> <b>markers</b> of liver injury, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were assessed. Malathion-treated rats showed increased glycemia, insulinemia and glycated hemoglobin level, HOMA-IR and HOMA-β indices, plasma activities of hepatocellular enzymes, lipid peroxidation index, CD 3 (+) /CD 4 (+) and CD 3 (+) /CD 4 (+) and pro-inflammatory cytokines when decreased antioxidant status in liver was noted. Most of our study indicates that malathion promotes insulin resistance, inflammation and Hepatosteatosis in subchronic model of exposure. On the basis of biochemical and molecular findings, it is concluded that insulin resistance induced by malathion occurs through oxidative stress and related pro-inflammatory markers in a way to result in a reduced function of insulin in liver cells...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Reciprocal {{recurrent}} selection among full-sib families {{is one of}} the outstanding methodologies of maize improvement, since gains are possible in the per se and/or in cross populations. Here the selection index proposed by Smith and Hazel was used in the cited methodology; besides, an additional phase involving RAPD markers was introduced to preserve the genetic variability of the selected genotypes and identify contaminants before their recombination. Multivariate techniques of grouping and discriminant analyses were used for this purpose, to assure the continuance of the improvement program and amplify the genetic distance between the populations Cimmyt and Piranão, which were used for an intervarietal hybrid. The molecular technique proved useful to identify contaminants and helpful in the choice of the genotypes to be recombined to maximize heterosis among populations. The technique can be included in {{recurrent selection}} programs, mainly those that target the development of hybrids.

40|$|Abstract: The {{coexistence}} of upper airways disease with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{is not well}} documented. The aim of this research was to assess sino-nasal inflammation in COPD by various tools, and look for the impact on quality of life, relation to smoking, disease severity and systemic inflammation. Current and ex-smokers with COPD (n = 42) and healthy never-smokers (n = 21) were included in this study. COPD severity was assessed by GOLD criteria and BODE <b>index.</b> <b>Markers</b> of systemic inflammation were measured. Nasal symptoms and general quality of life were assessed using the questionnaires; sino-nasal questionnaire (SNAQ- 11) and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Nasal endoscopy and saccharine test were performed. Nasal lavages were collected for cytological examination and eicosanoids (cysteinyl leukotrienes, leukotriene B 4, 8 -isoprostane). Symptoms and endoscopic scores were higher in COPD (P � 0. 0001). Only SGRQ symptoms subscore correlated with SNAQ- 11 (r = 0. 34, P = 0. 035). Mucociliary clearance was impaired only in current smokers (9. 91 ± 0. 49 versus 13. 12 ± 0. 68 minutes, P � 0. 001). 8 -isoprostane was higher in COPD smokers compared to the controls (0. 17 ± 0. 04 versus 0. 34 ± 0. 09 pg/g protein, P � 0. 05).
