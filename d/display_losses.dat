40|$|A semi-analytical {{study of}} the {{acoustic}} radiation losses associated with various transverse vibration modes of a micromechanical (MEMS) annular resonator is presented. The quality factor, Q, of such resonators is of interest in many applications and depends on structural geometry, interaction with the external environment, and the encapsulation method. Resonators {{with at least one}} surface exposed to air can <b>display</b> <b>losses</b> through acoustic radiation even at micro meter dimensions. Published experimental results suggest the dominance of acoustic losses in the Q of a MEMS drum resonator. In this study, a well established mathematical techniques to analytically model resonator vibration modes and fluid-structure interaction are used, and a semi-analytical procedure for computing Q due to acoustic radiation losses, Qac, in any vibrational mode outlined. Present technique includes calculation of the exact mode shape and its utilization in computing Qac. The dependence of Qac on the first 15 mode shapes is computed. Results are compared for the lowest 2 modes of a solid circular resonator using exact mode shapes to those of Lamb's approximate mode shapes. Comparison to published experimental results validates the predictive utility of the technique, especially for higher modes where acoustic radiation seems to be the dominant constituent of Q.

40|$|A {{deletion}} mapping analysis of chromosome 19 {{was performed on}} a series of 101 samples derived from malignant gliomas. A total of 35 tumors displayed different deletions for the loci studied (D 19 S 21, D 19 S 11, D 19 S 74, D 19 S 7, D 19 S 8, CKM, and D 19 S 22). In most instances, losses involving the long arm markers of chromosome 19 were observed, and only four samples were characterized by losses on the short arm. No tumor was found <b>displaying</b> <b>loss</b> of both short and long arm markers. The higher frequency of deletions was detected in tumors with a major oligodendroglial component: 76 % of samples included in this group <b>displayed</b> <b>losses</b> at 19 q. Among the astrocytic tumors, the frequency of 19 q alterations varied as follows: 11 % in pilocytic astrocytomas, 17 % in astrocytomas grade II, 10 % in anaplastic astrocytomas and 21 % in glioblastoma multiforme. No ependymoma was found <b>displaying</b> allele <b>loss</b> on chromosome 19. The common region of overlap for the 19 q deletions observed involves primarily the distal portion of the long arm, 19 q 13. 2 -q 13. 4.

Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to receive bolus or cumulative i. v. doses of melatonin, thiopental or propofol. Righting re¯ex, hindpaw withdrawal to a noxious stimulus, response to tail clamping and haemodynamic effects were assessed. Results. Melatonin caused a dose-dependent increase in paw withdrawal threshold and the percent of rats <b>displaying</b> <b>loss</b> of the righting re¯ex. Melatonin was comparable to thiopental and propofol {{in terms of its}} rapid onset of hypnosis. The mean ED 50 values for loss of righting re¯ex were 5. 4 (SEM 1. 2), 12. 5 (1. 1) and 178 (1. 1) mg kg± 1 for propofol, thiopental and melato-nin, respectively. The percent of rats <b>displaying</b> <b>loss</b> of response to tail clamping was greater with propofol than with melatonin (P< 0. 05). Haemodynamic changes produced by melatonin or propofol were similar in onset and magnitude. Conclusions. I.

40|$|SummaryApoptotic {{extrusion}} is a multicellular process {{utilized by}} live cells to remove neighboring apoptotic cells. In epithelial tissues, {{this process has}} been shown to be critical for the preservation of tissue integrity and barrier function [1, 2]. Here we demonstrate that extrusion is driven by the retraction of the apoptotic cell, which, in turn, triggers a transient and coordinated elongation of the neighboring cells. The coordination of cell elongation requires E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Accordingly, cells that express low levels of E-cadherin are compromised in elongation and apoptotic extrusion, and furthermore, <b>display</b> <b>loss</b> of barrier function in response to apoptotic stimuli. These findings indicate that the maintenance of adhesive forces during apoptotic cell turnover might play an essential role in controlling tissue homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how alterations in the PI 3 K pathway correlate with non-small cell lung cancer subtypes squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) and adenocarcinoma (ADCA). We analyzed copy number variation and protein expression of INPP 4 B, protein expression of pAkt, PDPK 1, and PTEN and mutational status of PIK 3 CA and PTEN in 180 cases. Nineteen% <b>displayed</b> <b>loss</b> of INPP 4 B copy, whereas 47 % lacked expression, both showing correlation with SCC. Elevated pAkt expression was seen in 63 % of all cases, also correlating to SCC. PDPK 1 was expressed in 70 %, more in male than female patients. Regarding PTEN, 50 % <b>displayed</b> <b>loss</b> of expression, of which seven were identified with mutations in the phosphatase domain. We detected nine cases (5 %) of PIK 3 CA mutations, all identified as the E 545 K hot spot mutation in the helical domain, all except one in SCC. When analyzing all PI 3 K pathway components together, we show that patients with at least one alteration in the PI 3 K pathway are twice as likely to have SCC, than ADCA. Interestingly, we also found a strong correlation between high pAkt expression and PTEN expression. As comparison, we also analyzed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes, where we identified fifteen KRAS mutations (8 %) and one BRAF mutation (1 %), significantly associated to ADCA. No association was found to the Gly 972 Arg polymorphism of IRS- 1, involved in activation of both PI 3 K and MAPK pathways. In conclusion, we show here that several components of the PI 3 K pathway, alone and in combination, are correlated to development of SCC of the lung.
