The data used in the analyses include unpublished institutional level data for all doctoral and research universities on <b>funding</b> and <b>indirect</b> cost rates obtained from the National Science Foundation for the fiscal years 1988 to 1997 period. Our major finding is that higher indirect cost rates are associated with higher levels of direct and <b>indirect</b> cost <b>funding</b> for institutions that initially are among the largest recipients of federal funding. In contrast, for universities initially in the lower tail of <b>funding</b> recipients, higher <b>indirect</b> cost rates are associated with lower levels of direct and <b>indirect</b> cost <b>funding.</b> This pattern of results is hypothesized to be based upon an institution 2 ̆ 7 s indirect cost rate serving primarily as a 2 ̆ 2 price 2 ̆ 2 of research for lesser institutions but serving primarily as a proxy for the quality of the institution 2 ̆ 7 s research infrastructure for the major recipients of federal funds. Our findings are consistent with the observation that since 1990 both indirect cost rates and shares of research funding for major private research universities have tended to decline. We find no evidence that faculty at major research universities are disadvantaged in their quests for external research <b>funding</b> by high <b>indirect</b> cost rates...|$|R

According to Yapı Merkezi, the main construction firm, the financing of the second phase between Kombolcha and Hara Gebeya hasn't been fully secured by August 2017 and construction works there are uncertain to some extent.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, many of the {{activities}} that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of [...] "arts policy". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and <b>indirect</b> <b>funding</b> to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as Kevin Mulcahy has observed, [...] "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy.

[...] A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., Classical music, painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., community theatre) and cultural forms which were not considered part of the Western canon by previous generations (e.g., traditional music such as blues, World music, and so on).|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} government and city of Paris continued {{to partner with}} NGOs {{in order to provide}} trafficking victims with a network of services and shelters during the reporting period. The government provided some <b>indirect</b> <b>funding</b> for victims’ care in 2009; however, it did not report overall funding allocations to NGOs for victims of trafficking. One NGO reported it received 20 percent of its budget from the government in 2009 but had to seek private funding in order to provide temporary housing for trafficking victims. Another NGO reported it worked with pro-bono medical and social service providers in order to assist victims of forced labor. A third NGO working with unaccompanied minors who are at risk of becoming victims of trafficking in France reported that it received 98 percent of its budget from the government in 2009. The government reported police and other authorities identified and referred 799 trafficking victims to NGOs for assistance in 2009; however, it reported that it did not officially collect or track data on the actual number or percentage of these identified victims that it referred for shelter and assistance. The NGO Committee Against Modern Slavery (CCEM) reported 216 cases of forced labor in France in 2008; 120 of these victims were reportedly placed in protective custody. The government increased its partnership with the Romanian government in order to improve the protection, return, and reintegration of Romani people unaccompanied minors. The French government provided witness protection services and issued one-year residency permits, which can be renewed every six months, to victims of trafficking who cooperated with authorities in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers; the government also provided identified victims with assistance and a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to cooperate with law enforcement. A trafficking victim may receive a permanent residency card though only if the defendant is successfully convicted by the government. The government did not report the number of victims that received residence permits or cards in 2009. One NGO continued to express frustration with the fees required for the residency permit and renewal of the permit. NGOs continued to provide monthly stipends to trafficking victims, with some of these stipends provided by the government. The government formally assists trafficking victims seeking return to their countries of origin, though fewer than five percent usually decide to do so. Although the border police reportedly used indicator cards to proactively identify victims, French border police do not have any systematic procedures in place to identify trafficking victims, according to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch. Some local observers continued to criticize the government’s lack of a proactive approach to identifying trafficking victims and reported that some women in prostitution are arrested and fined for solicitation without being screened to determine if they are trafficking victims. To address this deficiency, the government reported it continued to provide mandatory training to all law enforcement personnel to increase their identification and awareness of potential trafficking victims in 2009.|$|E
