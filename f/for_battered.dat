2500|$|In Australia, {{self-defence}} {{might be}} considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder {{for a woman who}} kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life. [...] But the lack of success in raising self-defence in Australia <b>for</b> <b>battered</b> women has meant that provocation has been the main focus of the courts [...] In 2005, based on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's Defences to Homicide: Final Report, the Victorian government announced changes to the homicide laws in that jurisdiction, which are intended to address this perceived imbalance. Under the new laws, victims of family violence will be able to put evidence of their abuse before the court as part of their defence, and argue self-defence {{even in the absence of}} an immediate threat, and where the response of killing involved greater force than the threatened harm.|$|E

5000|$|The pitches which Reyes {{regularly}} throws are {{a fastball}} which regularly reaches 100 mph, a power curveball, and a changeup. Noted to have prodigious lateral and horizontal movement, the fastball typically ranges from 94 mph to 97 mph, making {{it very difficult}} <b>for</b> <b>batters</b> to hit solidly. It is most effective high in the strike zone. The curveball {{has been called a}} [...] "wipeout" [...] pitch with a vertical falling pattern following the points from [...] "12-to-6" [...] on the clock, making it equally difficult <b>for</b> <b>batters</b> to hit well. The combination of both the fastball and curveball contributes to the significantly-above normal strikeout rates. Reyes typically throws both pitches for strikes, although his command of the fastball was below average. The changeup will need increased refinement. His walk rate is higher than normal, but he gave up just one total home run in 2015. In 2016, Baseball Prospectus pronounced that Reyes [...] "has one of the highest ceilings of any current pitching prospect." ...|$|R
