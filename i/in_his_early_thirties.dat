25|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> <b>thirties,</b> Ginzberg {{returned}} to Odessa {{where he was}} influenced by Leon Pinsker, {{a leader of the}} Hovevei Zion (Lovers of Zion) movement whose goal was settlement of Jews in Palestine. Unlike Pinsker, Ginsberg did not believe in political Zionism, which he fought, 'with a vehemence and austerity which embittered that whole period'. Instead he hailed the spiritual value of the Hebrew renaissance to counter the debilitating fragmentation (hitpardut) in the diaspora, he believed that the ingathering of Jews in Palestine was not an answer. Kibbutz galuyoth was a messianic ideal rather than a feasible contemporary project. The real answer lay in achieving a spiritual centre, or 'central domicile', within Palestine, that of Eretz Israel, which would form an exemplary model for the dispersed world of Jewry in exile to imitate; a spiritual focus for the circumferential world of the Jewish diaspora. He split from the Zionist movement after the First Zionist Congress, because he felt that Theodor Herzl's program was impractical. From 1889 to 1906, Ginzberg flourished as a preeminent intellectual in Zionist politics.|$|E

25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune {{towering over}} Triton. He {{appears to be}} a man <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> <b>thirties,</b> with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

25|$|Only <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> <b>thirties,</b> Captain Schofield {{is renowned}} for his level-headed {{demeanor}} and reflexes that afford him {{the ability to}} come out of devastating conflict alive. His callsign comes from two vertical scars that run from his eyebrows to his cheeks, over his eyes, wounds he sustained while he was a Harrier pilot for the Marine Corps in Serbia. Although his rank is well below many others in the story, he frequently takes command of the entire United States military; the President personally agreeing to this due to Schofield having saved his life the preceding year. Often resorting to very dangerous strategies to win a battle, it has become the norm for any attempt on his life to end with him escaping while the surrounding environment is more or less demolished. He commands a recon unit of Marines called to aid the Russian government - a trap designed to lead to his death. Upon discovering M-12's plot to change world order, he embarks upon a campaign to ruin the Chameleon and Kormoran projects. He is the protagonist in four Matthew Reilly novels and a novella, Scarecrow being the third novel.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston University. Luzzasco Luzzaschi {{belongs to}} {{that group of}} late sixteenth century Italian composers {{concerning}} whom we know practically nothing. 	Investigation {{seems to indicate that}} he was born c. 1545 and that he studied with Rore in Ferrara. By 1571 or earlier, Luzzaschi was organist to Duke Alfonso II, a position he held until the Duke's death in 1597. Active as a composer, organist, and teacher at one of the most cultivated courts in Italy, Luzzaschi's name is most frequently associated with the "Concerto della Dame," that group or lady singers at the Ferrara court whose fame was spread by the chronicles of the period and for whom Luzzaschi wrote his often mentioned volume, the Madrigali [...] . per cantare et sonare. Upon the death of his patron and the dissolution of the court at Ferrara, little information regarding the composer is available. Evidence is ample that he was the teacher of Frescobaldi, and it is likely that his life came to a close in Ferrara c. 1607. 	Luzzaschi's five-part madrigals, to which this study is limited, are contained for the most part <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seven madrigal books published between the years 1571 and 1604. Of the Primo libro, Sesto libro (long considered totally lost), and Settimo libro, no complete copy is extant. However, a posthumous volume entitled Seconda Scelta [...] . reprints some madrigals from Luzzaschi's last three madrigal publications, that is from the Fifth through the Seventh books. Thus this collection is extremely valuable, for it contains our only known source for Luzzaschi madrigals from his Sixth and Seventh books. (Unfortunately, no evidence to date has uncovered any complete madrigals from the First book.) A few madrigals not contained in any of the seven books were published in various anthologies of the period, and a complete source list of all known Luzzaschi madrigals together with other bibliographical information is contained in Appendix I. In all, Luzzaschi's total output of five-part madrigals numbers at least 186. 	Beginning with the Secondo libro, the largest of the complete madrigal books and written when the composer was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> very <b>early</b> <b>thirties,</b> the reader is immediately confronted with a volume noted for its balance and clarity and one revealing an understanding of the common practice type of madrigal characteristic of the period. The usual madrigalisms on textually important words are to be found together with other melodic and harmonic peculiarities that go into the making of a personal and individual style. 	Probably the most significant aspect of Luzzaschi's madrigal writing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> use of what this writer has termed "melodic interchange of parts," that is the substitution of melodic material among the voices which results in effect in a kind of Stimmtausch. This device is not limited to Luzzaschi's early writing but is employed throughout all of his madrigal volumes. 	One does not find in Luzzaschi's madrigals indications pointing to a departure from tradition. Individual madrigals such as his tortuous setting of Dante's Quivi sospiri may stand out and focus attention upon themselves, but on the whole, these represent isolated examples of departure from the norm. Luzzaschi is a stable madrigalist, perhaps even retrospective in outlook and method, and one will have to look well among his works to find signs of a Wert, a Marenzio, or a Monteverdi...|$|R

25|$|The tale told in Sverre's saga is the {{official}} version. Historians have questioned the veracity of it, {{especially with regard to}} Sverre's alleged paternity. Some historians have considered his claim to be King Sigurd's son to be false, as did many of his contemporaries. Others have believed the paternal claim to be true, while most historians have found that the paternal question can not be given a definite answer. Although the fact that kings fathered illegitimate sons was taken for granted, other facts indicate that Sverre was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>early</b> <b>thirties</b> when he came to Norway, such as the age of his own sons and nephews. It has been cited against Sverre's claim that according to Canon law, one had to be at least 30 years old to be eligible for the priesthood. If Sverre was 30 years old when he became a priest, this would place his birth no later than 1145, making his paternal claim impossible, as Sigurd Munn was born in 1133. This particular objection has lost credence as it has become clear that this age limit was routinely ignored in Scandinavia at the time. However, other objections remain, such as the fact that Sverre consistently refused to undergo an ordeal by fire to prove his claims. At the time, such a trial was routine for new claimants to the throne, and belief in its efficacy seems to have been universal; yet Sverre refused to undergo it. If Sverre's claim was false, however, he would lack royal legitimacy, dooming his plans to failure. Regardless, his motivation is clear: to capture the throne of Norway, whether he could prove royal blood or not. After all, Norway had seen other claimants, since Harald Gille, whose paternity was equally questionable.|$|E
