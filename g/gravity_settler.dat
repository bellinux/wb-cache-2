40|$|This study {{developed}} an integrated bioprocess comprising a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> for precipitative removal of Fe(III) from hydrometallurgical processing at ambient temperature. CSTR was fed with the raffinate solution (pH 1. 4) from Zijinshan copper heap bioleaching plant containing nutrients and trace elements. In the CSTR, Fe(II) was biologically oxidized and pH {{was controlled by}} using KOH and CaCO 3. The solution redox potential and pH was maintained at 580 - 600 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) and 2. 5 - 3. 0, respectively. The oxidation rate of Fe(II) was 1. 0 g/L. h. The sludge in the <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> was recycled to CSTR as jarosite seeds and carrier material for microbial cells. Iron and sulfate removal efficiencies were 52 and 21 %, and 86 and 32 % at pH 2. 6 and 3. 0, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{theoretical}} model of foam as a consolidating continuum is proposed. The general model {{is applied to}} foam in a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler.</b> It is predicted that liquid drainage from foam in a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> begins with a slow drainage stage. Next, a stage with faster drainage occurs where the drainage rate doubles compared to the initial stage. The experiments conducted {{within the framework of}} this work confirmed the theoretical predictions and allowed measurements of foam characteristics. Foams of three different concentrations of Pantene Pro-V Classic Care Solutions shampoo were studied, as well as the addition of polyethylene oxide (PEO) in one case. The shampoo’s main foaming components are sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate. It is shown to what extent foam drainage is slowed down by using higher shampoo concentrations and how it is further decreased by adding polymer (PEO). 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{all facets of}} an efficient, compact and environmentally acceptable crude oil dehydration operation based on three different equipments. The equipments considered {{for the purpose of}} this research are a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> (liquid-liquid) separator, heater-treater system and electrostatic coalescer. Case studies present the effect of crude oil properties and operating conditions on the right decision of equipment selection. The selection is based on mathematical equations that characterize the choices of the separation system through the determination of the required size and expected efficiency. The results of this study showed that the <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> is most suitable for dehydration of light density (less than 850 kg/m 3) and low water-cut (less than 40 %) crudes. The heater-treater system is found to be most suitable when dehydration of viscous and high water cut crudes is considered. Furthermore the study concludes that the electrostatic coalescer is most suitably used for dehydration of crude oil with water cut 20 % or less, as expected, because short circuiting occurs above this limit; In the cases where crude water cut is less than 20 %, the electrostatic coalescer showed the highest expected efficiency with the lowest equipment size requirements...|$|E

Some designs have a short conical section at the feed end for prethickening within the unit, but generally it is preferable to thicken before entering the centrifuge with <b>gravity</b> <b>settlers,</b> hydrocyclones or inclined screens, producing a higher concentration of solids.|$|R
40|$|The {{basis for}} design and {{scale-up}} of mixer-settlers for the Dapex {{solvent extraction process}} was determined by a unit operaiions study in scale model units. Rate constants for uranium extraction involving stage efficiency, phase ratio, and residence time are directly propcrtional to the cube root of power input in the mixer. Typical mixing requirements for 90 % stage efficiency are 30 hp/ 1000 gal and 2 min residence for extraction and 0. 7 hp/ 1000 gal and 1. 5 min for stripping. The scale-up of geometrically similar mixers is based on constant specific pcwer input. The flow capacity of gravity settlors is limited by a dispersion band, which increases exponentially with flow rate. The scale-up of settlers is based on constant flow rate of dispersed min for stripping. The scale-up of geometrically similar mixers is based on constant specific pcwer input. The fiow capacity of <b>gravity</b> <b>settlers</b> is limited by a dispersion band, which increases exponentially with flow rate. The scale-up of settlers is based on constant flow rate of dispersed phase per unit settler area and constant band thickness. The nominal flow capacity (50 % of flooding) of the dispersed phase is approximately I gpm/-sq ft of settler area. Emulsions and solvent entrainment are minimized by control of mixing to form solvent-continuous dispersions. Operating data from two uranium mills confirm the scale-up relations over a range of flow rates of 200 -fold for mixers and 1000 -fold for settlers. (auth...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} a novel technology for biological hydrogen production from glucose and corn-syrup with the performance of the conventional continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). The novel technology, termed biohydrogenator (patent-pending), comprises CSTR with <b>gravity</b> <b>settlers</b> to decouple hydraulic retention time (HRT) from solids retention time (SRT). Two biohydrogenators and two CSTR systems were operated at organic loading rates of 6. 5 - 42. 8 gCOD/L/d, and HRTs of 8 - 12 hours. The SRT was maintained at 2 days in the two biohydrogenators. The decoupling of SRT from HRT not only increased glucose conversion to volatile fatty acids and hydrogen from 29 - 50 % in the CSTR to 99. 9 % in the biohydrogenators, but also the volumetric hydrogen production from 0. 55 - 1. 8 in the CSTRs to 2. 4 - 9. 6 L/L/d. Hydrogen yield increased from 0. 5 - 1. 0 mol H 2 /mol glucose converted in the CSTR to 2. 8 mol H 2 /mol glucose converted in the biohydrogenators. DGGE analysis confirmed the specificity of the microbial culture in the biohydrogenators with the high hydrogen producing Clostridium species, as compared to the more diverse cultures in the CSTR. The biohydrogenator was then tested on a corn-syrup waste generated as a by-product from an industrial facility for bioethanol production located in South Western Ontario, Canada. Glucose was the main constituent in the corn-syrup; its concentration was varied over a period of 90 days from 8 to 25 g/L. The change in glucose concentration was used to study the impact of variable organic loading on the stability of hydrogen production in the biohydrogenator. Hydrogen production rate increased from 10 L H 2 /L /d to 34 L H 2 /L /d with the increase of organic loading rate (OLR) from 26 to 81 gCOD/L/d, while a maximum hydrogen yield of 430 L H 2 / kgCOD was observed...|$|R
40|$|The patent-pending {{integrated}} waste-to-energy system comprises both a novel biohydrogen reactor with a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> (Biohydrogenator), {{followed by}} a second stage conventional anaerobic digester {{for the production of}} methane gas. This chemical-free process has been tested with a synthetic wastewater/leachate solution, and was operated at 37 o C for 45 days. The biohydrogenator (system (A), stage 1) steadily produced hydrogen with no methane during the experimental period. The maximum hydrogen yield was 400 ml H 2 / g glucose with an average of 345 ml H 2 / g glucose, as compared to 141 and 118 ml H 2 / g glucose for two consecutive runs done in parallel using a conventional continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR, System (B)). Decoupling of the SRT from the HRT using the <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> showed a marked improvement in performance, with the maximum and average hydrogen production rates in system (A) of 22 and 19 L H 2 /d, as compared with 2 - 7 L H 2 /d in the CSTR resulting in a maximum yield of 2. 8 mol H 2 /mol glucose much higher than the 1. 1 - 1. 3 mol H 2 /mol glucose observed in the CSTR. Furthermore, while the CSTR collapsed in 10 - 15 days due to biomass washout, the biohydrogenator continued stable operation for the 45 days reported here and beyond. The methane yield for the second stage in system (A) approached a maximum value of 426 ml CH 4 / gCOD removed, while an overall chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of 94 % was achieved in system (A) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies how {{to improve}} the {{efficiency}} of a new system for catchment, pretreatment, and treatment of runoff water (SCPT). This system is integrated into an urban sustainable <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> that can decrease diffusive pollution. This study provides important advantages for the ecosystem by improving new sustainable drainage to clean runoff water. In this paper, an investigation methodology known as hybrid engineering (HE) was used. HE combines experimental tests and numerical simulations, both of them conducted on a 1 : 4 -scale prototype. In this study, numerical simulations by the finite-volume method (FVM) and experimental tests by particle image velocimetry (PIV) were compared. A strong correlation between the numerical and experimental analysis was found. Next, {{the efficiency of the}} SCPTwas optimized by design of experiments (DOE).

40|$|The {{suspensions}} in {{the treatment}} of water, domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater can be separated into clarified fluid and solid matter by gravity settlers. Inclined plate settler (IPS) is a type of <b>gravity</b> <b>settler.</b> Its performance strongly depends on the inlet zone configuration. Three different inlet structures were used to develop a model that can describe the effect of the inlet configuration on the hydraulic characteristics of lab-scale IPS numerically and validate it experimentally. The results show that feeding the IPS by a nozzle distributor can enhance the hydraulic performance of the IPS. Based on the previous results, the response surface methodology (RSM) combined with numerical simulation was used to optimise this distributor. The optimisation of nozzle has improved the hydraulic performance, flow distribution between the settlers and the separation efficiency of the IPS. Finally, a sediment gutter on the plates with an inclination angle to collect the sediment and disposes it via a lateral outlets is suggested to improve the separation efficiency...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{cost and}} {{effectiveness}} of three solids thickening processes, i. e., <b>gravity</b> thickening <b>settlers</b> (GTS), inclined belt filters (IBF), geotextile bag filters (GBF), were individually evaluated with the biosolids backwash produced in intensive aquaculture systems equipped with microscreen drum filters and radial-flow settlers. The IBF produced the cleanest discharge and highest treatment efficiencies, likely reflecting the rapid efficiency with which solids are separated from wastewater. The GBF was the least effective process, i. e., GBF leachate contained the highest concentrations of TP, TN, and cBOD. However, GBF was most effective for sludge volume reduction. Capital cost estimates for an IBF were {{more than twice that}} of GTS and GBF of similar treatment capacity. The GTS had the lowest capital and annual operating cost estimates. The estimated annual operating cost of the GBF was orders of magnitude higher than the IBF and GTS, due to the high cost to replace bags...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from batch to continuous processing in fine-chemicals industries offers many advantages; {{among these are}} a high volumetric productivity, improved control over reaction conditions resulting in a higher yield and selectivity, a small footprint and a safer process due to a smaller reaction volume. Pilot studies of continuous micro structured reactors in a production environment have been presented {{over the last few}} years by chemicals producers collaborating with equipment developers. It makes, however, little sense to shift only the reactor to continuous operation and not the work-up because this would result in accumulating reaction intermediates and products in storage vessels. The next logical step is the introduction of continuous micro structured separation equipment that has a similar performance with respect to separation efficiency as continuous reactors regarding productivity. Consequently for multistep chemical synthesis a toolbox of separations has to be developed based on the classical operations of evaporation, extraction and crystallization. Potential benefits versus conventionally applied stirred tank vessels include: a small footprint because of high productivity, less product degradation volume and increased safety due to a small because of the lower volume (for example less solvent) and the potential to reduce the number of down stream processing steps. Issues for the development of these separations are multipurpose applicability and scalability by modular design. Membrane contactors are potentially beneficial for small scale separations in fine-chemical applications. Potential benefits of pertraction are: a stable interface and therefore less foam / froth problems, less solvent use because of a asymmetric volume ratio up to 100 : 1 (for process stream: solvent stream), it allows for streams with small density difference because no <b>gravity</b> based <b>settler</b> is required, a small footprint due to a high specific surface area, flexible with respect to scale-up because a modular construction is possible, multi-applicable by choice of solvent, no moving parts resulting in low maintenance cost and finally proven technology in water applications. Issues that have to be addressed before pertraction can be applied in the core of fine-chemical processes are the use of chemically resistant materials and scale-up at low cost to sufficient large modules. To initiate the development of a pertraction module for fine-chemical processes three showcases for potential chemical applications were demonstrated experimentally. The first application was a solvent switch of a compound from one solvent into another. The second application was an aqueous work-up of a solvent reaction mixture, aiming for removal of spent acids or bases. The aqueous work-up can be carried out without the formation of an emulsion and potentially with a smaller volume of washing water. The third application was the dehydration of a reaction mixture, with the objective of removing both dissolved and dispersed water. In the latter case the test system was an esterification reaction between hexanol and hexanoic acid with lipase as catalyst. For all cases the mass transfer coefficient was determined in order to calculate the surface area of membrane required for a small scale industrial pertraction module. Finally, module design and construction aspects (a. o. stacking) will be considered...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of acidic {{solution}} containing 5 g/L of Fe(II) and 10 mg/L of As(III) was studied {{in a system}} consisting of a biological fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) for iron oxidation, and a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> for iron precipitation and separation of the ferric precipitates. At pH 3. 0 and FBR retention time of 5. 7 h, 96 – 98 % of the added Fe(II) precipitated (99. 1 % of which was jarosite). The highest iron oxidation and precipitation rates were 1070 and 28 mg/L/h, respectively, and were achieved at pH 3. 0. Subsequently, the effect of pH on arsenic removal through sorption and/or co-precipitation was examined by gradually decreasing solution pH from 3. 0 to 1. 6 (feed pH). At pH 3. 0, 2. 4 and 1. 6, the highest arsenic removal efficiencies obtained were 99. 5 %, 80. 1 % and 7. 1 %, respectively. As the system had ferric precipitates in excess, decreased arsenic removal was likely due to reduced co-precipitation at pH < 2. 4. As(III) was partially oxidized to As(V) in the system. In shake flask experiments, As(V) sorbed onto jarosite better than As(III). Moreover, the sorption capacity of biogenic jarosite {{was significantly higher than}} that of synthetic jarosite. The developed bioprocess simultaneously and efficiently removes iron and arsenic from acidic solutions, indicating potential for mining wastewater treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} patent-pending system comprises a novel biohydrogen reactor with a <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> for decoupling of SRT from HRT. The biohydrogenator was operated for 100 days at 37 °C, hydraulic {{retention time}} 8 h and {{solids retention time}} ranging from 2. 2 – 2. 5 days. The feed was a corn-syrup waste generated as a byproduct from an industrial facility for bioethanol production located in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The system was initially started up with a synthetic feed containing glucose at concentration of 8 g/L and other essential inorganics. Anaerobicaly-digested sludge from the St. Mary’s wastewater treatment plant (St. Mary, Ontario, Canada) {{was used as the}} seed, and was heat treated at 70 °C for 30 min to inhibit methanogens. After 10 days, when the hydrogen production was steady, the corn-syrup waste was introduced to the system. Glucose was the main constituent in the corn-syrup; its concentration was varied over a period of 90 days from 8 to 25 g/L. The change in glucose concentration was used to study the impact of variable organic loading on the stability of hydrogen production in the biohydrogenator. Hydrogen production rate increased from 10 L H 2 /L·d to 34 L H 2 /L·d with the increase of organic loading rate (OLR) from 26 to 81 gCOD/L·d, while a maximum hydrogen yield of 430 mL H 2 /gCOD was achieved in the system with an overall average of 385 mL H 2 /gCOD...|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulating}} {{the separation of}} an emulsion in a batch <b>gravity</b> <b>settler</b> was tested. This model {{is based on a}} population balance which considers a non-uniform droplet distribution, where coalescence occurs simultaneously as the film drains during the time of contact. This model also incorporates the physical properties of the bulk fluids, liquid-liquid interface, the effects of surface properties and the squeezing forces subjected on the droplets. The population balance predicts the dynamic and spatial evolution of the dropsize distribution across the entire batch separator. The model was used to fit data for local fractions from experimental data in order to compare the model results with actual experimental results. The prediction of the dynamic and spatial evolution of the drop size distribution allows one to calculate the backflow of the continuous phase and drop growth rate (the first moment of the volume weighted coalescence birth function). These two calculated values allow one to make a semi-quantitative description of the individual sedimentation and binary coalescence rates, based on the types and concentration/composition of demulsifiers or mixtures of demulsifiers used for separation. The experiment consisted of an water in crude oil emulsion with added demulsifier. Five experiments were tested, with varying ratios of the two different demulsifiers, Demulsifier 1 and Demulsifier 2. The results for the different demulsifiers demonstrated that pure Demulsifier 2 provided the fastest separation of this water in oil emulsion, this was due to the large initial droplet size in this mix. However, the blend with 50 % Demulsifier 1 and 50 % Demulsifier 2 had the largest maximum continuous phase velocity (Uf,max) and maximum drop growth rate (Rg,max), which resulted in a fast separation, 25 min for complete separation as opposed to 16 min for the pure chemical Demulsifier 2. The large value of Uf,max indicate fast sedimentation and Rg,max indicate fast binary coalescence, however the large initial droplet size for the pure Demulsifier 2 provided the fastest separation. This separation model could then be used to develop chemical destabilization strategies to knock out a significant fraction of the emulsified water and reduce process volumes and energy consumption, which could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve process economy...|$|E
