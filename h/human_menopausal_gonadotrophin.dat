The mean number of oocytes recovered was significantly higher with buserelin (9 · 5 (SD 4 · 5) v 5 · 5 (2 · 2)) as was the mean number of embryos obtained (4 · 3 (2 · 4) v 2 · 9 (1 · 7)). Significantly more women who had an embryo transfer became clinically pregnant after treatment with buserelin (53 % (30 / 57) v 30 % (48 / 159), or 36 % v 14 % of treatment cycles). Altogether 33 % (10) of pregnancies in women treated with buserelin were multiple compared with 23 % (11) in those treated conventionally.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> and {{recombinant}} <b>human</b> {{follicle stimulating hormone}} are the {{two main}} gonadotrophin products utilized for controlled ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technologies. In this meta-analysis, the number of oocytes was designated as the most relevant endpoint directly resulting from ovarian stimulation, and therefore where the drug effect may be estimated with the best sensitivity. Methods All published randomized controlled trials on ovarian stimulation comparing the two gonadotrophin products were evaluated. Internal validity was determined using Chalmers' validated scale. If trials {{did not meet the}} established quality criteria, a sensitivity analysis assessed the stability of the results. The comparison of continuous variables was conducted following the weighted mean difference and the standardized mean difference (Cohen's effect size) with the random model. Given the known relationship of baseline conditions on treatment endpoints, results were adjusted for age, body mass index and type of infertility. Results Sixteen studies involving 4040 patients were included. Treatment with <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> resulted in fewer oocytes (- 1. 54; 95 % CI: - 2. 53 to - 0. 56; P Conclusions Because baseline conditions are predictive of outcome, meta-analytic results are more sensitive when these variables are considered. Using an endpoint closely associated with the stimulation period, sufficient sensitivity is achieved to compare gonadotrophin treatments. As the largest meta-analysis published to date on this subject, treatment with <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> is characterized by fewer oocytes and a higher total dose.

40|$|Abstract: In {{a patient}} with primary infertility, {{ovulation}} was induced by monitored stimulation with <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> (HMG) because of polycystic ovarian disease. Infertility work-up had shown a unicornuate uterus with a cavitary communicating rudimentary horn. The husband showed a varicocele-related moderate oligoasthenoterato-zoospermia. A triplet pregnancy occurred in a third HMG ovulation induction cycle combined with intra-uterine insemination of the husband's washed semen. The pregnancy was carefully monitored, and measures to prevent premature delivery were taken. Because of the patient's obvious discomfort {{in the presence of}} premature labour, Caesarean section was performed at 33 weeks gestation and three healthy infants were delivered. This is the first report of a successful triplet pregnancy in a women with a unicornuate uterus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} support with human chorionic gonadotrophin in the luteal phase in women taking part in an in vitro fertilisation programme after buserelin and <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> were used to hyperstimulate their ovaries. DESIGN [...] Controlled group comparison. SETTING [...] Outpatient department of a private hospital. PATIENTS [...] 115 Women with indications for in vitro fertilisation, {{all of whom had}} at least one embryo transferred. INTERVENTIONS [...] After suppression of the pituitary with buserelin the ovaries of all the women were stimulated with <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> on day 4 of the luteal phase. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (10, 000 IU) was given to induce ovulation, and oocytes were recovered 34 hours later. Embryos were transferred 46 to 48 hours after insemination. Women who had received the 10, 000 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin on a date that was an uneven number (n = 61) were allocated to receive support doses of 2500 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin three and six days after that date. The remaining 54 women did not receive hormonal support. END POINT [...] Determination of the rates of pregnancy. MEASUREMENTS and main results [...] Support with human chorionic gonadotrophin did not significantly alter the progesterone or oestradiol concentrations in the early or mid-luteal phase. The mean (range) progesterone concentrations in the late luteal phase in women who did not become pregnant were, however, significantly higher in those who received support (16 (9 - 110) nmol/l nu 8 (4 - 46) nmol/l), and the luteal phase was significantly longer in this group (14 days nu 12 days). The rate of pregnancy was significantly higher in the women who received support than in those who did not (25 / 61 nu 8 / 54). CONCLUSIONS [...] When buserelin and <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> are used to hyperstimulate ovaries support with human chorionic gonadotrophin in the luteal phase has a beneficial effect on in vitro fertilisation...|$|E

For example, the so-called menotropins (also called <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropins) consist of LH and FSH {{extracted from the}} urine of menopausal women. There are also recombinant variants. Besides the aforementioned legitimate pharmaceutical drugs, there are fad diet or quack preparations, which are illegal in various countries.|$|R
40|$|Anovulation is {{a common}} cause of female infertility. Treatment for women with {{anovulation}} is aimed at induction of ovulation. Ovulation induction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is indicated in women with WHO type II anovulation in whom treatment with clomifene citrate (clomifene) has failed. The majority of these women have polycystic ovary syndrome. The major disadvantages of ovulation induction with FSH are the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome {{and the risk of}} higher order multiple pregnancies. To reduce the rate of complications due to multiple follicular development, FSH should be administered using a chronic low-dose protocol with small dose increments. In women with WHO type I anovulation, an exogenous supply of luteinizing hormone (LH) is required to achieve an adequate follicular response to FSH treatment. Thus, ovulation induction with FSH is not the treatment of choice in these women. FSH is a hormone that stimulates follicle growth and oocyte maturation. Endogenous FSH is produced by the pituitary gland and exists as a family of isohormones exhibiting distinct oligosaccharide structures. FSH for exogenous administration is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. The commercially available FSH products all contain different mixtures of FSH isoforms. To determine the effectiveness of urofollitropin (urinary-derived FSH), a comparison with the other available gonadotropins was made (i. e. recombinant FSH and <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin). Urofollitropin and recombinant FSH appear to be equally effective and well tolerated for ovulation induction. <b>Human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropin is comparably effective to urofollitropin in terms of pregnancy outcomes. It remains unclear whether <b>human</b> <b>menopausal</b> gonadotropins have a higher risk of overstimulation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome compared to urofollitropin in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. In practice, recombinant products are more convenient to use but are also more expensive. Therefore, if availability is not an issue but costs are, there is still a place for the use of urofollitropins for ovulation inductio...|$|R
