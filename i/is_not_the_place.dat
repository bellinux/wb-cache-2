If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E

An opponent of the Iraq War and potential war with Iran, he has also criticized neoconservatism and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, arguing that both inadvertently cause terrorist reprisals against Americans, such as the 9/11 attacks.

[...] The notables replied in the affirmative, but asserted that their men were already trained in the art of war and like the generations before them, they would [...] "willingly shed blood" [...] for the [...] "fatherland" [...] and [...] "defend their country" [...] from [...] "the enemies of our religion". Ibrahim Pasha countered that their fighters would need to be professionally trained, telling them [...] "War <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> for a herd of useless men".|$|E

2500|$|In 1934, Shach was {{appointed}} rosh yeshiva of the Novardok yeshiva. This came {{about as a}} result of the recommendation of Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (known as the Chazon Ish) to one of the yeshiva's founders, Rabbi Bentzion Brook. During this time in Shach's life, the rest of his family stayed in Kletsk, while he stayed in the Novardok yeshiva for extended periods of time. After approximately two years, Shach left the yeshiva, because, in his own words, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> for me for many reasons". In 1935, Shach became rosh yeshiva at the Hasidic Karlin yeshiva in Luninets. He also functioned as the mashgiach ruchani of the yeshiva, giving customary mussar sermons to the yeshiva students. Shach remained at the yeshiva until the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its early}} days, this notion was greatly {{influenced}} {{the philosophy of}} German idealism, from which its founders drew much inspiration: belief in humanity marching toward {{a full understanding of}} itself and the divine, manifested in moral progress towards perfection. This highly rationalistic view virtually identified human reason and intellect with divine action, leaving little room for direct influence by God. Geiger conceived revelation as occurring via the inherent [...] "genius" [...] of the People Israel, and his close ally Solomon Formstecher described it as the awakening of oneself into full consciousness of one's religious understanding. The American theologian Kaufmann Kohler also spoke of the [...] "special insight" [...] of Israel, almost fully independent from direct divine participation, and English thinker Claude Montefiore, founder of Liberal Judaism, reduced revelation to [...] "inspiration", according intrinsic value only to the worth of its content while [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where they are found that makes them inspired." [...] Common to all these notions was the assertion that present generations have a higher and better understanding of divine will, and they can and should unwaveringly change and refashion religious precepts.|$|E
2500|$|This {{preference}} for book learning {{and lack of}} intense involvement {{in the world around}} him were detrimental to Mackintosh's later career, even though he drifted back to a more liberal political stance. Hazlitt, who heard him speak in Parliament, observes that, just as his previous appointment as a judge in India was unsuited to a man who worked out his thought in terms of [...] "school-exercises", Mackintosh's mind did not fit well the defender of political causes, which needed more passionate engagement. [...] "Sir James is by education and habit and ... by the original turn of his mind, a college-man [...] in public speaking the logician takes place of the orator". Hazlitt recalls having heard him speak publicly in the House of Commons [...] "seldom ... without pain for the event." [...] The House <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> to speak only the truth. Too much [...] "interest" [...] rather than pure [...] "love of truth" [...] enters into the decisions made in Parliament. And [...] "the judgment of the House is not a balance to weigh scruples and reasons to the turn of a fraction. ... Sir James, in detailing the inexhaustible stores of his memory and reading, in unfolding the wide range of his theory and practice, in laying down the rules and the exceptions, in insisting upon the advantages and the objections with equal explicitness, would be sure to let something drop that a dexterous and watchful adversary would easily pick up and turn against him...." ...|$|E

[...] When Augustine asked whether to use Roman or Gallican customs in the mass in England, Gregory said, in paraphrase, that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> that {{imparted}} goodness but good things that graced <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> and it was more important to be pleasing to the Almighty.

2500|$|On October 2, the PKI {{newspaper}} Harian Rakjat {{published an}} editorial {{that would eventually}} be used {{as evidence that the}} Communists had organized the coup attempt by Untung and his group. Anderson and McVey noted that the Harian Rakjat [...] "prided itself on well written and cogently argued editorials", but the editorial in question [...] "is no gem of style or clarity". They believed that the [...] "foolish hesitant editorial" [...] provided the Army an opportunity to place the blame of the coup on the PKI. Since the coup, Anderson and McVey noted that the Army's success in blaming the PKI was [...] "both because of actual PKI involvement, however confused, and because all groups now in power wish to believe it, since for years they lived in growing fear of a possible PKI takeover". To conclude their observations of the events of and following the coup, Anderson and McVey asserted, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> here to go into the details of the anti-Communist campaign which developed {{in the wake of the}} Army coup of October 1." [...] However, they believed that the coup itself and subsequent events formed [...] "quite separate political phenomena" [...] despite being [...] "intimately related". Anderson and McVey believed this to be the case because of a three-week absence of violence that ended on October 21, when Communist youth elements clashed with the Army Para-Commando Regiment ( [...] , abbreviated as RPKAD) in Boyolali Regency.|$|E

50|$|David O. McKay, a Republican {{who became}} {{president}} of the church in 1951, was able to establish friendly relationships with President Dwight D. Eisenhower. McKay supported church apostle Ezra Taft Benson in his role as Eisenhower's Secretary of Agriculture. President Lyndon B. Johnson invited McKay to visit him in the White House. (Benson was president of the church from 1985 to 1994.) McKay rarely used his position in the church to speak out on political issues. One instance in which he did was to instruct Mormon congressmen that they should support the right-to-work legislation that was before congress at the time. Some of the congressmen reacted negatively to McKay's message feeling like it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of their religious leader to tell them how to vote. McKay considered this a religious issue and not a strictly political decision and in fact apostle Joseph F. Merrill had spoken on this very issue during his address at the Church's General Conference.|$|R
