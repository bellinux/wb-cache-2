40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} the content of professional-oriented teaching of a foreign language to students of non-linguistic specialties, which is particularly relevant from the viewpoint of the increasing role of foreign language communication in the professional activity of modern professionals. The purpose of foreign language teaching in non-linguistics universities is to achieve a level that is sufficient for practical use of a foreign language in future career. Thus, if foreign language at linguistic university is a special base, at non-linguistic universities it is an application to <b>general</b> <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> base and skills, so at non-linguistic universities the statement of ultimate goal requires specification. Thus, it is sufficient to consider the contents of foreign language teaching at non-linguistic faculties as the totality of what students should learn in the education process, the quality and level of foreign language should correlate with their needs and goals, as well as the goals and objectives of this level of training. Selection of the content is intended to promote the broad development of the student’s personality, its preparation for future careers...|$|E
40|$|As a teacher, {{you will}} be {{expected}} to assess pupils’ work and feed back the results of this assessment to help them to develop. You will also need to use assessment to feed forward into your planning. This is a skill that has to be learned. Teachers tend to be rated highly on <b>general</b> <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and planning but they do not always make effective use of assessment (Ofsted Annual Reports, cited in Stanley 2007). For teacher trainees, it is perhaps understandable that specific provision for assessment may be left out initially as concerns about presentation of subject content and classroom management can be more pressing. But to become a good teacher you will {{need to be aware of}} the importance of assessment for public accountability and will need to understand how assessment can significantly improve teaching and learning. You will assess pupils both during and after learning. These assessments are usually called assessment for learning (AfL) or formative assessment, and assessment of learning (AoL) or summative assessment. However: Assessments in themselves are not inherently formative or summative – it is the process and how the information is used that is important. (DfES 2004 : 17...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the subsequent stages of Aleksander Ostrowski’s education; it shows his successes at school, and also {{points at the}} direct link between the economic achievements of the Ostrowskis’ domain {{and the level of}} the owners’ education. The <b>general</b> and <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> acquired at school and the level of culture and civil awareness provided resulted in the formation of high educational ambitions also in the next generation: the atmosphere of the family home and the pedagogical attitude of Aleksander and Helena Ostrowski influenced the fact that their children were also well educated; therefore, they could continue the family traditions, develop their farm, and participate in political life. The example of the Ostrowski family from Maluszyn can serve as an argument justifying the statement that a high level of education should be treated as a main factor in forming certain types of world views, social and political beliefs, and the level of interest and participation in culture. It should also be treated as a factor determining openness towards innovations and progress in both the organisation of social life and the economy...|$|R

Continuing education must be seen as a crucial principle of constructing a new model of education with integrity as a factor, regulating the activities of various educational institutions: main and complementary; basic and optional; state and public; formal and informal.

40|$|Chairperson: Fien Depaepe, KU Leuven, Belgium Organisers: Annette Tettenborn, Institut fur padagogische Professionalitat und Schulkultur, Switzerland & Henrik Saalbach, University of Leipzig, Germany Discussant: Robin Stark, Saarland University, GermanyThe {{relevance}} of teachers' competencies {{for research on}} learning and instruction is twofold: First, teachers' Teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and instructional strategies affect whether and how students acquire knowledge. Second, teachers themselves often carry misconceptions about specific contents, the nature of learning, or effective instructions. Therefore, research aiming at defining, investigating and developing teachers' <b>professional</b> competencies, in <b>general,</b> and <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> in particular, is a promising path {{in order to enhance}} instruction and learning. Teachers' <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is commonly conceptualized by three core dimensions: content knowledge (CK), pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and generic pedagogical knowledge. The papers of this symposium target different dimensions of teachers' <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and their change through professional teacher education and development. The first study examines the effect of an innovative research-based training on improving pre-service elementary school teachers' CK and PCK with respect to teaching rational numbers. The second paper investigates whether kindergarten teachers' construal of (science) learning as conceptual change is related to specific scaffolding activities, and whether a shift in their beliefs induced by a professional development program is reflected by a change in their scaffolding activities. The third study analyzes teachers' occupational coping patterns depending on their contextual features and their relation to pedagogical content beliefs. The final paper of the symposium reports about a study on the development of generic pedagogical knowledge of pre- service science and mathematics teachers. Here, the researchers examine the assumption that the coherence in teachers' knowledge is a function of explicit learning opportunities. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{analytical}} framework for studying professional discretion in organisations that provide state-sponsored human services. In <b>general,</b> <b>professional</b> rationality makes claims for {{more or less}} autonomous professional discretion shaped by <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and ethics, and by the licence given to each profession by the state. The scope of this discretion clearly reflects each profession's power. This paper argues that the discretion of professionals working in formal organisations is further constrained and shaped by rationalities arising through the power relations in that organisational context. In particular, the discretion available within any organisation will tend to be shaped by organisational requirements. These include political, resourcing and accountability requirements, but they also include more structural matters, in particular managing or mitigating conflicts and contradictions that come from the mode of organisation...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{facet of}} professional competence is the <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{acquired by the}} trainees. It {{is defined as the}} knowledge that people need to practice their profession, for example, to solve complex problems at workplace (Kirschner 2013; Riedl 2003). Measuring <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is considered as a suitable form of quality assessment for VET programs (Gschwendtner 2011; Nickolaus et al. 2012). Consequently, the first instruments for the evaluation of such programs addressed <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> e.g. for mechanical technicians (Abele et al. 2013) and for commercial business clerks (Achtenhagen and Winther 2014). However, to our knowledge, there are no validated instruments for VET programs in biology and medicine currently existing, despite the important role of laboratory assistants in hospitals, research institutes, and industries. To address this gap, we have developed a paper-and-pencil test (<b>Professional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of Laboratory Assistants or PROKLAS). We validated it in this study with N =  284 VET students, that allows for the assessment of their <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> of laboratory tasks in biochemistry and cell biology. In this paper, we use the term “laboratory assistants” for “laboratory assistants in biology and medicine”, and “laboratory tasks” for “laboratory tasks in biochemistry and cell biology”.|$|R

Drawing on empirical data collected over four years, the paper illustrates the ways in which <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>professional</b> preparation of teachers in pre-service institutions are constructed within the Kazakh and Soviet pedagogical traditions, albeit with some reference to international scholars. Teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is formed from pedagogic theory mediated by academic staff in what is seen by many from outside and inside the country who are engaged in educational ‘reform’ in Kazakhstan as a largely didactic style with little or no critical engagement or exploration of the implications for practice.

What kinds of university learning in the social sciences do students enrolled in distance education and lifelong education courses at Open Universities want?
