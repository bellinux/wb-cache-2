2500|$|Furigana fonts are {{generally}} sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either {{by adjusting the}} furigana by using a condensed font (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by <b>intercharacter</b> <b>spacing</b> (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading—for example [...] (where [...] reads , tazusa)—the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing. Three-kana readings are not uncommon, particularly due to yōon with a long vowel, such as five kana are required for [...] and six for , the longest of any character in the Joyo kanji. Very long readings also occur for certain kanji or symbols which have a gairaigo reading; the word [...] "centimeter" [...] is generally written as [...] "cm" [...] (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space) and has the seven-kana reading [...] (senchimētoru) (it can also be written as the kanji , though this is very rare); another common example is [...] "%" [...] (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading [...] (pāsento). These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated to the preceding figure).|$|E
