It demonstrates how forest-level modelling can be used to forecast criteria and indicators of timber economic benefits and how sensitive these indicators are to changes in the constraints affecting the timber harvesting land base and harvest practices. In an economic sense, forests are assets with the potential to generate wealth through a sustainable flow of benefits. Managing this asset to maximize economic returns and to minimize the risk of loss to natural disturbances are important objectives. This <b>extension</b> <b>note</b> develops these concepts and identifies indicators that can measure economic performance. A harvest simulation model is used to forecast harvest volume, growing stock, and delivered wood cost for the Sustainable Forest Management Pilot Basecase Analysis.

This early public input guided the selection of criteria and indicators for the SFM pilot basecase analysis in the Lemon Landscape Unit. Sustainable forest management must be sustainable in a social sense and should incorporate public values. This <b>extension</b> <b>note</b> describes and evaluates several methods for involving the public in forest management planning. A standard mail survey was used to gather public perception data across a large geographic area (the former Arrow Forest District and the adjacent community of Nelson). Based on a systematic analysis of stakeholders in the IFPA area, a more focussed multi-criteria analysis (MCA) process was used to investigate stakeholder priorities and preferences for forest management scenarios at the landscape unit level.

40|$|This <b>extension</b> <b>note</b> is {{the fifth}} {{in a series of}} eight that {{describes}} a set of tools and processes developed to support sustainable forest management planning and its pilot application in the Arrow Timber Supply Area (TSA). It summarizes the criterion and indicators used to set thresholds and evaluate potential impacts on biological diversity for the sustainable forest management (SFM) pilot basecase analysis for Lemon Landscape Unit. Initial thresholds were developed for some indicators, and measures for others, to assess the SFM basecase harvest scenario. Although this did not represent a comprehensive evaluation, preliminary results indicate that under the SFM basecase scenario, habitat attributes (e. g., snags) associated with late seral stands were met primarily in the non-harvested land base, and may be unsustainable for biodiversity objectives. Retention strategies in the harvested land base are therefore important, but could not be assessed for their potential contribution to late seral attributes {{because of the lack of}} available models. This <b>extension</b> <b>note</b> provides both an example of how criteria and indicators can be applied to evaluate SFM scenarios, using indicators to set targets and thresholds, and a framework for evaluation. Some indicators, based on dynamic habitat elements (e. g., snags, downed wood, and understorey vegetation), require models to project these elements across a range of stand types and stand treatments. If these models are to act as effective tools, further development and refinement is required to ensure that they are calibrated and verified with field data. Our understanding of habitat thresholds also needs improvement to better define risks and appropriate management responses...|$|E

The management of forests has broadened to include various social values and amenities that were considered during the development of criteria and indicators for the Arrow Innovative Forestry Practices Agreement. The quality-of-life criterion was assessed through indicators that addressed outdoor recreation opportuni-ties and visual quality of the managed landscape. This assessment was informed by public input from area residents and stakeholders. Measurable quality-of-life indicators allowed trade-offs with other resources in the SFM pilot basecase analysis; protection of these quality-of-life values did not overly constrain other values modelled in the project...|$|E

It describes a pilot project designed to evaluate the use of criteria and indicators in developing a sustainable forest management (SFM) basecase and to provide decision support for managers in creating SFM plans. This note outlines how indicators can be used to define management objectives, planning units, and harvesting constraints or “initial thresholds, ” and how the resulting SFM basecase was evaluated in trade-off and sensitivity analyses. The process revealed some priority issues in which management objec-tives for some indicators had significant effects on a measure for the timber criterion (harvest volume) and others had minimal effect. Although the SFM basecase was intended to emphasize non-timber criteria, it nonetheless yielded a greater short- and long-term timber supply than a scenario based on Forest Practice Code rules. This note provides an example of the first iteration of a decision-support process requiring the participation of decision makers and allowing public feedback. Initial results suggest that this decision-support approach has merit and could form an important part of an SFM framework base...|$|E
40|$|This <b>extension</b> <b>note</b> {{describes}} some of {{the effects}} of timber harvesting on the soils at the Sicamous Creek Silvicultural Systems Project study site for the 5 -year period since harvesting. The study site is located in the essf zone near Sicamous, B. C. Five harvesting treatments were applied: no harvesting, single-tree selection, 0. 1 -, 1 -, and 10 -ha clearcuts. A variety of studies investigated the effects of opening size and distance {{from the edge of the}} cut area on soil nitrogen dynamics, nutrient cycling, soil food webs, ectomycorrhizae, and fine roots. Generalizations regarding short-term effects on the belowground organisms and processes are difficult. A complete absence of sporocarp fruiting, increased rates of nitrogen mineralization and increased nutrient leaching losses were noted in the first growing season after harvest. Decreased ectomycorrhizal diversity and fine-root biomass were measured after one growing season. Shifts in community structure occurred for micro-arthropods and bacteria while no discernible impact was detected for decomposition rates and total collembola numbers. All these changes persisted for up to 5 years after treatment, although nutrient leaching peaked after 3 years. The major influence of the forest edge into the opening occurred within approximately one-half of the tree canopy height of the uncut forest. Cutting practices that create a range of opening sizes would best maintain the widest variety of soil biological diversity and functions...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the causes}} and {{implications}} of the trade-off between working and caring for young children is relevant to the policy goals of greater workforce participation, welfare burden reduction and gender equality. Essay 1 examines the longer-term employment impacts of variations in the time spent out of the workforce for partnered mothers with primary-school-commencing children. It uses Australian administrative data and exploits exogenous variations in workforce absence due to school entry age thresholds. This approach has never {{been used in the}} hysteresis literature but acts as a strong instrument for mothers who withdraw from the workforce until children begin school. We find that the initial employment gaps caused by variations in school starting age do not persist after controlling for child age, suggesting that partnered mothers are not subject to employment hysteresis. Essay 2 assesses the workforce participation costs of caring for larger families using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census data. It accounts for the selection effects arising from the characteristics of mothers who choose to have larger families with an instrumental variables approach based on the gender-match of the first two children. Mothers who progress fertility beyond the second child, compared to those who have two children {{are less likely to be}} employed. This holds even in the longer-term, once all children have reached primary school age. An <b>extension</b> <b>note</b> also suggests that this result is externally valid. Essay 3 examines the factors that are associated with a higher hazard of exit from welfare for Australian mothers after they separate. It distinguishes the type of welfare exit that is due to finding a new partner from increasing personal income while remaining single by estimating a competing risk model. Following around 78, 000 mothers and using administrative data, we find a convergence in the welfare receipt rates of well-off and poor mothers after separation, which is then slowly unwound as more advantaged mothers leave welfare at a faster rate. Different characteristics are associated with exiting welfare due to finding a new partner versus exiting welfare while remaining single...|$|E
