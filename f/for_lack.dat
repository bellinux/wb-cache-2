However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of a better alternative.

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in 2003 with the {{original}} intention of releasing the game for the PlayStation 2. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to develop a launch title for the PlayStation Portable. Due to time constraints, the Cambridge studio was given only a year to develop the game, thus they decided to remake the original MediEvil. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release, with critics mainly praising the game's humor, voice talent and graphics but was criticized <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of innovation and cumbersome camera controls.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} around Arras, the 33rd {{was moved to}} Nieuwpoort, Belgium, {{as part of the}} build-up for the planned Operation Hush, a breakthrough along the coastal front coupled with an amphibious landing behind German lines. After the operation was cancelled, the division remained at Niewpoort, where Pinney was hospitalised and temporarily relinquished command. He remained in hospital for two months, during which time he missed heavy fighting by the 33rd at the Battle of Passchendaele. After VIII Corps Commander Hunter-Weston had sacked the current divisional commander, Philip. R. Wood, <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of aggression (unjustifiably, in Simon Robbins’ view), Pinney returned to the division on 30 November, amid rumours that he had got the return posting through personal influence.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{positive}} {{reception of the}} first game, Sony Computer Entertainment commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to make a sequel to MediEvil {{before the end of}} the PlayStation's lifespan. The original concepts for MediEvil 2 went through many transformations during development before the Cambridge team finally settled on making a sequel set during the Victorian Gothic revival, largely reminiscent of its predecessor. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise including slight improvements over its predecessor such as artificial intelligence and graphical enhancements, but was criticised <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of innovation from the original.|$|E
5|$|Illinois v. Hemi Group, LLC, 622 F.3d 754 (7th Cir. 2010), was a {{personal}} jurisdiction {{case in which the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois' ruling finding personal jurisdiction based on Internet transactions. In the initial filing, the state of Illinois sued Hemi Group LLC (Hemi) for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents over the Internet in violation of state law and for failing to report those sales in violation of federal law. Hemi moved to dismiss the suit <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of personal jurisdiction, but the district court found that the Internet transactions provided a basis for Hemi to be sued in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, {{an act of}} insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of being punished, the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E

Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of ammunition.|$|E

After seven months Mercator was released <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.|$|E
