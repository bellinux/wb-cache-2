This study aims at emphasizing the relevant points within this interrelation as well as the teacher social role. The teacher constitutes the cross beam in the process of building the student’s character, a process that must be developed by means of a combined experimentation. The educational activities, for their turn, must be centered in the students’ abilities, expectations, interests, opportunities, possibilities and learning conditions. Motivation is the teaching and learning master spring in order to achieve the main objectives in education that are the sedimentation of the previous knowledge, the correction of the distortions and the acquisition of new knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Human {{history is}} marked by {{progressive}} stages of dominant <b>human</b> <b>interrelation</b> patterns. Marx examined these patterns and believed that history could {{be understood as a}} variation on a Fichtian science of material dialectics where a thesis would meet its antithesis, and a new synthesis would emerge from the violent struggle found at their intersection. This dissertation takes a slightly different perspective, concentrating on the contemporary stage of dominant <b>human</b> <b>interrelation</b> patterns, their origin, and consequences from an educational organisation perspective. This is an emerging discussion of the foundational and philosophical structures of interorganisational relationships involving educational administration. Beginning with a discussion of the origins and development of contemporary relational structures writ large—in terms of social, political, and economic antecedents—I show how their convergence around a dual falsehood has produced a self-perpetuating dominance in the modern era. The dual falsehood is manifest in the conflation of science and technology, and social Darwinist assumptions of human nature. Misunderstanding the nature of this dual falsehood, proponents of post-modernity are exposed as providing an anaemic or counterproductive response to the problems of modernity. I explore the particular problems of modernity faced by education as a general area of study and practice, and educational administration more specifically. The root of these problems is demonstrated in a misalignment of (a) dominant relational structures falsely self-declaring their basis in science, and (b) education as a genuine scientific pursuit (as defined herein). I further explore psychopathologies of relationships when negotiated in terms of such false self-declared and contextually dominant beliefs. The implications of psychopathological relationship negotiations are discussed for educational administration and strategies are explored for educational leadership and advocacy. Two stages of correction for the dominant issues described herein are posited on behalf of educational organisations. Stage one advocates the construction of a singular definition of pedagogy for public consumption. Stage two articulates areas of responsibility for various intraorganisational elements within education. The purpose of stage two is to disseminate widespread propaganda based upon Habermas’ (1970) communicative competence to eradicate dysfunctional communication that perpetuates the dominance of modern and post-modern relational structures. Furthermore, stage two advocates the adoption of Mouffe’s agonistic position for interorganisational relations between education and non-education entities. Stages are to be evaluated in terms of an adaptation upon Giddens’ (1979) analysis of sedimented practices of educational administration {{within the context of the}} Mouffian (2005) political...|$|R

40|$|Ezekiel {{has often}} been called ‘the prophet of the spirit’ due to his surpassing {{use of the term}} רוח, whose {{symbolic}} range embraces meteorological phenomena, the anthropological principle of life, a theological principle of divine apparitions, or experiences of divine presence. However, hardly any study exists which relates Ezekiel’s רוח motif to contemporary pneumatologies of the African biblical-faith communities which, akin to Ezekiel’s רוח symbolism, portray a worldview of axiomatic divine- <b>human</b> <b>interrelation</b> in existential life. The thesis of the present study is that the Ezekielian רוח motif conveys a polysemous symbolism which, nonetheless, accentuates an overarching leitmotiv; the רוח symbolism signifies a paradigmatic shift, in ancient Israelite understanding of divine- <b>human</b> <b>interrelation,</b> from visible manifestations and experiences of כבוד־יהוה mediated through cultic rituals and confined to cultic shrines to unmediated manifestations and experiences of divine presence, neither confined to cultic shrines nor necessarily limited to particular guilds of the Israelite societal leadership. Moreover, the study posits that the pneumatological worldview of the African communities of biblical faith is an apt hermeneutical lens for understanding Ezekiel’s רוח symbolism and that the experiences of the Ezekielian exilic community prefigure dynamic equivalents in the pneumatological context of the African communities of biblical faith. The present study is therefore an attempt to read Ezekiel’s רוח symbolism utilizing African pneumatology as a hermeneutical lens. A reader- response theory of biblical interpretation, in which textual meaning emerges from the interaction between the text, read in its socio- historical setting, and the reader in his or her socio- cultural world, is employed utilizing biblical inculturation as a strategy which contextualizes the hermeneutical process by bringing the reader’s interpretive interests and life concerns into the task of biblical interpretation. The study begins with an exploratory study of the book of Ezekiel in its historical context in the Hebrew Bible. This entails a critical review of the Ezekielian corpus in contemporary scholarship as well as an exegetical analysis of רוח symbolism in the Hebrew Bible in order to situate the Ezekiel’s רוח in its socio-historical and canonical context. The study then examines critical features of African pneumatological worldview which constitute hermeneutical linkages, or bridgeheads, between Ezekiel’s רוח symbolism and African pneumatology. The study shows that the Ezekielian רוח motif critically informs the African biblical-faith pneumatology while, as a corollary, the African pneumatological worldview illumines and, indeed, serves as an apt hermeneutical lens for understanding the Ezekielian רוח symbolism. The hermeneutical import of the Ezekielian רוח symbolism, as understood in the African pneumatological context, is that divine presence is experientially feasible in existential life without the necessity of any ecclesial or ritual mediation. As the writer of the biblical book, Acts, affirms, “God [...] . is not far from each one of us; for in him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17 : 27 - 28) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of human {{circulation}} on the onset of an epidemics for a arboviral (mosquito-borne) illness such as dengue. The underlying dynamics on a metapopulation is given by a classical SIR (human) /SI (vector) model. We consider three concepts of reproduction numbers: local (for each isolated subsys- tem), uniform or mixing (disregarding movement and non-uniformity in the whole region), and network (coupling the patches via <b>human</b> circulation). <b>Interrelations</b> between the three concepts are obtained. Depending on the biological contact as- sumptions, two types of network models result. In destination type models, the force of infection depends on mosquito density, relative to human population or to area. In origin based models, {{it is assumed that}} the transmission is determined by the behaviour of susceptible humans. Archetypal examples can be found where each node has local reproduction ratio less than one, the uniform reproduction number is also less than one, but the network reproduction number is greater than one. This shows that the disease can propagate among the patches solely as a consequence of human circulation. An estimate about {{the effect of}} vector control on a given patch is given.

40|$|The {{late twentieth}} century has seen a {{significant}} increase in the number of literary texts turning to music for thematic content and structural form. I read musical forms as structuring or articulating new forms of nationalism, identity formation, community, memory, and exile. Using vocabulary from postcolonial theory, I argue that sites of alterity identifiable in music challenge existing, dominant cultural formations, promote ethical orientation towards others, and suggest openness to <b>human</b> <b>interrelations.</b> The texts that anchor my study articulate an aesthetic humanism that proposes the musical arts as non-confrontational conceptions of self and other, of the individual and society. In the introduction to their provocatively entitled anthology, Dangerous Liaisons, Aamir Mufti and Ella Shohat insist on the value of a "contrapuntal juxtaposition" of multiculturalism in the U. S. context and postcolonialism in the international sphere. This phrase - contrapuntal juxtaposition - encapsulates the motivation for my dissertation. On the one hand, my work is contrapuntal in its interdisciplinarity. Revising the critical successes of musicologists, such as Susan McClary and Jeffrey Kallberg, who use feminist and genre theories to interrogate the gender politics readable in musical structures, harmonic progressions, and tonal qualities, I employ theories and practices of Western music to read the cultural, social, and political strategies for subject positioning and <b>human</b> <b>interrelations</b> employed by late-twentieth century novels and poetry. On the other hand, my study juxtaposes American ethnic and postcolonial writings. I use a contested scope for postcolonial literatures in order to focus on sites that might be considered "mature" in their postcoloniality and to find conditions of entrenched and deeply conflicting ideological positions. I contend that musical elements provide a means to critique dominant cultural ideologies and social constructions from within European Enlightenment, of which Western music is a product...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{consider}} the sociological term of ‘community’. It theoretically thinks about its state in contemporary urban settings. It has long been agreed that sociology is a discipline that studies <b>human</b> <b>interrelations</b> and societal solidarity. Thus, it is reasonable as well as meaningful {{to consider}} community as {{the context in which}} they can take place. However, the concept in question has been interpreted in a number of ways, thereby rendering it a confusing omnibus word with a variety of connotations. This has been the case, even though {{it is one of the}} key terms of sociology and thus needs to be clarified for sociological discussions. This paper argues that community is space for continuous social processes which mould the way that <b>human</b> <b>interrelations</b> and societal solidarity materialise with varying significance. This definition means that community is not something that is static, territorially embedded or refers to a group or a place; rather, it is something that embraces these all as social space which has no boundaries as long as there are social interactions. Based upon this definition, this paper will reflect on the nature of community by tracing the path which it has been through to become what it is today, i. e., community in urban settings. As it is social space, community can be found where human beings are. Therefore, there are such words as rural community, urban community, cyber community, to name but a few. This paper will focus on urban community, clarifying the rationale for analysing community in contemporary urban context. It will then point out some of the major challenges facing urban community today. It will also highlight the importance of our endeavour to create community, according to the social organisation of the time...|$|E

A human being is referred to as an individual engaged in creative activity of developing and updating the urban environment. It is pointed out that the local designer environment is of complicated nature being under the influence technogenic, social and environmental factors. The author of the article argues that the positive assimilation of an individual is the result of synthesis of an ideal concept of city and the individual. The analysis reveals the complicated nature of the urban body, its cultural character which determines the self-reflection of a human being in the semantics of urban architecture. Key words: human existance, urban design, design environment, a <b>human</b> being, <b>interrelation</b> of a <b>human</b> being and a society, adjustment, individuality of a human being.

40|$|Sprawl {{is often}} {{considered}} as prefiguring a new urban design, with new compositional structures, a new formal balance, new geographies with {{its impact on}} the regional systems of roads, logistics, services and settlements. No one remembers that the extent of urbanization in agricultural or natural areas induces a change in their ecological environment. Nobody seems to remember that new environmental matrices must be built to perform the function of biological connection for many groups of plants and animals. In addition, the slow but inexorable decline of agroforestry-pastoral traditional activities (being no longer economically viable) is not only the undoing of the historical and architectural value of agricultural landscapes, which belong to the collective imagination of local communities, (and which could lead to new endogenous economies), but also results in a reduction in biodiversity and ecotonal articulation due to a loss of alternation of sites with different ecological characteristics. New settlement rules and new rural policies are therefore required to respond to a rural area that is increasingly the scene of complex transformations. It is nevertheless still the embodiment of a constant relationship between the work of man, the balance of nature and the future of humanity. The identities of the spaces of agriculture, are continually remodeled due to action of natural factors and / or <b>humans</b> and their <b>interrelations.</b> We have so many different identities...|$|R
40|$|This article {{calls on}} two {{branches}} of third-wave feminist theory – ecofeminism and post-colonial feminism – to investigate <b>human</b> and nonhuman <b>interrelations</b> in Neil Gaiman’s young adult graphic novel, Stardust, illustrated by Charles Vess. Stardust follows Tristran Thorn on his {{journey into the}} land of Faerie {{in his attempt to}} capture and bring back a fallen star. Faerie is both a natural and exotic space and Tristran’s journey “to the East” transposes an Orientalist aesthetic onto its wild geography. Tristran, as would-be coloniser, views Faerie as a place of potentially inexhaustible natural resources. The star – as the imperialistic goal – is in fact a woman, which endows the wild space with further Oriental tropes, rendering it sensual, feminine and embodied. Tristran’s imperialistic impulse is thus associated with both a cultural impulse towards the domination of nature and a patriarchal impulse towards the oppression of women. Tristran’s increasing recognition of the star’s right to a fully realised selfhood sits uncomfortably with his initial imperialistic ambitions. As the novel progresses, the East becomes not, as it has been, a natural world ripe for colonial exploration and exploitation, but a place of positive intersubjective relations between humans and non-human nature. Initially both a real and illusory textual space resembling Edward Said’s “imaginative geography,” Faerie ultimately becomes a space to call “home,” in an overt critique of the nineteenth century boy’s adventure story with its implicit glorification of empire. Thus, it is argued, Stardust’s ecofeminist counter-discours...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This paper broadly {{discusses}} {{the role of}} the State of Bangladesh {{in the context of the}} health system and <b>human</b> rights. The <b>interrelation</b> between <b>human</b> rights, health and development are well documented. The recognition of health as a fundamental right by WHO and subsequent approval of health as an instrument of welfare by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights (ICSECR) further enhances the idea. Moreover, human rights are also recognized as an expedient of human development. The state is entrusted to realize the rights enunciated in the ICSECR. Discussion In exploring the relationship of the human rights and health situation in Bangladesh, it is argued, in this paper, that the constitution and major policy documents of the Bangladesh government have recognized the health rights and development. Bangladesh has ratified most of the international treaties and covenants including ICCPR, ICESCR; and a signatory of international declarations including Alma-Ata, ICPD, Beijing declarations, and Millennium Development Goals. However the implementation of government policies and plans in the development of health institutions, human resources, accessibility and availability, resource distribution, rural-urban disparity, the male-female gap has put the health system in a dismal state. Neither the right to health nor the right to development has been established in the development of health system or in providing health care. Summary The development and service pattern of the health system have negative correlation with human rights and contributed to the underdevelopment of Bangladesh. The government should take comprehensive approach in prioritizing the health rights of the citizens and progressive realization of these rights. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper emphasises {{projects}} {{as being a}} social process. It {{moves away from the}} traditional views that lay emphases on linear and predictable models of project practice to one that better highlights the complex nature of <b>human</b> <b>interrelations.</b> Findings from recent doctoral research implemented in the Middle East, indicate that socio-cultural factors in project contexts affect knowledge creation processes critical to organisational change. Research results benefited from viewing the project organization as a &# 039;complex adaptive system&# 039; with a structurally open project entity facilitating the contextual interconnections necessary for detecting and creating environmental change. Pragmatic knowledge was seen as emergent through movement of human interactions and contributed to the portrayal of the project organisation as a &# 039;becoming&# 039; cognitive system whose resilience is dependent upon producing meaning as opposed to processing information. Complexity in project management and theory has traditionally focussed on technical and structural aspects of project practice, whereas aligning social systems with nature where disorder and uncertainty prevails provides a better model of social analysis. Working in culturally pluralistic project environments where multiple realities and disparities in language are commonplace create challenges to traditional PM practice.

In this context I use the term “anthropology” as a philosophical model of interpretation for each of the numerous facets of <b>human</b> existence and <b>interrelations.</b> Blumenberg’s anthropology includes, besides the corporeal state during one’s lifespan stretched between birth and death, human life in creating, developing and configuring one’s abilities to actively give shape to the world surrounding us. Further it includes the evolvement of mental dimensions in language, culture and art and, beyond that, social competencies we exercise in coexistence with one another. Last but not least, it includes the utterly important role of the unconscious as a human parameter. Blumenberg based his analysis primarily on scientific data and model calculations. As a guiding principle he postulated the history of humanity to be a phylogenetic phenomenon, evolving from pre-existing species through adaptation to the environment with all its threats, difficulties, dangers and narrow passageways of security for finding the basic means for living. As a result of these considerations for Blumenberg, the development of the brain derives directly from the struggle of life in tropical jungles and sub-tropical savannahs in which the archaic hominids had to survive. Under this guideline {{one of the most important}} motives in Blumenberg’s works is the declaration that humans are beings who prefer to act from a distance. Blumenberg published long essays on human curiosity and its implications for self-assertion in prevailing hostile environments. In these works he denied what he found to be religious misinterpretations of the topic. He extensively writes about anthropological interpretations of achievements in astrophysics. Here he distinguishes between the socially relevant developments from the Copernican days onward, as well as contemporary insights. Though Blumenberg’s background is cultural anthropology, he denies all ideological interpretations of the world, refuses to accept any “divine purposes” for humankind, and does not grant humans any special status in the universe. To Blumenberg the idea of a deity steering humanity toward its destiny is a sheer construct of theological groups and schools. However, along with interpretations based on physics and biology, he presents certain ideas that can be seen as guidelines for culturally acceptable use of newly gained knowledge. The crucially human parameters are what Blumenberg detects in humanity’s enrichment means of recognizing fascinating, naturally occurring structures as manifest in the physical, biological, psychological and social fields. In all these disciplines technology can even extend this fascination; and make a meaningful life in this world desirable, even without religious and metaphysical constructs. Blumenberg is a modern interpreter of our world, who thinks that humankind can escape from its sombre, rigid confinement, at least partially, through knowledge and insight into the function of the unconscious. This is easiest when it comes to the development of technologies to make our lives more comfortable and better, by using humans’ almost limitless creativity. When it comes to changing our behaviour, however, the margins are far more narrow, because Blumenberg thinks of the influence of archaic structures as very limiting factors and describes them as practically immutable...|$|R
40|$|Sarah Kane’s {{first play}} Blasted (1995) {{has often been}} read in a {{normative}} and biographical way by critics, authors and previous researchers. This essay makes a supplementary close reading of Blasted from gender and genealogical perspectives and utilizes theoretical works by Judith Butler, Luce Irigaray and Michel Foucault. My study makes clear that the characters different positions in language and talk create and maintain a power imbalance between them. Efforts to change and develop one’s individual position in language and talk are being made throughout the play {{since it is the}} only way to bring about a change in the social power structure. A fact that in turn also subsequently punishes those efforts. By analyzing the tools of representation, Kane points out a direct link between a violent power imbalance in a couples relationship and the violence of a war zone. In Blasted, it is revealed how violence in a private situation is mirrored in a situation of public violence and how the public violence, in turn, crawls back to the private zone and there repeats itself. By forcing one of the main characters to regress back to the infancy of language and from there alter the ability to act within the framework of <b>human</b> <b>interrelations,</b> Kane demonstrates how a change in social structures can be made, and as is shown in this essay, this indicates that a knowledge of how the social structures are being maintained and how they in turn can be disarranged, is what is required to create an opportunity for change...|$|E
40|$|The {{ambition}} of this dissertation is {{to articulate a}} theory of affect that works well with the innovative poetics of four important contemporary feminist poets. The introduction, "Reading for Affect in Contemporary Feminist Poetry," gives an overview of literary affect studies and proposes a way of reading for affect in poetry. The second chapter, "Black Laughter in the Poetry of Harryette Mullen," approaches laughter {{as a form of}} affect and explores the ambiguity of that affect through a reading of Mullen's major collections of poetry, all of which employ puns and other double-meanings to comic effect, even while commenting upon serious issues of race and gender. Chapter three, "Language and Affect in the Poetry of Leslie Scalapino," reads for affect in selected works of this Language poet, arguing that despite semantic indeterminacy, affect flourishes. In the fourth chapter, "Lisa Robertson's Feminist Poetic Landscapes," I argue that in several of her major works, Robertson challenges the figure/ground division to create a poetic subjectivity that is a feminist model of interrelatedness. And finally, in the last chapter, "SAD in the Anthropocene: Brenda Hillman's Ecopoetics of Affect," I further explore the ways an affective poetics can develop an ecological subjectivity that is more sensitive to <b>human</b> <b>interrelations</b> with the land. The chapters are organized to emphasize what I see as a trend toward ecopoetics in these works. The ethics of attention to and respect for difference, highly developed in this feminist writing, lends itself very well to a consideration of affective and ecological interrelations. Together, these chapters apply an affective interpretive method to extended studies of the work of four contemporary feminist poets...|$|E
