5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, given the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{do not have the}} precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E

25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid lies in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E
25|$|No {{matter how}} we view it, {{it remains a}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> charged a non-English-speaking alien with {{criminal}} tax evasion on the first tax returns he filed in this country.

Rather, we took a novel theory of tax liability of less than $10,000 {{and turned it into a}} guilty verdict and eighteen months in a federal prison.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued by some physicists, e.g., M. J. Duff, that {{the laws of physics}} are {{inherently}} dimensionless. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have assigned incompatible dimensions to Length, Time and Mass is, according to this point of view, just a matter of convention, borne out of the fact that before the advent of modern physics, {{there was no way to}} relate mass, length, and time to each other. The three independent dimensionful constants: c, ħ, and G, in the fundamental equations of physics must then be seen as mere conversion factors to convert Mass, Time and Length into each other.|$|E

25|$|An {{increase}} in the RD temperament leads us to seek out those behaviors or substances {{that will allow us}} to remain in a pleasant physical and/or mental state, attributing to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> humans are hedonistic individuals, seeking to avoid pain and embracing pleasurable stimuli. Our pleasure and reward systems in the brain are hyper-activated, which makes us display continuous approach behaviors to the reward in question. Our neuro-circuity is as such that when we stop having access to such pleasurable objects of desire, we then experience negative consequences (withdrawal symptoms). Addictive behaviors then arise to alleviate such negative consequences and the cycle continues.|$|E
25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include mindfulness practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully aware of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist mindfulness training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E

The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the Hunley, which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (Hunley also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels {{and was one of the}} few historic warships ever raised intact); the Resurgam II, the first powered submarine; and Holland 5, which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.|$|E

25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E
25|$|In Shusterman’s and, also, Dewey's opinion, {{the eastern}} {{meditation}} practices repair perception for understanding {{our dependence on}} the society’s moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars’s critique of {{the myth of the}} given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation {{has been one of the}} reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick has {{developed}} this approach further {{in connection with}} computer, or video games. In his Aesthetic Theory and the Video Game {{he argues that the}} aesthetic appeal of games does not lie where we expect to find it – in sumptuous on-screen imagery – but in the physical sensations of gameplay. Because most video game analysis is informed by conventional media theory it tends to interpret games in terms of their ‘content’, or message, viewing the game as a sign system. This overlooks {{the most important part of}} the experience of gameplay and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can often enjoy a game without ever thinking about what it, or the activity of playing it, ‘means’. In his second book on games, Computer Games and the Social Imaginary, Kirkpatrick presents a history of digital games that links their rise to the spread of neo-liberalism, a version of capitalism that fosters and relies upon a playful disposition on the part of its subjects.|$|E

25|$|The {{people of}} Thailand, with Buddhist and animist beliefs, {{also have a}} vast pantheon of amulets, which are still popular and in common use by most people even in the present day. The belief in magic is {{impregnated}} into Thai culture and religious beliefs and folk superstitions, and this {{is reflected in the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can still see commonplace use of amulets and magical rituals in everyday life. Some of the more commonly known amulets are of course the Buddhist votive tablets, such as the Pra Somdej Buddha image, and guru monk coins. But Thailand has an immensely large number of magical traditions, and thousands of different types of amulet and occult charm can be found in use, ranging from the takrut scroll spell, to the necromantic Ban Neng Chin Aathan, which uses the bones or flesh of the corpse of a 'hoeng prai' ghost (a person who died unnaturally, screaming, or in other strange premature circumstances), to reanimate the spirit of the dead, to dwell within the bone as a spirit, and assist the owner to achieve their goals. The list of Thai Buddhist amulets in existence is a lifetime study in its own right, and indeed, many people devote their lives to the study of them, and collection. Thai amulets are still immensely popular both with Thai folk as well as with foreigners, and in recent years, a massive increase in foreign interest has caused the subject of Thai Buddhist amulets to become a commonly known topic around the world. Amulets can fecth prices ranging from a few dollars right up to millions of dollars for a single amulet. Due to the money that can be made with sorcery services, and with rare collector amulets of the master class, there is also a forgery market in existence, which ensures that the experts of the scene maintain a monopoly on the market. With so many fakes, experts are needed for collectors to trust for obtaining authentic amulets, and not selling them fakes.|$|E
