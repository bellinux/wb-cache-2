25|$|Most sulfurization {{agents are}} strong dehydrators and drive {{completion}} of the reaction. Early postulates toward the mechanism of the Paal-Knorr <b>furan</b> synthesis suggested that the thiophene was achieved by sulfurization of the <b>furan</b> product.

25|$|The Feist–Benary {{synthesis}} is {{a classic}} way to synthesize <b>furans,</b> although many syntheses have been developed.

25|$|Pyrrole is a colorless {{volatile}} liquid that darkens readily upon {{exposure to}} air, {{and is usually}} purified by distillation immediately before use. Pyrrole has a nutty odor. Pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle, like <b>furan</b> and thiophene.

25|$|The {{third class}} {{includes}} reactions describing {{the synthesis of}} FDCA from furfural.

25|$|The {{temperatures}} {{needed to}} break down dioxin are typically not reached when burning plastics outdoors in a burn barrel or garbage pit, causing high dioxin emissions as mentioned above. While plastic does usually burn in an open-air fire, the dioxins remain after combustion and either float off into the atmosphere, or may remain in the ash {{where it can be}} leached down into groundwater when rain falls on the ash pile. Fortunately, dioxin and <b>furan</b> compounds bond very strongly to solid surfaces and are not dissolved by water, so leaching processes are limited to the first few millimeters below the ash pile. The gas-phase dioxins can be substantially destroyed using catalysts, some of which can be present as part of the fabric filter bag structure.|$|E
25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of <b>furan)</b> increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (benzimidazole, for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five membered aromatic rings that contain heteroatoms. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E
