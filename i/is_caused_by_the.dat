5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period. This <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> filling of the valence {{shell of the}} atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} classified {{the accident}} as survivable because the impact forces varied along the fuselage. <b>The</b> tail-first impact <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first officer's last-second attempt at raising the aircraft. Most of the fatalities resulted from people having been {{trapped in the}} sinking sections, which <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> collapsing of the structure after impact. <b>The</b> collapse <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> compromise of the tubular integrity, which was dependent on the keel beam that had been torn off on impact.|$|R

5|$|The drop in export <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of {{competitiveness}} against other major export countries including Japan and Germany, where the currency had been drastically devalued {{during the previous}} quantitative easing operations.

5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, radio {{emission}} from the Andromeda Galaxy {{was detected by}} Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first radio maps of the galaxy {{were made in the}} 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group. The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog. In 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. This was detected using a technique called microlensing, which <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> deflection of light by a massive object.|$|E
5|$|In ctenophores, {{bioluminescence}} <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{activation of}} calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, {{which are often}} confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E

5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to thrombosis, particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide's rapid {{reaction}} {{with water}} in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are breakdown {{products of the}} amino acids ornithine and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E

5|$|Scales, more specifically, mostly {{consist of}} hard beta keratins which are {{basically}} transparent. The colours {{of the scale}} are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when {{one end of a}} molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E
5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised. The air sacs expand and contract due {{to changes in the}} volume in the thorax and abdomen. This volume change <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> movement of the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of the flight muscles.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit body}} remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; {{dehiscence}} (fruit body opening) <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses—sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) {{cells that are}} interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture {{is thought to be}} caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{ethylene glycol}} itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses {{there will be}} less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects {{the liver and}} is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E
