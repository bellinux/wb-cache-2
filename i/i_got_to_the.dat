5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
25|$|This is Richard's CD. My only {{knowledge}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{studio was}} how {{he seemed to have}} wanted this for a long time. You're in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.|$|E

[...] He saw his novel as a continuation of the Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end I wrote mine." ...|$|E

He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else.

500|$|The gates {{were opened}} at 11:30am as advertised, {{three and a}} half hours before the match was due to begin, and until 1:00pm the flow of people into the stadium was orderly. By 1:00pm, however, a vast number of people were pouring into the stadium, and after an {{inspection}} by the stadium authorities, the decision was made to close the gates at 1:45pm. [...] Spectator William Rose said later that Olympic Way was [...] "seething with people" [...] and that [...] "the nearer <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stadium the worse it got, by the time I got there the turnstiles had been closed". Although the information was relayed to various railway stations, thousands of people continued to arrive and mass outside the gates. [...] Organisation within the stadium was poor, and in his report on the match the correspondent for the Daily Mail described the stewarding as [...] "useless" [...] and stated that officials in and around the stadium [...] "seemed to know nothing". Fans were not directed to any specific area, and the tiers in the lower half of the stadium filled up much faster than those higher up.|$|E

She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Novelization {{writers are}} often also {{accomplished}} original fiction writers, {{as well as}} fans of the works they adapt, which helps motivate them to undertake a commission that is generally compensated with a relatively low flat fee.

One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio that day.

[...] The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book The Nationalisation of Banking, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called Womens Leader. Amber remained active in the Fabian Society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party.

2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been a while since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E
