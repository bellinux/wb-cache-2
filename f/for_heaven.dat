5|$|Purgatory is a {{temporary}} condition for the purification of souls who, although destined <b>for</b> <b>Heaven,</b> are not fully detached from sin and thus cannot enter Heaven immediately. In Purgatory, the soul suffers, and is purged and perfected. Souls in purgatory may be aided in reaching heaven by the prayers of the faithful on earth and by the intercession of saints.|$|E

5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street {{whether or not they were}} headed <b>for</b> <b>heaven</b> or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians as a result of his evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E

25|$|Literary {{references}} to purgatory go {{back at least}} as far as Dante Alighieri. In his Divine Comedy story Purgatorio, Mount Purgatory is split into different terraces for those being made to be ready <b>for</b> <b>heaven.</b> At the top of Mount Purgatory is the Garden of Eden.|$|E
25|$|Purgatory is the {{condition}} or temporary punishment in which, it is believed, {{the souls of}} those who die {{in a state of}} grace are made ready <b>for</b> <b>Heaven.</b> This is a theological idea that has ancient roots and is well-attested in early Christian literature, while the poetic conception of purgatory as a geographically situated place is largely the creation of medieval Christian piety and imagination.|$|E
25|$|In {{the romantic}} Segyeong Bonpuli myth, the protagonist {{is the woman}} Jacheong Bi. In this story, Jacheong Bi disguiises herself as a man, and goes to school with the teenaged deity Mun Doryeong. After {{secretly}} pretending she was a man for three years, she sends a letter on a leaf while Mun Doryeong is bathing, telling Mun Doryeong the truth. Mun Doryeong and Jacheong Bi share love that night, then Mun Doryeong leaves <b>for</b> <b>Heaven.</b>|$|E

25|$|Traditional images {{show the}} Trung sisters wearing yellow turbans during their revolt against China in AD 40. These were {{unwrapped}} {{and waved to}} signal {{the beginning of a}} fight. A yellow banner with a red circle in the center was adopted as a standard by Emperor Gia Long (r. 1802–1820). The flag of South Vietnam was originally designed by Emperor Thành Thái in 1890, and was revived by Lê Văn Đệ and re-adopted by Emperor Bảo Đại in 1948. The three stripes represented the Quẻ Càn, or Qian trigram, one of eight trigrams used in the I-Ching, a Taoist scripture. Quẻ Càn is the divination sign <b>for</b> <b>heaven.</b> Later, the stripes were reinterpreted to represent the northern, central and southern regions of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Another view held by many Protestants is sola fide ("by faith alone"): {{that faith}} alone, apart from any action, is what {{achieves}} salvation, and that good works are merely {{evidence of that}} faith. Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, {{not the result of}} a transformation of character. However, most Protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience. Instead of distinguishing between mortal and venial sins, Protestants believe that one's faith dictates one's state of salvation and one's place in the afterlife. Those who have been saved by God are destined <b>for</b> <b>heaven,</b> while those have not been saved will be excluded from heaven. Accordingly, they reject any notion of a provisional or temporary afterlife state such as purgatory.|$|E
25|$|Shively {{continues}} {{to show its}} strong ties to the bourbon industry. It remains the site of one major operating distillery—Brown-Forman's Early Times distillery, which still produces historic brands including Early Times (first produced in 1860, {{and one of the}} few brands that was allowed to be produced during the Prohibition era—the best-selling whiskey in the country in the mid-1950s) and Old Forester (first produced in 1870—the first bourbon sold exclusively in sealed bottles and the oldest bourbon continuously on the market to the present time). Another historic Shively distillery site, the former Stitzel-Weller distillery, has been converted into a tourist attraction for the Bulleit Bourbon brand, and was included as a stop on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail in 2014. As of October, 2014, the historic Michter's bourbon brand is working on opening a new distillery site in Shively. The Bernheim Distillery, another major distillery which is the current distillery site <b>for</b> <b>Heaven</b> Hill Distilleries, opened in the neighboring part of Louisville just outside Shively around 2000.|$|E

25|$|For him {{science was}} {{the means of}} exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full {{strength}} it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward {{the end of his}} life it brought him confidence. Gauss' God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation <b>for</b> <b>heaven.</b> Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.|$|E

500|$|Millennium creator Chris Carter {{conceived}} Frank Black's character {{early in}} the series' genesis, knowing {{that he wanted to}} build the show around a retired law enforcement agent; the tone of Millennium came to Carter later in the process but shaped Black's character. Carter saw Black as an archetypal Western hero, describing him as [...] "self-reliant, quiet, capable, dangerous" [...] and comparing him to the title character of the 1953 film Shane. Actor William Hurt was considered for the role {{early in the}} conception of the series, although Carter denies that Hurt was seriously approached for the part, saying Henriksen was their [...] "first and last choice". David Nutter, a frequent director for the series, described Henriksen as an [...] "everyman" [...] who appears to have [...] "seen hell, and has reached <b>for</b> <b>heaven</b> but not often had it".|$|E
500|$|Zihuatanejo {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an analogue <b>for</b> <b>heaven</b> or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific ocean, whose name means [...] "peace". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised following Andy's admission of guilt over his wife's death. Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption. While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, {{it can also be}} interpreted as a Nietzschean form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he {{can be seen as a}} Zarathurstra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Ebert argued that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.|$|E
