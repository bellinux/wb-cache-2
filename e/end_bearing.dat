25|$|The Rolls-Royce {{design team}} {{realised}} that producing a scaled-up version of their Griffon V-12 engine {{would lead to}} excessively large combustion chambers and problems with detonation. The team concluded that {{a larger number of}} small cylinders would be the answer and considered an X-24 design. This layout had previously caused unreliability with the Rolls-Royce Vulture due to the need to fasten four connecting rods in a complicated arrangement to a common big <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Air Ministry {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the accident under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations, 1922. The investigation opened on 25 June at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, with Sir Arthur Colefax in charge. The cause of the engine failure was the fracture of No. 4 connecting rod in the starboard engine. The engine had run for 126 hours since its last overhaul, with the permitted time between overhauls being 300 hours. The connecting rod had failed due to the failure of the big <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> studs.|$|E
2500|$|One-piece, {{machined}} from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome {{molybdenum steel}} forging. Statically and dynamically balanced. Seven main bearings and six throws. Internal oilway, with feed from both ends, used to distribute lubricants to main and big end bearings. [...] "Floating" [...] front <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> consisting of an internally toothed annulus bolted to crankshaft, meshing with and incorporating a semi-floating ring, internally splined {{to a short}} coupling shaft. Coupling shaft splined at front end to driving wheel of propeller reduction gear. Clockwise rotation when viewed from rear.|$|E
50|$|Big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are {{commonly}} bushings or plain bearings, but less commonly may be roller bearings (see crankshaft).|$|R
50|$|The bearing at the {{interface}} of a cantilever and a suspended span is specially designed {{to cater to}} complex seismic movements. These consist {{of a combination of}} spherical knuckle and P.T.F.E stainless steel sliding surface for free <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and spherical knuckle cum electrometric pad for fixed <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> Electrometric type of expansion joints are provided for to cater to large seismic movements and to give a smooth riding surface. The bridge deck is provided with 25 mm thick layer of Mastic Asphalt.|$|R
25|$|The {{approach}} spans, and the <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> for {{the main}} spans, were fabricated by the American Bridge Company at its shops located in Ambridge, Pennsylvania.|$|R
2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's big <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated locomotive axles also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher resistance to heat.|$|E
2500|$|The A4 {{class had}} {{previously}} {{had problems with}} the big <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> for the middle cylinder, so the big end was fitted with a [...] "stink bomb" [...] of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. Shortly after attaining the record speed, the middle big end did overheat and Mallard had to limp onwards to Peterborough. It then travelled to Doncaster for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case Mallard {{did not make it}} back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.|$|E
50|$|For <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> piles, {{the pile}} annulus {{is filled with}} either a neat cement grout or sanded grout. The neat cement grout is tremied {{to the base of}} the pile. A sanded grout is pumped into the pipe annulus at the top of the pile. The choice of grout for <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> piles depends on the size of the job, {{equipment}} and crew preferences. Either grout can fulfill the strength requirements.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, the crankpins, {{also known}} as crank journals are the [...] of the big <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the connecting rods opposite to the pistons.|$|R
50|$|An {{undercut}} crankshaft {{is a form}} of crankshaft for piston engines, {{where the}} overall length of the crankshaft is shortened by overlapping the main bearings of the crankshaft with the big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> of the connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver {{it to the big}} <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> All big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod big end has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Ductile iron piles {{have been}} {{successfully}} used {{on a range of}} projects throughout the world. Designs in accordance with the EuroCode (EC) have proved to be competitive with drilled micropiles and various other types of <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> piles. TRM piles have been designed in both friction and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> applications. The TRM pile system provided both financial, as well as operational benefits to completed projects. For example, mobilizing an excavator versus a pile driving rig provided substantial logistical and driving advantages. When soil conditions differ adding pile length proves to be an easy task. We believe that the TRM system will not only have great advantages on tight sites with deep depths to the <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> stratum we believe as well that the TRM system will be used very efficiently on projects where loads can be shed in friction at shallower depths. Both <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> and friction TRM piles will prove to be cost-effective, adaptable to varied site grading conditions and the simplicity of mobilization. The virtually vibration free driving process allows the installation of piles immediately adjacent to existing structures.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{crankpin}} serves {{more than}} one cylinder, then the corresponding cylinders may have an offset, to simplify {{the design of the}} big <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b> This design is used in: ...|$|E
50|$|Deep {{foundations}} {{are used}} for structures or heavy loads when shallow foundations cannot provide adequate capacity, due to size and structural limitations. They may {{also be used to}} transfer building loads past weak or compressible soil layers. While shallow foundations rely solely on the bearing capacity of the soil beneath them, deep foundations can rely on <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> resistance, frictional resistance along their length, or both in developing the required capacity. Geotechnical engineers use specialized tools, such as the cone penetration test, to estimate the amount of skin and <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> resistance available in the subsurface.|$|E
50|$|The engine had its {{cylinders}} cast {{together with}} the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with counterbalancing weights. The big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were flanged over {{the sides of the}} crankshaft to locate the rods against the crank webs, which reduced engine noise.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Semi-tunnel {{crankshaft}} from a Tatra T27 This is a built-up crankshaft with bolted webs. The {{crank bearings}} (excluding the bearing races) {{are smaller than}} the webs. The <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> of this semi-tunnel crankshaft (not shown) are also of conventional small size.|$|R
50|$|The big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were {{lubricated}} by jets from an {{oil gallery}} in the crankcase, the oil striking the crankshaft webs which were drilled accordingly. Originally the journal diameter was 1.125"; this was later increased to 1.3125". The three bearing engine (from 1936) used a white metal centre bearing.|$|R
50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The connecting rod small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} is standardized by ASTM D4945-00 Standard Test Method for High Strain Dynamic Testing of Piles. It may be performed on all piles, {{regardless of their}} installation method. In addition to bearing capacity, Dynamic Load Testing gives information on resistance distribution (shaft resistance and <b>end</b> <b>bearing)</b> and evaluates the shape and integrity of the foundation element.|$|E
5000|$|The spherical rod <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> was {{developed}} by Nazi Germany during World War II. When {{one of the first}} German planes to be shot down by the British in early 1940 was examined, they found this joint in use in the aircraft's control systems. Following this discovery, the Allied governments gave the H.G. Heim Company an exclusive patent to manufacture these joints in North America, while in the UK the patent passed to Rose Bearings Ltd. The ubiquity of these manufacturers in their respective markets led to the terms heim joint and rose joint becoming synonymous with their product. After the patents ran out the common names stuck, although [...] "rosejoint" [...] remains a registered trademark of Minebea Mitsumi Inc., successor to Rose Bearings Ltd. Originally used in aircraft, the rod <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> may be found in cars, trucks, race cars, motorcycles, lawn tractors, boats, industrial machines, go-karts, radio-control helicopters, and many more applications.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> from inside. The <b>end</b> main <b>bearings</b> and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's sight glasses give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|R
50|$|It had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors, {{inclined}} at 49 degrees, with {{an unusual}} float tank system used rather than float bowls. Plain bearings {{were used for the}} big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and the centre main bearings. The outer main bearings were rollers. One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} practice, the {{crankshaft}} and connecting rod big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> {{in a modern}} automobile engine are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the bearing caps. The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze which is in turn coated with {{a thin layer of}} Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.|$|R
5000|$|Solute fossils have an irregularly shaped {{flattened}} body {{covered in}} calcite plates, and {{are up to}} about 10 cm long. The body has two appendages, interpreted as a [...] "feeding arm" [...] at one <b>end,</b> <b>bearing</b> tube feet at its end, and a [...] "stele" [...] at the other, {{which may have been}} used by the animal to propel itself along the sea floor.|$|E
5000|$|Bigend Saddle (...) is a snow-covered saddle at the {{southwest}} side of Mount Betty in northern Herbert Range, Queen Maud Mountains. The saddle was traversed in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould. It was {{named by the}} Southern Party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition, 1963-64, {{because one of the}} party's motor toboggans was abandoned here with a smashed big <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} feature {{some fine}} cedar joinery {{in the sanctuary}} area and liturgical fitments including a silky oak minister's chair. The timber pews have decorative <b>ends</b> <b>bearing</b> pew numbers. A pair of leadlight windows featuring the Welsh dragon are above the doors in the rear wall leading into the vestry/meeting room. The walls display several timber plaques and memorials.|$|R
50|$|Internal combustions engines require {{lubrication}} {{in operation}} that moving parts slide smoothly over each other. Insufficient lubrication subjects {{the parts of}} the engine to metal-to-metal contact, friction, heat build-up, rapid wear often culminating in parts becoming friction welded together e.g. pistons in their cylinders. Big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> seizing up will sometimes lead to a connecting rod breaking and poking out through the crankcase.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{a coastal}} species found {{on both sides}} of the north Atlantic. It appears as a group of pink or red [...] "stems" [...] (hydrocauli), up to 25 mm tall, with distinctively clubbed <b>ends</b> <b>bearing</b> thread-like tentacles. It can be found on rocks but is most often seen {{attached}} to seaweed, especially brown seaweeds such as Ascophyllum and Fucus.|$|R

50|$|K-Series Joists are {{standardized}} regarding depths, spans, and load-carrying capacities. There are 63 separate designations in the Load Tables, representing joist depths from {{10 inches}} (254 mm) through 30 inches (762 mm) in 2 inch (51 mm) increments and spans through 60 feet (18,288 mm). Standard K-Series Joists have a 2 1/2 inch (64 mm) <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> depth so that, {{regardless of the}} overall joist depths, {{the tops of the}} joists lie in the same plane. Seat depths deeper than 2 ½” (64 mm) can also be specified.|$|E

The connecting rod had failed due to the failure of the big <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> studs.|$|E
50|$|In service, {{the unit}} {{proved to be}} a {{somewhat}} mixed bag; some owners reported excellent reliability and long engine lives, others complained of overheating, frequent blowing of head gaskets, cylinder head cracks (cracks between the valve seats are common and do not represent danger if the cracks do not exceed specifications), premature wear of the bottom and top <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> low oil pressure etc.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, a 500 cc {{version with}} linked {{front and rear}} brakes appeared, and the big <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were now fed oil through the {{crankshaft}} pin. The old 350 cc was dropped in 1926. For 1928 Rudge motorcycles were fitted with saddle tanks, and 8-inch internal expanding drum brakes. Stanley Glanfield designed a Rudge for dirt racing, marketed from 1928 as the Glanfield Rudge.|$|R
25|$|The Griffon was {{the first}} Rolls-Royce {{production}} aero engine to use a hollow crankshaft as the means of lubricating the main and big <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> providing a more even distribution of oil to each bearing. In another change from convention, one high efficiency B.T.H-manufactured dual magneto was mounted {{on top of the}} propeller reduction casing; earlier Rolls-Royce designs using twin magnetos mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine.|$|R
