5|$|According to Fumić, {{the weaker}} and ill {{children}} were lodged with compassionate local peasants, but 350 {{of the strongest}} children were taken away by the fighters. According to Lukić, a total of 727 children were liberated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> but at the first rest stop at Svetojanska, medical examinations by Davila identified about 400 weak and sick children who could no longer walk, and they were returned to Jastrebarsko.

5|$|Inmates were {{at times}} able to {{distribute}} information <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> {{to the outside}} world via messages used in shortwave radio transmissions. The Polish government-in-exile in London first reported the gassing of prisoners on 21 July 1942. However, these reports were for a long time disregarded as exaggerated or unreliable by the Allied Powers, Germany's opponents in the West. Information regarding Auschwitz was also available to the Allies during the years 1940–43 by the accurate and frequent reports of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) Captain Witold Pilecki. Pilecki was the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, spending 945 days there. He gathered evidence of genocide and organized resistance structures known as Związek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW) at the camp. His first report was smuggled {{to the outside world}} in November 1940, through an inmate who was released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp.</b> He eventually escaped on 27 April 1943, but his personal report of mass killings was dismissed as exaggeration by the Allies, as were his previous reports.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> except the ethnic Persian troops, who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E

5|$|Children {{survived the}} Jastrebarsko and Donja Reka camps only because {{concerned}} individuals from Zagreb, Jastrebarsko, and surrounding villages offered humanitarian aid. Among {{those who worked}} to alleviate children's suffering were Marinić, Budisavljević, and Davila. One survivor, Milan Vujić, was taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> when he was sick and cared for {{until the end of}} the war by a Croatian family in Koprivnica. They had never accepted the Ustaše regime or its policies. Many Croats, he stated, took in and even adopted children from Jastrebarsko and treated them kindly.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} through {{vineyards}} and cornfields, the emaciated children ate {{as much as}} they could. Lukić states that the Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging for them to be transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, some of the children who were liberated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše. Some were killed and others were returned to the camp.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E

Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position {{a short distance from}} the perimeter and from there some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Vrba (11 September 1924– 27 March 2006) was a Slovak-Jewish {{biochemist}} who, as {{a teenager}} in 1942, was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. He became known for having escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> in April 1944, {{at the height of the}} Holocaust, and for co-writing a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking place there. Distribution of the report is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving over 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba became a noted biochemist in England and Canada.|$|E

5|$|The first {{victims were}} a few {{thousand}} men arrested in July 1941 and brought from Riga Central Prison. In 1942 another 12,000 Jews were brought from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought here who were unable to work at Kaiserwald concentration camp, followed by those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> itself unable to work in 1944.

5|$|The local Partisans {{had been}} advised of the {{presence}} of the camp and the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on the camp site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked the camp and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters even found a brother or sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> all the children that could walk.|$|E
5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet.|$|E

5|$|After 10 days of {{questioning}} Winter {{was taken to}} Rennes, where he was joined three days later by Captain Burton, Hollings, and Orr. These three had managed to stay together when the boat was sunk, and were captured by a German parachute unit carrying out manoeuvres. Burton {{was sent to a}} prisoner of war camp in Germany, Winter, Hollings and Orr were taken to Frankfurt and handed over to the Gestapo for further questioning, after which Winter was sent to a prisoner of war camp at Memmingen. The fate of Hollings and Orr has never been established. Winter and a Special Air Service officer escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> in April 1945, disguised as French soldiers.

5|$|After news of {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, {{followed}} by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, {{it was evident that}} Japanese control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it. After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman made his way to Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces {{were in the process of}} retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} mounted {{between the}} Indians in the Northwest Territory and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning joint operations between federal army troops and local frontier militia against the Indians. In April 1790, Scott raised {{a contingent of}} volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join Josiah Harmar in a raid against the Western Confederacy along the Scioto River in {{what would become the}} U.S. state of Ohio. The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior– nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet– led away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot.
