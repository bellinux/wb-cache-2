40|$|The {{growing demand}} for safer and {{high-quality}} food products creates the need for better knowledge of the processes involved in food production. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{have been widely used}} to better understand food thermal process, one of the safest and most frequently used methods for food preservation. However, no consistency in mathematical models has been observed, especially on the boundary conditions definition. The present study has evaluated four methodologies for the definition of boundary conditions for heating water in two commercial bottles: (M 1) temperature profile of heating water (T infinity) and convective heat transfer coefficient (h), (M 2) T infinity as boundary condition for the outside package wall, (M 3) T infinity as boundary condition for the outside heated liquid edge, and (M 4) internal temperature profile (T=T(x,y,z,t)), previously measured in the <b>inner</b> <b>package</b> wall, as boundary condition for the outside heated liquid edge. Models that considered the measured value of h e T infinity as boundary condition showed good agreement with experimental values, compared by thermal history and sterilization value (F). The models that considered the temperature profile of the heating water or the <b>inner</b> <b>package</b> wall as boundary conditions, showed faster heating. By over-estimating the product heating rate, those models are not appropriated for thermal process modelling, as it compromises the safety and preservation of food products...|$|E

Aflatoxin B 1 is the dangerous agent having roles as carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic. The aims of this research were known kinds of moulds and detection of aflatoxin B 1 on commercial condiments fermented of shrimp. Two brands of commercial condiments fermented of shrimp were taken from traditional markets and supermarkets in Surakarta. Isolation was done by made suspension of sample in aquadets. Suspension on appropriate dilutions was grown on CDA (Czapek’s Dox Agar) media with surface spread. The grown colonies were separated and grown on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) slant media. Furthermore, isolates were cultured on CDA and MEA (Malt Extract Agar) media. The grown colonies were microscopes and microscopes examined and identified. Existence of aflatoxin B 1 was known by Commercial RIDA Screen ELISA Kit that could detect qualitatively and quantitatively with detection sensitive < 1. 7 ppb. Moulds that could be isolated from condiments fermented of shrimp were: Aspergillus flavus Link, Aspergillus niger van Tieghem, Aspergillus wentii Wehmer, Aspergillus PU 1 or Aspergillus PU 2 and Penicillium citrinum Thom.

40|$|The {{traditional}} Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model {{ignores the}} physical limitations of distribution practices. Very often distribution centers (DC) have to deliver merchandise in manufacturer-specified packages, which can impose {{restrictions on the}} application of the economic order quantity. These manufacturer-specified packages, or ship-packs, include cases (e. g., cartons containing 24 or 48 units), inners (packages of 6 or 8 units) and eaches (individual units). For each Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), a retailer decides which of these ship-pack options to use when replenishing its retail stores. Working with a major US retailer, we have developed a cost model to help determine the optimum warehouse ship-pack. Besides recommending the most economical ship-pack, the model is also capable of identifying candidates for warehouse dual-slotting, i. e., two picking modules for the same SKU that carry two different pack sizes. We find that SKUs whose sales volumes vary greatly over time will benefit more from dual-slotting. Finally, we extend our model to investigate the ideal case configuration for a particular SKU, that is, the ideal size for an <b>inner</b> <b>package.</b> by Naijun Wen. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Phthalates {{are used}} in many {{industrial}} and consumer products. High-molecular-weight phthalates are primarily used as plasticizers to soften PVC products, while low-molecular-weight phthalates are widely used as solvents to hold colour and scent in products. Phthalates have been detected in food and also measured in humans. This study investigated phthalates in food products on the Belgian market in order to explore possible contamination pathways. 650 Representative samples of widely consumed foods were purchased in Belgian shops. The levels of eight phthalates were determined and product specific properties were stored in a database. This database was used to explore the contamination pathways by identifying relations between sample properties (e. g. fat content, pH and packaging) and measured phthalate concentrations. The results of the measurement campaign show {{a wide variety of}} phthalate concentrations in the food samples. Concentrations are higher in high-fat food products like butter, oil and cheese compared to low-fat food products, like vegetables and juices. Higher phthalate concentrations were also detected in some cardboard packed food, probably due to migration from inks and glues. Aluminium <b>inner</b> <b>package</b> seems to be a good barrier for migration. A wide range of phthalate levels in bread was found and further research is necessary. A wide variety in phthalate concentration was found.

These fruits were exported to Hong Kong via sea for 7 days using reefer containers at set temperatures of 2 °C and 15 °C. After delivery, the fruits were stored at 10 °C and room temperature for 6 days. The number of softened fruits in each test was counted {{on the day of}} delivery and on every second day during storage. The softening of fruit was judged directly by touch and fruits that had even slightly softened were regarded as softened fruits. Simultaneously a laboratory test was conducted under conditions mimicking the transport conditions to determine the effect of MAP on persimmon quality based on the evaluation of headspace O 2 and CO 2 concentration inside the package, fruit skin color, and ion leakage. The number of softened fruit was less at 2 °C than at 15 °C transportation temperatures on the day of delivery, but during shelf-life conditions at both 10 °C and room temperature, the number of softened fruit increased rapidly on the fruit that was transported at 2 °C. These results indicate that the selection of an appropriate transportation temperature, considering the chilling sensitivity of ‘Jiro’ persimmon fruits, is very important {{to increase the number of}} marketable fruits, thereby increasing its overseas trade value. Storage at room temperature after transportation prolonged the shelf-life of fruits better than those stored at 10 °C. Using MAP was more effective at preventing quality loss of persimmon not only on the delivery day but also on the day after delivery. ‘Wase-Jiro’, which is an early-ripening type, was more sensitive to chilling than ‘Futsu-Jiro’, which is a middle-ripening type.

The purpose and scope of this model report is to document models for general and localized corrosion of the waste package outer barrier (WPOB) {{to be used in}} evaluating waste package performance. The WPOB is constructed of Alloy 22 (UNS N 06022), a highly corrosion-resistant nickel-based alloy. The inner vessel of the waste package is constructed of Stainless Steel Type 316 (UNS S 31600). Before it fails, the Alloy 22 WPOB protects the Stainless Steel Type 316 inner vessel from exposure to the external environment and any significant degradation. The Stainless Steel Type 316 inner vessel provides structural stability to the thinner Alloy 22 WPOB. Although the waste <b>package</b> <b>inner</b> vessel would also provide some performance for waste containment and potentially decrease the rate of radionuclide transport after WPOB breach before it fails, the potential performance of the inner vessel is far less than that of the more corrosion-resistant Alloy 22 WPOB.

40|$|New Zealand is the world’s third biggest {{producer}} of kiwifruit, with 94 % of the kiwifruit produced exported (NZ $ 1. 0 bn in 2014). Forced-air cooling of the produce (from the harvest temperature of about 20 °C to near storage temperature of 0 °C) immediately after harvest improves storage potential and maintains produce quality before transportation to market. The {{design of the}} kiwifruit packaging system influences the rate of cooling and temperature achieved, mainly by affecting the airflow within and throughout the package. The typical kiwifruit package contains 10. 5 kg of fruit and consists of a cardboard box and polyliner bag to prevent the loss of moisture and fruit shrivelling. Individual boxes are assembled onto pallets (10 boxes to a pallet layer, 10 layers high) Open areas or vents (in the box) facilitate cooling by allowing cool air to enter and circulate throughout the package. In forced-air cooling pallets are assembled into double rows with an aisle between the rows. Cool air is sucked through the pallets by a fan in the aisle, cooling the fruit and warming the air. The air is then either blown or ducted to the refrigeration system to be re-cooled. The polyliner keeps the local humidity high near the fruit, preventing weight loss due to evaporative cooling, but, {{as a barrier to}} direct fruit to air contact, slows the cooling rate. This project investigated the impact of operating conditions and package design on the cooling performance in such systems. A numerical model was developed (a CFD model implemented using the Fluent CFD software) that describes and predicts the temperature profiles of palletised kiwifruit packages undergoing forced-air cooling. The capability of the model to predict the fruit temperatures in each package was quantitatively validated against experimental data. The numerical model was able to predict temperature profiles within experimental error bars over 14 h of cooling. The numerical model was used to determine the operating point (in terms of pressure drop and flowrate across the pallet) to ensure rapid cooling of the produce without incurring excessive operational costs due to the power requirements. Results from both experimental work and the numerical model informed that there was an effective limit to the volumetric flowrate of 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 : flowrates in excess of the limit had no or little effective benefit. This threshold flowrate is below the typical range recommended in industry for the forced-air cooling of non-polylined horticultural produce, which is 0. 5 – 2. 0 L kg- 1 s- 1. The numerical model demonstrated that the overall cooling performance (cooling rate, uniformity, power consumption and pallet throughput per week) can be improved by controlling the airflow distribution between the fastest and slowest cooling kiwifruit packages. An alternative design that channels cool air through the pallet towards the slowest cooling packages, located {{at the back of the}} pallet, by using two package designs in the same pallet, was presented. At 0. 243 L kg- 1 s- 1 it was found that the pressure drop and power required to achieve equivalent cooling rates with the new design was reduced (by 24 % each) compared to the conventional design. Additionally, at the half-cooling time the cooling uniformity was improved by 19 %. The key features of the new design can be expected to be applicable for the cooling of horticultural produce involving an <b>inner</b> <b>packaging</b> liner...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the fabrication of a wireless, passive sensor {{based on an}} inductive-capacitive resonant circuit, and its application for in situ monitoring {{of the quality of}} dry, packaged food such as cereals, and fried and baked snacks. The sensor is made of a planar inductor and capacitor printed on a paper substrate. To monitor food quality, the sensor is embedded inside the food package by adhering it to the <b>package’s</b> <b>inner</b> wall; its response is remotely detected through a coil connected to a sensor reader. As food quality degrades due to increasing humidity inside the package, the paper substrate absorbs water vapor, changing the capacitor’s capacitance and the sensor’s resonant frequency. Therefore, the taste quality of the packaged food can be indirectly determined by measuring the change in the sensor’s resonant frequency. The novelty of this sensor technology is its wireless and passive nature, which allows in situ determination of food quality. In addition, the simple fabrication process and inexpensive sensor material ensure a low sensor cost, thus making this technology economically viable...|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{possibility}} of packing the B ration in units of ten was suggested early in the Second World War, progress on such an arrangement did not begin until 1943 when the Mountain ration, Jungle ration, and 5-in-1 rations were discontinued. The success of the British [...] "compo" [...] or 14-in-1 ration during the North African campaign in 1942 and the movement to classify field rations into four categories added incentive for development of the 10-in-1 ration. [...] A guide to its rapid development was furnished in the following 1943 definition:"A small-group field ration be composed of components of the standard field ration type B (modified to reduce bulk and weight) packed in basic packages of five complete rations each[...] [...] [...] The <b>inner</b> and outer <b>packages</b> are to be proof against water, vapor, moisture, and chemical agents.

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{certifies}} {{several types}} of radioactive waste packages and verifies that the package designers have shown {{that there will be}} no significant chemical, galvanic, or other reactions among the package components and contents, in accordance with Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 71. 43 (d). For a transportation package containing substances that could generate hydrogen gas, the package designer should calculate the gas generation rate and ensure that it is limited to a molar quantity of no more than 5 percent by volume in the package over a 60 -day shipping period under standard temperature and pressure conditions. In addition, the maximum normal operating pressure (MNOP) of the containment vessel should be designed below the design pressure. Therefore, the MNOP calculations should include the hydrogen gas generated in the payload and released into the <b>inner</b> cavity. <b>Package</b> designers have used various approaches to estimate hydrogen gas generation and demonstrate compliance with the regulatory limits. Because it may be difficult to directly measure the hydrogen gas concentrations during transportation operations, it is important that designers use consistent and reliable methods to evaluate hydrogen gas generation. This paper presents a generic evaluation approach for estimating hydrogen generation from radiolysis and thermal decomposition in generic transportation packages. It also presents the calculation of associated MNOP induced by the potential combined effects of radiolysis, thermal decomposition, thermal expansion, and water vapor. In addition, this paper discusses a generic inerting process commonly used to control combustible gases during the normal conditions of transport. A fictitious data set is used to illustrate the evaluation approach. Keywords: hydrogen generation, decay heat, radiolysis, thermal expansion, thermal decomposition, maximum normal operating pressure (MNOP), and inerting...|$|R
40|$|Present coastal systems {{along the}} east Texas coast evolved during the past 3. 5 ky of {{relative}} sea-level stillstand following a rapid sea-level rise 4 ka. Closure of proto-Galveston Bay, caused by spit accretion of Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula, formed Bolivar Roads approximately 3. 3 ka. Increased tidal prism and entrenchment over the Trinity River incised valley led to inlet stabilization and intensification of tidal influence. The present shoreface and <b>inner</b> shelf <b>package</b> {{is characterized by a}} paucity of storm deposits. Strong along-shelf storm currents, low sediment supply, and low effective accommodation space in the region are unfavorable for the preservation of storm beds. Higher sand supply during the early establishment of the present coastal lithosomes resulted in a greater occurrence of storm beds lower in the section. Amalgamated storm deposits on the east Texas shelf are associated with reworked coastal lithosomes. Pods of tidal-inlet, tidal-inlet/spit, and tidal-delta deposits mark previous shoreline positions on the continental shelf. Their distribution mimics the along-strike variation of the present coastal systems, defines six relative sea-level stillstands, including the present, during the past 10. 2 ky, and supports the model of a step-like sea-level rise. The seismic architecture of pre- 8 ka coastal lithosomes provide evidence for greater tidal influence, greater accommodation space, and higher sedimentation rates compared to the present. The preserved coastal lithosomes indicate that the depth of shoreface ravinement decreases with decreasing shelf gradient, increasing rates of sea-level rise, and increasing sediment supply. Better preservation within incised valleys results from greater accommodation space and the soft valley-fill that allows incision of the inlets beyond the depth of shoreface ravinement. The mechanism of shoreline translation (discontinuous erosional shoreface retreat, transgressive submergence, or in-place drowning), is a function mainly of shelf gradient and rate of sea-level rise. Gentle shelf gradient and rapid sea-level rise favor transgressive submergence. In regions with steep shelf gradient, aggradation may produce stratigraphic signatures consistent with in-place drowning and discontinuous erosional shoreface retreat...|$|R
40|$|The Hatton Bank margin, {{flanking}} the Iceland Basin, {{is an example}} of a volcanic rifted margin and has been studied to examine the along margin tectono-magmatic variability. Integration of 5660 km of new seismic reflection profiles with > 60, 000 km 2 of new multibeam bathymetry has allowed the margin to be divided into three segments, each of which are flanked by oceanic crust. The southernmost segment is characterised by a series of inner and outer seaward dipping reflector (SDR) packages, which are separated by an “Outer High” feature. The outer SDRs are truncated by Endymion Spur, a chain of steep sided, volcanic cones connected by narrow septa or necks. The central segment has no <b>Inner</b> SDR <b>package</b> and is characterised by the presence of a continental block, the Hatton Bank Block (HBB). The northern segment is adjacent to Lousy Bank, with a wider region of SDRs recognised than to the south, and characterised by many volcanic cones. The variations in the distribution of the SDRs along the margin, the presence of the HBB and Endymion Spur all suggest that the break-up process was not a uniform smooth process along-strike. Structural segmentation controlled the variations along the margin with break-up initiated in the south, producing the SDR packages. The HBB prompted the focus of break-up to relocate outboard of the block. The northern segment was closest to the Iceland “hot-spot”, and regular seafloor spreading did not become established until Chron 21. Shortly after break-up, the eruption of Endymion Spur occurred and may have been triggered by the passage of a pulse of hot asthenospheric material along the margin. The margin segmentation pattern we describe controlled the location of the enhanced volcanism along the Endymion Spur to the southern sector. In addition the segmentation has influenced the break-up style (presence or absence of SDR) and also the location and nature of post break-up volcanism...|$|R
