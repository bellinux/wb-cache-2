5|$|In the second, the Soviets {{started with}} a quick goal by Shadrin after 21 seconds. The last ten minutes saw two goals from the Soviets: Yakushev scoring his seventh of the series {{followed}} by Vasiliev on the power play to put the Soviets ahead 5–3 after two periods. White had countered for Canada midway through the period. It was one of few moments for Canada to cheer as the Soviets played an excellent period. The other was a goal-saving play by Esposito who stopped a shot by Yury Blinov who had faked goaltender Dryden out of position and had an empty net to shoot at. Blinov was denied by Esposito who stopped the puck with his stick on the goal line. Blinov and the crowd had prematurely celebrated the apparent goal, and Blinov shook his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief.</b>|$|E

He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, he shook his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief,</b> still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
500|$|With {{the score}} 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death {{threw the ball}} to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday {{standing}} near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief.</b> [...] "I'll never forget it", Thomas recalled. [...] "It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn't gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen." [...] Reading {{went on to win the}} game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, [...] "Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week." ...|$|E

For those shaking their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief</b> over the mogul/reality TV star's new-found career in politics, however, just soaking in Depp's mannerisms and dead-on impersonation, along with the various celebrity cameos, will probably be compensation enough." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ronaldo {{was at his}} {{physical}} peak at Barcelona, {{and many of his}} 47 goals involved him rounding the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net. Probably his most memorable goal was scored at SD Compostela on 11 October 1996. Having received the ball inside his own half, he evaded a cynical tackle of the first opponent with a drag back, before running away from another and ran towards goal where he went past two more defenders in the box with close ball control, and then slotted the ball into the bottom corner of the net. The camera then cut to Barcelona manager Bobby Robson who had got up off the bench and clasped his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief</b> at what he had seen. The footage of the goal was later used in a Nike advert with a voiceover asking: [...] "Imagine you asked God to be {{the best player in the}} world, and he listened to you". The day after the goal, the headline in the Spanish newspaper AS read: 'Pele returns'. Such was the manner Ronaldo ran through opposing defences, former Real Madrid forward Jorge Valdano commented; [...] "he's not a man, he's a herd". At the end of 1996, aged 20, Ronaldo became the youngest player to win FIFA World Player of the Year.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988–89, Australia lost {{again to}} the West Indies, and Border's form suffered; the West Indies {{routinely}} applied a tactic of targeting the opposition captain when he batted, thus undermining his confidence {{and that of the}} team. It worked to the extent that Border compiled 258 runs at 32.25 and his best performance was with the ball. He celebrated becoming the first Australian to play 100 Tests by taking 7/46 and 4/50, backed with an innings of 75, in Australia's only victory for the series, in the Fourth Test at Sydney. His bowling figures are the best for a match (and second best for an innings) by an Australian captain. Previously, he had taken 16 wickets in 99 Tests. Receiving the player of the match award, Border said, [...] "there will be batsmen all around the world shaking their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief</b> when they see the result".|$|R
25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} the exhausting {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief,</b> because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|R

50|$|Among the six total {{levels in}} the game, there are three {{platforming}} levels as well as three two-dimensional scrolling shooter stages. In both types, the concept remains the same; collect diet drinks, attack/avoid enemies, and finish within the time limit. The 7th level contains the confrontation with Ginji, and is a behind-view shooting stage. At {{the conclusion of the}} game, Penta and Penko fly to a tropical island and everything initially appears to be idyllic. In a surprise move, very uncharacteristic for an NES game, Penko reveals herself to actually be very overweight and Penta slaps his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>disbelief.</b> Penko then proceeds to start binge eating. The game also has a second run that repeats the stages, and really ends the game.|$|E

Ginebra lost Robert Jaworski via a busted lip midway in the second quarter on account of a wayward elbow from Moore that forced him to rush to the emergency room of the nearby Medical City in Pasig. Given up for lost, the Philippine team ran roughshod against the Gins minus their leader. When Jaworski came back to the coliseum with less than 8 minutes left in the 4th canto, the crowd erupted seeing the Big J with a bandage on his upper lip. The Big J entered the game, his team behind 15 points. The crowd was already in a frenzy by then, and every Ginebra shot was punctuated by heavy cheering matched only by every NCC missed shot.
