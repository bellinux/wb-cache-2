5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen <b>detonation</b> parameters, such as critical <b>detonation</b> pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E

50|$|Subsequently, the W33 nuclear {{artillery}} shell was test fired twice (not in a gun) during its development (shots Nougat/Aardvark and Plumbbob/Laplace). These four <b>detonations</b> {{are the only}} identified gun-type bomb <b>detonations.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Nevada Test Site was {{the primary}} testing {{location}} of American nuclear devices from 1951 to 1992; 928 announced nuclear tests occurred there. Of those, 828 were underground. (Sixty-two of the underground tests included multiple, simultaneous nuclear <b>detonations,</b> adding 93 <b>detonations</b> and bringing {{the total number of}} NTS nuclear <b>detonations</b> to 1,021, of which 921 were underground.) The site is covered with subsidence craters from the testing.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} theory of weakly {{nonlinear}} multi-dimensional self sustained <b>detonations</b> based on asymptotic analysis of the reactive compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that these equations {{can be reduced to}} a model consisting of a forced, unsteady, small disturbance, transonic equation and a rate equation for the heat release. In one spatial dimension, the model simplifies to a forced Burgers equation. Through analysis, numerical calculations and comparison with the reactive Euler equations, the model is demonstrated to capture such essential dynamical characteristics of <b>detonations</b> as the steady-state structure, the linear stability spectrum, the period-doubling sequence of bifurcations and chaos in one-dimensional <b>detonations</b> and cellular structures in multi- dimensional <b>detonations...</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the dying}} {{stages of the}} conflict, FRELIMO was {{provided}} with a few SA-7 MANPAD shoulder-launched missile launchers from China; these were never used to shoot down a Portuguese plane. Only one Portuguese aircraft was lost in combat during the conflict, when Lt. Emilio Lourenço's G.91R-4 was destroyed by premature <b>detonation</b> of his own ordnance.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{claims of}} diamond {{synthesis}} were documented between 1879 and 1928; {{most of those}} attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as <b>detonation</b> synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a <b>detonation</b> of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.|$|E
50|$|Sympathetic <b>detonations</b> {{may occur}} in munitions stored in e.g. vehicles, ships, gun mounts, or storage depots, by a {{sufficiently}} close explosion of a projectile or a bomb. Such <b>detonations</b> {{after receiving a}} hit caused many catastrophic losses.|$|R

25|$|Yucca Flat saw 739 nuclear tests, {{including}} 827 separate <b>detonations.</b> The {{higher number}} of <b>detonations</b> is from single tests that included multiple nuclear explosions occurring within a 0.1 second time window and inside a 2km diameter circle. 62 such tests took place at NTS.|$|R
5|$|On 24 January 1961, a B-52G {{broke up}} in midair and crashed after {{suffering}} a severe fuel loss, near Goldsboro, North Carolina, dropping two nuclear bombs in the process without <b>detonation.</b> 3 of the 8 crew members were killed.|$|E
5|$|On 27 March 1916, {{following}} an artillery bombardment, {{combined with the}} <b>detonation</b> of mines beneath the German trenches, the British 5th Corps attacked the St Eloi salient. On the night of 3–4 April, the Canadian Corps relieved the British, with the 6th Canadian Brigade taking up positions {{in front of the}} craters created by the detonations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>detonation</b> was {{initially}} planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because {{of rain and}} lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature <b>detonation.</b> A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems. The shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E

40|$|<b>Detonations</b> were {{experienced}} in the Space Shuttle Main Engine fuel preburner (FPB) augmented spark igniter (ASI) during engine cutoff. Several of these resulted in over pressures sufficient to damage the FPB ASI oxidizer system. The <b>detonations</b> initiated in the FPB ASI oxidizer line when residual oxidizer (oxygen) in the line mixed with backflowing fuel (hydrogen) and detonated. This paper reviews the damage history to the FPB ASI oxidizer system, an engineering assessment of the problem cause, a verification of the mechanisms, the hazards associated with the <b>detonations,</b> and the solution implemented...|$|R
5|$|Type Ia supernovae, {{that involve}} helium {{accretion}} {{by a white}} dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation {{of this type of}} stellar remnant. In this scenario, the carbon <b>detonation</b> produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric explosion that kicks the star, often known as a zombie star, to high speeds of a hypervelocity star. The matter processed in the failed <b>detonation</b> is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where it accumulates. These iron-core white dwarfs would be smaller than the carbon-oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the <b>detonation</b> point.|$|E

40|$|The water {{mitigation}} {{effects on}} the <b>detonations</b> of explosive in a confined cube chamber are studied by use of a numerical code. Significant mitigation effects on shock pressure at various loading densities, various water/explosive mass ratios and various air gaps are obtained. Reduction of final static pressure is also obtained because water absorbs the energy released from the <b>detonations</b> through being compressed and vaporized. On {{the basis of this}} study, the <b>detonations</b> in a tunnel system with vent are further simulated. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data, and the water mitigation effects on shock pressure are verified...|$|R
5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of <b>detonation,</b> using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E

On 23 May, entering Dunkirk harbor with a demolition team aboard, Jaguar was struck by a torpedo fired by either the E-boat S-21 or S-23. The <b>detonation</b> killed 13 men and wounded 23; the ship had to be beached at Malo-les-Bains lest she sink, and was written off.|$|E

5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the <b>detonation</b> waves in a thermonuclear <b>detonation,</b> {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E
