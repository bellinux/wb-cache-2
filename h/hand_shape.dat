5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, they are called suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as <b>hand</b> <b>shape,</b> orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language {{seems to be that}} of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) <b>hand</b> <b>shape,</b> orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
25|$|The {{orientation}} of the palm is indicated by filling in the glyph for the <b>hand</b> <b>shape.</b> A hollow outline (white) glyph indicates that one is facing the palm of the hand, a filled (black) glyph indicates that one is facing {{the back of the}} hand, and split shading indicates that one is seeing the hand from the side. Although in reality the wrist may turn to intermediate positions, only the four orientations of palm, back, and either side are represented in SignWriting, as they are enough to represent sign languages.|$|E

25|$|The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key {{function of}} replicating the HCV’s viral RNA {{by using the}} viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined {{based on the same}} consensus sequence BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right <b>hand</b> <b>shape</b> with fingers, palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an aspectual frame is the unrealized inceptive aspect ('just about to X'), {{illustrated}} here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward {{to point out the}} recipient of the telling. 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features from the frame (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching her breath during the final hold. The <b>hand</b> <b>shape</b> throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of gestural application can vary a lot: {{from a simple}} pointing mechanism to a visual sign language. Application of gestural interaction as a sign language with a proper formalism {{to interact with the}} technology has not been studied much. In this work, we present our Kinect-based gesture recognition system that is able to recognize personalized <b>hand</b> <b>shapes</b> and dynamic <b>hand</b> movements. We then describe how we created a “language” for smart-home control based on a specific syntax over sequences of <b>hand</b> <b>shapes</b> and <b>hand</b> movements...|$|R

2500|$|The two systems, {{arbitrary}} and descriptive, are sometimes combined, usually for humorous purposes. [...] For example, U.S. President Richard Nixon may be signed by signing [...] "to lie" [...] with his initial, N, as the <b>hand</b> <b>shape,</b> effectively meaning [...] "Nixon the Liar". [...] Hearing people learning ASL are also often assigned combined name signs. [...] This is not traditional for Deaf people.|$|E
2500|$|This <b>hand</b> <b>shape</b> is {{also used}} {{in a number of}} signs in many sign languages, {{including}} (in American Sign Language) [...] "to look" [...] (with the palm down) or [...] "to see" [...] (palm up). When the pointer and middle fingers are pointed at the signer's eyes then turned and the pointer finger is pointed at someone it means [...] "I am watching you." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{constraints}} on arbitrary signs. [...] First, {{it should not}} mean anything. [...] That is, it should not duplicate an existing ASL word. [...] Second, {{there should not be}} more than one person with the name sign in the local community. [...] If a person moves to a new community where someone already has their name sign, then the newcomer is obligated to modify theirs. [...] This is usually accomplished by compounding the <b>hand</b> <b>shape,</b> so that the first tap of the sign takes the initial of the person's first English name, and the second tap takes the initial of their last name. [...] There are potentially thousands of such compound-initial signs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain new insights into the processes underlying gestural communication in adults by examining <b>hand</b> <b>shapes</b> and <b>hand</b> preference patterns associated with different types of gestures. Several communicative situations eliciting pointing gestures and symbolic gestures were presented to 81 participants in an experimental context. Results have highlighted some differences in <b>hand</b> <b>shapes</b> depending on the function of pointing: contrary to results reported in children, the proportion of index-finger gestures was higher in imperative situations than in declarative situations. The distance between the gesturer and the referent was also found to influence <b>hand</b> <b>shapes,</b> proximal pointing being more frequently associated with index-finger gestures than distal pointing. The comparison of hand preferences revealed a greater right-sided asymmetry for declarative pointing than for non-communicative activities, whereas there was no difference between imperative pointing and non-communicative activities, or between symbolic gestures and non-communicative activities. The present study thus sheds some light on the features and the roles of communicative gestures in adults. Results are discussed in relation to the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of communication...|$|R

2500|$|The {{majority}} of people, probably well {{in excess of}} 90%, have arbitrary name signs. [...] These are initialized signs: [...] The <b>hand</b> <b>shape</b> is the initial {{of one of the}} English names of the person, usually the first. [...] The sign may occur in neutral space, with a tremble; with a double-tap (as a noun) at one of a limited number of specific locations, such as the side of the chin, the temple, or the elbow; or moving across a location or between two locations, with a single tap at each. [...] Single-location signs are simpler in connotation, like English [...] "Vee"; double-location signs are fancier, like English [...] "Veronica". [...] Sam Supalla (1992) collected 525 simple arbitrary name signs like these.|$|E
2500|$|Sutton orders {{signs in}} ten {{groups based on}} which fingers are {{extended}} on the dominant hand. These are equivalent to the numerals one through ten in ASL. Each group is then subdivided according to the actual <b>hand</b> <b>shape,</b> and then subdivided again according to the plane the hand is in (vertical, then horizontal), then again according to the basic orientation of the hand (palm, side, back). [...] An ordering system has been proposed using this beginning and examples from both American Sign Language and Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS). The current system of ordering for SignWriting is called the Sign Symbol Sequence which is parsed by the creator of each sign as recorded into the on-line dictionary. [...] This system allows for internal ordering by features including handshape, orientation, speed, location, and other clustered features not found in spoken dictionaries.|$|E

30|$|Participants’ {{gestures}} {{were categorized}} in two ways. Gestures {{were coded as}} imitated when the <b>hand</b> <b>shapes</b> {{were the same as}} the viewed gestures or invented when the <b>hand</b> <b>shapes</b> differed. The semantic content of the gestures was coded as action or structure depending on the properties of the engine they exemplified. Action gestures showed the action of a part or a process of a system. They were frequently schematic, showing only the direction of the action. Structure gestures showed the position or structure of a part, for example, showing the contour of a part or pointing to relative position of a part. Blends, where a gesture carried both action and structure information, were coded as an action gesture. Blends were always invented gestures.|$|R

40|$|In {{designing}} hand tools, {{especially about}} shape and layout, {{there are two}} essential points: consideration of various <b>hand</b> <b>shapes,</b> experience of touching and manipulating products directly. To get evaluations based on various <b>hand</b> <b>shapes,</b> it needs many test subjects and much time. Computer manikin addresses this problem, and the technology about generating various <b>hand</b> <b>shapes,</b> modeling of the human hand has been developed. However, this method cannot give touching products directly. So we have been exploring the system that provides experiencing different-shape hand (Fig. 1). For analogous-shape hands, we have developed the system gives feeling {{that the size of}} my own hand has been changed. It is composed of optical system (Fig. 2) and analogous objects (Fig. 3), makes visual change of only hand size. The feeling can be made by a difference between touch experiences in this system and predictions. For various-shape hands, it is necessary to consider the effect of visual delay on the feeling, which is inevitable accompaniment to VR devices. “Sense of agency ” and “sense of ownership” are essential for fundamental functions of hand: manipulation and perception of objects. These senses are affected by visual delay. We investigated the allowable visual delay about different-sized hand experience in which these senses can be felt by using the system shown in Fig. 4, and concluded it to be 100 [ms]...|$|R
