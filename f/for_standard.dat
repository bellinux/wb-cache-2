Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which would be used for the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> gauge.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E

5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E

5|$|In 1853, chemist Charles Frédéric Gerhardt treated acetyl {{chloride}} with sodium salicylate to produce acetylsalicylic acid {{for the first}} time; {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.|$|E

He was {{a major player in the}} development of the centrifuge isotope separation, which is now the most commonly used way of uranium enrichment.He became an advisor <b>for</b> <b>Standard</b> Oil and worked towards the possibility of the nuclear energy. Cohen later started his work with General Electric Company and created the Reactor Safety Committee there.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E

5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. <b>For</b> <b>standard</b> substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before <b>for</b> <b>standard</b> gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E

His company, which was later absorbed by Magnolia Petroleum Company and then acquired by Standard Oil of New York, {{built the first}} modern refinery west of the Mississippi River. Following the strike at Spindletop, Cullinan partnered with Arnold Schlaet to form the Texas Fuel Company in Beaumont with funding from an investment group run by former Texas governor James S. Hogg and other investors. In 1905, as the new company rapidly expanded its operations, it moved its corporate headquarters to Houston. The company's strength {{in the oil industry}} established Houston as the center of the industry in Texas. The company was later absorbed into the Texas Company and then renamed Texaco.|$|E
