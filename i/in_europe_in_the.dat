5|$|Evaluating Mountfort's works today, one has {{to avoid}} judging them against a {{background}} of similar designs <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1860s, New Zealand was a developing country, where materials and resources freely available in Europe were conspicuous by their absence. When available they were often of inferior quality, as Mountfort discovered with the unseasoned wood in his first disastrous project. His first buildings in his new homeland were often too tall, or steeply pitched, failing to take account of the non-European climate and landscape. However, he soon adapted, and developed his skill in working with crude and unrefined materials.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E

5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E
5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain {{an important part of}} horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.|$|E

5|$|In 1834, in British Guiana, a German physician, Carl Warburg, invented an {{antipyretic}} medicine: 'Warburg's Tincture'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine {{and other}} herbs.

The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in India and other colonies.|$|E

5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the shallows, while others swim or relax on the beach.

Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E
5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, having {{to make do with}} ordinary summer uniforms, but in the winter of 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive.

5|$|An Orthodox monastery grew {{around the}} church near Elbasan, {{and became the}} center of veneration of Saint Jovan Vladimir, which was limited to an area around the monastery. In {{the latter half of the}} 15th century, the {{territory}} of present-day Albania was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, in which Islam was the privileged religion. After losing the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Ottomans went on the defensive <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> climate of revival of Christianity in the Ottoman Empire, a hagiography of the saint and a service to him were written in Greek in 1690 at the monastery. It stood under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, which became a notable spiritual and artistic force during the leadership of Archbishop Joasaph from 1719 to 1745. In this period, the veneration of Saint Jovan Vladimir was promoted in southern Albania and western Macedonia, as well as beyond the archbishopric, in Bulgaria and among the Serbs in the Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Henry had a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take {{the moral high ground}} in respect to Henry, capitalising on his reputation as a crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.|$|E
5|$|However Butlin did {{not remain}} celebrating for long; he {{required}} a further $2.25 million (2011:£) {{to complete the}} camp, and {{to make matters worse}} American tourists were not used to the holiday camp mentality so the venture held little interest. In an attempt to save the camp, Butlin sold the hotel leases to an American firm. By November 1950, the subsidiary company handling the Caribbean resort was ordered to be wound up by a court. Butlin admitted defeat and focused his efforts back <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 1940s Butlin had successfully opened hotels outside the Skegness and Ayr camps, so he now saw his opportunity to expand into this market. Butlin began acquiring hotels in Saltdean, Blackpool and Cliftonville.|$|E
