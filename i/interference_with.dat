5|$|One of {{the main}} causes for the {{pathology}} of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin. Lead also inhibits the enzyme ferrochelatase, another enzyme involved in the formation of heme. Ferrochelatase catalyzes the joining of protoporphyrin and Fe2+ to form heme. Lead's <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> heme synthesis results in production of zinc protoporphyrin and the development of anemia. Another effect of lead's <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> heme synthesis is the buildup of heme precursors, such as aminolevulinic acid, which may be directly or indirectly harmful to neurons.|$|E

5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually have a negative charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E

The complaint alleged Apple's acts in favoring its own stores constituted breach of contract, false advertising, fraud, trade libel, defamation, and intentional <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> prospective economic advantage. , Apple reached settlements with all of the plaintiffs, including the bankruptcy trustee for one reseller that failed, while the former principal of that company appealed the bankruptcy court's approval of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Nine Inch Nails was {{involved}} in a much-publicized feud with TVT Records, the first record label to sign the band. Reznor objected to the label's attempted <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> his intellectual property. Ultimately, they entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own Nothing Records imprint. In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims. Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of {{berkelium}} on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles, neutrons, or both for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126keV) hinders its detection, due to signal <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory.|$|E

Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may last from two to four months.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a No Disqualification {{match between}} Abyss, who was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell, and Sabu next. Its duration was 11 minutes and 30 seconds.

In a No Disqualification match, weapons are legal, as well as outside <b>interference,</b> <b>with</b> a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. In the final minutes, Abyss retrieved a bag of thumbtacks which were hidden under the ring.

5|$|The Rhodes Mk III EK-10 was a {{combination}} electric piano and synthesizer instrument, introduced in 1980 before CBS bought ARP Instruments in 1981.

The instrument was unreliable with a problematic production, particularly when a shipment of 150 units to Japan caused <b>interference</b> <b>with</b> local television reception. Compared to the new polyphonic synthesizers being marketed at the same time, it was limited in scope and sound, and very few units were sold.|$|E

Abyss slammed Sabu into a pile of thumbtacks to earn a two-count during the match. Near the end, Sabu tried to hit Abyss with a steal chair wrapped in barbed-wire, but Abyss countered the maneuver. This led to Abyss slamming Sabu back-first onto the barbed-wire wrapped steal chair with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver to win the encounter at 10 minutes and 48 seconds.|$|E
