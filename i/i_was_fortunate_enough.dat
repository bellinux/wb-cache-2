I didn't do anything for a year. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> that I could buy my children a hot lunch. Then, I decided I wanted to work again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blasko had {{released}} and promoted her material independently, with financial assistance from her then-manager, Craig New. She explained [...] " [...] {{starting to get}} my head around computer home recording ... I decided to put out my own EP independently. Most of it was recorded at home. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to have JJJ pick up {{on one of the}} tracks almost immediately". Blasko signed to Brisbane-based label, Dew Process, which repackaged and re-released Prelusive in March 2003.

60|$|IN {{three days}} more, Jeanne was safe in London; having {{traveled}} under my escort. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> {{to find a}} home for her, {{in the house of}} a lady who had been my mother's oldest and dearest friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "The fault was mine," [...] he interposed, [...] "altogether mine. In an ungovernable fit of shyness, I {{took refuge}} {{with the only}} person except yourself, Lady Meltoun, whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to know. I simply refused to come away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I rejoice to hear it,' said Sir John. 'Commend me to {{them when}} you return, and say that <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to convey, myself, the salute which I entrust you to deliver.

6000|$|... "Very bad indeed. In fact I {{consider}} you extremely dangerous, and {{if anything}} happens to our good Duchess we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible. But I should {{like to talk to you}} about life. The generation into which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born was tedious. Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley, and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to possess." ...|$|R
60|$|It chanced {{that the}} Setons were far enough {{along with their}} {{building}} to announce a House Warming, and on New Year's Day, Zulime and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> included {{in the list of}} their guests. On the Saturday train we found Lloyd Osbourne, Richard Le Gallienne and several others whom we knew and on arrival at the new house on its rocky ledge above the lake, we found that the party also included Mary Fanton, Carl Lumholz, Emery Pottle and Gertrude Lynch.|$|R

60|$|But there Nature, {{with the}} aid of Art, has done that for herself. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to engage a very {{superior}} German artist; and hope to renew my acquaintance with this and many other Levantine scenes, by the arrival of his performances.|$|E

6000|$|... "Good Heavens, no! {{we are not}} in {{love with}} one another. Can you believe that I would marry for such a {{frivolous}} reason? No. The subject turned up accidentally, and the advantage of a match between us struck me forcibly. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to convert her to my opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Half an {{hour before}} the sun sank, I started. No {{horsemen}} were in sight, and if any were to come along, I could see them long before they could notice me.

40|$|As a {{contributor}} to the IMS (2004) AccessForAll work and co-editor of its development in ISO (2005 a, b, c), I find it pleasing to see our work being implemented and enlightening {{to see some of the}} ways that ideas one has worked on are interpreted, and discover these are not always ways that <b>were</b> intended.

60|$|Here I {{filled the}} large saddlebags made of {{buckskin}} with tins of beef, {{a couple more}} bottles of beer and a packet of tandstickor matches which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to find.

6000|$|This conveyance, the box {{of which}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to secure, had come down to meet us at the {{railroad}} station, and was as muddy and cumbersome as usual.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> {{to find a}} {{disengaged}} omnibus, {{and filled}} it with our rugs and smaller belongings. Then {{we made our way}} slowly back to the little space prepared for the reception of the heavier baggage, and around which a barrier had already been erected. There was a slight nervousness in my companion's manner which made conversation difficult. I, too, could not help feeling that the situation was a difficult one for her.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{the work}} of Samuel Haughton, {{commentators}} Frederick Charles Cook and Josh McDowell argued that the death of Jesus in the Gospels {{could not have been}} fabricated, as the text displays medical knowledge not available at the time. Haughton wrote that the description in the Gospel of John of the flowing of [...] "blood and water" [...] after the soldier pierced Jesus' side with a spear was prescient: [...] "... With the foregoing cases most anatomists who have devoted their attention to this subject are familiar; but the two following cases, although readily explicable on physiological principles, are not recorded in the books (except by St. John). Nor have <b>I</b> <b>been</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to meet with them." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{later life}} (alas!) the Hymn has been succeeded by sad and bitter meditations; {{and the sweet}} sleep has been but ill {{exchanged}} for the broken slumbers which haunt the uneasy pillow of care. On the other hand, I have continued to fold my clothes, and to keep my little diary. The former habit links me to my happy childhood--before papa was ruined. The latter habit--hitherto mainly useful in helping me to discipline the fallen nature which we all inherit from Adam--has unexpectedly proved important to my humble interests in quite another way. It has enabled poor Me to serve the caprice of a wealthy {{member of the family}} into which my late uncle married. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> useful to Mr. Franklin Blake.|$|R
50|$|Winning the Pulitzer {{has meant}} {{nothing for the}} piece that won. Back when Blomstedt was at the San Francisco Symphony, David Zinman {{conducted}} it and did a beautiful job. But they never did it again and nobody else has ever played it. It’s a very difficult piece. I write chromatic music and chromatic music is not in vogue at the moment. I think that has not helped things.The Prize has benefited me in other ways, however. You {{get a lot of}} notoriety out of it. My commissions have soared and everything I have written since that time has <b>been</b> published. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> to have some of the best musicians in the world playing my chamber music, which has led to a CD that has just come out.|$|R
