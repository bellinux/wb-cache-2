25|$|A {{hydraulic}} power network {{is a system}} of interconnected pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit mechanical power from a power source, like a pump, to hydraulic equipment like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> networks are still in use; modern hydraulic equipment has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|E

40|$|Up to now, {{several types}} of hybrid systems have been {{developed}} to deduce energy consumption. Switching type closed loop constant pressure system (SCL-CPS) was proposed as one of feasible hybrid systems.

40|$|Virtual {{prototyping}} (VP) {{of complex}} machines requires the realistic representation of components to perform robust analyses and simulations. In many cases, machines are an assembly of rigid and flexible components. Although modern three-dimensional CAD {{systems can be}} considered powerful tools for modelling solids or surfaces representing rigid bodies, they are not adequate to model soft material components, especially a realistic visualisation of physical behaviour. This drawback motivated the present research work. In particular, this paper describes an approach and the related knowledge-based software system (FlexSim) developed to create virtual prototypes facilitating product development in cases of flexible parts like cables, pipes and wires. The resulting VP tool integrates the CAD technology and the dedicated structural simulation methods to automatically model and validate three-dimensional functional sub-groups having flexible parts. The system application is shown on metallic reinforced elastomer hoses used for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmissions.</b> For this purpose, a finite-element approach has been implemented to find hose configurations for given boundary conditions determined by mounting positions. Pipe fittings are selected and automatically assembled and the optimal hose length and its ideal spatial disposition are calculated. Simulations of behaviour allow the rapid optimisation of a solution. The system has been tested on agricultural harvest machines and mining equipment, which widely employ hydraulic transmissions for moving groups of components. As a result, the number of physical prototypes, the lead-time due to the trial-and-error activities and the product development costs can be significantly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{minimally}} invasive surgery techniques has steadily increased, {{the development of new}} tools for these procedures has stagnated. Indeed a new generation of surgical instruments, with tips that have multiple degrees of freedom, has been developed. However, they are facing so many technical problems that none have been able to establish themselves in the medical market. To overcome the problems these instruments are facing, a micro <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> system has been developed and been presented in [1].

40|$|Hydraulic Power Take Off (PTO) {{systems for}} wave energy usually {{fall into two}} broad categories. These are, firstly, {{variable}} pressure systems where control of the primary force/torque is achieved by pressure modulation, and secondly, constant pressure systems where control of the primary force/torque is achieved by valve transitions that select between discrete effort levels determined by the approximately constant accumulator pressure and alternative piston areas. Energy storage is integral to the constant pressure category while, in the purest form of the variable pressure category, it is not provided. Hybrid systems which combine elements of both categories are also possible. This paper reports {{an analysis of the}} most elementary of systems from each of these categories. The analysis uses a coupled hydrodynamic-hydraulic time domain model. The model is used to assess the effectiveness of the hydrodynamic power absorption and the efficiency of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission.</b> The results show that, in each case, the hydraulic motor performance is a critical consideration and the optimal configuration of any one system is dependent on motor selection.

40|$|A {{gearless}} hydraulic {{wind energy}} transfer system utilizes the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> principles {{to integrate the}} energy of multiple wind turbines in a central power generation location. The gearless wind power transfer technology may replace the current energy harvesting system {{to reduce the cost}} of operation and increase the reliability of wind power generation. It also allows for the integration of multiple wind turbines to one central generation unit, unlike the traditional wind power generation with dedicated generator and gearbox. A Hydraulic Transmission (HT) can transmit high power and can operate over a wide range of torque-to-speed ratios, allowing efficient transmission of intermittent wind power. The torque to speed ratios illustrates the relationship between the torque and speed of a motor (or pump) from the moment of start to when full-load torque is reached at the manufacturer recommended rated speed. ^ In this thesis, a gearless hydraulic wind energy harvesting and transfer system is mathematically modeled and verified by experimental results. The mathematical model is therefore required to consider the system dynamics and be used in control system development. Mathematical modeling also provided a method to determine the losses of the system as well as overall efficiency. The energy is harvested by a low speed-high torque wind turbine connected to a high fixed-displacement hydraulic pump, which is connected to hydraulic motors. Through mathematical modeling of the system, an enhanced understanding of the HTS through analysis was gained that lead to a highly efficient hydraulic energy transmission system. It was determined which factors significantly influenced the system operation and its efficiency more.

40|$|Pigs {{have been}} {{reported}} to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other species, including dogs. We investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = 6). Before embolization, minipigs, compared with dogs, presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; by an average of 9 mmHg), a steeper slope of Ppa-flow (Q) relationships, and higher 0 -Hz impedance (Z 0) and first-harmonic impedance (Z 1), without significant differences in characteristic impedance (Zc), and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> Embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa: 40 - 55 mmHg) was associated with increased Z 0 and Z 1 in both species, but the minipigs had a steeper slope of Ppa/Q plots and an increased Zc. At identical Q and Ppa, minipigs still presented with higher Z 1 and Zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> The energy <b>transmission</b> ratio, defined as the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the measured waves divided by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the forward waves, was better preserved after embolism in minipigs. No differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after embolism. We conclude that minipigs, compared with dogs, present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased Zc without earlier wave reflection. These differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> and, therefore, a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation.

HT’s generally have acceptable efficiency at full load and drop efficiency as the loading changes, typically having a peak around 60 %. The efficiency of a HT is dependent on several parameters including volumetric flow rate, rotational speed and torque at the pump shaft, and the pressure difference across the inlet and outlet of the hydraulic pump and motor. It has been demonstrated that using a central generation unit for a group of wind turbines and transferring the power of each turbine through hydraulic system increases the efficiency of the overall system versus one turbine to one central generation unit. The efficiency enhancement depends on the rotational speed of the hydraulic pumps. Therefore, it is proven that the multiple-turbine hydraulic power transfer system reaches higher efficiencies at lower rotational speeds. This suggests that the gearbox can be eliminated from the wind powertrains if multiple turbines are connected to the central generation unit. Computer simulations and experimental results are provided to quantify the efficiency enhancements obtained by adding the second wind turbine hydraulic pump to the system...|$|E
