25|$|In a {{semiconductor}} heterostructure, {{where a small}} bandgap {{material is}} sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound <b>excitons.</b> This is because the electron and hole which form the exciton are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller bandgap material, so the exciton is not merely pulled apart by the field.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{possibility}} of <b>exciton</b> condensation in Mott insulating bilayers. In these strongly correlated systems an <b>exciton</b> is the bound state of a double occupied and empty site. In the strong coupling limit the <b>exciton</b> acts as a hard-core boson. Its physics are captured by the <b>exciton</b> t-J model, containing an effective XXZ model describing the <b>exciton</b> dynamics only. Using numerical simulations and analytical mean field theory we constructed the ground state phase diagram. Three homogeneous phases can be distinguished: the antiferromagnet, the <b>exciton</b> checkerboard crystal and the <b>exciton</b> superfluid. For most model parameters, however, we predict macroscopic phase separation between these phases. The <b>exciton</b> superfluid exists only for large <b>exciton</b> hopping energy. Additionally we studied the collective modes and susceptibilities of the three phases. In the superfluid phase we find the striking feature that the bandwidth of the spin-triplet excitations, potentially detectable by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), {{is proportional to the}} superfluid density. The superfluid phase mode is visible in the charge susceptibility, measurable by RIXS or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Comment: 21 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

40|$|Apresentação em posterOne of the {{milestones}} in the photovoltaic {{field was}} the use of a bulk-heterojunction made of polymer/low weight molecules to increase organic solar cells efficiency. When an <b>exciton</b> is created in the polymer, it can easily be dissociated into an electron/hole pair if the <b>exciton</b> reaches the polymer/low weight molecule interface. For that happens, it is necessary an efficient <b>exciton</b> diffusion towards the interface before it decays.
