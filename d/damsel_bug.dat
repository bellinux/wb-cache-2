50|$|Other foliar-foraging predators {{that are}} present North American soybean fields that {{may play a}} role in {{suppression}} of soybean aphid populations include green lacewings (Chrysoperla spp.), brown lacewings (Hemerobius spp.), <b>damsel</b> <b>bugs</b> (Nabis spp.), big eyed bugs (Geocoris spp.), spined soldier bugs (Podisus maculiventris (Say)), hover flies (Syrphidae spp.), and the aphid midge (Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani)). Another group of predators that are present in soybean fields is ground beetles (Carabidae spp.); however, field experiments have shown limited to no impact from these predators on populations of soybean aphids due to the fact that ground beetles rarely scale soybean plants for prey. While parasitoids of the soybean aphid have a large impact on colonies in Asia—Lysiphlebia japonica (Ashmead) can have a soybean aphid parasitism rate as high as 52.6% in China—parasitoids are thought to exert only minimal pressure on soybean aphids in North America.|$|R

40|$|Nine {{insecticides}} {{were applied}} on March 10, 2004, to alfalfa {{that had been}} water stressed prior to irrigation on March 6. These actions were thought to have resulted in treatments means with less distinct differences than usually noted for these treatments at 7 - 14 days post treatment. All pyrethroid treatments as well as Lorsban® and Steward® treatments resulted in significant reductions of alfalfa weevil larvae at four days post treatment. The Trilogy® treatment {{did not result in}} acceptable control of this pest. Significant increases in adult alfalfa weevils were noted at 10 - 14 days post treatment in pyrethroid treated alfalfa, perhaps due to increased production of certain plant volatiles in response to this class of insecticides. Low numbers of blue alfalfa aphids were noted in this study partially due to insecticide control as well as numerous beneficial insects.

40|$|Two {{rates of}} the insect active {{ingredient}} zetacypermethrin (MustangMax) were evaluated for control of summer insect pests on bermudagrass, with application made about one month prior to harvest. Crop was 22 inches tall when treatments were applied and had a dense stand, which also intercepted much of the treatment. Little difference existed between the two rates of zetacypermethrin in this study. Treatments reduced planthopper numbers by slightly over 50 % for the first 9 days after application. Reduction of bermudagrass mirid populations was 45 % at two days post treatment, but numbers of this insect were numerically higher in MustangMax treated plants than in untreated plots at subsequent sample dates. Treatments also resulted in significantly lower numbers of <b>damsel</b> <b>bugs</b> and minute pirate bugs at two days post treatment, while only reducing grass thrips numbers by about 20 % through 13 days after application. Bark lice were more prevalent in the treated plots, thought due to a reduction of predatory beneficial insects. More effectiveness from this chemistry would be expected earlier in the growing season when plants are shorter, therefore allowing greater coverage and contact with insects as this chemistry is not systemic...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Relay strip-cropping {{combines}} two vegetation management tactics, under-sowing and strip-management. In {{this study}} conducted from 1994 though 1997, a cover crop seed-mixture containing oats (Avena sativa L. var. "Monida"), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), annual ryegrass (Lolium multflorum Lam.), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) was broadcast over established broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) 32 days after planting. The broccoli was planted, under-sown, and harvested in sections alternated with strips of cover crop. The cover crop relay provided tillage and pesticide refuges for beneficial insects without taking land out of broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping increased the abundance {{and diversity of}} ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones: Phalangiidae), lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and <b>damsel</b> <b>bugs</b> (Heteroptera: Nabidae) in the cropping system; however, this did not always result in increased natural enemies in the broccoli. Arthropod species varied significantly in their propensity to leave the non-crop vegetation and move into the broccoli. Movement of the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata L. from the cover crop strips into the broccoli may have depressed aphid populations in 1996. The non-crop vegetation may {{have served as a}} sink rather than a source for Nabis species and appeared to reduce their density in the broccoli growing nearby. There was no evidence that background vegetation surrounding the broccoli reduced colonization by winged aphids. The density of the cabbage flea beetle Phyllotreta crucferae Goeze was lower in the broccoli relay compared with the clean-tilled broccoli. The number of third instar imported cabbage worm Pieris rapae (L.) and cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) was reduced on broccoli leaves and harvested buds in the relay strip-cropping system compared with the clean-tilled system. The number of diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) pupae was higher in the clean-tilled broccoli; percent parasitism of the pupae was similar in the two cropping systems. Although reduction in broccoli contamination associated with relay strip-cropping was significant, the residual insect contamination was unacceptable for commercial broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping may be useful for preventing soil erosion and protecting water quality. Relay strip-cropping may be a useful component of an integrated pest management program...|$|R
40|$|To avoid capture by {{predator}}s, herbivores often deploy predator avoidance or deterrence behaviors. Chemical {{defenses of}} Colorado potato beetles (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata) have been described, but {{little is known}} about antipredator behaviors of CPB larvae in response to attack by generalist predators. We examined the behavioral responses of second, third, and fourth instar CPB larvae when contacted by predatory lady beetles (Hippodamia convergens) or damsel bugs (Nabis alternatus). Of these predators, only the <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> readily captures CPB larvae. First, in simple Petri-dish arenas we touched single CPB larvae with either a lady beetle or <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> adult attached {{to the end of a}} wooden dowel, or a bare dowel as a control. Larvae responded to predator contact by walking away, rearing up, regurgitating onto their ventral surface, wiggling their bodies, and/or defecating. The number of behavioral responses increased significantly when larvae were touched with a predator compared to a bare dowel, when larvae were in later instars, and when larvae were contacted by a <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> rather than a lady beetle. Next, we observed natural encounters between CPB larvae and predators on potato plants. We again found that fourth instar larvae were most likely to initiate antipredator behaviors, and that all larval stages reacted more intensely to damsel bugs than lady beetles. In summary, we found that CPB larvae deployed a complex suite of behaviors when accosted by generalist predators. The frequency of behavioral response varied by larval instar, and appeared to be scaled to the risk posed by the predator encountered...|$|E
40|$|When direct {{observations}} {{are used to}} study animal behavior {{the presence of the}} observer may alter the animal and hence influence the data being collected, yet few studies have quantified this effect. We conducted direct observation studies in the glasshouse to assess the relative influence of observer presence on the behavior of Pacific damsel bugs, Nabis kinbergii, a potentially important predator of crop pests. Comparisons of predator activity, predator distribution, prey (Helicoverpa armigera) mortality and prey distribution between frequently observed and minimally observed treatments, during diurnal and nocturnal observation sessions showed that the frequency of observer presence had no apparent impact on Pacific <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> behavior. This is the first documented test of the impact of observer presence in an insect system. To place our results in context, we reviewed 15 papers on the influence of observer presence in a range of animals. We established that just over half of these papers found evidence for an effect. Nevertheless, {{direct observations}} should be useful in further studies of Pacific <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> behavior, and researchers using direct observations to study the behavior of other animals should be cognizant of observer effects during design and interpretation of their study...|$|E
40|$|Eggs {{and small}} to {{medium-sized}} larvae of beet armyworm are exploited by {{a complex of}} natural enemies in hay alfalfa fields in northern California. Field studies at Davis (Yolo Co.) during 2004 revealed that predation on sentinel egg masses ranged from 50 - 90 %. The egg-predators included minute pirate bug, <b>damsel</b> <b>bug,</b> lygus bugs, big-eyed bugs, green-lacewing larvae, soft-winged flower beetle and convergent ladybird beetle. Three parasites were reared from larvae at Davis from 1999 - 2004; total parasitization ranged from 25 - 60 %. A few larvae were infected with a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV); however, no epizootic occurred from 1999 - 2004. These results suggest that natural enemies, primarily generalist predators, are largely responsible for maintaining beet-armyworm populations at relatively low levels in non-treated alfalfa fields in the region...|$|E
40|$|The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) is {{a serious}} pest of {{economically}} important crucifer crops such as cabbage. The moth has developed resistance to all tested insecticides and further studies on the potential role of factors affecting P. xylostella survival, including natural enemies, are urgently needed. One aim of this thesis was to identify the species that are natural enemies of P. xylostella and to evaluate {{their role in the}} natural biological control of this pest insect. Another aim was to gain knowledge {{that could be used to}} develop biological pest control methods with the potential for high efficacy against P. xylostella, thus avoiding the side effects of traditional chemical control while maintaining production and profits. This study was carried out in Estelí, Nicaragua during five cropping seasons, from 2006 to 2008. The results indicate that there is a broad spectrum of predators present in habitats within and around cabbage fields, and that these have the capacity to feed on P. xylostella eggs and larvae under laboratory conditions. The predators with the highest consumption rates were insect larvae (Syrphidae) and spiders in the families Linyphiidae and Salticidae. The most abundant predators, which also had the highest consumption rate and consequently the highest potential for suppressing P. xylostella populations, were spiders (Lycosidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), although sheet weaving spiders, jumping spiders, assassin <b>bugs</b> (Reduviidae) and <b>damsel</b> <b>bugs</b> (Nabidae) may also be important. It is concluded that these generalist predators should be considered for further study in the field as candidate species with a role in the management of the pest P. xylostella. An exclusion experiment in the field showed that flying and ground dwelling natural enemies of P. xylostella interact negatively with each other. In another study, leaf damage was found to be higher in insecticide treated fields than in untreated fields as a combined consequence of insecticide resistance in the pest and lower predation from natural enemies which are reduced in number by the insecticide applications. In the last study, the main focus was to identify whether a combination of bio-control agents, i. e. parasitoids and a biological insecticide (Bt), interact additively, negatively or positively, in affecting the mortality of P. xylostella. It is concluded that a combination of control measures, including the promotion of predators and parasitoids, is probably needed to achieve sustainable biological control of the diamondback moth. To succeed with such approaches we must, however, learn more about the particular roles of different predators...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} mirids and stinkbugs {{have emerged as}} {{important}} sucking pests in cotton. While stinkbugs are causing damage to bolls, mirids are causing damage to seedlings, squares and bolls. With the increasing adoption of Bollgard II and IPM approaches the use of broad-spectrum chemicals to kill Helicoverpa has been reduced {{and as a result}} mirids and stinkbugs are building to levels causing damage to bolls later in crop growth stages. Studies on stinkbugs by Dr Moazzem Khan revealed that green vegetable bug (GVB) caused significant boll damage and yield loss. A preliminary study by Dr Khan on mirids revealed that high mirid numbers at later growth stages also caused significant boll damage and that damage caused by mirids and GVB were similar. Mirids and stinkbugs therefore demand greater attention in order to minimise losses caused by these pests and to develop IPM strategies against these pests to enhance gains in IPM that have been made with Bt-transgenic cotton. Progress in this area of research will maintain sustainability and profitability of the Australian cotton industry. Mirid damage at early growth stages of cotton (up to squaring stage) has been studied in detail by Dr Khan. He found that all ages of mirids cause damage to young plants and damage by mirid nymphs is cumulative. Maximum damage occurs when the insect reaches the 4 th and 5 th nymphal stages. He also found that mirid feeding causes shedding of small and medium squares, and damaged large squares develop as ‘parrot beak’ bolls. Detailed studies at the boll stage, such as which stage of mirids is most damaging or which age boll is most vulnerable to feeding, is lacking. This information is a prerequisite to developing an IPM strategy for the pest in later crop growth stages. Understanding population change of the pest over time in relation to crop development is an important aspect for developing management strategies for the pest which is lacking for mirids in BollgardII. Predators and parasitoids are integral components of any IPM system and play an important part in regulating pest populations. Some generalist predators such as ants, spiders, <b>damsel</b> <b>bugs</b> and assassin bugs are known to predate on mirids. Nothing is known about parasitoids of mirids. Since green mirid (GM), Creontiades dilutus, is indigenous to Australia it is likely that we have one or more parasitoids of this mirid in Australia, but that possibility has not been investigated yet. The impact of the GVB adult parasitoid, Trichopoda giacomelli, has been studied by Dr Khan who found that the fly is established in the released areas and continues to spread. However, to get wider and greater impact, the fly should be released in new locations across the valleys. The insecticides registered for mirids and stinkbugs are mostly non-selective and are extremely disruptive {{to a wide range of}} beneficial insects. Use of these insecticides at stage I and II will minimise the impact of existing IPM programs. Therefore less disruptive control tactics including soft chemicals for mirids and stinkbugs are necessary. As with soft chemicals, salt mixtures, biopesticides based on fungal pathogens and attractants based on plant volatiles may be useful tools in managing mirids and stinkbugs with less or no disruption. Dr Khan has investigated salt mixture against mirids and GVB. While salt mixtures are quite effective and less disruptive, they are quite chemical specific. Not all chemicals mixed with salt will give the desired benefit. Therefore further investigation is needed to identify those chemicals that are effective with salt mixture against mirids and 3 of 37 GVB. Dr Caroline Hauxwell of DPI&F is working on fungal pathogen-based biopesticides against mirids and GVB and Drs Peter Gregg and Alice Del Socorro of Australian Cotton CRC are working on plant volatile-based attractants against mirids. Depending on their findings, inclusion of fungal-based biopestcides and plant volatile-based attractants in developing a management system against mirids and stinkbugs in cotton could be an important component of an IPM approach...|$|R
40|$|Three {{insecticides}} and one herbicide (Prism®) {{were evaluated}} efficacy against summer alfalfa insects using small plots. Usage of the insecticide Steward® resulted in excellent control of alfalfa caterpillars and beet armyworms, {{as well as}} excellent initial control of Empoasca leafhoppers. Usage of Steward® also reduced nymphal lygus bugs, but also resulted in lowest numbers of bigeyed bugs. Application of the insecticide Baythroid® XL was noted to result in excellent control of Empoasca leafhoppers throughout the study, excellent control of palestriped flea beetles early in the study, but also reduced populations of damsel bugs early in the study. Reduction of threecornered alfalfa hoppers was also noted, as was excellent control of alfalfa caterpillars at one and seven days post treatment with this chemistry, although this was not noted at four days after treatment. Data indicate the herbicide treatment (Prism® + Hasten®) significantly reduced <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> populations and large lygus bug nymphs for one day post treatment, and resulted in a slight numerical decrease in beet armyworms and palestriped flea beetles. Clover leafhopper numbers where higher at seven days post treatment in alfalfa receiving this treatment than the untreated check. Application of Trilogy®, {{expected to be a}} slow acting treatment, did result in some slight initial reductions (25 %) of palestriped flea beetles, threecornered alfalfa hoppers and beet armyworms, but these red uctions were not apparent at four days post treatment.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the <b>damsel</b> <b>bug,</b> Alloeorhynchus bakeri, has been completed and annotated in this study. It represents the first sequenced mitochondrial genome of heteropteran family Nabidae. The circular genome is 15, 851 bp in length with an A+T content of 73. 5 %, contains the typical 37 genes that are arranged {{in the same order}} as that of the putative ancestor of hexapods. Nucleotide composition and codon usage are similar to other known heteropteran mitochondrial genomes. All protein-coding genes (PCGs) use standard initiation codons (methionine and isoleucine), except COI, which started with TTG. Canonical TAA and TAG termination codons are found in eight protein-coding genes, the remaining five (COI, COII, COIII, ND 5, ND 1) have incomplete termination codons (T or TA). PCGs of two strands present opposite CG skew which is also reflected by the nucleotide composition and codon usage. All tRNAs have the typical clover-leaf structure, except the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm of tRNA Ser (AGN) which forms a simple loop as known in many other metazoa. Secondary structure models of the ribosomal RNA genes of A. bakeri are presented, similar to those proposed for other insect orders. There are six domains and 45 helices and three domains and 27 helices in the secondary structures of rrnL and rrnS, respectively. The major non-coding region (also called control region) between the small ribosomal subunit and the tRNA Ile gene includes two special regions. The first region includes four 133 bp tandem repeat units plus a partial copy of the repeat (28 bp of the beginning), and the second region at the end of control region contains 4 potential stem-loop structures. Finally, PCGs sequences were used to perform a phylogenetic study. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses highly support Nabidae as the sister group to Anthocoridae and Miridae. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{completed}} at the Washington State University Honors College. It received a ranking of "passed with distinction. "The Colorado potato beetle (CPB) {{is a key}} pest of potato crops in Washington. CPB larvae feed on plants aboveground, where they are attacked by predatory insects. Then, CPB pupate in the soil, where they are attacked by pathogens. CPB can be stressed when they are exposed to, but not killed by predators, and this stress might make them more susceptible to pathogens. We tested this hypothesis in field and laboratory experiments where CPB larvae were exposed to predators or a control and surviving pupae were exposed to pathogens. In the laboratory experiment CPB were exposed to predators by attaching a lady beetle or <b>damsel</b> <b>bug</b> {{to the end of}} a wooden dowel rod and forcing it into contact with CPB larvae. CPB not exposed to predators were contacted with a dowel rod alone. Following contact, we recorded the behavior of larvae to determine how they responded to each treatment. After larvae had completed development, we placed them in plastic deli cups containing soil with fungi and nematodes and recorded survival to the adult stage. This allowed us to determine if CPB previously exposed to predators had differing levels of mortality. In our field experiment we placed CPB larvae with potato plants in mesh cages and exposed them to both a combination of predator and density treatments. This exposed them to four different treatment combinations while they developed to their final instar stage. Resulting pupae were exposed to fungi and nematodes as in the laboratory experiment. Once again survival to adulthood was recorded. Our results revealed that predators decreased the CPB’s resistance to pathogens, suggesting predators and pathogens likely act in a complementary way to control CPB. CPB survival to adulthood after pathogen exposure was not significantly effected by the density treatment. If it is true that predators and pathogens can act in a way to suppress CPB pests, this experiment may add important knowledge to the field of agriculture by providing insight into naturally controlling pests without using harmful insecticides.
