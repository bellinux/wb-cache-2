5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had learned and wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing.|$|E

5|$|While {{preparing}} {{for his role}} as a deaf man in See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Wilder met Karen Webb (née Boyer), who was a clinical supervisor for the New York League for the <b>Hard</b> <b>of</b> Hearing. Webb coached him in lip reading. Following Gilda Radner's death, Wilder and Webb reconnected, and on September 8, 1991, they married. The two lived in Stamford, Connecticut, in the 1734 Colonial home that he had shared with Radner.|$|E

5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet heard a loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study {{on the effect of}} the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E

5|$|Under Collier, Jones {{supervised}} the offensive backfield and the ends, {{but was also}} the Browns' offensive play-caller. He directed the team from the press box on Collier's behalf because Collier was <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing and could not do so himself. The Browns won their first six games {{at the beginning of}} Jones's coaching career in the 1963 season, although a late slump cost them a spot in the championship game. The team regrouped the following year, ending with a 10–3–1 win-loss-tie record and winning the NFL's eastern division. Cleveland {{went on to win the}} championship game against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The Browns advanced to the championship game again the following year, but lost to the Green Bay Packers. During his tenure as a coach, Jones was the primary position coach for running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly, both of whom are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also coached receiver Paul Warfield, another hall of fame member who helped propel the Browns to the 1964 championship.|$|E

25|$|The deaf or <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing {{community}} has {{a difficult time}} to communicate and perceive information as compared to hearing individuals. Thus, these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information. The use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to their problems by providing higher sound (for those who are <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing), tactile feedback, visual cues and improved technology access. Individuals who are deaf or <b>hard</b> <b>of</b> hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with improved access to information in numerous environments. Most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and/or vibration. These technologies can be grouped into three general categories: Hearing Technology, alerting devices, and communication support.|$|E
