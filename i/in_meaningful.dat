Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered {{to determine if}} drivers are safe behind the wheel. To enable independence of older adults at home, occupational therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning in their homes, and recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence.|$|E

Miller deliberately {{allowed himself to}} be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex. He also deplored Bradman's hard-nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as [...] "festival matches". Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability, Miller played with reckless aggression, rather than a measured style in line with his captain's aim of remaining undefeated. Bradman's letters in later life, published posthumously, revealed his hostility towards Miller. Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence—one of the reserve batsmen—to partake <b>in</b> <b>meaningful</b> matchplay due to captain's reluctance to risk Australia's unbeaten run.|$|E

500|$|However, {{some players}} {{expressed}} displeasure at Bradman's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition. The all rounder Keith Miller, {{who was one}} of two bowling spearheads, deliberated allowed himself to be bowled first ball for duck during the match against Essex, while Bradman was his batting partner, in a protest against Australia's world record of scoring 721 runs in one day. Miller also deplored Bradman's hard-nosed attitude in the match against Leveson-Gower's XI, which was traditionally regarded as a [...] "festival match". Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability, Miller played with reckless aggression, rather than a measured style in line with Bradman's aim of remaining undefeated. Bradman's later letter revealed his hostility towards Miller. Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamenceone of the reserve batsmento partake <b>in</b> <b>meaningful</b> matchplay; due to Bradman's reluctance to risk Australia's unbeaten run, Hamence usually batted low in the order and had limited opportunities because the senior batsmen were rarely dismissed cheaply. Along with fringe bowlers Doug Ring and Colin McCool, Hamence called himself [...] "Ground Staff" [...] due to the trio's lack of on-field duties, and they often sang ironic songs about their status.|$|E
500|$|McGrady {{was known}} for his laid-back {{demeanor}} and scoring prowess; he once scored 41 points in a game despite being asleep right until tip-off, a performance that inspired the nickname [...] "The Big Sleep". Many of his contemporaries, including Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce, have called him {{one of the most difficult}} players that they ever had to guard. His playing style has been compared to that of George Gervin; both players made scoring appear easy with their [...] "smooth" [...] approach to the game. At his peak, McGrady was an explosive player capable of finishing at the rim over the defense; in a piece for ESPN, Zach Lowe elaborated, [...] "He glided through the lane, crouched into traffic, and accelerated suddenly -- almost violently -- through a forest of slower-moving forms, and to the rim." [...] McGrady would frequently pull up for deep three-pointers over unsuspecting defenders, making him a threat to score from anywhere on the court. These qualities, in addition to his ability to survey the floor and make accurate pocket passes when necessary, have led analysts to describe him as being ahead of his time; in 2017, ESPN's Amin Elhassan remarked that McGrady was built for the style of positionless basketball that was being played in the modern era. On the defensive side of the ball, McGrady's effort was less consistent, but he demonstrated the ability to raise his level <b>in</b> <b>meaningful</b> games, such as during the playoffs against the Mavericks, where he often drew the assignment of guarding Dirk Nowitzki.|$|E
