2500|$|In 1986, Murdoch {{introduced}} electronic {{production processes}} to his newspapers in Australia, Britain and the United States. The {{greater degree of}} automation led to significant reductions {{in the number of}} employees involved in the printing process. [...] In England, the move roused the anger of the print unions, resulting in a long and often violent dispute that played out in Wapping, one of London's docklands areas, where Murdoch had installed the very latest <b>electronic</b> <b>newspaper</b> purpose-built publishing facility in an old warehouse. The bitter Wapping dispute started with the dismissal of 6,000 employees who had gone on strike and resulted in street battles and demonstrations. Many on the political left in Britain alleged the collusion of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government with Murdoch in the Wapping affair, as a way of damaging the British trade union movement. In 1987, the dismissed workers accepted a settlement of £60 million.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the <b>electronic</b> <b>newspaper's</b> market structure. The market {{is characterized by}} low barriers to entry. Based on the information versus advertising and local versus long-distance distinctions, four submarkets are identified.

Under intermedia competition, we suggest <b>electronic</b> <b>newspapers</b> differentiate themselves from traditional media by developing Internet-related features.
