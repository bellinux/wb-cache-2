This {{is a source of}} annoyance to Naomi, whose privacy is invaded when she wakes up one morning, naked, to discover that a male hippy is sleeping in her bed. At college, she avoids Emily to meet with her politics teacher Kieran instead. In the students' common room, they are informed of the upcoming elections for Student President. Emily encourages Naomi to run for president, but Naomi refuses. She later comes across Cook, who tries to persuade her to have sex with him. She jokingly tells him that he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the student elections, which he sees as a challenge and decides to register. Kieran walks her {{home at the end of}} the day and urges her to run in the elections, giving her a registration form. When she arrives at her house, she finds Emily waiting in her bedroom with another registration form. Emily starts to leave when Naomi is rude and standoffish to herdespite taking Emily's advice to enter the electionsbut returns and confronts her. She coldly tells her that she is not obsessed with pursuing a sexual relationship with her, and Naomi suggests she stay the night with her.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} move from one income group into another (income mobility) is a means of {{measuring}} economic opportunity. A higher probability of upward income mobility theoretically would help mitigate higher income inequality, as each generation <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of achieving higher income groups. Conservatives and libertarians such as economist Thomas Sowell, and Congressman Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.) argue that more important than the level of equality of results is America's equality of opportunity, especially relative to other developed countries such as western Europe.|$|E

25|$|Back at Carlisle, King Arthur learns of {{the events}} and pardons the {{defeated}} king. Arthur decides personally to set out in search of Fergus, but Gawain counsels that he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of finding him if he hosts a tournament. The tournament is arranged at Jedburgh, and the prize is Queen Galiene and her kingdom. During the week-long tournament, Fergus remains invincible, defeating, among others, Kay, Lancelot and the Black Knight. It is after this that Fergus and Galiene are united in marriage, and Fergus becomes King of Lothian.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the fourth}} edition, skill and ability checks worked as follows: all {{actions in the}} game, {{from the use of}} skills to making attacks in combat, are first given a target number that {{reflects}} the difficulty of the action which is then raised or lowered by various modifying factors, such as environmental conditions, the condition of the character, the use of mechanical aids, and so forth. The player then rolls a number of dice equal to their level in the relevant skill, and the number of dice rolled that meet or exceed the target number determines if the character is successful performing the action and the degree of success the character has. As an example, a character with a high firearms skill not only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> at hitting a target than someone with a lower ranked skill, but also is more likely to cause more damage to the target. Target numbers may exceed 6, in which case any dice that show a 6 have to be re-rolled (a target number of, e.g., 9 is reached by rolling a 6 followed by at least a 3; thus, a target number of 6 and one of 7 are identical, except extra dice rolls are not allowed for target number 7 or greater). For even higher target numbers, this procedure has to be repeated; thus, an action with a target number of 20 (like attempting to procure military-grade weaponry) will only succeed if three successive dice rolls result in sixes, and the fourth gives at least a 2. For any dice-roll a roll of 1 always counts as a failure. This system allows great flexibility in setting the difficulty of an action.|$|E
2500|$|Automimicry {{refers to}} {{instances}} in which one body part of an animal mimics another. This may help and animal survive an attack, or help a predators to appear innocuous. [...] Examples include many moth, butterfly, and fish species that have [...] "eye-spots". These are large dark markings that help prey escape by causing predators to attack a false target. [...] For example, the gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus) shows the false head at its rear; it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving an attack to that part than an attack to the head. Another example is the [...] "two-headed" [...] snake of Central Africa which has a tail that resembles a head. The snake even moves its tail in the way most snakes move their heads. This adaptation functions to deceive prey as {{to the source of}} an attack.|$|E

2500|$|The {{degree to}} which seed {{predation}} influences plant populations may vary by whether a plant species is safe site limited or seed limited. If a population is safe site limited {{it is likely that}} seed predation will have little impact {{to the success of the}} population. In safe site limited populations increased seed abundance does not translate into increased seedling recruitment. However, if a population is seed limited, seed predation <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of negatively affecting the plant population by decreasing seedling recruitment. Maron and Simms found both safe site limited and seed limited populations depending on the habitat in which the seed predation was taking place. In dune habitats seed predators (deer mice) were limiting seedling recruitment in the population, thus negatively affecting the population. However, in grassland habitat the seed predator had little effect on the plant population because it was safe site limited.|$|E

Writing as Poblano on Daily Kos, he had gained a following, especially for his primary election forecast on Super Tuesday, February 5, 2008. From that primary election day, which included contests in 24 states plus American Samoa, [...] "Poblano" [...] predicted that Barack Obama would come away with 859 delegates, and Hillary Clinton 829; in the final contests, Obama won 847 delegates and Clinton 834. Based on this result, New York Times op-ed columnist William Kristol wrote: [...] "And an interesting regression analysis at the Daily Kos Web site (poblano.dailykos.com) of the determinants of the Democratic vote so far, applied to {{the demographics of the}} Ohio electorate, suggests that Obama <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> than is generally realized in Ohio".|$|E
