5|$|Female <b>homosexuality</b> has not {{received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male <b>homosexuality</b> or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female <b>homosexuality</b> appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult <b>homosexuality,</b> while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult <b>homosexuality.</b> Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of <b>homosexuality.</b> Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult <b>homosexuality.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed <b>homosexuality</b> in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A {{large-scale}} study of <b>homosexuality</b> in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but <b>homosexuality</b> remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} child {{as a result of}} their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female <b>homosexuality.</b> This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on <b>homosexuality</b> centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female <b>homosexuality</b> are frequently suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Some House Republicans were {{critical}} of Thorne-Begland's {{lying to the}} Navy about his <b>homosexuality,</b> stating that his violation of the military's code of conduct made him unfit for a judgeship.

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of <b>homosexuality,</b> and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of <b>homosexuality,</b> that psychoanalytic theories of the development of <b>homosexuality</b> are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male <b>homosexuality,</b> and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of <b>homosexuality</b> and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of <b>homosexuality,</b> dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male <b>homosexuality</b> and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with the American Psychological Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on <b>homosexuality.</b> Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|The Rejected (1961) is a made-for-television {{documentary}} film about <b>homosexuality,</b> produced for KQED in San Francisco by John W. Reavis. The Rejected {{was the first}} documentary program on <b>homosexuality</b> broadcast on American television. It initially ran on KQED on September 11, 1961, and was later syndicated to National Educational Television (NET) stations across the country. The Rejected received positive critical reviews upon airing.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause <b>homosexuality</b> by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} <b>homosexuality</b> and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing <b>homosexuality.</b> The geneticist Dean Hamer wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, Hamer found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of <b>homosexuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of <b>homosexuality</b> from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of <b>homosexuality</b> is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed <b>homosexuality</b> from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. <b>Homosexuality,</b> which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude <b>homosexuality</b> as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about <b>homosexuality,</b> and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider <b>homosexuality</b> as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, <b>homosexuality</b> and bisexuality.|$|E

5|$|Films {{produced}} {{under such}} censorship could only introduce <b>homosexuality</b> as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, {{such as in}} the cult horror film White Zombie.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s onwards, <b>homosexuality</b> gained {{much wider}} {{mainstream}} acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of <b>homosexuality</b> to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by {{the growing number of}} openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of <b>homosexuality</b> within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homosexuality</b> {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed <b>homosexuality</b> by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the Supreme Court of India {{reinstated}} {{the controversial}} Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which, among other things, criminalises <b>homosexuality.</b> There {{was a popular}} outcry, although clerics, including Muslim religious leaders, stated that they supported the verdict. BJP president Rajnath Singh said that the party supported section 377, because it believed that <b>homosexuality</b> was unnatural, though its stand has softened after its victory in the 2014 general elections.Senior party members including Arun Jaitley and Harsh Vardhan (Delhi politician) openly support the rights of gender and sexual minorities in India. Vanathi Srinivasan BJP leader from Tamil Nadu launched the first book on LGBTQIA and Genderqueer in Tamil penned by Gopi Shankar Madurai.|$|E

5|$|Lesbian {{consciousness}} {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1986, when the Sandinista National Liberation Front expelled {{gay men and}} lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation of associations until AIDS became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was Nosotras, founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare <b>homosexuality</b> illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when Grupo Safo– Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua was created, four years before <b>homosexuality</b> became legal again.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are one of}} the few animals {{where the}} {{molecular}} basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined. However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the Oregon Health and Science University that investigated the mechanisms that produce <b>homosexuality</b> in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure <b>homosexuality</b> in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.|$|E

5|$|The German-speaking {{countries}} {{have a lot}} of gay bathhouses ("Schwule Sauna") since <b>homosexuality</b> had been legalized in 1969 (and later). The oldest ones are Vulcan-Sauna in Hanover, another bathhouse in Cologne, Berlin and Kaiserbründl in Vienna.|$|E
5|$|The True Directions program {{involves}} the campers admitting their <b>homosexuality</b> (step 1), rediscovering their gender identity by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks (step 2), finding {{the root of}} their <b>homosexuality</b> through family therapy (step 3), demystifying the other sex (step 4), and simulating heterosexual intercourse (step 5). Over {{the course of the}} program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, a college student named Graham (Clea DuVall) who, though more comfortable being gay than Megan, was forced to the camp at the risk of otherwise being disowned by her family.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women {{had ever had}} sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 <b>homosexuality</b> was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that <b>homosexuality</b> was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} several of the men were {{obscured}} in some fashion, either in shadow or, in one instance, behind a large potted palm tree. Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position that <b>homosexuality</b> is a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of <b>homosexuality</b> as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of the inside of a gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a street corner and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female <b>homosexuality</b> {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences of American women in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of <b>homosexuality</b> as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E
5|$|The scandal fuelled the {{attitude}} that male <b>homosexuality</b> was an aristocratic vice that corrupted lower-class youths. Such perceptions were still prevalent in 1895 when the Marquess of Queensberry accused Oscar Wilde of being an active homosexual.|$|E
5|$|The work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis {{was widely}} read, {{and helped to}} create public {{consciousness}} of female <b>homosexuality.</b> The sexologists' claims that <b>homosexuality</b> was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor {{should be considered a}} criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. Lesbian began to describe elements of a subculture.|$|E
