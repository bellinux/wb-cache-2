40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The droplet {{formation}} {{process in}} the vicinity of the nozzle exit and the behavior of a spreading droplet during impingement on a smooth glass surface were studied. Two nozzle geometries were tested. The first case was a stiff stainless steel nozzle plate 0. 787 mm thick. The second case was a flexible stainless steel nozzle plate 0. 102 mm thick. In each case, two different waveforms were used to drive the piezoelectric element in the droplet generator. This resulted in different meniscus behavior at the nozzle exit in each case. Leading and trailing edge velocities and the position of the leading edge relative to the nozzle were measured through use of double-frame images taken with a high-speed camera to describe the formation process at the nozzle. This data was displayed in both dimensional and non-dimensional form using capillary parameters. At the impingement surface, the high speed camera was used to record the spread rate and contact angle of the droplets. This research concluded that the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> had a significant impact on droplet formation. Exit velocities were more than double those of the stiff nozzle, and break-off times were shorter for the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle.</b> One drawback of the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> was that satellite droplets were produced along with the main droplet, which did not happen with a stiff nozzle. Behavior at the impingement surface was also noted to be different in each case. However, this is not directly related to the different nozzles themselves, but rather the fact that the nozzles resulted in different droplet velocities. The spread rate of the droplets was observed to increase as the impingement velocity was increased. The dynamic contact angles were also measured and compared to existing models found in the literature. Although there were discrepancies, it is likely that these are due to the difference in Weber numbers between this experiment and the models...|$|E

The jet was characterized by a pulsatile flow that was self-excited by the motion of the flexible tube.

The jet flow was dominated by vortices that were shed from the nozzle with an axis parallel to the major axis. The vortices in the near field were quasi-two-dimensional so that measurements performed at the center plane represented the dynamics of the entire vortex. The nozzle excited two different modes depending on the tension applied to the <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the volumetric flow through it. The first was a flapping mode, which was associated with alternate shedding of vortices. This caused strong steering of the jet to one side or the other.

This approach is computationally intensive and prevents the nozzles from being designed in real-time, which is necessary for an operational aircraft system.

Results show that genetic algorithm trained neural networks provide a viable, real-time alternative for designing thrust vectoring nozzles contours.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Droplet {{formation}} from a <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> plate {{driven by}} a prescribed-waveform excitation of a piezoelectric is numerically investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model with the VOF method. The droplet generator with a <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> plate, which is free to vibrate due to the pressure acting on the plate, is modeled in a computational domain. The CFD analysis includes the fluid-structure interaction between fluid and a flexible plate using large deflection theory. The problem {{is characterized by the}} nondimensional variables based on the capillary parameters of time, velocity, and pressure. The CFD model is validated with experiment results. This study examines the characteristics of the applied waveforms and nozzle plate material properties to change the vibrational characteristics of the nozzle plate. The effect of fluid properties on the droplet formation process is also investigated focusing on surface tension and viscous forces. The mechanism of the droplet formation excited by a drop-on-demand piezoelectric waveform is investigated using a step-function and a pulse waveform. The piezoelectric displacement {{plays an important role in}} generating either forward-driven momentum or a suction pressure inside the chamber. For the step-function waveform, the nondimensional applied impulse is defined and used to characterize the post-breakoff droplet volume. Increasing the impulse of the piezoelectric can be used to cause a faster droplet velocity and it is shown that the vibration of the nozzle plate has a strong effect on the droplet velocity, shape, and volume. Surface tension has strong influence on the droplet formation characteristics which is in contrast to a viscous force that makes little difference on the droplet formation for a range of viscosities studied. For the combination of a fluid with high surface tension and the most <b>flexible</b> <b>nozzle</b> plate, this system can cause the droplet not to be ejected from the nozzle. Successive droplet impingement onto a solid surface is numerically investigated using a CFD multiphase flow model (VOF method). The main focus of this study is to better understand the hydrodynamics of the non-splash impingement process, particularly the effect of a dynamic contact angle and fluid properties along with the interaction between successive droplets while they are impinging onto a solid surface. The pre-impact droplet conditions are prescribed based on a spherical droplet diameter, velocity, and inter-droplet spacing. The molecular kinetic theory is used to model the dynamic contact angle as a function of a contact line velocity. The numerical scheme is validated against experiment al results. In the impact spreading and receding processes, results are analyzed to determine the nondimensional deformation characteristics of both single and successive droplet impingements with the variation of fluid properties such as surface tension and dynamic viscosity. These characteristics include spreading ratio, spreading velocity, and a dynamic contact angle. The inclusion of a dynamic contact angle is shown to have a major effect on droplet spreading. In successive droplet impingement, the second drop causes a surge of spreading velocity and contact angle with an associate complex recirculating flow near the contact line after it initially impacts the preceding droplet when it is in an advancing condition. This interaction is less dramatic when the first drop is receding or stationary. The surface tension has the most effect on the maximum spreading radius in both single and successive droplet impingements. In contrast to this, the viscosity directly affects the damping of the spreading-receding process...|$|E

For operating the Variable Mach number <b>Flexible</b> <b>Nozzle</b> (VMFN) at supersonic Mach numbers in the NAL 0. 6 m wind tunnel, it is proposed to keep the second throat in a fixed position (corresponding to starting condition at low Mach numbers.

Since these two are totally independent dynamical systems with their own time contrants, proper matching of the two is necessary for efficient handling and operation of the complete wind tunnel. Mach number in the VMFN is controlled by a single hydraulic jack, which outputs a voltage proportional to its displacement (Temposonic sensor). For every Mach number, there exists a certain minimum (safe) stagnation pressure that must be delivered and maintained by the PRV.

Some ideas on further augmentation of the 1. 2 m wind tunnel, considering the future aerospace programmes {{of the country are}} presented...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{to augment the}} NAL 0. 6 m wind tunnel with a variable Mach number <b>flexible</b> <b>Nozzle</b> (VMFN) to enhance the testing capability from transonic to supersonic Mach numbers(up to 4. 0). In {{order to avoid the}} star stop loads that are inherent in blow down wind tunnels, it {{is proposed}} to start the tunnel at a low Mach number(say 1. 0) and then increasing the Mach number by reducing the nozzle throat(maximum Mach number = 4. 0) by continuously flexing the nozzle walls; the reverse process is to be adopted while stopping in such an operation two important issues arise. Firstly, the setting chamber pressure should always be maintained above the minimum 'running ' pressure at any supersonic Mach number to avoid flow breakdown in the test section. Secondly,in order to maintain the free-stream dynamic pressure constant during the useful runtime and within desirable limits during the transition from Mach 1. 0 to 4. 0 and vice versa, the pressure regulating valve(PRV) must be operated in a closed-loop pressure control. In the problem is formulated based on assumptions of quasi-steady is entropic elations and a program is presented in C language to study the nature of variation of stagnation pressure in the settling chamber for various trajectories of the results predicated from the program and experimental data obtained at subsonic Mach numbers in the existing 0. 6 m wind tunnel are shown. Predictions for VMFN operation show that the setting chamber pressure rapidly builds up towards the value of storage tank pressure. When the VMFN nozzle throat reduces from Mach 1. 0 to Mach 4. 0 condition. Presumably due to constriction of the flow when the VMFN nozzle throat reduces from Mach 1. 0 to 4. 0 condition. Presumably due to constriction of the flow passage at the first throat. Likewise. the pressure rapidly falls when the VMFN reverses from Mach 4. 0 to 1. 0 condition by suitably controlling the initial opening and the trajectory of opening and closing of the PRV it is possible to ensure that the stagnation pressure in the setting chamber is always greater than the minimum (renning) pressure that is necessary for stable flow in the test section. However it is seen that during the transition from Mach 1. 0 to 4. 0 and vice versa the free-stream dynamic pressure overshots to relatively high values, which has significance on model and balance design for aerodynamic force and moment measurements at supersonic Mach numbers in the 0. 6 m wind tunne...|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of control system of a wind tunnel, it is {{important}} to understand the importance of operations of mechanical systems in order to ensure that any emergencies that may arise during the running of the wind tunnel are properly handled by the system. In the NAL 0. 6 m blowdown wind tunnel, it is proposed to incorporate a Variable Mach number <b>Flexible</b> <b>Nozzle</b> (VMFN), using which the tunnel 13; can be started at a low Mach number and the required test Mach number (up to 4) can be reached by continuously (on-line) changing the nozzle contour using an Electroservohydraulic drive. Before stopping the tunnel, the VMFN would be reverted to the initial low Mach number condition. During the entire operation of the tunnel in such a scenario, it is essential that the Pressure Regulating Valve (PRV) maintains the specified or minimum stagnation pressure in the test section by following a safe trajectory. In order to determine a safe trajectory, a basic understanding of the variation of stagnation pressure in the settling chamber is called for, before the PRV control system is designed. In this paper, the problem is 13; formulated based on quasi-steady isentropic equations and programmed in C language to predict the timehistories 13; of settling chamber pressure and storage tank pressure for a given trajectory of the opening of PRV, as the VMFN throat is changed from Mach 1 to Mach 4 condition and vice versa. In order to validate the present methodology, the PRV trajectory measured during an experiment in the NAL 0. 6 m 13; wind tunnel was used as input to the program and the measured time-histories of settling chamber pressure and storage tank pressure are compared with the predicted values. Predictions of settling chamber pressure and the storage tank pressure relevant to VMFN operation indicate that settling chamber pressure rapidly builds up towards the storage tank pressure, apparently due to the constriction offered at the VMFN throat as VMFN throat is changed from M= 1 contour to M= 4 contour during the 13; start of the run. Minimum PRV opening area has been predicted to maintain the settling chamber pressure 13; higher than the estimated minimum value at high Mach numbers. For smaller openings of the PRV (lt; 0. 065 m 2), the predicted pressure falls below the minimum and is hence unsafe. From the predicted time history of free-stream dynamic pressure (q), it is noted that alarming increase in q can occur during starting and stopping transients, which can damage a test model in the tunnel, balance and such other components. Therefore, {{the design of}} test object and support system need to be adequately designed...|$|E
