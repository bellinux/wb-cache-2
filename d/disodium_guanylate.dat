2500|$|MSG is one {{of several}} forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is {{pervasive}} in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term [...] "spices and flavorings". The ribonucleotide food additives disodium inosinate and <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term [...] "natural flavor" [...] is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug Administration does not require disclosure of components and amounts of [...] "natural flavor." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>guanylate,</b> {{also known}} as sodium 5'-guanylate and {{disodium}} 5'-guanylate, is a natural sodium salt of the flavor enhancing nucleotide guanosine monophosphate (GMP). <b>Disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> is a food additive with the E number E627. It is commonly {{used in conjunction with}} glutamic acid (monosodium glutamate, MSG).|$|E
50|$|Guanosine monophosphate in {{the form}} of its salts, such as <b>disodium</b> <b>{{guanylate}}</b> (E627), dipotassium guanylate (E628) and calcium guanylate (E629), are food additives used as flavor enhancers to provide the umami taste. It is often used in synergy with disodium inosinate; the combination is known as disodium 5'-ribonucleotides. <b>Disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> is often found in instant noodles, potato chips and snacks, savoury rice, tinned vegetables, cured meats, and packet soup.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> is {{produced}} from dried seaweed {{and is often}} added to instant noodles, potato chips and other snacks, savory rice, tinned vegetables, cured meats, and packaged soup.|$|E
50|$|The food {{additives}} disodium inosinate and <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> are usually used in synergy with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients, {{and provide a}} likely indicator of the addition of glutamate to a product.|$|E
5000|$|Oxo beef stock cubes contain: [...] "Wheat Flour (with added Calcium, Iron, Niacin, Thiamin), Salt, Maize Starch, Yeast Extract, Flavour Enhancers (Monosodium Glutamate, <b>Disodium</b> <b>Guanylate),</b> Colour (Ammonia Caramel), Beef Fat (4.5%), Autolysed Yeast Extract, Dried Beef Bonestock, Flavourings, Sugar, Acidity Regulator (Lactic Acid), Onion Powder." ...|$|E
50|$|As it is {{a fairly}} {{expensive}} additive, it is not used independently of glutamic acid; if <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> is present in a list of ingredients but MSG {{does not appear to}} be, it is likely that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient such as a processed soy protein complex. It is often added to foods in conjunction with disodium inosinate; the combination is known as disodium 5'-ribonucleotides.|$|E
50|$|Pringles {{have about}} 42% potato content, the {{remainder}} being wheat starch and flours (potato, corn, and rice) combined with vegetable oils, an emulsifier, salt, and seasoning. Other ingredients can include sweeteners like maltodextrin and dextrose, monosodium glutamate (MSG), disodium inosinate, <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate,</b> sodium caseinate, modified food starch, monoglyceride and diglyceride, autolyzed yeast extract, natural and artificial flavors, malted barley flour, wheat bran, dried black beans, sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc.; Pringles varieties {{vary in their}} ingredients.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> is {{not safe}} for babies under twelve weeks, and should {{generally}} {{be avoided by}} asthmatics and people with gout, as guanylates are metabolized to purines. However, the typical amounts found in food are generally too low to produce significant side effects. [...] Since it is often produced from fish, vegans and vegetarians may wish to avoid it unless the product is specifically labeled as vegan or vegetarian. Such labels {{require the use of}} non-animal derived sources, such as seaweed or yeast.|$|E
50|$|Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides, E number E635, is {{a flavor}} {{enhancer}} which is synergistic with glutamates {{in creating the}} taste of umami. It {{is a mixture of}} disodium inosinate (IMP) and <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> (GMP) and is often used where a food already contains natural glutamates (as in meat extract) or added monosodium glutamate (MSG). It is primarily used in flavored noodles, snack foods, chips, crackers, sauces and fast foods. It is produced by combining the sodium salts of the natural compounds guanylic acid (E626) and inosinic acid (E630).|$|E
50|$|The {{electronic}} tongue uses taste {{sensors to}} receive information from chemicals {{on the tongue}} {{and send it to}} a pattern recognition system. The result is the detection of the tastes that compose the human palate. The types of taste that is generated is divided into five categories sourness, saltiness, bitterness, sweetness, and umami (savoriness). Sourness, which includes hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and citric acid, is created by hydrogen ions. Saltiness is registered as sodium chloride, sweetness by sugars, bitterness, which includes chemicals such as quinine and caffeine is detected through magnesium chloride,and umami by monosodium glutamate from seaweed, or <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate</b> in meat/fish/mushrooms.|$|E

50|$|In October 2009, the DOE banned bake sales, {{though some}} schools {{continue}} to have them with frequency. The DOE cited the high sugar content of baked sale goods and that 40% of NYC students are obese. Meanwhile, vending machines in the schools operated by Frito Lay and Snapple continue to sell high processed empty calorie foods such as Doritos and Juices. Contracts for the vending machines were awarded in no-bid deals through Mayor Bloomberg's office. As part of the DOE's ambition to create healthy diets among students, as of October, Frito Lay will have to put Reduced Fat Doritos in machines. The DOE considers Reduced Fat Doritos, which contain corn dextrin, corn maltodextrin, monosodium glutamate (MSG), disodium phosphate, artificial flavor, dextrose, artificial color, disodium inosinate and <b>disodium</b> <b>guanylate,</b> a healthy snack based on its June 2009 request for healthy snack vending machine proposals. The NYC school lunch menu contains numerous highly processed foods and high sugar content foods including chicken nuggets, French fries, French toast and syrup. NYC also continues to fail to meet the mandatory physical education requirements of NY State, and NYC DOE has failed to maintain or improve playgrounds instead turning them into ad-hoc additional classroom space or parking lots.|$|E
