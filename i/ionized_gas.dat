5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E

25|$|When {{the light}} is turned on, the {{electric}} power heats up the cathode enough for it to emit electrons (thermionic emission). These electrons collide with and ionize noble gas atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a plasma {{by the process of}} impact ionization.

25|$|The {{issue of}} how such a diverse range of nebular shapes can be {{produced}} is a debatable topic. It is theorised that interactions between material {{moving away from the}} star at different speeds gives rise to most observed shapes. However, some astronomers postulate that close binary central stars might be responsible for the more complex and extreme planetary nebulae. Several have been shown to exhibit strong magnetic fields, and their interactions with <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> could explain some planetary nebulae shapes.|$|E

25|$|Cosmic dust {{is widely}} present in space, where {{gas and dust}} clouds are primary {{precursors}} for planetary systems. The zodiacal light, as seen in a dark night sky, is produced by sunlight reflected from particles of dust in orbit around the Sun. The tails of comets are produced by emissions of dust and <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> {{from the body of}} the comet. Dust also covers solid planetary bodies, and vast dust storms occur on Mars that cover almost the entire planet. Interstellar dust is found between the stars, and high concentrations produce diffuse nebulae and reflection nebulae.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinguishing}} feature of Saturn's magnetosphere is high abundance of neutral gas around the planet. As revealed by ultraviolet observation of Cassini, {{the planet is}} enshrouded in a large cloud of hydrogen, water vapor and their dissociative products like hydroxyl, extending as far as 45Rs from Saturn. In the inner magnetosphere the ratio of neutrals to ions is around 60 and it increases in the outer magnetosphere, {{which means that the}} entire magnetospheric volume is filled with relatively dense weakly <b>ionized</b> <b>gas.</b> This is different, for instance, from Jupiter or Earth, where ions dominate over neutral gas, and has consequences for the magnetospheric dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The hottest {{and most}} massive {{of the newly}} formed stars (known as OB stars) will emit intense {{ultraviolet}} radiation, which steadily ionizes the surrounding gas of the giant molecular cloud, forming an H II region. Stellar winds and radiation pressure from the massive stars begins to drive away the hot <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> at a velocity matching {{the speed of sound}} in the gas. After a few million years the cluster will experience its first core-collapse supernovae, which will also expel gas from the vicinity. In most cases these processes will strip the cluster of gas within ten million years and no further star formation will take place. Still, about half of the resulting protostellar objects will be left surrounded by circumstellar disks, many of which form accretion disks.|$|E

25|$|The {{solar wind}} and {{magnetosphere}} consist of plasma (<b>ionized</b> <b>gas),</b> which conducts electricity. It {{is well known}} (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs {{in a direction that}} the conductor cuts across (or is cut by), rather than along, the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the direction of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process ("the dynamo effect"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.|$|E
25|$|A Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor {{consists}} of two wire cages, one inside the other, {{often referred to as}} grids, that are placed inside a vacuum chamber. The outer cage has a positive voltage versus the inner cage. Typically, deuterium gas is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its ionization temperature, making positive ions. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly {{through the center of the}} device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, they feel a Coulomb force that directs them back towards the center. Over time, a core of <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes conduct mass and energy away from the plasma.|$|E

In 1978, stellar-dynamical modeling of the mass distribution in M87 demonstrated evidence for a central mass of 5 billion solar masses. [...] After the installation of the COSTAR corrective-optics module in the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993, the Hubble Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) was used to measure the rotation velocity of the <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> disk in the center of M87, as an [...] "early release observation" [...] designed to test the scientific performance of the post-repair Hubble instruments.

500|$|Aries is home {{to several}} meteor showers. The Daytime Arietid meteor shower {{is one of the}} strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day, lasting from 22 May to 2 July. It is an annual shower {{associated}} with the Marsden group of comets that peaks on 7 June with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of 54 meteors. Its parent body may be the asteroid Icarus. The meteors are sometimes visible before dawn, because the radiant is 32 degrees away from the Sun. They usually appear at a rate of 1–2 per hour as [...] "earthgrazers", meteors that last several seconds and often begin at the horizon. Because most of the Daytime Arietids are not visible to the naked eye, they are observed in the radio spectrum. This is possible because of the <b>ionized</b> <b>gas</b> they leave in their wake. Other meteor showers radiate from Aries during the day; these include the Daytime Epsilon Arietids and the Northern and Southern Daytime May Arietids.
