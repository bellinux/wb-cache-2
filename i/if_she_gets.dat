The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord's influence.|$|E

Because Lydia's really deranged, Lydia starts {{thinking}} {{that because she}} loved Sarah and Sarah loved Zoe, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> with Zoe, that'll be the final piece in the puzzle and it'll all work out." [...] She explained: [...] "Lydia starts becoming obsessed with Zoe and to keep control, Zoe has to go with it. There's a point where Lydia kisses her! And then Mike walks in and kicks Zoe out." ...|$|E

Soon Lydia starts to befriend Zoe and she ends up moving in with the Barnes family where Lydia now lives and soon Zoe plans too uncover Lydia's murderous ways as she {{does not want to be}} known as a killer.

2500|$|Cody {{filed for}} divorce in 1904, after 38 years of marriage. This {{decision}} was made after years of jealous arguments, bad blood between {{his wife and his}} sisters, and friction between the children and their father. By 1891, Cody had instructed his brother-in-law to handle Frederici's affairs and property, stating [...] "I often feel sorry for her. She is a strange woman but I don't mind her—remember she is my wife—and let it go at that. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> cranky, just laugh at it, she can't help it." [...] Cody hoped to keep the divorce quiet, so as to not disrupt his show or his stage persona, but Frederici had other ideas.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} some {{criticism}} in the regard of what Pat Garrat from Xbox World described as [...] "blatant sexual references" [...] of a [...] "Japanese ninja with enormous tits. Sorry, there's no other way of saying it." [...] Writing for GameSetWatch, Leigh Alexander used [...] "Taki's nipples [...] have been meticulously articulated since the graphics technology existed to make it possible" [...] {{as an example of}} [...] "a strong degree of physical exploitation" [...] of female characters in fighting games. Video game designer and blogger Damion Schubert wrote he [...] "found Taki’s outfit awesome in Soul Caliber 2, and awful in Soul Caliber 4." [...] According to Kotaku's McWhertor, Taki's [...] "tighter than skin tight ninja outfit leav absolutely nothing to the imagination, making her high kicks the stuff of Hustler magazine spreads." [...] Destructoid's Karim Kayka commented on [...] "ridiculously endowed ninja gal Taki, who demonstrates what happens now that consoles can chum out superflucous polygons to render realistic nipples under a skintight leotard." [...] Shawn Sines of GameFront used the images of Taki from Soulcalibur II and Kasumi from the Dead or Alive series to illustrate the 2007 critical article about [...] "the video game implementation of modeling female breasts." [...] GamesRadar UK opined that in Soulcalibur IV Taki’s breasts look if they [...] "have been designed by a hormone-addled 13-year-old. They’re simply unfathomable and totally impractical for the fighting physique. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> punched in them it’s going to hurt and she isn’t even wearing a sports bra." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you feel}} {{strong enough to}} prevent the rudder taking charge <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> {{sternway}} on her? It wouldn't do to get something smashed about the steering-gear now. We've enough difficulties to cope with as it is." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “It won’t be easy. She {{has lost}} her {{propeller}} {{and carried her}} stern-frame away.
