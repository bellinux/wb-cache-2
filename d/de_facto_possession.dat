50|$|The Huguenot Cemetery in St. Augustine, Florida located {{across from}} the {{historic}} City Gate was a Protestant burial ground between the years 1821 and 1884. The Spanish colonial city of St. Augustine, along with the entire Florida Territory became <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> American <b>possessions</b> after the 1819 signing of the Adams-Onis Treaty.

5000|$|In his 1849 {{treatise}} What is Property?, Pierre Proudhon answers with [...] "Property is theft!" [...] In natural resources, he sees {{two types}} of property, de jure property (legal title) and <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> property (physical <b>possession),</b> and argues that the former is illegitimate. Proudhon's conclusion is that [...] "property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition." ...|$|R
2500|$|Belknap {{declined}} {{a regular}} Army commission after the war, and was appointed Iowa's Collector of Internal Revenue by President Andrew Johnson; he served {{for four years}} without controversy. In 1869, President Grant appointed Belknap Secretary of War. As secretary, Belknap requisitioned portraits for all the previous Secretaries of War, intending to create a complete collection for display {{in honor of the}} United States Centennial. He also aided Chicago Fire victims in 1871 and convinced Grant to commute the sentence of James Webster Smith, the first African American cadet to attend the United States Military Academy. [...] Smith was recommended for expulsion after he was falsely accused of misconduct; after Belknap intervened, Grant changed the sentence to setting Smith back one year in academic standing, which caused him to repeat his Plebe year. During the Reconstruction Era, Belknap's War Department and the U.S. military worked under supervision of President Ulysses S. Grant and the United States Attorney General's office to vigorously enforce the mandates of Reconstruction upon the defeated South. Belknap supported Grant's Reconstruction policy, which was opposed by most Democrats. In 1875, Grant, Belknap, and other members of Grant's administration secretly agreed to remove troops from the Black Hills after gold was discovered. [...] The Black Hills were protected by the military because they had been guaranteed to the Lakota by treaty; allowing a gold rush of white settlers to take place enabled the United States to gain <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>possession</b> after the Lakota refused to sell.|$|E

50|$|On 27 November, the Prince Regent, the Queen and {{the entire}} royal family, {{accompanied}} by many rich merchants {{as well as their}} servants, boarded fifteen Portuguese ships gathered in the Tagus with an escort of several English ships, as planned the year before when the British ambassador advised the prince that the Portuguese Crown should be transferred to Brazil. Approximately 10,000 people, including the entire governmental administration and the judiciary, joined the royal family as they moved to Brazil, a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> colonial <b>possession</b> of Portugal, and established the capital of the Portuguese Empire in Rio de Janeiro.|$|R
50|$|In 1500, France had 14 archbishoprics (Lyon, Rouen, Tours, Sens, Bourges, Bordeaux, Auch, Toulouse, Narbonne, Aix-en-Provence, Embrun, Vienne, Arles, and Rheims) and 100 bishoprics. By the 18th century, archbishoprics and bishoprics had {{expanded}} {{to a total}} of 139 (see List of Ancien Régime dioceses of France). The upper levels of the French church were made up predominantly of old nobility, both from provincial families and from royal court families, and many of the offices had become <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> hereditary <b>possessions,</b> with some members possessing multiple offices. In addition to fiefs that church members possessed as seigneurs, the church also possessed seigneurial lands in its own right and enacted justice upon them.|$|R
2500|$|Venice did {{not appear}} in the Peloponnese until 1206 or 1207, when a fleet took the Messenian {{peninsula}} with the two forts of Modon and Coron from Champlitte's men. In late 1208, Champlitte left the Peloponnese to take up his inheritance in Burgundy, and Villehardouin succeeded him as ruler of the new Frankish state, adroitly exploiting feudal law to avoid Champlitte's nephew from taking up the title instead. In May 1209, Geoffrey of Villehardouin participated in the Parliament of Ravennika, convened by the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders. It was probably there—and likely through the Emperor's mediation—that negotiations began to reach a settlement reconciling Villehardouin's <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> [...] <b>possession</b> of the Peloponnese and the Venetian claims, which led to the signing of a treaty at the island of Sapienza, off Modon, in June.|$|R

5000|$|The treaty yielded many {{benefits}} for France.

2500|$|The Spanish claim makes a {{distinction}} between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other.

5000|$|The Japanese {{military}} commandeered the Broadway Mansions at 11.00am on 17 August 1937, {{with all}} non-Japanese residents {{were ordered to}} evacuate from the Broadway Mansions by Japanese military sailors, often {{at the point of}} a bayonet. Soon the Japanese flag fluttered over the Broadway Mansions, to the great delight of Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto who toured Shanghai in April 1938. The Mansions became a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> Japanese <b>possession.</b> The Journal of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines in discussing accommodation in Shanghai indicated: [...] "Broadway Mansions? No. That's out. It is ... mostly empty and in darkness. Some Japanese military are there, that is all. It is a British property, Shanghai's newest and best apartment hotel. Another indemnity is accumulating." [...] Within a year most of the Mansions was rented to Japanese tenants. According to testimony presented to a US Congress sub-committee, [...] "Broadway Mansion is the [...] "brain" [...] of all Japanese control in Shanghai. Here most of the important combined policy meetings are held." [...] The Mansions was used as the headquarters of the Japanese Army Liaison Office. Before December 1941, the Japanese military government held weekly (and later bi-weekly) press conferences at the Broadway Mansions, and had offices there, including its transportation office. Foreigners who transgressed the Japanese rules of the territory occupied by Japan were held for questioning in the Mansions.|$|R
2500|$|The fall of Kartasura {{made the}} palace inauspicious {{for the king}} and Pakubuwana II built a new kraton in Surakarta or Solo and moved there in 1746. However, Pakubuwana II was far from secure in this throne. Raden Mas Said, or Pangeran Sambernyawa (meaning [...] "Soul Reaper"), son of banished Arya Mangkunegara, who later would {{establish}} the princely house of Mangkunagara in Solo, and several other princes of the royal blood still maintained rebellion. Pakubuwana II declared that anyone who can suppress the rebellion in Sukawati, areas around present day Sragen, would be rewarded with 3000 households. Pangeran Mangkubumi, Pakuwana II’s brother, who would later establish the royal house of Yogyakarta took the challenge and defeated Mas Said in 1746. But when he claimed his prize, his old enemy, patih Pringgalaya, advised the king against it. In {{the middle of this}} problem, VOC’s Governor General, van Imhoff, paid a visit to the kraton, the first one to do so during the whole history of the relation between Mataram and VOC, to confirm the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> Dutch <b>possession</b> of coastal and several interior regions. Pakubuwana II hesitantly accepted the cession in lieu of 20,000 real per year. Mangkubumi was dissatisfied with his brother’s decision to yield to van Imhoff’s insistence, which was made without consulting the other members of royal family and great nobles. van Imhoff had neither experience nor tactfulness to understand the delicate situation in Mataram and he rebuked Mangkubumi as “too ambitious” before the whole court when Mangkubumi claimed the 3000 households. This shameful treatment from a foreigner who had wrested the most prosperous lands of Mataram from his weak brother led him to raise his followers into rebellion in May 1746, this time with the help of Mas Said.|$|R
50|$|After {{reaching}} Cairo, Illinois, {{early in}} August, the prize was fitted {{out by the}} navy yard at Mound City, Illinois, for duty as a receiving ship, and she served there and at Cairo until {{close to the end}} of the Civil War.

50|$|The current {{succession}} {{law in the}} United Kingdom evolved from {{succession law}} in both England and Scotland. Originally in both countries, there were no fixed rules governing succession to the throne. The individual could have relied on inheritance, statute, election (by Parliament or by another body), nomination (by a reigning sovereign {{in his or her}} will), conquest or prescription (<b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>possession</b> of the Crown). It was often unclear which of these bases should take precedence; often, the outcome depended not on the legal strength of the claims, but on the political or military power of the claimants.|$|E
5000|$|In 1715, Frederick IV of Denmark, still {{fighting}} in the Great Northern War, gained a new ally in the anti-Swedish coalition, George I Louis, King of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover. In return for George I's aid, Denmark-Norway sold to him Bremen-Verden, which it kept under occupation since 1712. So the Prince-Electorate of Brunswick and Lunenburg, or colloquially called after its capital, the Electorate of Hanover; (Kurfürstentum Braunschweig und Lüneburg, or Kurhannover) took <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>possession</b> of Bremen-Verden and stipulated in the Treaty of Stockholm of 1719, settling the war with Sweden, to compensate the latter by 1 million rixdollars.|$|E

In his new position of Duke of Saxony he held the Land of Hadeln around Otterndorf, south of the river Elbe right opposite of Ditmarsh on the north bank. Adolf III of Schauenburg, Count of Holstein, at enmity with the Ascanians, had taken <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>possession</b> of Ditmarsh.

50|$|An {{example of}} this is Britain {{entering}} India. With the simultaneous desire to procure resources already claimed by the aggregate Indian society, and lack of desire to participate in Indian society, Britain's subjects actively challenged established ownership. The act also defined all inhabitants, including not only those actively participating in Hindu society, but also those participating passively (Untouchables,) as part of an aggregate entity. Before asserting its own ownership upon said resources, British interests challenged existing Indian society's ownership by <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>possession</b> (by virtue of being present in India,) India's lack of utilization for said resources (contrasting with Britain's moral and lawful utilization of them, as concurred by its peer nations,) and the inability for India to counter-challenge Britain legally and philosophically.|$|E
50|$|Because Peru {{discovered}} that Ecuador and Colombia neglected to effectively control their Amazonian territories during their colonial era, Peru decided to back its de jure titles with <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>possession</b> {{by setting up}} military posts in the relatively isolated trading villages and then flooding the disputed area with Peruvian colonists. The only problem lay with the expanding ambitions of Brazil, since it had slowly settled its part of the disputed area with colonists throughout its colonial era; it had a trading relationship with the Spanish-speaking trading posts and villages along the Marañon River. To neutralize Brazil from impeding Peru's planned colonization project, on 23 October 1851, Peru peacefully settled its disputes with Brazil and both countries agreed to a bilateral free navigation and friendly trade along the Amazon River.|$|E
