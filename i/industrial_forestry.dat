50|$|Due to declining population, L. pulmonaria is {{considered}} to be rare or threatened {{in many parts of the}} world, especially in lowland areas of Europe. The decline has been attributed to <b>industrial</b> <b>forestry</b> and air pollution, particularly acid rain. L. pulmonaria, like other lichens containing a blue-green algal component, are particularly susceptible to the effects of acid rain, because the subsequent decrease in pH reduces nitrogen fixation through inhibition of the algal nitrogenase enzyme.|$|E

50|$|Grover Island is now forested with {{a mature}} {{maritime}} forest.

There is an historical record of a house on the island that was present in the 18th century and its archaeological remains are likely still present.
