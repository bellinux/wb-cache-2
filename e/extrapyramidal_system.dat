5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Although Parkinson's disease is primarily a disease of the nigrostriatal pathway and not the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system,</b> loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to dysregulation of the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system.</b> Since this system regulates posture and skeletal muscle tone, a result is the characteristic bradykinesia of Parkinson's.|$|E

Localized disturbances in the system are held responsible for certain resting "tremors" and "rigidities " of man; the results so far obtained from experiments based on this hypothesis have, however, proved disappointing, largely because of anatomical difficulty in separating the pyramidal from the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>systems.</b> By means of the Horsley-Clarke stereotaxic instrument, it is possible to place discrete lesions {{in various parts of the}} striatal complex without injury to pyramidal tracts. Since discrete ablations of extrapyramidal regions are easily made, destruction of portions of this system may be variously combined and the physiological effect...|$|R

40|$|Several {{cases of}} parkinsonism {{were found in}} a {{ferromanganese}} smelter after the ventilation system had broken down and had not been repaired for eight months in 1985. To determine the aetiology and prevalence of parkinsonism, 132 workers were submitted to thorough medical examination and estimated air concentrations of carbon monoxide and manganese at different worksites. Only six of eight workers performing electrode fixation or welding during 1985 developed parkinsonism. They were exposed for 30 minutes each day, seven days a week, to high concentrations of air manganese (greater than 28. 8 mg/m 3). There was a consistent trend between the index of exposure to manganese and signs and symptoms exhibited by <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>systems.</b> After repair of the ventilation system, the air concentration of manganese during electrode fixation and welding decreased to less than 4. 4 mg/m 3; furthermore, no new cases of parkinsonism have been observed. Workers with parkinsonism recovered partially after removal from original worksites and treatment with levodopa.

50|$|The nigrostriatal pathway {{connects the}} SNc with the dorsal striatum. It {{is one of}} the four major {{dopamine}} pathways in the brain, and is particularly involved in modulation of the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system.</b> Dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway synapse onto GABAergic neurons in the basal ganglia. and in part make up the basal ganglia motor loop. Along with the other dopaminergic pathways, it is also partially involved in reward and in the reinforcement of memory consolidation.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of cystic lesions, causing swelling {{in the third}} ventricle, is a common feature in all patients. It is this dilatation that causes pressure {{to be applied to}} the surrounding structures of the third ventricle, such as the diencephalon. It is possible that the back and forth movement of fluid within the cyst causes rhythmic pressure on the diencephalic motor pathways. One of the key periventricular structures in that pathway is the thalamus which is responsible for relaying motor signals to the cerebral cortex as well as regulating consciousness, sleep, and alertness. The disappearance of the head movements while asleep implies that their origin may lie within the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system</b> which {{is a part of the}} motor system that controls coordination of movement. The tracts associated with the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system</b> are controlled by various structures of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The basal ganglia plays a large part in controlling motor function and thus, abnormalities to this system can result in movement disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease and dyskinesia, both of which share commonalities with bobble-head doll syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Extrapyramidal tracts are chiefly {{found in}} the reticular {{formation}} of the pons and medulla, and target lower motor neurons in the spinal cord {{that are involved in}} reflexes, locomotion, complex movements, and postural control. These tracts are in turn modulated by various parts of the central nervous system, including the nigrostriatal pathway, the basal ganglia, the cerebellum, the vestibular nuclei, and different sensory areas of the cerebral cortex. All of these regulatory components can be considered part of the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system,</b> in that they modulate motor activity without directly innervating motor neurons.|$|E

50|$|MRI {{studies have}} shown that {{schizophrenic}} patients not currently taking related medication have a smaller putamen; part of the striatum that plays a very important role in procedural memory. Further studies on the brain reveal that schizophrenics have improper basal ganglia communication with the surrounding <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system</b> that is known to be closely involved with the motor system and in the coordination of movement. The most recent belief is that functional problems in the striatum of schizophrenic patients are not significant enough to seriously impair procedural learning, however, research shows that the impairment will be significant enough to cause problems improving performance on a task between practice intervals.|$|E
5000|$|The vestibulospinal tract is a neural tract in {{the central}} nervous system. Specifically, it is a {{component}} of the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system</b> and is classified as {{a component of the}} medial pathway. Like other descending motor pathways, the vestibulospinal fibers of the tract relay information from nuclei to motor neurons. [...] The vestibular nuclei receive information through the vestibulocochlear nerve about changes in the orientation of the head. The nuclei relay motor commands through the vestibulospinal tract. The function of these motor commands is to alter muscle tone, extend, and change the position of the limbs and head with the goal of supporting posture and maintaining balance of the body and head.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{thought was}} that the <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>system</b> operated entirely independently of the pyramidal system. However, more recent research has provided {{a greater understanding of}} the integration of motor control. Motor control from both the pyramidal and extrapyramidal systems have extensive feedback loops and are heavily interconnected with each other. A more appropriate classification of motor nuclei and tracts would be by their functions. When broken down by function there are two major pathways: medial and lateral. The medial pathway helps control gross movements of the proximal limbs and trunk. The lateral pathway helps control precise movement of the distal portion of limbs. The vestibulospinal tract, as well as tectospinal and reticulospinal tracts are examples of components of the medial pathway.|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that calcitonin, a putative neuromodulator, may influence <b>extrapyramidal</b> motor <b>system</b> by decreasing nigro-striatal dopaminergic function. Since calcitonin is extensively used in aged patients, we have investigated whether calcitonin might influence extrapyramidal motor behavior (haloperidol-induced catalepsy and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity) in rats of different ages. Intracerebroventricular injection of salmon calcitonin (1 micrograms/kg) prevented apomorphine-induced hyperactivity in 2, 7, 18 or 21 month old rats, but potentiated haloperidol-induced catalepsy only in 2 or 7 month old rats.

40|$|The {{medullary}} dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt) {{was recently}} shown {{to belong to}} the supraspinal pain control system; neurons within this nucleus give origin to a descending projection that increases spinal nociceptive transmission and facilitates pain perception [Almeida et al. (1999), Eur. J. Neurosci., 11, 110 - 122]. In the present study, the areas of the brain that may modulate the activity of DRt neurons were investigated by using of tract-tracing techniques. Injection of a retrograde tracer into the DRt resulted in labelling in multiple areas of the brain. In the contralateral orbital, prelimbic, infralimbic, insular, motor and somatosensory cortices labelling was prominent, but a smaller ipsilateral projection from these same areas was also detected. Strong labelling was also noted in the central amygdaloid nucleus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis and substantia innominata. Labelled diencephalic areas were mainly confined to the hypothalamus, namely its lateral and posterior areas as well as the paraventricular nucleus. In the mesencephalon, the periaqueductal grey, red nucleus and deep mesencephalic nucleus were strongly labelled, whereas, in the brainstem, the parabrachial nuclei, rostroventromedial medulla, nucleus tractus solitarius, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the parvocellular, dorsal, lateral and ventral reticular nuclei were the most densely labelled regions. All deep cerebellar nuclei were labelled bilaterally. These data suggest that the DRt integrates information from the somatosensory, antinociceptive, autonomic, limbic, pyramidal and <b>extrapyramidal</b> <b>systems</b> while triggering its descending facilitating action upon the spinal nociceptive transmission.

Infants’ displays of these emotions indicate that they are not cortically related. Similarly, blind children also display emotions, proving that they are subconscious rather than learned. Other subcortical facial expressions include the “knit brow” during concentration, raised eyebrows when listening attentively, and short “punctuation” expressions to add emphasis during speech.
