The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of water per year through two screw turbines {{and is expected to}} <b>generate</b> 400kW — enough energy to power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can <b>generate</b> a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can {{experience}} some side slipping as they roll, they can <b>generate</b> torques about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} contact patch.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to <b>generate</b> tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile and breathing gas mixtures. The usual procedure is to <b>generate</b> schedules for the intended profile and for the most likely contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E

5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered {{up for the}} first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could <b>generate</b> multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously <b>generate</b> different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to <b>generate</b> many tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1986–87, a {{cogeneration}} {{facility was}} added to the central heating plant to <b>generate</b> electricity from the plant's waste heat.

50|$|Every {{homomorphic}} {{image of}} a finitely <b>generated</b> module is finitely <b>generated.</b> In general, submodules of finitely <b>generated</b> modules need not be finitely <b>generated.</b> As an example, consider the ring R = ZX2, of all polynomials in countably many variables. R itself is a finitely <b>generated</b> R-module (with {1} as <b>generating</b> set). Consider the submodule K consisting of all those polynomials with zero constant term. Since every polynomial contains only finitely many terms whose coefficients are non-zero, the R-module K is not finitely <b>generated.</b>|$|R
40|$|Economic {{evaluations}} of alternative electric <b>generating</b> technologies typically rely on comparisons between their expected "levelized cost" per MWh supplied. I demonstrate that this metric is inappropriate for comparing intermittent <b>generating</b> technologies like {{wind and solar}} with dispatchable <b>generating</b> technologies like nuclear, gas combined cycle, and coal. It overvalues intermittent <b>generating</b> technologies compared to dispatchable base load <b>generating</b> technologies. It also likely overvalues wind <b>generating</b> technologies compared to solar <b>generating</b> technologies. Integrating differences in production profiles, the associated variations in wholesale market prices of electricity, and life-cycle costs associated with different <b>generating</b> technologies is necessary to provide meaningful comparisons between them. ...|$|R

5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original.

Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies.
