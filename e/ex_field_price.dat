Regulation has spawned further regulation; soon after one regulatory gap was filled, another appeared. Municipal franchising and price regulation of gas distributors led to state oversight of intrastate gas transmission, which prompted federal regulation of interstate transmission, followed by control of interstate affiliated <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> and later interstate independent <b>field</b> <b>prices.</b> Finally, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) extended federal jurisdiction to all intrastate field sales. ...|$|R
40|$|Deep target {{hydrocarbon}} detection {{is still}} challenging and expensive. Direct hydrocarbon indicators (DHIs) in seismic {{data do not}} correspond to economical hydrocarbon exploration. Due to unreliability in seismic data {{for the detection of}} DHIs, new methods have been investigated. Marine controlled source electromagnet (MCSEM) or Sea bed logging (SBL) is new method for the detection of deep target hydrocarbon reservoir. Sea bed logging has also the potential to reduce the risks of DHIs in deep sea environment. Modelling of real sea environment helps to reduce the further risks before drilling the oil wells. 3 D electromagnetic (EM) modelling of seabed logging requires more accurate methods for the detection of hydrocarbon reservoir. Finite element method (FEM) is chosen for the modelling of seabed logging to get more precise EM response from hydrocarbon reservoir below 4000 m from seabed. FEM allows to investigate the total electric and magnetic fields instead of scattered electric and magnetic fields, which shows accurate and precise resistivity contrast below the seabed. From the modelling results, It was investigated that Hz field shows higher magni- tude with 342 % than the <b>Ex</b> <b>field.</b> It was observed that 0. 125 Hz frequency can be able to show better resistivity contrast of Hz field (31. 30 %) and <b>Ex</b> <b>field</b> (16. 49 %) at target depth of 1000 m below seafloor for our proposed model. Hz and <b>Ex</b> <b>field</b> delineation was found to decrease as target depth increased from 1000 m to 4000 m. At the target depth of 4000 m, no field delineation response was seen from the current electromagnetic (EM) antenna used by the industry. New EM antenna has been used to see the EM response for deep target hydrocarbon detection. It was investigated that novel EM antenna shows better delineation at 4000 m target depth for <b>Ex</b> and Hz <b>field</b> up to 10. 3 % and 15. 1 % respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{assesses the}} impact of the 1978 NGPA on the production technology and cost structure of the U. S. interstate natural gas transmission industry, based on a newly constructed panel of twenty-four major pipeline companies for nine years, 1977 - 1985. The primary focus is the effect of partial deregulation of <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> on the structure of technology and costs, productive growth, technical efficiency, and substitution possibilities between factor inputs. Empirical results indicate the transmission industry is characterized by substantial economies of scale. Since the NGPA was enacted there has been a marked decline in productivity, paralleling the decline in output for the industry. Current regulatory changes to promote open access to pipelines appears to have enabled some firms to mitigate the overall industry productivity decline. Despite the increasing competition within the industry, we found significant differences in the technical efficiency among firms. There has been a slight shift in the structure of production under the NGPA; the industry is becoming more pipeline intensive and energy saving. There appears to be considerable long-run substitution possibilities among most factor inputs. The NGPA instituted a complex structure of partial and gradual decontrol of natural gas <b>field</b> <b>prices.</b> The legislation cost natural gas producers considerable lost revenue by holding average <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> below the unregulated, free-market level.

40|$|Introduction. A {{working paper}} {{entitled}} "Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Prices 1982 - 2002 : Implications for Depletion and Investment Cost" {{was published in}} October 2003 (cited hereafter as Adelman & Watkins [2003]). Since then we have obtained data for 2003 and estimated {{oil and natural gas}} reserve prices for that year. We have also revised our previous estimates of reserve prices for 2001. This addendum paper reports on the nature and significance of the results for 2003 and the revisions to 2001. We have also extended the analysis by adding two new features. First is the expression of reserve prices in real terms [...] previously we had only reported nominal prices. Second, we have estimated levelized or constant <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> that appear to underlie reserve prices, for each year. We refer to these as planning prices. Previously we had only published estimated growth rates in <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> from levels prevailing for a given year, congruent with our estimates of reserve prices. Section 1 of this Addendum paper highlights the 2003 results. Section 2 discusses the revisions for year 2001. Section 3 outlines the nature of the analytical extensions, presents the results, and discusses what they show. Concluding remarks are in Section 4. Adelman & Watkins [2003] included an extensive set of tables in Appendices. The revisions to all these tables to include 2003 and revised 2001 data are attached here as Appendices.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} a {{regulated}} industry undergoing rapid change. For {{the first time in}} its history, following the partial decontrol of <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> in 1978, natural gas is being priced at a level which places it in direct competition with competing fuels, chiefly oil. This change is placing considerable stress on the established institutional relationships in the gas industry and is the source of what has been and will continue to be a protracted public policy debate on the subject. It is the chief purpose of this study to interpret the effect of this change on the gas pipeline segment of the industry and its regulation. A second purpose is to explore the use of information from the capital market's valuation of natural gas pipeline securities, both as a means of characterizing the industry transition in the terms of financial economics and of evaluating the financial performance of the pipelines (and thus indirectly their regulators) during the transition. As such, the continuing decontrol of <b>field</b> <b>prices</b> constitutes a convenient "natural experiment" that allows us to characterize the likely nature of the gas industry of the future and ultimately to evaluate the various proposals for changing it. To accomplish these purposes, the study is divided into five parts. After describing the principal structural characteristics, transactional arrangements and regulatory procedures in the industry, the study investigates the origins and historical evolution of these features. This history is important in establishing the role of natural gas <b>field</b> <b>price</b> and pipeline regulatory policy and market conditions in determining the nature of the transactional arrangements prevalent today in the industry. This section closes with some conventional measures of the extent of the post- 1978 transition and the disequilibrium that now exists between gas market conditions, regulatory policy and industry transactional arrangments. In the next two chapters the tools of modern financial economics are used to characterize the effects of the industry transition on the systematic risk borne by gas pipeline industry investors. A significant secular increase in pipeline industry risk is found to persist during the transition period after 1978, an increase that is found to be directly associated with the partial decontrol of <b>field</b> <b>prices.</b> Other sources of risk are examined including what is termed "contractual leverage" [...] the leverage induced by rigid pipeline contractual relationships. These results are used to evaluate pipeline financial (and thus regulatory) performance during the transition. A significant deterioration in gas pipeline profitability is detected during this period. The study closes with an examination of the industry's transactional arrangements as they serve to allocate these risks under regulatory service obligations. It is observed that the current regulatory regime ratifies the longstanding transactional arrangements which bundle rights to gas reserves with rights to pipeline capacity. A substantial exogenous change in the risk conditions in the industry may require a regulatory regime which allows for more flexibility in gas supply transactions. It is suggested that to achieve this flexibility it may be necessary to unbundle the two types of rights, allowing a separate, unregulated market for gas reserves and production to form. This could lead to the formation of a liquid spot and futures market for gas, with consequential informational advantages for the rest of the market. This unbundling might be achieved with pipeline deregulation or a system of common carriage, the feasibility of which is examined in a preliminary manner. Supported by the U. S. Department of Energy.
