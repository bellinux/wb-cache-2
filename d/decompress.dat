5|$|A diver {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at atmospheric pressure when free-diving or snorkelling will not usually need to <b>decompress</b> {{but it is}} possible to get decompression sickness, or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of decompression equipment {{used to help}} divers <b>decompress,</b> which is the process required to allow divers {{to return to the}} surface safely after spending time underwater at higher pressures.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with altitude, {{and this has}} an effect on the absolute pressure of the diving environment. The most important effect is that the diver must <b>decompress</b> to a lower surface pressure, and this requires longer decompression for the same dive profile.|$|E

30|$|A midline {{laparotomy}} {{revealed that}} both the small and large intestine were significantly dilated. There was no obvious obstructing lesion. The small intestine was <b>decompressed</b> into the caecum. The procedure consisted of <b>decompressing</b> the caecum via a caecostomy tube.|$|R
5|$|Divers {{with long}} {{decompression}} obligations may be <b>decompressed</b> inside gas filled hyperbaric chambers {{in the water}} or at the surface, and in the extreme case, saturation divers are only <b>decompressed</b> {{at the end of}} a tour of duty that may be several weeks long.|$|R
5|$|A wet bell, or open bell, {{is similar}} to a diving stage in concept, but has an air space, open to the water at the bottom in which the divers, or at least their heads, can shelter during ascent and descent. A wet bell {{provides}} more comfort and control than a stage and allows for longer time in the water. Wet bells are used for air and mixed gas, and divers can <b>decompress</b> using oxygen from a mask at 12m.|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to <b>decompress</b> longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically <b>decompress</b> the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E

This means that bzip2 files can be <b>decompressed</b> in parallel, making it a good format for use in big data applications with cluster computing frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark.|$|R

In general, the {{decompression}} {{process may}} produce values outside the original input range of [...] If this occurs, the decoder needs to clip the output values keep them within that range to prevent overflow when storing the <b>decompressed</b> image {{with the original}} bit depth.|$|R
5|$|This {{ability to}} provide {{real-time}} tissue loading data allows the computer to indicate the diver's current decompression obligation, and to update it for any permissible profile change, so the diver with a decompression ceiling {{does not have to}} <b>decompress</b> at any specific depth provided the ceiling is not violated, though the decompression rate will be affected by the depth. As a result, the diver can make a slower ascent than would be called for by a decompression schedule computed by the identical algorithm, as may suit the circumstances, and will be credited for gas elimination during the slower ascent, and penalized if necessary for additional ingassing for those tissues affected. This provides the diver with an unprecedented flexibility of dive profile while remaining within the safety envelope of the algorithm in use.|$|E

25|$|Saturation diving will <b>decompress</b> {{the divers}} {{only at the}} end of the diving contract, in the {{controlled}} and relatively comfortable environment of the saturation system. The schedule will depend on the pressure and breathing gas mixture, not on the duration of exposure.|$|E
40|$|In {{mountain}} area, {{the bedrock}} of the valley side is affected by a thickness of <b>decompressed</b> rock in subsurface (<b>decompressed</b> zone). Groundwater flowing in this zone disrupts the depth geothermal gradients. The evolution of thermal gradients under the <b>decompressed</b> zone depends of groundwater temperature changes into the decom- pressed zone. In this study, the phenomenon is studied from data acquired in exploration drilling prior to the con- struction of the France - Italy transalpine tunnel (High Speed Line project between Lyon and Turin). The study area {{is located in the}} Vanoise siliceous series between Modane and Avrieux (Western Alps, France). Of 31 boreholes, we selected 14 wells showing a natural thermal disturbance (not due to the drilling) linked to the groundwater flow in <b>decompressed</b> zone. The drill holes have a length between 200 and 1380 m and well logs were carried out (gamma log, acoustic log, temperature log, flowmeter log). The rocks are constituted mainly by quartzite with high thermal conductivity or by schist and gneiss with low thermal conductivity. The <b>decompressed</b> zone concerns the quartzite with thicknesses ranging from 50 m to 750 m where groundwater flow imposes a constant temperature throughout the rock thickness. In the very low permeability rocks under the <b>decompressed</b> zone, the thermal gradient shows variations with depth. These variations suggest a water temperature change in the <b>decompressed</b> zone probably due to a paleoclimate event. We used the derived of the equation describing the propagation of a temperature in a 1 D semi-infinite, in response to a sudden temperature disturbance at the boundary of the medium, to estimate the age and the amplitude of temperature change in the <b>decompressed</b> zone. The medium under the <b>decompressed</b> zone is supposed to be initially in a steady state and only conductive. Numerical tests assess that the 1 D model is applicable in the slope context. The results obtained from 13 wells data show a few warming degrees (1 to 4 K) of the <b>decompressed</b> zone occurring about two to four centuries BP. The latest high altitude drilling shows about two degrees cooling of the <b>decompressed</b> zone two centuries ago. The groundwater temperature warming can be due to a type of recharge change with a reduction of the snowmelt contribution or it can be provided by an increase of at- mospheric and rainfall temperature. The observed cooling in the latest drilling can be interpreted as a groundwater flow change caused by the permafrost melting. The temperature change occurs during the end of Little Ice Ag...|$|R

40|$|Tone mapping or range {{reduction}} {{is often used}} in High Dynamic Range (HDR) visual signal compression {{to take advantage of}} the existing image/video coding architectures. Thus, it is important to study the impact of tone mapping on the visual quality of <b>decompressed</b> HDR visual signals. To our knowledge, most of the existing studies focus only on the quality loss in the resultant low dynamic range (LDR) signal (obtained via tone mapping) and typically employ LDR displays for subjective viewing experiments. As a result, it is not clear how tone mapping affects the perceptual quality of the <b>decompressed</b> HDR signal produced by inverse tone mapping. To address that, we present the results and analysis of a comprehensive subjective study in which the <b>decompressed</b> HDR images were displayed on an HDR display. Our study reveals that, indeed, the perceptual quality of the <b>decompressed</b> HDR signal is dependent on the tone mapping method employed...|$|R
25|$|A hydrogen–helium–oxygen (hydreliox) {{gas mixture}} was used during a similar on shore {{scientific}} test dive by three divers {{involved in an}} experiment for the French Comex S.A. industrial deep-sea diving company in 1992. On 18 November 1992, Comex decided to stop the experiment at an equivalent of 675 meters of sea water (msw) (2215fsw) because the divers were suffering from insomnia and fatigue. All three divers wanted to push on but the company decided to <b>decompress</b> the chamber to 650msw (2133fsw). On 20 November 1992, Comex diver Theo Mavrostomos was given the go-ahead to continue but spent only two hours at 701msw (2300fsw). Comex had planned for the divers to spend {{four and a half}} days at this depth and carry out tasks.|$|E
25|$|An {{acoustic}} horn converts large pressure variations {{with a small}} displacement area into a low pressure variation with a large displacement area and vice versa. It does this through the gradual, often exponential increase of the cross sectional area of the horn. The small cross-sectional area of the throat restricts the passage of air thus presenting a high acoustic impedance to the driver. This allows the driver to develop a high pressure for a given displacement. Therefore the sound waves at the throat are of high pressure and low displacement. The tapered shape of the horn allows the sound waves to gradually <b>decompress</b> and increase in displacement until they reach the mouth where they are of a low pressure but large displacement.|$|E
25|$|In a closed-circuit rebreather {{the oxygen}} partial {{pressure}} in the rebreather is controlled, {{so it can be}} maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial {{pressure in the}} breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to <b>decompress.</b> A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen {{at any time during the}} dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.|$|E
