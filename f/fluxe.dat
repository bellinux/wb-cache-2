An international group of scientists from institutions in Germany, the USA, Canada, and Japan (Table 1 and list of Participating Institutions) established a long-term research program based on the initial discovery in 1996 of methane hydrate exposures.

40|$|The air-sea gas {{transfer}} velocity is commonly parameterised via the wind speed at neutral stratification {{of the marine}} atmospheric boundary layer at 10 m height. This quantity known as u 10 is available {{from a variety of}} sources, ranging from satellite scatterometers and passive microwave sensors to model re-ananlyses. Furthermore, more recent parameterisations of the {{gas transfer}} velocity involve parameters such as friction velocity, significant wave height and small-scale sea surface roughness, also obtainable from satellite measurements. This wealth of data together with publically available climatologies of air-sea concentration difference of carbon dioxide allows a calculation of global CO 2 exchange at daily to monthly intervals. However, different sampling techniques and integration times of the various instruments or methodologies mean that parameter values, even if these claim to be measuring the same quantity, can disagree quite substantially. When these measurements are then used for calculations on a large scale such as for the determination of global air-sea gas fluxes, relatively small biases of data from different sources can result in large errors on the order of up to 20 % in carbon dioxide fluxes. This is particularly true when considering parameterisations of the gas transfer velocity which are based on a squared or cubed function of u 10. In this work we analyse data {{from a variety of sources}} and their sampling characteristics. For the calculation of air-sea gas flux we show how the choice of input data defines the uncertainty of the results. Further unknowns such as the parameterisation of gas transfer velocity are discussed.
