5|$|For a {{time after}} the fourth night, Robert cannot find the Number <b>Devil</b> in his dreams; later, however, on the fifth night, Robert finds himself at a desert where the Number <b>Devil</b> teaches him about {{triangular}} numbers {{through the use of}} coconuts. On the sixth night, the Number <b>Devil</b> teaches Robert about the natural occurrence of Fibonacci numbers, which the Number <b>Devil</b> shortens to Bonacci numbers, by counting brown and white rabbits as they reproduce multiple times. By this dream, Robert's mother has noticed a visible change in Robert's mathematical interest, and Robert begins going to sleep earlier to encounter the Number <b>Devil.</b> The seventh night brings Robert to a bare, white room, where the Number <b>Devil</b> presents Pascal's triangle and the patterns that the triangular array displays. On the eighth night, Robert is brought to his classroom at school. The Number <b>Devil</b> arranges Robert's classmates in multiple ways, teaches him about permutations, and what the Number <b>Devil</b> calls vroom numbers (factorials).|$|E
5|$|On {{the ninth}} night, Robert dreams {{he is in}} bed, {{suffering}} from the flu, when the Number <b>Devil</b> appears next to him. The Number <b>Devil</b> teaches Robert about natural numbers, which the Number <b>Devil</b> calls garden-variety numbers, the unusual characteristics of infinite, and infinite series. Robert finds himself at the North Pole, where the Number <b>Devil</b> introduces irrational numbers (unreasonable numbers), as well as aspects of Euclidean geometry, such as vertices (dots) and edges (lines). By the eleventh night, Robert has shown considerable increased interest in mathematics, but questions its validity, to which the Number <b>Devil</b> introduces the concept of mathematical proofs, ending with the Number <b>Devil</b> showing Robert a complicated proof of basic arithmetic. On the twelfth night, Robert and the Number <b>Devil</b> receive an invitation (which names the Number <b>Devil</b> as Teplotaxl) to Number Heaven, as Robert's time with the Number <b>Devil</b> has finished. At Number Heaven, Robert learns of imaginary numbers, which Teplotaxl describes as imaginative numbers, {{as well as the}} Klein bottle. Walking through Number Heaven, Teplotaxl introduces Robert to various famous mathematicians, such as Fibonacci, whom Teplotaxl calls Bonacci, and George Cantor, or Professor Singer. The book ends with Robert in class using his newfound mathematical knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The player plays as Dante {{through seven}} missions, taking over {{halfway through the}} game. His {{gameplay}} {{is similar to that}} of <b>Devil</b> May Cry 3, with him having access to multiple melee and ranged weapons which he gains after boss battles, and being able to cycle through them freely in combat, being no longer limited to equipping two weapons of each type as he was in the previous game. Dante also starts with his four styles, each of which grants him different abilities, but he may now switch them at will with buttons or pads on the controller, unlike in <b>Devil</b> May Cry 3. He also gains the Dark Slayer style near the end of his appearance, which only has one style level. Styles do not level up through experience as in the previous game, but must instead be upgraded like other skills in the shop screen in between missions or at statues. Dante can also enter <b>Devil</b> Trigger; in his <b>Devil</b> Trigger he gains most of the benefits that Nero's <b>Devil</b> Trigger has, though, as he does not have the <b>Devil</b> Bringer, he gets animation and property changes on some of his normal attacks instead.|$|E

5|$|The Utica <b>Devils</b> {{were the}} American Hockey League (AHL) {{affiliate}} {{team of the}} New Jersey <b>Devils</b> from 1987 to 1993, then the Albany River Rats from 1993 to 2006. The affiliation was broken once the <b>Devils</b> bought the Lowell Lock Monsters and renamed them the Lowell <b>Devils,</b> which in 2010 moved and became the Albany <b>Devils.</b> The Albany <b>Devils</b> moved after the 2016–17 season and became the Binghamton <b>Devils.</b>|$|R

He also {{completed}} a TV film documentary on the <b>Devil's</b> Triangle.|$|R
5|$|The player plays as Nero {{throughout}} most of the game. He is equipped with the Red Queen sword, Blue Rose revolver, and the powers of his <b>Devil</b> Bringer. The Red Queen features an Exceed Gauge that can be charged up, allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes, until the gauge empties. Nero also has the powers of his <b>Devil</b> Bringer, and can use it to pull himself towards enemies or vice versa. The <b>Devil</b> Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's <b>Devil</b> Bringer also gains new abilities {{during the course of the}} game, such as being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs. Nero eventually gains the ability to use <b>Devil</b> Trigger after getting the katana known as Yamato, which increases his <b>Devil</b> Bringer's power, thus changing his <b>Devil</b> Bringer attacks into more powerful versions with different animations.|$|E

5|$|A steam <b>devil</b> is a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam <b>devil</b> to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E

40|$|<b>Devil's</b> gardens’ {{are nearly}} pure stands of the myrmecophyte, Duroia hirsuta, {{that occur in}} Amazonian rainforests. <b>Devil's</b> gardens are created by Myrmelachista schumanni ants, which nest in D. hirsuta trees and kill other plants using formic acid as an herbicide. Here, we show that this ant–plant {{mutualism}} has an associated cost; by making <b>devil's</b> gardens, M. schumanni increases herbivory on D. hirsuta. We measured standing leaf herbivory on D. hirsuta trees and found that they sustain higher herbivory inside than outside <b>devil's</b> gardens. We also measured the rate of herbivory on nursery-grown D. hirsuta saplings planted inside and outside <b>devil's</b> gardens in ant-exclusion and control treatments. We found that when we excluded ants, herbivory on D. hirsuta was higher inside than outside <b>devil's</b> gardens. These results suggest that <b>devil's</b> gardens are a concentrated resource for herbivores. Myrmelachista schumanni workers defend D. hirsuta against herbivores, but do not fully counterbalance the high herbivore pressure in <b>devil's</b> gardens. We suggest that high herbivory may limit the spread of <b>devil's</b> gardens, possibly explaining why <b>devil's</b> gardens do not overrun Amazonian rainforests...|$|R
