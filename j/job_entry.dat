This article reviews evidence on ‘what works’, drawing generic lessons from research on locally-focused urban policy initiatives in Great Britain operationalised {{in the context}} of persistent worklessness in many cities. The findings highlight the importance of employer engagement to open up job opportunities, recognising the diverse needs of individuals, the significance of personalised support for those furthest from the labour market, and co-ordination of local provision. It is argued that providers need to ensure workless groups have the skills and support to access opportunities created by economic growth.

40|$|Britain, perhaps uniquely, has {{experienced}} simultaneoud rises in both wage inequality and polarisation of eployment across households {{over the past}} twenty years. This article investigates the inter-relations of these two trends by examining the changing nature of new jobs and the characteristics of the individuals who fill them. One of the principal reasons why new jobs are increasingly taken by individuals with partners in work is the low wages associated with these jobs. Using a simple matching framework, a rising share of bad, low quality, jobs in the stock of <b>entry</b> <b>jobs</b> can be shown to be consistent with a positive labour supply shock, rising separation rates, cost or productivity shocks, all of which have hit Britain, to some degree, over the past fifteen years. Using household survey data, the paper shows that real entry wages have fallen relative to the wages of those in other <b>jobs.</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>jobs</b> are dominated by high turnover forms of employment, part-time, temporary working and self-employment. Low wage/high turnover forms of working {{are less likely to be}} filled by those from workless households. Rising wage inequality re-enforces employment polarisation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of the {{emergence}} of large retailers (hypermarkets and department stores) on employment in the commerce sector in the regions of Chile. We use a panel with quarterly data from eleven Chilean regions for the period 1996 - 2004. Our results indicate that the entry of large retailers produces a discrete increase in employment in the commerce sector in the quarter that the entry occurs. We also find that there is an additional positive effect on employment throughout the year entry occurs, suggesting that suppliers or other parts of the chain of production follow the large retailer into the local market. However, after {{the first year of the}} entry there is a partial reversion, suggesting that smaller retailers exit or contract in response to the entry of the large retailer. The net effect on employment of the entry of a large retailer is an increase of 300 <b>jobs.</b> <b>Entry,</b> employment, retail...|$|R

In 1976 IBM provided another option, JES3 (<b>Job</b> <b>Entry</b> Subsystem 3), a descendant of ASP (Attached Support Processor), which allows one CPU to manage a single job queue feeding work to several physically distinct CPUs, and therefore allows one operator's console to manage the work of all those CPUs.

40|$|So far little {{empirical}} evidence exists on how real wages of newly hired workers react to business cycle conditions. This paper aims at filling this gap for Germany {{by analyzing the}} cyclical behavior of real wages of newly hired workers while controlling for 'cyclical upgrading' and 'cyclical downgrading' in employee/employer matches over the cycle. The analysis is undertaken for the 1977 to 2009 period using administrative longitudinal matched employer-employee wage data. I find that {{an increase in the}} unemployment rate of one percentage point decreases the real wages of <b>job</b> <b>entries</b> within given firm-jobs by about 1. 27 percent. In light of the magnitude of the entry-wage cyclicality it seems that introducing wage rigidity in the Mortensen-Pissarides model in order to amplify realistic volatility of unemployment is not supported by the data. Further I show that the procyclicality of the employment/population ratio is identical to the procyclicality of real entry wages. This counters the view of many macroeconomists that wages are much less cyclical than employment and unemployment.
