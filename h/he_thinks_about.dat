5|$|Ned {{invites the}} Simpson family to a {{barbecue}} party and announces {{his plans to}} open a store for left-handed people; The Leftorium. During the pulling of a wishbone, Homer, who has been constantly jealous of the material success of Ned and his family, wishes for The Leftorium to be a failure and go out of business. Homer frequently checks in on Ned to ensure that business is going poorly and is happy to see precisely that happening. When Homer sees left-handed citizens struggling with items made for right-handed people, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> informing them about The Leftorium, but decides not to. Eventually the store does indeed close due to lack of business, plunging the Flanders' into debt and misery. Ned is forced to sell his possessions, and Homer gleefully buys many of Ned's things. Homer starts to regret what he did, but when he goes to return Ned's possessions, he finds Ned's house repossessed and the family living in their car. Homer wrestles with the guilt his wish has brought, and tells Ned to open the store for one final day. He then tells all the left-handed residents of Springfield about The Leftorium, and they all travel to the store and buy things. The increase in customers helps Ned keep the store open and get his house back.|$|E
25|$|The song's lyrics {{feature the}} phrase {{identity}} ga nai, umarenai, which leads {{the song and}} feature in the song's chorus. The song's protagonist says that going by measures such as what his favourite clothes, books and food are, he's just a regular person, and that him thinking about the morning's rain {{that led to a}} woman's shirt becoming set were inelegant thoughts. A scene is depicted in the lyrics where someone {{at the beginning of a}} concert compares himself with the other members of the audience, and realises that comparing yourself to others is not a proper way to live. Later, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> childhood memories of defeat, and realises that these memories are his pure self. After understanding this, he feels like he wants to scream, and begins to cry.|$|E
25|$|Hercule Poirot {{is enjoying}} a social visit by Dr. Burton, {{a fellow of}} All Souls who recites sonorously some lines from Homer's Iliad (XXIII, 316 f) and turns the {{conversation}} round {{to the subject of}} Poirot's unusual Christian name and how some of the pagan names parents give to their children do not suit their recipients. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> Poirot's and Sherlock Holmes's mothers sitting together and discussing names for their children. Poirot claims ignorance of the legend of Hercules. The talk turns to Poirot's intention to retire after completing a few cases of interest and personal appeal and Burton laughingly refers to the twelve labours of Hercules. This comment gives Poirot pause for thought and after his visitor has gone, Poirot gets acquainted with the exploits of his legendary namesake, deciding his final cases will mimic Hercules's Twelve Labours.|$|E
5000|$|Metastasio, who {{expected}} {{the music to}} remain subservient to his words, was scandalized. He later wrote to Farinelli, [...] "When Galuppi writes <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> as much <b>about</b> the words as you think of becoming pope; and if <b>he</b> did <b>think</b> <b>about</b> them more, I doubt he would do better." ...|$|R

25|$|Śrībhārgavamithilāgamanam (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवमिथिलागमनम्) In {{only her}} sixth year, Sītā's {{appearance}} {{is like that}} of a sixteen-year-old. Her beauty is described by the poet in 12 verses (13.9–13.20). Janaka realizes that his daughter is the Ādi Śakti of Rāma and no ordinary girl, as she can drag the onerous bow of Śiva as a child. He is concerned about Sītā getting a deserving husband. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the doctrine of Avatāra, having heard verses about it in the Vedas, but his intellect and rationalism make him not believe it. After much contemplation, he concludes that the doctrine must be true. Just then, a doorkeeper announces the arrival of Paraśurāma in Mithilā. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma. Knowing Janaka to be a noble king, Paraśurāma does not consider him to be his enemy, unlike the despotic Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma expresses his wish to see Sītā. Janaka leads him to the sacrificial assembly (Yajñaśālā), where Paraśurāma sees Sītā playing with the bow of Śiva by dragging it like a play-horse. Paraśurāma asks Janaka to hold a Svayaṃvara for Sītā in which the prince who breaks the bow of Śiva will have the right to marry Sītā. Paraśurāma further predicts that Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, will break the bow. Paraśurāma tells Janaka that he will arrive again in Mithilā, pretending to be angry, so that he can have an excuse of seeing both Sītā and Rāma. At the end of the canto Paraśurāma bows to the child Sītā and starts to praise her.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, he {{was opposed}} by Republican Ronald A. Crews, an evangelical pastor, former Georgia state legislator, and {{president}} of the Massachusetts Family Institute. Crews, a national conservative activist, challenged McGovern's positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. McGovern derided his opponent's focus on social issues, saying, [...] "When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the first thing <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> is gay marriage. I don't think that is the most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how {{to make the world a}} more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about." [...] McGovern defeated Crews with 71 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.|$|E
500|$|As {{captain and}} first line centre for Team Canada, Crosby played with {{different}} line mates {{in almost every}} game as the coaching staff struggled to find players capable of keeping pace with the superstar centre at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, and again at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Crosby's fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash of the New York Rangers was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, [...] "I think he's a tough guy to keep up with. He's so fast. The way <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the game seems like it's far beyond everyone else's process. It's {{the same thing in}} the last Olympics, keep shuffling around until you found something that fit.” ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E
500|$|When Lester {{is caught}} masturbating by Carolyn, his angry retort about {{their lack of}} {{intimacy}} {{is the first time}} he says aloud what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> her. By confronting the issue and Carolyn's [...] "superficial investments in others", Lester is trying to [...] "regain a voice in a home that [...] the voices of mother and daughter". His final turning point comes when [...] Angela and he almost have sex; after she confesses her virginity, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object, but as a daughter. He holds her close and [...] "wraps her up". Mendes called it [...] "the most satisfying end to [...] journey there could possibly have been". With these final scenes, Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a [...] "mythical quest". After Lester gets a beer from the refrigerator, the camera pushes toward him, then stops facing a hallway down which he walks [...] "to meet his fate". Having begun to act his age again, Lester achieves closure. As he smiles at a family photo, the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall, onto which blood spatters as a gunshot rings out; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester's death. His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky. Mendes said that Ricky's staring into Lester's dead eyes is [...] "the culmination of the theme" [...] of the film: that beauty is found where it is least expected.|$|E
500|$|Whilst Gwen by {{the third}} series has become a more militant character, Rhys retains his everyman status and takes {{on the role of}} {{audience}} surrogate; press material describes him as [...] "the ordinary guy in the street" [...] and [...] "the normal person's eyes and ears" [...] who [...] "says what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> the situations Torchwood find themselves in, bringing the reality back to them". Paul Collins comments of the significance of Rhys having the first dialogue in the serial, remarking that this is Torchwoods [...] "determination to establish its domestic credentials before subverting them". Rhys becomes a reluctant hero; Kai Owen states that he [...] "would rather not get involved if he had the choice", but when faced with the life-or-death situations in the serial [...] "he doesn't run away from it" [...] because the character has [...] "seen so many things". This, in Owen's eyes, makes the Rhys seen in Children of Earth a [...] "very brave hero who has grown in stature". Rhys retains core character status for the fourth series, [...] Whilst Kai Owen explains that Rhys will always be at the forefront of [...] "Gwen's troubles or fights or adventures" [...] because of his concern for her, he remains unafraid to tell her when she has become too consumed by her job. Davies links the relationship between Gwen and Rhys in the fourth series to the show's continued exploration of human sexuality, stating that [...] "open sexuality has to include everything" [...] including [...] "a husband/wife great big crime-fighting team... happily in love".|$|E

Gabriel goes up near the window to handle a man who is screaming, and the police are prepared to shoot him. However, to prevent Gabriel from using his switch, Michael jumps at him, causing him to divert his path. Gabriel knocks him out, and shortly after injects him with ketamine. Michael suddenly wakes up in his [...] "green reality". Michael is looking for a ring, which is Dr. Wild's. He sees a hallucination of a penguin, caused by the drugs. The penguin tells him that Rex has the ring. He calls him down, and Rex reveals that he stole it for his girlfriend, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). Michael meets Emma and gets the ring back. Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones) claims that he is [...] "having a nightmare about madness". He wakes up in the [...] "red reality" [...] and sees Dr. Lee helping him. The police are coming in to shoot him. Michael quickly phones and tells them to stop, due to the [...] "dead man switch". Gabriel and Michael talk about Gabriel's two reality life. This makes Michael think about his life. Shortly later, Michael and Dr. Evans are talking about his mind. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> his life and tells her that he is okay. During a subsequent discussion, he finds out that Dr. Lee was not really inside his mind; he was actually helping himself.|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{the entire}} band have openly stated their dislike of Union. Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was {{reportedly}} unable to recognise {{any of his}} keyboard work in the final edit and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine. He has since referred to the album as [...] "Onion" [...] because it makes him cry when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> it. Union Co-producer Jonathan Elias later stated publicly {{in an interview that}} Anderson, as the associate producer, knew of the session musicians' involvement. He added that he and Anderson had even initiated their contributions, because hostility between some of the band members at the time was preventing work from being accomplished. The 1991–1992 Union tour united all eight members on a revolving circular stage. Following its conclusion, Bruford chose not to remain involved with Yes and returned to his jazz project Earthworks.|$|E

It premiered at the Siri Fort Auditorium in New Delhi on 29 March 2001 {{as part of}} the National Theatre Festival of National School of Drama. The play depicts Karna's mental agony a day before the Kurukshetra War, as <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> his past and his faith. Mohanlal said, [...] "You cannot compare Kavalam's play with the amateur plays I did. Though there are other characters in the play, the theme revolves around Karna. It is almost like a solo performance. Some of the scenes are really touching and challenging". He acted without payment, saying [...] "I performed for the joy of it ... for my love of our history".|$|E
2500|$|Gabriel Bagradian, {{a wealthy}} Armenian from Paris, has {{returned}} to his native village of Yoghonoluk, one of seven villages in Hatay Province.( [...] Bagradian's character {{was inspired by the}} figure of Moses the Kalousdian, whose Armenian first name was {{the same as that of}} the mountain.) His view is dominated by a familiar and looming presence in this paradisiac landscape—Musa Dagh—which means Mount Moses in Armenian. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> his return to settle the affairs of his dead older brother and entertains pleasant reveries of his childhood, as well as more serious matters. Bagradian feels both proud and estranged from his Armenian roots, and throughout the novel Werfel develops this theme of estrangement, which is denoted with the book’s first sentence - the question [...] "How did I get here?". Bagradian also considers his French wife Juliette and their son Stephan, and how they will adjust to their new environment, given the state of war that now exists and prevents their return.|$|E
