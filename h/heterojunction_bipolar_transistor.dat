50|$|The Heterojunction-emitter bipolar {{transistor}} (HEBT), is a somewhat unusual arrangement {{with respect to}} emitter blocking of minority carriers. This is accomplished by using heterostructure confinement in the emitter, introducing an energy barrier to minority-carrier charge flow from the base. This is important as loss of minority carriers from the base to the emitter degrades analog performance. The main difference of the HEBT from the <b>Heterojunction</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (HBT) is that the emitter-base interface {{is the same as}} in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) with the blocking energy gap being moved back into the emitter bulk region.|$|E

50|$|The <b>hetero{{junction}}</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (HBT) {{is a type}} of bipolar {{junction transistor}} (BJT) which uses differing semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, creating a heterojunction. The HBT improves on the BJT in that it can handle signals of very high frequencies, up to several hundred GHz. It is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly radio-frequency (RF) systems, and in applications requiring a high power efficiency, such as RF power amplifiers in cellular phones. The idea of employing a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT, dating back to a patent from 1951.|$|E

Despite their success, the device was not useful for practical purposes since it only operated at low temperatures - about minus 75 Celsius degrees.|$|E
