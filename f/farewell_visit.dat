She flew off her {{aircraft}} to Gibraltar on 31 January {{and continued on}} to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E

5|$|In June 1976, {{the last}} year of his life, Britten {{accepted}} a life peerage – the first composer so honoured – becoming Baron Britten, of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk. After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We Great Men, for voices and orchestra based on a poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir and orchestra. In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his <b>farewell</b> <b>visit</b> a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We Great Men.|$|E

The following day they visited the Tower of London, and later in the day, Kalākaua received the Holy Cross of Wasa from Sweden's chargé d'affaires. On September 3, the royal party visited the Blenheim Gun and Small Arms Works, where they lunched with several dignitaries. After services at St Paul's Cathedral, Kalākaua bestowed the Royal Order of Kalākaua on Hoffnung for his service during their travels around Europe.

25|$|Kỳ gambled by {{allowing}} Thi {{to return to}} I Corps, ostensibly to restore order. He claimed he allowed Thi {{to return to his}} old area of command as a goodwill gesture, to keep central Vietnamese happy, and because he promised Thi a <b>farewell</b> <b>visit</b> before going into exile. Thi received a rousing reception and the anti-Kỳ protesters became more fervent. Kỳ then sacked the police chief of Huế, a Thi loyalist.

The general activity and excitement rendered it impossible for Charlie to lead {{the life of an}} artistic hermit any longer and he fell into a restless condition which caused Rose to long for the departure of the Rajah when she felt that he would be safe, for these farewell festivities were dangerous to one who was just learning to say [...] "no." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next month}} was a busy one.

In answer to inquiries as to their plans, Mr. Renshaw always replied that at present nothing whatever was settled.

On January 14, 2016, with Rose again sidelined, Moore scored Chicago's first 7 points in overtime as the Bulls overcame both a 24-point deficit and a 4-point overtime deficit to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers.

500|$|Chamberlain's {{fall from}} power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, [...] "Few men can have known such a {{reversal}} of fortune in so short a time." [...] He especially regretted the loss of Chequers as [...] "a place where I have been so happy", though after a <b>farewell</b> <b>visit</b> there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote [...] "I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." [...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. The battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E

We had a {{pleasant}} trip to it, for the Rhine valley is always lovely. The only trouble was that the trip was too short. If I remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours, therefore I judge that the distance was very little, if any, over fifty miles. We quitted the train at Oos, and walked the entire remaining distance to Baden-Baden, {{with the exception of a}} lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon, the weather being exhaustingly warm. We came into town on foot.|$|R

Aziz strongly allied with the United States {{in the fight against}} terrorism, and in a meeting with the American journalist, Aziz maintained that: [...] "Pakistan is now ideally positioned to [...] "work with cooperation rather than confrontation as a force for peace, stability and prosperity..".

2500|$|After {{returning}} to Daulatpur, Bhupen learnt from his college mate Gopaldas Majumdar that Bagha Jatin was soon leaving his {{business as a}} contractor {{in order to go}} back to Kolkata. After a significant <b>farewell</b> <b>visit</b> to Bhupen, Jatin sent a horse to Dr Amulya Ukil of the campus, apparently for the latter's use; thanks to this gift, Bhupen and the other boys took lessons in riding.

On visit to Daulatpur, Subhas Chandra Bose and Hemanta Kumar Sarkar [...] were so impressed by this pageant that during the Kolkata session of the National Congress, in 1928, when Bose organised the Bengal Volunteers in a fully military style, he was happy to have Bhupen by his side.

2500|$|The most {{authoritative}} {{and well}} researched account of General Bond's death {{is provided by}} the book [...] "Red Eagles: America's Secret MiGs" [...] In it, the author states that on 26 April 1984 Bond, who was about to retire, made a <b>farewell</b> <b>visit</b> to [...] "an Air Force Systems Command unit" [...] believed to have been the 6513th Test Squadron, Red Hats, at Groom Lake. The Red Hats, like the 4477th TES Red Eagles based at Tonopah Test Range, clandestinely operated Soviet aircraft. On a previous visit to Groom, Bond had flown the secret YF-117A prototype. The MiG-23 was known as YF-113 in US service and, along with a greater number of MiG-21s, was part of a collection of Soviet-built aircraft that the 4477th flew. Bond insisted on flying the MiG-23 BN fighter-bomber after a cursory briefing over the cockpit rail, even though it was considered a difficult aircraft and pilots usually received several hours of ground instruction before flying it. On his second high-speed flight, he was flying at 40,000 feet and over Mach 2, and had left the T-38 chase plane that was flying with him far behind, when a hydro-mechanical inhibitor activated, preventing him from disengaging the afterburner. It was designed to avoid sudden shut-downs at high speed that could damage the Tumansky R-29 engine, or even cause it to explode and destroy the aircraft. At such speeds, with the wings fully swept back to 72°, the MiG had very limited pitch authority and was inclined to yaw and roll. Bond lost control, made a distress call ("I gotta get out of here") and was then killed in the ejection, when the slipstream broke his neck and shredded the canopy of his parachute. The aircraft crashed in the desert, diving in at a 60° angle and impacting on what is now known as Jackass Flats, part of Area 25 that was still contaminated from NERVA nuclear rocket testing years before. Bond's body was discovered by a USAF sergeant on his way to work, who removed the rank insignia from Bond's flight suit with a pocket knife before going to get help.|$|E

5000|$|In 1823 Francis Farewell, {{formerly}} a {{lieutenant in the}} British navy, with other merchants of Cape Town, formed a company to trade with the natives of the south-east coast. In the brig [...] "Salisbury", commanded by James S. King, {{who had been a}} midshipman in the navy, <b>Farewell</b> <b>visited</b> Port Natal, St Lucia and Delagoa Bays. The voyage was not successful as a trading venture, but Farewell was so impressed with the possibilities of Natal both for trade and colonization that he resolved to establish himself at the port. He went on with ten companions, among them Henry Francis Fynn. All the rest save Farewell and Fynn speedily returned to the Cape, but the two who remained were joined by three sailors, John Cane, Henry Ogle and Thomas Holstead. Farewell, Fynn and the others went to the royal kraal of Shaka, and, having cured him of a wound and made him various presents, obtained a document, dated 7 August 1824, ceding to [...] "F. G. Farewell & Company entire and full possession in perpetuity" [...] of a tract of land including [...] "the port or harbour of Natal". On the 27th of the same month Farewell declared the territory he had acquired a British possession. In 1825 he was joined by King, who had meantime visited England and had obtained from the government a letter of recommendation to Lord Charles Somerset, governor of the Cape, granting King permission to settle at Natal. Farewell, King and Fynn made independent settlements at various parts of the bay.|$|R

It was the turn of Soames to make no answer to that smile and that little farewell wave; he went out into the fashionable street quivering from head to foot. He knew what she had meant to say: [...] "Now that I am going for ever {{out of the reach of}} you and yours--forgive me; I wish you well."
