Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, Pearce.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. This is like a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E

Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling down the windows and the wind was blowing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> horrible, which exactly reflected my mood.

50|$|One way {{in which}} {{cultural}} emphasis is exemplified is a populace talks about the weather. For example, {{in a place where}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> snows a lot, a large collection of words to describe the snow would be expected.|$|R
