500|$|The {{theme of}} [...] "failed or betrayed friendship", in Leng's words, is most evident {{midway through the}} third verse, with the lines [...] "You've got me {{wondering}} how I lost your friendship / But <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> your eyes". Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time. Lennon too had been a friend of Harrison's since school days, and Leng includes him {{as a source of}} Harrison's [...] "minibereavement" [...] at the Beatles' impending demise.|$|E
500|$|Stone Rollin {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} was one of the year's best reviewed records. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 20 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Kellman deemed it not just a [...] "period-piece" [...] but also [...] "the high point of Saadiq’s career, his exceptional output with Tony! Toni! Toné! included", while Kevin Ritchie of Now said he exhibited [...] "the electrifying fervour and meticulous musicianship typical of his stage show" [...] on the record. Steve Horowitz from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "shows off Saadiq's genius as a singer, writer, instrumentalist, and producer of modern rhythm and blues that pays homage to its traditions", adding that it does not have [...] "a false step or even a dull note". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau said Saadiq [...] "plays with himself to beat the band" [...] like Prince and [...] "makes these 10 tracks bump and pulse. And then you notice even the less pneumatic ones connecting as songs." [...] However, he perceived a drop-off from The Way <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>in</b> terms of songwriting and catchiness, singling out [...] "Go to Hell", [...] "Day Dreams", and [...] "Good Man" [...] as the highlights. Slant Magazines Matthew Cole was more critical, finding the record too involved in fabricating retro sensibilities [...] "to leave a lasting impression of its own ... even the highlights are complacent genre exercises".|$|E

And the bridge {{is a piece of}} public property; {{anonymously}} famous; beaming on the incurious dilettante from the walls of a hundred exhibitions. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Salon; <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Academy; <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the last French Exposition, excellently done by Bloomer; in a black-and-white by Mr. A.
