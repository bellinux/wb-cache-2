5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of churches that existed in Visby <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> is unknown, there were {{certainly}} more than in any other Swedish city, and at least twelve within the city walls. Visby grew to become an important trading port <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> and most of the churches in the city were built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The churches were not, as in the countryside, only parish churches. Some belonged to abbeys, almshouses or served groups of traders of a specific nationality, such as the Russian Church or present-day Visby Cathedral, which was originally a church used by German traders.|$|E

5|$|A charter for {{a weekly}} market was granted to Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 1315–16; this {{increased}} {{his status as}} Lord of the Manor and improved local industry. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> the town was visited by King HenryI and in 1324 by EdwardII. Evidence of Eastbourne's medieval past can seen in the 12th century Church of St Mary, and the manor house called Bourne Place.|$|E
5|$|As {{the only}} stable {{long-term}} state in Europe <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging {{forces to the}} East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. From a different perspective, since the 7th century, the evolution and constant reshaping of the Byzantine state were {{directly related to the}} respective progress of Islam.|$|E
50|$|The Emperor Gratian visited Cularo and, {{touched by}} the people's welcome, made the village a Roman city. In honour of this, Cularo was renamed Gratianopolis ("city of Gratian") in 381 (leading to Graignovol <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Age</b> and then Grenoble).|$|R

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{the town}} largely {{depended}} on the abbey but was also a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} dignitaries {{who lived in}} Chadderton's manor houses, Chadderton's {{population}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> comprised a small community of retainers, {{most of whom were}} occupied in farming, either growing and milling of grain and cereal or raising cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. Workers supplemented their incomes by hand-loom spinning and weaving of wool at home. The community was ravaged by an outbreak of the Black Death in 1646.|$|E

5|$|Cranham is {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Craohv and in 1201 as Craweno. It means 'spur of land frequented by crows' and is formed from the Old English 'crāwe' and 'hōh'. It contained two Anglo-Saxon manors of Ockendon (Wochenduna) and Cranham (Crawenho). <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages,</b> and until around the 15th century, it was also known as Bishop's Ockendon because {{a large part of}} its area was owned by the Bishop of London.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan {{culture was}} in decline after {{the rise of}} Christianity and later Islam, but {{interest}} in Egyptian antiquity continued {{in the writings of}} medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>Ages</b> {{sheep farming}} for the wool trade came to {{dominate}} the economy of Exmoor. The wool was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E
