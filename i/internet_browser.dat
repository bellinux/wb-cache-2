5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an <b>Internet</b> <b>browser</b> to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the authors}} propose a new {{approach}} to distributed computing with Web browsers and introduce the WeevilScout prototype framework. The proliferation of Web browsers and the performance gains being achieved by current JavaScript virtual machines raises the question whether <b>Internet</b> <b>browsers</b> can become yet another middleware for distributed computing. With 2 billion users online, computing through <b>Internet</b> <b>browsers</b> has the potential to amass immense resources, thus transforming the Internet into a distributed computer ideal for common classes of distributed scientific applications such as parametric studies. As a proof of concept, the authors demonstrate how a cluster of globally distributed <b>Internet</b> <b>browsers</b> is used to compute thousands of bio-informatics tasks...|$|R

In Japan, mobile phone companies provide immediate notification of earthquakes and other natural disasters to their customers free of charge.

An interactive menu accessible through the phone's <b>Internet</b> <b>browser</b> notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond cellular coverage, as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an AMBER Alert goes out for a missing person in their area.|$|E
