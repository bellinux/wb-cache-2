5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} either side of a large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> at one end.|$|E
25|$|Stuxnet {{requires}} specific slave variable-frequency drives (<b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> drives) to {{be attached}} to the targeted Siemens S7-300 system and its associated modules. It only attacks those PLC systems with variable-frequency drives from two specific vendors: Vacon based in Finland and Fararo Paya based in Iran. Furthermore, it monitors the frequency of the attached motors, and only attacks systems that spin between 807Hz and 1,210Hz. The industrial applications of motors with these parameters are diverse, and may include pumps or gas centrifuges.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the last}} steps in the process before {{reaching}} the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351nm in a device known as a <b>frequency</b> <b>converter.</b> These are made of thin sheets (about 1cm thick) cut from a single crystal of potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When the 1053nm (IR) light passes through {{the first of two}} of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527nm light and the remaining 1053nm light into 351nm (UV) light. IR light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot electrons which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat temporal shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8MJ.|$|E

2500|$|Using amateur-only {{frequencies}} {{provide better}} security and interference characteristics to amateur radio operators. In the past {{it used to}} be easy to use modified consumer grade hardware to operate 802.11 on channels that are outside of the normal FCC allocated frequencies for unlicensed users but still inside an amateur radio band. However, regulatory concerns with the non-authorized use of licensed band frequencies is making it harder. The newer Linux drivers implement [...] that prevents a casual user to operate outside of the country specific operating bands. This requires the use of radio transceivers based on the use of Transverter (or <b>frequency</b> <b>converter)</b> technology.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{effect was}} predicted by Lord Rayleigh {{in his classic}} book on sound: if the source is moving toward the observer at twice the speed of sound, a musical piece emitted by that source would be heard in correct time and tune, but backwards. The Doppler effect with sound is only clearly heard with objects moving at high speed, as change in frequency of musical tone involves a speed of around 40 meters per second, and smaller changes in frequency can easily be confused by changes in the amplitude of the sounds from moving emitters. [...] Neil A Downie has demonstrated [...] how the Doppler effect can be made much more easily audible by using an ultrasonic (e.g. 40kHz) emitter on the moving object. The observer then uses a heterodyne <b>frequency</b> <b>converter,</b> as used in many bat detectors, {{to listen to a}} band around 40kHz. In this case, with the bat detector tuned to give frequency for the stationary emitter of 2000Hz, the observer will perceive a frequency shift of a whole tone, 240Hz, if the emitter travels at 2 meters per second.|$|E

[...] Defenses included a defensive bunker and an inner perimeter with outpost, and a <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> shelter provided the 3 phase 400Hz power needed for precision pointing by the radar's antenna motors. [...] The camouflaged Cassegrain antenna was {{on the roof of}} the operations shelter, while the connected shelter had a rotating identification friend or foe antenna and mast antennas for UHF and VHF communications. [...] A calibration in September 1967 included an estimation of the AN/TSQ-81 antenna coordinates by [...] "fly-in" [...] using aircraft tracked by LS-85 while overflying previously-surveyed nearby peaks (surveyors at the peaks observed the flyover precision).|$|E
