40|$|There are {{substantial}} differences in unemployment durations and reemployment outcomes for workers in different occupations. This paper {{shows that this}} variation can be explained in part by differences in occupational <b>employment</b> <b>risk</b> that arise from two sources: (1) the diversification of occupational employment across industries, and (2) the volatility of industry employment fluctuations, including sectoral comovements.

Applying a competing risk duration model, this analysis finds that unemployed workers in high <b>employment</b> <b>risk</b> occupations have 5. 2 % lower hazard ratios of leaving unemployment to {{a job in the}} same occupation and have 4. 9 % higher wage losses upon reemployment than workers in low <b>employment</b> <b>risk</b> occupations.

In a “publish or perish” environment, hospital and medical curriculum leadership, must be willing to redefine what makes a great student, resident, or clinician when innovations fail [18].

Estimating wage functions we find that job turnover depresses wages at the regional and the firm level, indicating that firms incur significant adjustment costs when experiencing productivity shocks. On the regional level, industrial specialization and diversification mitigate wage depressing effects of different types of employment shocks. On the firm level, shock intensive firms are found to be more productive when being located in spatial proximity to firms with large but opposite employment shocks.

30|$|The first {{argument}} {{contains the}} evolution of a core workforce, which results from firms aiming at profitability and a long-term interest to survive. This approach entails the view that a stable and long-term workforce, protected against <b>employment</b> <b>risks</b> and major competition, shows a highly favorable cost-benefit ratio. According to the transaction cost theory (Williamson 1984, 1985), employers aim at safeguarding revenues resulting from firm-specific investments, such as investments into human capital. Thus, it is more cost-effective to retain a stable workforce and create an internal market than hiring new workers for each new work task (Nienhueser 2014). The individual’s qualification serves therefore as a dominant pattern for both the horizontal and vertical division of labor within a firm. Following the basic logic of stairs, workplaces equal certain skill requirements, which increase step by step. If a worker or employee fulfills the duties of his workplace, it becomes most likely that even the requirements of the next, and more demanding workplace, are met. Thus, those internal climbers generate only low costs for the company.|$|E

We then investigate the mutual insurance role against labour income risks played by the spouses. We insist on the limited insurance provided by the spouses due to limited commitment, and the particularly high default risk in bad times for the couple. The latter risk is all the more important than unemployment alters bargaining powers inside the couple. Finally, this leads us to investigate the institutional framework aimed at protecting individuals/families against labour market hazards (Unemploy- ment Insurance and Employment Protection Legislation) and its interactions with the family.

However, Unemployment Insurance depends very little on family status, once taxes and transfers are taken into account.

40|$|This article uses {{data from}} the European Union Labour Force Survey (EULFS) 2004 for a {{comparative}} analysis of individual and contextual determinants of temporary employment contracts in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Descriptive analyses reveal that temporary contracts are more often involuntary by nature and associated with relatively lower occupational status than permanent contracts in CEE countries compared to Western European average. Individual-level logistic regressions show that the general determinants of temporary employment are rather similar in both parts of Europe, but vary in their strength between countries. To evaluate the impact of macro-level influences on these cross-country differences in temporary <b>employment</b> <b>risks,</b> {{we focus on the}} risk of young people as one group of potential labour market outsiders. In general, young persons have a higher temporary employment risk, but their relative risk varies between countries. We use multi-level models implemented in a two-step estimation procedure and try to explain this cross-country variation with the intervening role of institutional influences under control of macro-structural conditions. Comparing CEE countries and Western European countries shows that neither employment protection of regular contracts nor its interaction with the level of employment protection of temporary contracts affects the young people's risk. Instead, we find a positive association between collective bargaining coverage as a measure of insider-outsider cleavages and the relative temporary employment risk of young persons.

I do this by assigning job seekers a 0, 1, 5, 50, 75 or 100 percent chance of real alternative employment of the same duration and wage as the jobs for which they are applying. I find that job seeker performance is highest and effort is lowest among those assigned the lowest <b>employment</b> <b>risk</b> (a guaranteed alternative job), and performance is lowest and effort highest among those facing the highest <b>employment</b> <b>risk</b> (those without any job guarantee). My findings are consistent with a framework that ties together insights from economics and psychology; performance is an increasing function of effort and an inverse u-shaped function of stress. In the second chapter I exploit the experiment used in chapter one and estimate the employment and wage effects of a short term job. I find the following key results. First, there is a 10. 6 to 13. 9 percentage point increase in average employment during the eight months following the job. Second, there is a sizeable increase in wages. Individuals earn approximately 60 to 67 percent more per day. There is suggestive evidence that individuals are switching into different occupations particularly clerical and related work away from agricultural based activities. Lastly, the estimated returns to the job are larger among those who perform worst on a high stakes numeracy and literacy test.
