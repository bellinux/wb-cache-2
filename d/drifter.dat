The German 5th Half-Flotilla sailed into the Dover Barrage and soon {{came into contact with}} five drifters of the 10th <b>Drifter</b> Division tending the anti-submarine nets and attacked. After hearing gunfire, Flirt—the drifters′ escort—approached the unidentified vessels and challenged them. The boats responded to the British signal with a similar signal. Confused, Flirts commander decided that the approaching vessels were Allied destroyers and that drifters had been attacked by a submarine. An open boat was also launched from Flirt to rescue survivors from the sinking drifters. The German boats attacked the destroyer, surprising the crew.
