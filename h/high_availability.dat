Internal transport is served by a number of bus routes and taxis. Service taxis, which most often operate on fixed routes, are readily available and inexpensive. The two main bus and taxi stations are Abdali (near the King Abdullah Mosque, the Parliament and Palace of Justice) and the Raghadan Central Bus Station near the Roman theatre in the city centre. Popular Jordanian bus company services include JETT and Al-Mahatta. Taxis are the most common way to get around in Amman due their <b>high</b> <b>availability</b> and inexpensiveness.|$|E

In this context it is quite obvious that modern uninterruptible power supply (UPS) have started to exploit improvement strategies to achieve <b>higher</b> <b>availability</b> figures over time.

In this paper the authors compare the availability performance of an UPS with a single core control board with a distributed UPS based on multiprocessor control boards. Additionally, a model for the variations of the failure rate due to environmental changes is proposed.
