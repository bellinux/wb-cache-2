5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the <b>firm</b> <b>is</b> also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the <b>firm</b> <b>is</b> able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} <b>firm</b> <b>is</b> shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a <b>firm</b> <b>is</b> slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study conducts}} {{experiments}} {{to determine the}} modes of communication {{that are able to}} produce and sustain collusion and how the efficacy of communication depends on market structure. Two communication treatments are considered: non-binding price announcements and unrestricted written communication. We find that price announcements are conducive to coordinating on a high price but only under duopoly and when <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> symmetric. The standard experimental finding that collusion without communication is rare when there are more than two <b>firms</b> <b>is</b> shown to be robust to allowing firms to make price announcements. When <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> asymmetric, price announcements do result in higher prices but {{there is little evidence that}} <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> coordinating their behavior. When <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> allowed to engage in unrestricted written communication, coordination on high prices occurs for all market structures. We find that the incremental value to express communication (compared to price announcements) <b>is</b> greater when <b>firms</b> <b>are</b> asymmetric and there <b>are</b> more <b>firms...</b>|$|R
