Our planet, or in a small sense the environment, has the capability to minimize the adverse effects, but now, it is alarming for us to think about it. Dhaka, a megacity in the world, is in the worst situation in terms of environmental perspective. Environmental pollution has crossed its line, degrading the whole environment day by day. High population and large density of vehicle emissions are industrial pollutions that are circulated everywhere, the main culprits to degrade the system (Chowdhury 2006; Islam 2014). The situation is worst in the transition point of the city like bus stands. The major highway like Dhaka Aricha highway is being polluted for vehicle emissions, an industrial pollution that causes the <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Heavy metal contamination of aquatic ecosystems has received much attention because of its toxicity, abundance, and persistence (Arnason and Fletcher 2003). Elevated levels of heavy metals in environmental compartments, such as aquatic soils, may pose a risk to human health due to their transfer in aquatic media and uptake by living organisms, thereby entering the food chain (Sin et al. 2001; Varol and Sen 2012).

40|$|Time-keeping is {{important}} at two levels; to time changes in physiology and behavior within {{each day and}} within each year. For the former, birds have a system {{of at least three}} independent circadian clocks present in the retina of the eyes, the pineal gland, and the hypothalamus. This differs from the situation in mammals in which the input, pacemaker and output are localized in different structures. Each bird clock interacts with at least one other clock and together, they appear to form a centralized clock system that keeps daily time. These clocks have a powerful endogenous component and the daily light-dark cycle entrains them to 24 hours. The timing and duration of life history stages that make up annual cycle of an individual must also be controlled by some form of time-keeping. However, evidence for the existence of an equivalent endogenous circannual clock is less clear. Environmental cues, particularly photoperiod, appear to have a more direct role than simply entraining the clock to calendar time. For example, the timing of migration is probably greatly influenced by photoperiod but its manifestation each day, as Zugunruhe, appears to be under circadian control. Migration involves marked changes in physiology to cope with the energetic demands. There is still much that we do not know about how organisms’ timekeeping systems respond to their natural environment, particularly how salient signals from the environment are perceived and then transduced into appropriately timed biological functions. However, given that changes in environmental input affects the clock, increasing human <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> is likely to adversely affect these systems...|$|E
40|$|Colonization of new habitats, {{which have}} been {{established}} {{as a result of}} a catastrophic <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment,</b> is one of the characteristic repetitive events throughout the Phanerozoic. In recent years, much attention has been paid to investigations focusing on biological recovery of benthic habitats severely disturbed by human activity. In order to improve our environmental and stratigraphical interpretations of such events, we need a more thorough understanding of the processes involved in colonization by one of the most abundant and useful fossil groups, the benthic foraminifera. The present review focuses on processes governing benthic foraminiferal dispersion and colonization patterns in modern environments. For benthic foraminifera, the only active dispersal mechanism is through self-locomotion on or within the sediment and this is considered to be efficient over short distances only. Several passive dispersal methods have been suggested but two seem to be of more general importance. These are dispersal through release and transport of embryonic juveniles and passive suspension and transport of various growth stages. Both are probably important for most benthic foraminifera but the former is likely to be the main mechanism for attached, tubular and larger foraminifera, which are not easily entrained at a later life stage. The latter seems to be a more important dispersion mechanism for benthic foraminifera than previously realized. The colonization rate of soft-bottom substrates is closely related to the hydraulic regime in, and the transit time from, the source area inhabited by species capable of colonizing the new habitat as long as food and other. environmental characteristics are not limiting factors.

Palynological {{analysis}} of organic sediments from a freshwater lake near Port Elizabeth (34 Â°S, 25 Â° 30 'E) {{has provided a}} high- resolution vegetation history of the area for the last 2200 years. Detailed identification and counting of the fossil pollen resulted in the generation of a pollen diagram. Changing frequencies in fossil pollen over time are represented, and inferences are made regarding environmental conditions which influenced the vegetation. A detailed narrative of vegetation history in response to environmental change is presented, and this is compared to results from related studies. The significance of the Lake Farm study site has been noted {{in terms of its}} location as a 'zone of convergence' for a variety of vegetation types. Results of fossil pollen analysis indicate that environmental conditions prior to 1 500 BP were drier than at present. Forest and fynbos vegetation were not well-represented in the pollen spectrum at this time, and it is suggested that they were not favoured by these conditions. Environmental conditions ameliorated after 1500 BP, becoming more mesic, which favoured the proliferation of both forest and fynbos vegetation types. At present xeric and grassland elements are declining, while shrubs increase, indicating an enhanced human-induced disturbance regime. It is suggested that the partial decline in forest elements at present 1 s most likely attributable to human-induced <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> The introduction of exotic trees has been noted (approx. 280 BP) and is seen to have coincided with the influx of european settlers to the region.

How does one group of Native Americans, the Navajos of the southwestern United States deal with environmental issues in such disrupted circumstances? As part of the objectives of this dissertation, I will describe the traditional and modern Navajo environmental beliefs on several development subjects; the effects of these developments on the Navajo people and their lands; and the internal conflicts these issues generate for the Navajo people. ^ The goal of this research is to analyze how contemporary Navajos perceive their environment and their relations to it. How does development, upon which they are heavily dependent, affect how they negotiate these perceptions? In addition, how do Navajos assess their own well being and relationships within the context of development? Specifically the dissertation will emphasize the following research objectives: (1) What is the traditional environmental model used by the Navajo people and how do they view the current degradation of their lands from development using this perspective? (2) What is their assessment of their own well being concerning present environmental concerns and relations with outside institutions and governments concerning development? (3) What are the internal conflicts that arise out of their current environmental debate, and what are the forces that continue to generate these conflicts? (4) Are there different routes available for resolving the tensions and contradictions that exist within Navajo society because of their development and environmental perspective? ^ The theoretical basis of this study is derived from Gregory Bateson 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of human knowledge, communication, culture and experience.

Capillary blood samples were obtained from children aged six to 59 months. Samples were subjected to a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for Plasmodium falciparum detection, whilst haemoglobin (Hb) was measured to determine anaemia. Additionally, mothers were interviewed with a malaria-related knowledge, attitudes and practices questionnaire.; A total of 339 children and 235 mothers participated in the surveys. A positive RDT for P. falciparum was found in 69 % of the children, whilst 72 % of the children were anaemic (Hb > 11 g/dl). Plasmodium falciparum infection was significantly associated with anaemia (odds ratio (OR) 7. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 97 - 13. 89), access to a health facility (OR 5. 59, 95 % CI 1. 81 - 17. 32) and age (OR 0. 04, 95 % CI 0. 01 - 0. 12; youngest (six to 11 months) versus oldest (48 - 59 months) age group).

The colonization rate of soft-bottom substrates is closely related to the hydraulic regime in, and the transit time from, the source area inhabited by species capable of colonizing the new habitat (as long as food and other environmental characteristics are not limiting factors). The transit time depends on the speed of the transporting medium and the distance from the source area. There seems to be two end-processes which can operate during the colonization, depending on whether physically induced or biological processes are allowed to dominate. They are characterized by different colonization patterns. In high energy environments (bottom current velocities often > 20 cm/s), a short transit time may cause the major components of the nearest ambient seafloor assemblages to colonize the new habitat within days. In this case the colonization is simply through a physical transfer of parts of the source community to the new habitat, allowing no time for pioneer, opportunistic assemblages to develop. In low energy environments (bottom current velocities generally < 10 cm/s), the transit time is long for most species. Here, colonization follows the classic metazoan successional pattern with an initial, high abundance pioneer assemblage strongly dominated by small opportunists followed by development of assemblages with increasing numbers of specialized species and recovery can take from one to several years. Initial lack of food (e. g., volcanic ash) or `hostile' substrate properties (e. g., recently reoxygenated or severely contaminated sediments) may delay colonization by months or even years. Small, infaunal species (both calcareous and agglutinated) are among the first and most successful colonizers of soft bottom habitats from shallow waters to the deep sea. Throchospiral agglutinated taxa are among the most abundant colonizers on deep sea hard substrates...|$|E

40|$|On February 3, 1999, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13112 (E. O.) {{which calls}} on state {{transportation}} agencies {{to work to}} prevent and control the introduction and spread of invasive species. Nonnative flora and fauna can cause significant changes to ecosystems, upset the ecological balance, and cause economic harm to our nation’s transportation, environmental, agricultural and recreational sectors. For example, introduced plants, such as Phragmites and purple loosestrife, throughout New York State have choked out native plant species and consequently clogged roadway drainage ways and altered environmental habitat. Transportation systems can facilitate the spread {{of plant and animal}} species outside their natural range. Those species that are likely to harm the environment, transportation safety, human health, or economy are of particular concern. The NYS Department of Transportation maintains approximately 16, 500 miles of highway and annually spends over $ 9. 1 million on vegetation management. Funding for this project is integretated as part of the normal department operational vegetation management budget. The threat from invasive species is increasing with human population growth, global trade and <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> Effectively dealing with the problem of invasive plant species presents a significant conservation challenge, both biologically and politically. The prevention of new plant invasions, early detection and monitoring of infestations of invasive plants, and effective control of established invasions through area-wide partnerships have been identified as key objectives in an overall national strategy for invasive plants. Stopping potentially invasive species before they spread from transportation corridors may be the best option for short-term protection. The department is implementating a proactive environmental initiative to attempt to eradicate certain existing invasive populations, and control the colonization and spread of species that have demonstrated negative effects to natural systems. Highway corridors provide opportunities for the movement of invasive species through the landscape. Invasive plant or animal species can move on vehicles and in the loads they carry. Invasive plants can be moved from site to site during spraying and mowing operations. Weed seed can be inadvertently introduced into the corridor during construction on equipment and through the use of mulch, imported soil or gravel, and sod. Some invasive plant species might be inadvertently planted in erosion control, landscape, or wildflower projects. Thousands of miles of New York State rights-of-ways traverse public and private lands. Many of these adjacent lands have weed problems and the highway rights-of-way provide corridors for further spread. NYSDOT has an opportunity to address roadside vegetation management issues on both their construction activities and maintenance programs with new levels of cooperation and communication with other state agencies and conservation organizations. Under the E. O., Federal-aid and Federal Lands Highway Program funds cannot be used to carry out actions that are likely to cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species in the United States or elsewhere unless all reasonable measures to minimize risk of harm have been analyzed and considered. NYSDOT plans on implementing a 10 -point invasive transportation vegetation management plan consisting of the following components: (1) Developing a prioritized list of threatening flora or fauna based upon regional environments. (2) Field and GIS mapping of existing invasive populations. (3) Integration of invasive species identification and analysis as part of the department’s normal NEPA /SEQR processing. (4) Evaluation of potential impacts caused by construction or maintenance activities. (5) Development of preventive best management practices. (6) Testing, execution and evaluation of eradication measures. (7) Annual reviews and updates of the vegetation management plans. (8) Progression of innovative design solutions to reduce the opportunities for the introduction or spread of invasive species. (9) Promote a climate of interagency cooperation and sharing of coordinated research with public and private sectors. (10) Increase employee and public knowledge through outreach training of the effects of invasive species to the users. An important design component of the plan is consideration of invasive species during all phases of the environmental process. For example, during scoping, discussions with stakeholders should identify the potential for impacts from invasive species and include possible prevention and control measures. The actual NEPA analysis should include identification of any invasive terrestrial or aquatic animal or plant species that could do harm to native habitats within the project study area. In summary, the NYSDOT is committed to the integration of E. O. 13112 as part of the department’s planning, design, construction and operations programs. This E. O. came at an opportune time to become another facet of the department’s nationally recognized transportation environmental initiative...|$|E

Here we present the organic electronic ion pump (OEIP), a polymer-based delivery system exhibiting high spatial, temporal, and dosage precision. Based on electrophoretic transport of positively charged species, the OEIP can deliver - with high precision - an array of biologically relevant substances without fluid flow, thus eliminating convective <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target system's <b>environment.</b> We discuss our results to date, including oscillatory delivery profiles and stimulation of neuronal cells in vitro, as well as our ongoing work...|$|R

It was shown that <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> many sites with smaller tidal range has become feasible, and larger sites in <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 10 GW may now beexploited with less severe <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marine <b>environment.</b> In this context, {{it was pointed out}} that particularly in certain remote regions of Canada, Russia, Alaska, Australia and Patagonia, with tidal power resources far in excess of local requirements, tidal energy may be delivered by pipeline or tanker as hydrogen, or ammonia, or methanol. In these cases, hydrogen electrolyzersare an attractive load for absorbing and retiming power from variable speed tidal turbines. <b>The</b> many benefits <b>of</b> this major environmentally benign energy source were also summarized. It was concluded that tidal energy, particularly linked with hydrogen, must be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal weapons in the fight against globalwarming. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{sequence}} <b>of</b> pathophysiological {{changes that}} can result from <b>the</b> stimulating effects <b>of</b> a sustained <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social <b>environment</b> was studied in ten colonies of socially deprived mice. Sixteen formerly isolated males were placed with 16 normal females in population cages consisting of seven intercommunicating boxes. Six of these socially disturbed 32 -member colonies were terminated after periods of interaction ranging from 2 days to 9 months. The remaining four were terminated {{a month or more}} after the males had been returned to individual isolation. Indirect blood pressure measurements, body and heart weights, and sections of hearts and aortas were studied in the males. Following the shorter exposures, blood pressure reverted to normal in a few days. Exposures of 6 months or more were associated with unchanged body weights and sustained increases in heart weight and blood pressure readings. In addition, there was a significant development of aortic arteriosclerosis and myocardial fibrosis. These changes persisted despite prolonged return to isolation. KEY WORD...|$|R
40|$|Nematodes, the earth's most {{abundant}} metazoa, are ubiquitous in <b>the</b> soil <b>environment.</b> They are sufficiently large to be identifiable by light microscopy and sufficiently small to inhabit water films surrounding soil particles. They aggregate around and in food sources. They include component taxa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil food web at several trophic levels.

40|$|Developing a {{specific}} {{model for a}} tractor-trailer system subject to slips in real working environment is essential for understanding its system behavior. More importantly, the demand for autonomous agricultural vehicles in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a tractor pulling a trailer is increasing because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decrease in the labor supply involved in farming. For such autonomous tractor-trailer, one of its critical elements is the controller. Thus, this thesis analyzes comprehensively <b>the</b> kinematics <b>of</b> a tractor towing a steerable implement under <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> inevitable sliding effects caused by the ground onto the implements and wheels. Furthermore, various nonlinear design methods are also studied {{in order to find}} the most suitable ones of synthesizing controllers for the agricultural vehicle to track a predetermined path. The study firstly presents a kinematic model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tractor-trailer in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> and uncertainties. An error model is then derived, based on the open-loop kinematic model and the desired reference path. By applying basic theory of engineering mechanics for rigid body with slips, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> extra velocities and angles, exerting on rear axles and steered wheel as well as the trailer's implements, the open-loop kinematic model is primarily established. Secondly, with the derived error model, control laws for steering <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> tractor and trailer are constructed to make the car-like mobile robot towing an implement follow either a circle or a straight line. Such controllers are developed by utilizing not only recursive design methods for nonholonomic systems but also a nonlinear proportional integral (PI) scheme. The obtained control laws guarantee the closed-loop plant's stability and robustness against ambient working environment perturbations as well as uncertainties existing inside the system. In establishing of a kinematic model for the tractor-trailer, provided that <b>the</b> current state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle and random <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> are known with bounds, <b>the</b> next states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system can be estimated, the vehicle running path is predicted, along with setting a basis for further controller design. This thesis also provides additional techniques to adjust responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car-like mobile robot towing an implement. Furthermore, constructed controllers can be implemented to make current agricultural vehicles operate autonomously...|$|R
