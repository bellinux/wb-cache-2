25|$|From late 1942 {{through at}} least early 1944, several {{high-ranking}} government officials and military officers made repeated requests for food to be imported from outside India, but the War Cabinet persistently either rejected the requests outright or bargained them down to {{a fraction of the}} original amount. Viceroy Linlithgow began making appeals in mid-December 1942 for the Secretary of State for India, Leo Amery, to request food imports. At first, the requests adopted a nearly apologetic tone, with assurances that the military would be given preference over civilians when imports were distributed. In the first week of January, Amery sent the first of many requests to the UK for food aid in the form of <b>direct</b> <b>imports.</b> Rather than mentioning worsening conditions in the countryside, Amery stressed that Calcutta's industries must be fed or its workers would return to the countryside to help their families. Rather than meeting this request, the UK promised a relatively small amount of wheat that was specifically intended for western India (that is, not for Bengal) in exchange for an increase in rice exports from Bengal to Ceylon.|$|E

50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>Imports</b> are {{products}} imported {{directly into a}} country and not through the manufacturer's authorized agent/distributor.

40|$|This project investigates empirically whether {{retailer}} size influences their <b>direct</b> <b>importing</b> activities. Twenty three Canadian retail sectors are analyzed,classified by {{types of}} commodities {{for the year}} 2002. Two aspects of retailer size are considered, average size and size dispersion of retail establishments in a retail sector. Other explanatory factors include: the share of purchases of imports by wholesalers selling the same product category of each retailer type; Canadian production of the commodities sold in each retail sector, as a fraction of total Canadian production of the year; and three importing sources (the US and Mexico, EU and Japan and Low Cost Asian countries). Only non-highly correlated independent variables are included in each estimation. The best estimation {{suggests that there is}} significant negative correlation between average size of retail establishments and their <b>direct</b> <b>import</b> activities; and there is negative link between size dispersion of retail establishments and their <b>direct</b> <b>import</b> activities...|$|R

50|$|In {{rapidly growing}} {{developing}} economies like India where {{the demand for}} international consumer products is growing much faster than in-country supply from authorized distributors, <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> become {{the only way for}} consumers to procure a large set of products (especially long tail). In many cases, even if a particular product is available from an authorized middle-man, a direct import may cost much less since in-country middlemen use their exclusive territorial rights to price products much higher than in the country of origin. Perversely, in countries where such product and price arbitrage is the most obvious, the import process is typically very onerous and not easily navigated by the average consumer leaving the field open to predatory pricing from in-country middlemen.|$|E

50|$|From the 1750s, American-born slaves of African descent already {{began to}} outnumber African-born slaves. By {{the time of}} the American Revolution, most of the Northern states had {{abolished}} and banned slavery, and some Southern states like Virginia had produced such large and self-sustaining locally-born slave populations by natural increase, that they stopped taking in <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> of slaves from Africa altogether (but still kept slavery, which continued in the South). However, other Southern states like Georgia and South Carolina still relied on constant, fresh supplies of slave labour {{to keep up with the}} demand of their burgeoning plantation economies, so they continued to allow the direct importation of slaves from Africa right up to 1808, only stopping for a few years in the 1770s, because of a temporary lull in the trade brought on by the American Revolutionary War. The continued, direct importation of slaves from Africa ensured that for most of the eighteenth century, South Carolina's black population remained very high, with blacks outnumbering whites three to one, unlike in Virginia, which had a white majority, despite its large black slave population. It was said that South Carolina in the eighteenth century as a British colony looked much more like an extension of West Africa than it did of Britain. All legal, direct importation of slaves from Africa had stopped by 1808, when the now, newly formed United States finally banned its citizens from participating in the international slave trade altogether by law. Despite the ban, small to moderate cargoes of slaves were occasionally being illegally shipped into the United States directly from Africa for many years, as late as 1859.|$|E

40|$|The {{retail price}} for the best-selling {{cigarette}} brand in Austria currently includes 74 percent in taxes, more than {{in any of the}} neighboring countries. The tax rate is lowest in Slovakia (47 percent), the Czech Republic (50 percent) and Switzerland (55 percent). Smokers go to considerable lengths to shop for cheaper cigarettes abroad, especially at the airport duty free shops and at the road border crossing points. Annually, some 266 million people cross into Austria who are entitled to make <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> of a certain quantity of cigarettes. Of them, almost one third are Austrians. The permitted limits for duty-free cigarette imports are normally utilized by just a fraction of those eligible. The current figure for <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> by Austrians declined from 3. 8 to 1. 1 billion cigarettes, in consequence of the limit reduction on July 1, 1997. Low prices for cigarettes and petrol are incentives for shopping trips to the eastern neighbor states. This in turn may lead to increased <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> of other goods and services. A day trip to Czechia or Slovakia is attractive not just for the low prices for food and restaurant meals but even more because of the cheap cigarettes. In Austria, every announcement of a price increase up to the mid 1980 s triggered significant sales before it became effective. Such sales were then more than compensated by slow sales afterwards because consumers used the price increase to restrict their smoking. In later years, that restraint following hoarding purchases has been less pronounced. It appears that the accumulated home stock tempts those smokers not weeded out by anti-smoking campaigns to step up their consumption. The Eastern opening has reduced domestic sales. Initially (1993) moderate, the slackening has accelerated markedly since 1995. For 1996, the drain was calculated at almost 2 billion cigarettes (about 15 percent of domestic sales). This estimate gets some verification from the development in 1997. After import from the Eastern countries was limited to 25 cigarettes per person, sales in Austria grew by more than 15 percent. As expected, Austrian consumers showed little response to changes in cigarette prices. Even income fluctuations did little to affect demand. The older the members of an Austrian household, the smaller will be the part of their income spent on tobacco products. Blue-collar workers spend most on tobacco. Tobacco consumption declines with the level of education achieved. Tabaksteuer und Zigarettenabsatz in Österreich; Tobacco Tax and Cigarette Sales in Austria...|$|E

40|$|The common {{practice}} for finding {{direct and indirect}} import requirements in response to domestic final demand changes involves multiplication of the <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> coefficients matrix by the Leontief inverse matrix of domestic coefficients. The outcome is usually {{referred to as the}} import dependency matrix, a typical element of which gives intermediate import demand, induced by the domestic final demand (policy) sector (column), from the foreign (origin) sector (row). We propose an alternative methodology to capture all three dimensions of import dependency, i. e. origin, destination and policy. The information content of the import dependency matrix is expanded by information on domestic sectors (destination) which demand intermediate imports. Calculations reveal some interesting features of import dependency in Turkey, namely that policy sectors mostly coincide with destination sectors, that oil refinery emerges as a leading destination sector for all, and that raw petroleum is a leading origin sector.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the compilation {{of the use}} table for imported goods and the valuation matrix of trade margins for Belgium in 1995. It introduces the methodological novelty of integrating the compilation of both tables and systematically exploiting the fact that large import and export flows do not generate trade margins. This is notably the case for <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> for intermediate consumption or investment by non-traders, and direct exports by producers. For identifying these trade flows, extensive use was made of intrastat and extrastat data. The results are {{compared with those of}} a proportional distribution of imports and trade margins. Many statistical offices resort to the latter approach {{because of a lack of}} survey data on the destination of trade margins and imports. We demonstrate that the integrated approach can improve the quality of both the import matrix and the valuation matrix for trade margins, while using only existing data sources.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the role}} and impact of foreign investment enterprises in the Czech Republic, distinguishing between greenfield investment and mergers and acquisitions while focusing on manufacturing enterprises. The core {{of the study is}} statistical regression analysis, illustrating trends in foreign direct investment and their impact on the host economy. In the data, each enterprise is characterised by ownership (foreign, domestic) and by how the firm was established in order to identify the firms with foreign capital and to further determine greenfield or mergers and acquisitions status. The main variables used for our analysis are ownership of enterprises, means of establishment, employment, sales (output), own capital, fixed capital, assets, salaries, and value added, investment, i. e., those data recorded by the Czech Statistical Office from the balance sheets and financial statements of enterprises. In addition, for 1998 enterprises also recorded <b>direct</b> <b>imports</b> by each individual firm.
