The ship <b>is,</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> any other ice-strengthened vessel, also capable of running ahead in light ice conditions. The stern is, however, shaped like an icebreaker's bow, and Mastera {{is designed}} to operate independently in the most severe ice conditions of the Baltic Sea. For this purpose the ship is also equipped with two bridges for navigating in both directions. The ship is served by a crew of 15 to 20 depending on operating conditions during winter and maintenance work during summer.|$|E
25|$|Nobb {{suggests}} {{the only way}} the rebels can withstand Griffon is by rebuilding Paznos, a massive mobile fortress. Max and Monica travel to Heim Rada to begin restoring the origin point of the Gundorada Workshop. As they go about rebuilding the village, they are again attacked by the Death Ark. They confront Gaspard and he tells them he <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them; fighting for a parent. He explains that his changeling father died when he was a child, and he and his mother (Rikako Aikawa/Samantha Newark) were run out of town. Eventually, she died, but beforehand, she told him he must find something worth protecting. Gaspard realizes he hasn't found such a thing, and now lives only for hatred. He tells them they must defeat Griffon, and asks if he can join them. However, the magic of Griffon turns him into a dragon and forces him to fight them. They reluctantly kill him. However, a child Gaspard is then shown meeting his mother in their old house, where she tells him she is proud that he found something worth protecting.|$|E

25|$|Tublat (Keith David) – A rogue ape and {{a former}} member of Tarzan's gorilla family. He {{challenged}} Kerchak for leadership but he was defeated and cast out. He is considered dangerous by all the gorillas due to his aggressive and sociopathic behavior. He is based on Kala's husband (and Tarzan's foster father) in the original Tarzan novel. His personality is also very much like the original Kerchak or Terkoz from the novel. Conversely, Kerchak's personality in the 1999 film <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Tublat's in the original novel. He once took over another gorilla family that Gobu belonged to, but inspired by Tarzan the family overthrew him and Gobu replaced him. He often calls Tarzan a hairless runt. He has four toes on his right foot (it is possible he lost one in a fight), and this is one way to tell he is in the area. In the series, he plots to dispose of Tarzan so that he can take over the gorilla pack for himself and makes no secret of his hatred against Tarzan, believing him to be unworthy of leading the gorilla family (despite Tarzan's actual success as a leader of the gorillas).|$|E

500|$|According to Wilentz's {{analysis}} of the session's tapes, Dylan felt {{his way into the}} lyrics of one of his most popular songs, singing [...] "disconnected lines and semi-gibberish" [...] during the earlier takes. He was unsure what the person described in the song does that <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a woman, rejecting [...] "shakes", [...] "wakes", and [...] "makes mistakes". This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored—"not least by her acquaintances among Andy Warhol's Factory retinue"—to be about Edie Sedgwick. The reference to Baby's penchant for [...] "fog... amphetamine and... pearls" [...] suggests Sedgwick or some similar debutante, according to Heylin.|$|E

500|$|Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims, the Red Queen. She is an {{amalgamation}} of two Carroll characters: the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts. Her {{first name}} is a play on the word [...] because she is easily irritated, obstreperous, impatient, and quick to anger. Bonham Carter's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen. The character hates animals, and chooses to use them as servants and furniture. It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband, the King. The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell, a toddler, stating that, [...] "The Red Queen <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> a toddler, because she's got a big head and she's a tyrant." ...|$|E

What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|The first {{formulation}} {{of such a}} functionalist theory was put forth by Putnam himself. This formulation, which is now called [...] "machine-state functionalism", was inspired by analogies noted by Putnam and others between the mind and Turing machines. The point, for functionalism {{is the nature of}} the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as [...] "state one" [...] simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry [...] "ouch", become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth.|$|E

The husband informs Scully, Doggett, and Reyes that they are being watched, and signals to Scully to close the window. He then reveals to Scully that he works for the NSA and has no name. [...] He says he was not there to take William, but was there to retrieve his wife, as he knew she was upset. [...] Patti says their daughter <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> William, and they only want to keep both children safe.

500|$|Following {{the death}} of {{terrorist}} Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a resurgence in the popularity of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] video occurred. The official YouTube video was flooded with comments regarding {{the death of}} bin Laden and it was immediately deemed a celebratory anthem for the event. Moreover, the song's association to his death continued on other social medias, like Facebook and Twitter, and it was played as individuals celebrated outside of the White House. About it becoming an anthem for bin Laden's death, Nitsuh Abebe of New York magazine wrote, [...] "I have to confess that my list of reactions to the news did not get anywhere near 'watch a Miley Cyrus video.' The reason it occurred to others is surely {{as simple as it}} seems: This is a recent hit song whose title is dominated by the words [...] "party" [...] and [...] "U.S.A." [...] Looking for anything more apt would be overthinking it. Cyrus' video [...] is stocked with a great many of those things we like and do well: a drive-in theater, trucks and muscle cars, Daisy Dukes, giant flags. It <b>is,</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> bin Laden's death, another convenient opportunity to celebrate ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{wrote that}} the video is [...] "an eye-popping, herky-jerky, high-fashion" [...] one. He praised the way Knowles [...] " [...] her pelvis in ways never imagined", and the {{wardrobe}} changes in the clip, before concluding: [...] "She expands on her burgeoning robot fetish, flashes the crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways. All {{of which is to}} say that 'Sweet Dreams' <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> every amazingly crazy Beyoncé video from the past three years, which — to extend the point — also means that it's pretty great." [...] Olivia Smith of Daily News noted that in the video, Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie Barbarella (1968), Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears. Smith further compared the video with the one for [...] "Single Ladies", writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she [...] "can only swivel those hips in so many ways". Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described the introductory part of the video as a David Lynch-like mixture of eroticism and symbolism. He {{wrote that the}} video was [...] "one part Victoria's Secret commercial, another part dream logic anti-narrative, and a CGI-assisted freakout all around". Soderberg commended the video for being [...] "an excess of body and action, not filmic techniques", adding that the dancing in the video [...] "blow our minds anew".|$|E

500|$|Just before Cassandra leaves town, {{she tells}} Donna that Matt, {{the man who}} raised her, is not her {{biological}} father. Cassandra tells Donna that her real father is a man named Nick. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Donna's father had been cast and would be introduced the following year. Brian Vriends was given the role of Nick Nixon. Of the introduction of Brian and Nick, executive producer, Susan Bower said [...] "The Freedman family have provided fantastic drama for us so far and we have lots in store for Brian, it's great to have him with us. This is just one of many, many great storylines we have coming up in 2010". Donna discovers that there are two men that could be her father and she contacts them both. Nick Nixon replies first and Donna begins to believe that he is her father. However, Professor Nicholas McKay (Chris Bunworth) later turns up and Donna becomes confused over the situation. Nicholas has just been released from jail and he is keen to do something right. However, he hurts Donna when he tells her that she <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> her mother and that she will run away. Robbie said [...] "He takes a horrible approach". Nicholas' arrival makes Donna more afraid to find out the results of the DNA test she asked Nick to take. On the situation, Robbie said [...] "She's a hopeless romantic and wants the happily ever after – not only with Ringo, but with her family." [...] The DNA test eventually proves that Nick is her real father.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{received}} general acclaim. Taraborrelli {{called it}} a [...] "melancholy and beautifully executed ballad". Author Chris Wade wrote in his book The Music of Madonna that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was a standout from the album. He complimented Madonna and Babyface's vocals, while calling the music [...] "stunning". He declared {{it as one of}} the singer's [...] "purest songs, totally free of any gimmicks, self consciousness or knowing sexual references; a graceful end to the album." [...] Encyclopedia Madonnica writer Matthew Rettenmund {{called it a}} [...] "sentimental ballad with showbiz theme" [...] while finding similarities in the song to that of [...] "Superstar" [...] by The Carpenters. In his review of Bedtime Stories, Billboards Paul Verna called it a [...] "holiday feast for Top 40, rhythm crossover, and AC". Also from Billboard, Larry Flick gave the single a particularly positive review; [...] "The follow-up to the top five smash 'Secret' [...] is as perfect as top 40 fare gets. This single has a delightful, immediately memorable melody and chorus, engaging romance-novel lyrics and a lead vocal that is both sweet and quietly soulful. A lovely way for [...] to kick out '95". J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the song, about [...] "innocent romance" [...] has a [...] "gently cascading melody". Peter Calvin from The Advocate praised the lyrical flow of the song, saying that the [...] "effect is truly heartbreaking. The song... shows that ultimately Madonna... <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> you and me".|$|E
