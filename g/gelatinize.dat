Viewed with a light microscope, the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species.

We prepared four variety of bread: bread containing rice porridge (rice porridge bread), bread containing <b>gelatinized</b> rice flour (<b>gelatinized</b> rice flour bread), and wheat flour and rice flour breads for references. Instrumental analyses the bread samples were carried out by volume measurement of loaf samples, creep test and digital image analysis of crumb samples. Rice porridge bread showed the maximum specific volume of 4. 51 cm 3 /g, and even <b>gelatinized</b> rice flour bread showed 4. 30 cm 3 /g, which was larger than the reference bread samples (wheat and rice flour breads). The values of viscoelastic moduli of <b>gelatinized</b> rice flour bread and rice porridge bread were significantly smaller (p < 0. 05) than those of wheat flour and rice flour breads, which indicates addition of <b>gelatinized</b> rice flour or rice porridge to bread dough encouraged breads softer. Bubble parameters such as mean air- bubble area, number of air-bubble, air-bubble area ratio (ratio of bubble area to whole area) {{were not significantly different}} among the bread crumb samples. Therefore, the bubble structures of the bread samples seemed to similar, which implied that difference of viscoelasticity was attributed to air-bubble wall (solid phase of bread crumb) rather than air-bubble.

If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully <b>gelatinize,</b> leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers.

25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes {{take place in the}} grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and <b>gelatinize,</b> and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow the cooked grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.|$|E
500|$|The gill {{tissue is}} divergent, {{meaning that the}} cells {{are more or less}} {{parallel}} {{near the center of the}} gill, but bend outwards near the end of the gill. The hyphae in this tissue are cylindrical to inflated, thin walled, hyaline (translucent) to yellowish, and measure 2.2–9µm wide; the hyphae in the central strand are narrower and typically cylindrical. The hyphae of the subhymenium (a layer of tissue directly under the hymenium) are interwoven. These hyphae are branched, cylindrical to slightly inflated, hyaline, and [...] 6–9µm wide. The hyphae of the cap cuticle are filamentous, interwoven, and radially arranged. They are cylindrical, 2.7–4µm wide, thin-walled, hyaline to yellowish, and <b>gelatinize</b> when mounted in potassium hydroxide. The cap tissue is also interwoven, with hyphae that are cylindrical to somewhat inflated, 3.7–14.6µm wide, thin-walled, branched, and hyaline to yellowish. Caulocystidia are abundant on the apex of the stem; they are club-shaped to cylindrical, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 3–9µm wide. The annulus tissue comprises interwoven cylindrical hyphae measuring 3–9µm wide. Sphaerocysts (inflated, spherical cells) are also present in the annulus tissue; they are club shaped to ellipsoidal, with dimensions of 29–55 by 30–70µm. The warts on the cap surface (remnants of the universal veil) comprise loosely interwoven cylindrical to inflated thin-walled hyphae that are 3.5–8µm wide.

The sphaerocysts here are ellipsoidal to roughly spherical, hyaline, and measure 35–70 by 20–35µm. In A.gemmata, where they are most abundant in the region just below the cap cuticle, these refractive cells are scattered, and have a width of 3.7–6µm. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of A.gemmata; they are present in the annulus, gill tissue, subhymenium, and cap tissue.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the tribological and rheological properties of liquid and semi-solid food model systems containing micro-granular rice starch. Native (uncooked) and <b>gelatinized</b> rice starch dispersions, o/w emulsions and emulsion-filled gelatin gels were studied as food model systems. Native rice starch particles behaved as active fillers and increased the gel modulus with increasing concentration. At low concentration, soft <b>gelatinized</b> rice starch particles decreased gel modulus. At high concentration, <b>gelatinized</b> rice starch increased the gel modulus due to dense packing of particles. Native and <b>gelatinized</b> rice starch increased friction coefficients with increasing concentration due to different mechanisms. Native rice starch particles increase friction {{probably due to the}}ir irregular shape and particle agglomerations (at high concentration) that indirectly increase surface roughness and asperity contacts. <b>Gelatinized</b> rice starch particles increase friction probably due to the stickiness of leached-out starch polymers. The presence of oil droplets in rice starch-o/w emulsions could reduce the friction caused by stickiness of <b>gelatinized</b> rice starch. The tribological behaviors of rice starch-emulsion-filled gels are more complex than liquids due to the bulk and breakdown properties of the gel matrix. We conclude that morphology and surface properties of the rice starch particles together with bulk and breakdown properties of matrices are the main factors determining the tribological properties of food model systems containing rice starch particles...|$|R
