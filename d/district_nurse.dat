The radio personality Robb Wilton acknowledged {{learning a lot}} from him, and although he felt that Robey [...] "was not very funny", he could time a comic situation perfectly. Similarly, the comedian Charlie Chester admitted that, as a comedian, Robey [...] "still didn't make me laugh," [...] although he described him as [...] "a legend" [...] whose Prime Minister of Mirth character used a beautiful make-up design. Robey's biographer Peter Cotes disagreed with these assessments, praising the comedian's [...] "droll like humour" [...] and comparing it in greatness to Chaplin's miming and Grock's clowning. Cotes wrote: [...] "His Mayor, Professor of Music, Saracen, Dame Trot, Queen of Hearts, <b>District</b> <b>Nurse,</b> Pro's Landlady, and of course his immortal Prime Minister, were all absurdities: rich, outsize in prim and pride, gloriously disapproving bureaucratic petty officialdom at its worst, best and funniest." ...|$|E

However, due to poor viewing figures and a damning critical response the sitcom was not renewed. Regarding the negative reception to the series, her co-star Clive Mantle saracastically remarked [...] "I've seen murderers and rapists get a better press than we did". Lancashire continued to star as Ruth Goddard in Where the Heart Is for its second and third series in 1998 and 1999. In 1998 she was nominated for her second National Television Award for Most Popular Actress. In February 1999 she made a guest appearance in the British dark comedy anthology series Murder Most Horrid alongside comedian Dawn French. The pair played two yachtswoman whose journey ends with fatal repercussions. In April {{it was announced that}} Lancashire would be quitting Where the Heart Is, despite an offered pay rise. At the time, Where the Heart is was the third most popular drama on British Television, regularly attracting 12 million viewers. Lancashire's decision was reportedly influenced by the series filming away from home, and a fear that remaining in the series long term would harm her career. In January 2000 she expanded on her decision, stating that Ruth [...] "was too chocolate-boxy, no longer a challenge".|$|E
40|$|To {{date the}} public health role of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> has been less well defined than in other {{branches}} of community nursing.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> experiences meeting intimate of cancer patients in home care. The study had a qualitative approach with a descriptive design. The sample consisted of ten <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> employed in primary health care, working in emergency duty in a district in the Middle of Sweden. The results are presented from the two categories; to communicate and being competent, which was formulated to one theme. The theme “Being safe in one´s professional role, being aware of possibilities and difficulties when encountering intimates in home care”. The <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> experienced that they had an important role since they had to notice and understand the needs of the intimates as well as to refute and confirm them. To act like ‘a guest’ in the patient's home was important and regarded a respectful behavior towards the family, according to the <b>district</b> <b>nurses.</b> To give intimates ‘time’ was stated urgent and described possible during the nightshifts. According to the <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> well informed intimates felt more secure in their situation. The <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> experienced that it is important to observe and understand the intimate’s body language and empathized that both verbal and non verbal communication must be paid attention. They stated that encountering intimates included answering their questions as well as they could. The <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> felt that it was not always easy to refute the questions asked and they could feel deficiencies in their own capability and competence. Sometimes, encountering intimates, the <b>districts</b> <b>nurses</b> experienced difficulties being professional since they felt lack of ‘tools’.         Keywords: Intimates, cancer, <b>district</b> <b>nurses,</b> nightshift, homecare, encounte...|$|R

An increase in the number and complexity of patients’ needs treated within the community, coupled with the predicted decline in the number of <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> poses a potential supply and demand problem.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} genesis of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> in England, and in particular explores {{the way in which}} <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> became a paid occupation {{over the course of the}} nineteenth century. <b>District</b> <b>nursing</b> is defined as the care of the sick poor within their own homes, which is consistent with a nineteenth, rather than a twentieth, century meaning. At the beginning of the century an occupation of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> did not exist, yet by the end a formal occupation had emerged, and some associations of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> were attempting to create a profession which would attract educated women. In order to explore the processes involved, empirical data were obtained from the records of nineteenth century <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> associations and organisations for their affiliation. These were interpreted and analysed within the theoretical framework of the sociology of work, occupation and professions, the concept of occupation being regarded as crucial in explaining the emergence of <b>district</b> <b>nursing.</b> Since <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> was an exclusively female occupation, particular emphasis is given to the gender division of labour. It was found that social changes associated with urbanisation and the rise of capitalism in an age of enlightenment thinking, facilitated a move from an informal to a paid occupation. This was not, however, a linear progression, since philanthropic pursuit, particularly that of women, played an important role in the formation of most associations and in constructing power relationships. The first associations were Protestant Sisterhoods where subjective labour (Freidson 1978) dominated and controlled the work of paid nurses. By the end of the century most nurses were part of the official economy (Freidson 1978), yet the involvement of philanthropic effort continued. Diversity among emerging associations hindered the development of a unified occupation with a discrete area of work and occupational identity, which in turn circumscribed the attempts of some organisations to create in <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> a profession of educated women...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{posed by}} the current context of health and social care offer opportunities for different models of care delivery. <b>District</b> <b>nursing</b> has evolved, and continues to evolve to meet these challenges. The traditional reactive role of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> has developed as contemporary practice expects <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> to meet both planned and unplanned care required by practice populations. Modern anticipatory care approaches to care are being adopted, while care and case management is being facilitated and delivered to patients and families with complex health and social care needs. Additionally, <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> are recognizing the need to further develop management and leadership skills as the teams delivering care consist of a skill mix of nurses and other disciplines. They are also charged with evidencing the impact {{of what they do}} and influencing care delivery at every level of healthcare organizations. This first paper of two will explore the current UK policy context and ways in which <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> services within each country are changing to meet the challenges posed. A second article will argue the need to ensure the <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> workforce is underpinned by robust educational standards that ensure protection of the public.

40|$|This {{research}} {{produces a}} deeper understanding of the transition of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> from nineteenth century voluntarism to the twentieth century welfare state, with particular emphasis on Leicester within the context of the national scene from 1866 to 1974. The thesis takes Leicester as an example of urban society to explore the collective attributes, networks of expertise and the initiatives that promoted the development of a <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> service for the sick in their own homes. The evidence shows the challenges presented by limited human and financial resources; reveals the range of skills and responsibilities practised by district nurse; traces the course of professionalization through the adoption of national standards; sets out the biographical characteristics and career rhythms of Queen's Nurses, a sub-set of district nursing; and highlights the contribution made by <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> to the empowerment of women. The study exposes the shifting and often contradictory attitudes of society towards <b>district</b> <b>nursing.</b> <b>District</b> <b>nursing</b> was most valued by the recipients of care and by people closest to the service in the community; it was least valued by those who were not in direct contact with <b>district</b> <b>nurses</b> and had little appreciation of the expertise involved. A most telling finding was the attitude of the government and the extent to which that attitude threatened the development of <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> through a lack of recognition of the skills and responsibilities involved. The research shows that throughout the three phases of transition, 1866 - 1908, 1909 - 47, and 1948 - 74, <b>district</b> <b>nursing</b> rose above constraints and hostile policies to build on the traditions and values that lay at its core. The evidence makes a contribution to social policy and the social history of health care in Britain, and points to significant issues for future research and social policy decisions.
