40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of social dialogue for the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model, there has been little attention to the factors that account for social partner engagement with <b>European</b> <b>social</b> dialogue. On the basis of data from 28 <b>European</b> sectoral <b>social</b> dialogue committees, this article investigates structural factors that account for the conclusion of <b>European</b> sectoral <b>social</b> dialogue agreements. It is found that actors' organisational density is a necessary but not sufficient factor for successful <b>European</b> <b>social</b> dialogue and four different categories of sectoral social partner engagement with <b>European</b> <b>social</b> dialogue are identified...|$|R

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model is a {{fundamental}} part of what Europe stands for, but {{a very important issue}} to know is that this model is not only <b>European,</b> not wholly <b>social</b> and not a model. The <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model is not limited to social policy in the narrow sense: welfare, healthcare, pensions, but it includes also employment policy such as labour market rules, equality policies, benefit rules. The <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model is only possible because Europeans accept the importance of the state. <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model, social policy, employment policy, institutional paths...|$|R

40|$|The small {{progress}} {{made in the}} direction of implementing the strategy of the European model – the Lisbon Strategy led the social analysts to talk about the necessity of reinventing the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model.

The ECJ’s Social Model is based on access justice not on social justice.

40|$|This article tackles the {{importance}} of the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Charter in the defense of the social rights of older people {{in the context of the}} major social and economic crisis that is affecting Europe. In a Europe that is dominated by competitiveness concerns and economic interests, the intervention of the <b>European</b> Committee of <b>Social</b> Rights and the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Charter, play an essential role on the maintenance of the social rights of the European citizens, especially of the most disadvantaged population groups. The protection afforded by the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Charter and the national law to the rights of older people is identified, as well as the way our country has been trying to respond to the demands placed upon him by the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Charter in this area. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

The implementation of two such agreements, the Telework and Work-Related Stress Agreements, in four countries and two sectors is investigated. Seven hypotheses, primarily derived {{from the study of}} generic European ‘soft’ law, about {{the factors that}} explain the implementation of <b>European</b> <b>social</b> partner ‘soft’ law are tested. The article concludes that <b>European</b> <b>social</b> partner ‘soft’ law is distinctive from generic European ‘soft’ law in that its successful implementation is contingent upon the extent the industrial relations system in which it is implemented is centralized and co-ordinated...|$|R
50|$|The general {{outlines}} of a <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model {{emerged during the}} post-war boom. Tony Judt lists a number of causes: the abandonment of protectionism, the baby boom, cheap energy, {{and a desire to}} catch up with living standards enjoyed in the United States. The <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy. In recent years, it has become common to question whether the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, globalisation, Europeanisation and an ageing population.|$|R

40|$|Across Europe social {{democracy}} is in crisis. The countries which form its collective home, Britain, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and France, are all currently governed by centre right parties. It seems that change to <b>European</b> <b>social</b> {{democracy is}} essential. The contributors to this volume {{look at what}} kind of change this might be. In the last decade <b>European</b> <b>social</b> democracy has ceased to be about either society or democracy. In government it has embraced liberal economic principles that undermined solidarity and association. Along the way {{the idea of the}} common good has been lost and there is no vision of a 'Good Society'. The authors explore the values of <b>European</b> <b>social</b> democracy, how it can be revived and what kind of political economy it requires in order to thrive. An international group of distinguished academics address these issues and look at how <b>European</b> <b>social</b> democracy can be used the build the Good Society. The Future of <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Democracy also includes a foreword and appendix by the two leaders of the 'Building the Good Society' project on which the book is based, Andrea Nahles and Jon Cruddas...|$|R
40|$|Following ECB-president Draghi's {{remark that}} the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model does {{no longer exist}} and the crisis can only be {{overcome}} {{through a combination of}} austerity and structural reform, this paper examines the consequences of austerity measures and structural reforms adopted during the crisis in a number of EU member states. The hypothesis is that the juxtaposition {{of the end of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model on the one hand, and austerity and structural reform on the other was well chosen. In fact austerity and the structural reforms amount to a veritable attack on the foundations of the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model. The first part of the essay summarizes the discussion on the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model, while the second part describes and compares major austerity measures and structural reforms adopted during the crisis. The third part discusses the impact of the newly established European Economic Governance structure on national economic and social policies. The fourth part deals with the consequences of austerity and structural reform, including for poverty and inequality. The essay ends with some reflections on the role of solidarity and the future of the <b>European</b> <b>Social</b> Model...|$|R
