5|$|The Whiskers are a {{successful}} group of meerkats that own a two-square-mile {{area in the}} Kuruman River Reserve. The group came into existence in 1998, with four Young Ones females and two Lazuli rovers - reinforced with a wild meerkat who had been released nearby (instead of the potjie) from Van Zylsrus. Holly and Argon took <b>dominance</b> till 2000. After Holly died Risca took <b>dominance</b> with Beetle. She evicted some females who formed the Asphodel and Hobgoblin groups. Eleven Vivian rovers emigrated into Whiskers in 2001. Izit won <b>dominance</b> over Basil, despite Basil being older. Basil left to join to Lazuli. Risca and Izit lost <b>dominance</b> and left to form the Gattaca. Vialli and Zaphod became the next dominant pair. After Vialli died, Flower won <b>dominance</b> in 2002. Yossarian overthrew Zaphod taking male <b>dominance</b> but Zaphod overthrew him sometime after. Flower and Zaphod reign then on. The group split Yossarian and Super Furry Animal taking <b>dominance</b> in the splinter till Baddiel overthrew her sister. The Whiskers reunited and Flower and Zaphod took back <b>dominance.</b> Flower evicted Kinkaju and Mozart with two other females who formed the Starsky. Flower succumbed to a snake bite in January 2007. Her daughter Rocket Dog rose to power after her. The Whiskers split in two and formed the Aztecs. After Rocket Dog died in 2008 and Ella established <b>dominance.</b> Five Whiskers males emigrated into the Lazuli kicking out Thundercat who soon joined the Whiskers. The group recently recovered after a low in numbers. Many Whiskers formed or joined other groups. Some males have joined the Whiskers rivals the Lazuli and Commandos. While many groups were formed by Whiskers members such as the two largest group in the KMP today, the Baobab and Kung Fu. With every move recorded on camera by Cambridge University, the Whiskers became famous as {{the stars of the}} hit television series, Meerkat Manor (2005).|$|E

5|$|Homology remains {{controversial}} in animal behaviour, {{but there is}} suggestive evidence that, for example, <b>dominance</b> hierarchies are homologous across the primates.|$|E
5|$|In sheep, {{position}} in a moving flock is highly correlated with social <b>dominance,</b> {{but there is no}} definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.|$|E
5|$|India has {{traditionally}} been the dominant country at the South Asian Games. An example of this <b>dominance</b> is the basketball competition where Team India won {{three out of four}} tournaments to date.|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their <b>dominance</b> {{over each other}} by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same time}} each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves <b>dominance,</b> it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their <b>dominance</b> more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher <b>dominance</b> means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for <b>dominance.</b> Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of female social <b>dominance</b> sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals; in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band {{together to form}} coalitions that displace them. However, many Eulemur species are exceptions and the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) does not exhibit female <b>dominance.</b> When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain <b>dominance</b> varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female aggression is often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.|$|E
5|$|There are no <b>dominance</b> {{hierarchies}} {{among the}} females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form <b>dominance</b> hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable <b>dominance</b> hierarchies. Groups of Central American squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} {{focuses on}} {{the expansion of the}} Holy Roman Empire by integrating the squabbling German duchies under the rule of Frederick Barbarossa, the first Holy Roman Emperor. The first campaign missions sees the player establishing Barbarossa's <b>dominance</b> over the Central European powers of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Bohemia, Burgundy as well as Swabia by collecting relics. Although having established <b>dominance,</b> Barbarossa still finds rivals to challenge his Empire's power in the form of Poland, as well as Henry the Lion, a respected ally of Barbarossa. Henry is spared his life and titles as long as he promises to fully declare allegiance to Barbarossa.|$|E

5|$|Tunbridge Wells local {{elections}} show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party <b>dominance,</b> {{apart from a}} two-year period from 1994 to 1996 of no overall control and a two-year period from 1996 to 1998 when the Liberal Democrats held a majority. The most recent elections, held in May 2008, gave the Conservatives a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats' four. The extent of the Conservatives' <b>dominance</b> is further illustrated {{by the fact that}} in some wards (e.g. Park) Labour did not even field a candidate in the 2008 council elections.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males have}} large cheek flaps {{to show their}} <b>dominance</b> to other males. The cheek flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are {{supported}} by the musculature of the face. Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hokies {{had success}} on defense {{during the first}} quarter, Mississippi {{dominated}} the Hokies defensively {{for the rest of}} the game. Such was the defensive <b>dominance</b> of Mississippi in the last three quarters of the game that after Tech's field goal in the first quarter, the Hokies had 11 offensive possessions and crossed into Ole Miss territory just once.|$|E
5|$|Among the colonies, news of {{the attack}} led to {{rejection}} of British authority {{and the establishment of}} independent governments. It also led the Second Continental Congress to contest British Naval <b>dominance</b> by forming a Continental Navy. Both Mowat and his superior, Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves, who had ordered Mowat's expedition, suffered professionally {{as a consequence of the}} act.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} day, {{following}} 'secret' negotiations, a compromise began to emerge after the Executive Committee moved explicitly to exclude consideration of extra-solar planets and to bring into the definition a criterion concerning the <b>dominance</b> of a body in its neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with this}} ceremony, the AMPAS music branch divided the {{category}} of Best Original Score into two categories: Best Dramatic Score and Best Musical or Comedy Score. This {{was seen as a}} response to the <b>dominance</b> of Walt Disney Feature Animation films in the Original Score and Original Song categories in recent years. Four years later, the two scoring categories were merged back into one category.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} use plumage {{to assess}} and assert social <b>dominance,</b> to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks. Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.|$|E
5|$|By 1963 {{there were}} 600 KFC restaurants, making the company the largest fast food {{operation}} in the United States. KFC popularized chicken in the fast food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established <b>dominance</b> of the hamburger.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf was {{the last}} of a series of Mercian kings, {{beginning}} with Penda in the early 7th century, to exercise <b>dominance</b> over most or all of southern England. In the years after his death, Mercia's position weakened, and the battle of Ellendun in 825 firmly established Egbert of Wessex as the dominant king south of the Humber.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{behavior}} {{between males}} {{has been reported}} {{on a number of}} occasions, and is very similar in form to that seen in many other viperid species. An important factor in sexual selection, it allows for the establishment and recognition of <b>dominance</b> as males compete for access to sexually active females.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>dominance</b> of rugby union {{there have}} been few {{football}} teams of note {{in the history of the}} Rhondda Valleys. Several teams were formed around the end of the 19th century, but most folded during the depression, including Cwmparc F.C. in 1926 and Mid-Rhondda in 1928. The most successful club from the area is Ton Pentre F.C..|$|E
5|$|During the Brood War, the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Fleet {{took control}} of the zerg unaligned with Sarah Kerrigan by {{controlling}} the second Overmind. The enslaved broods {{played a critical role in}} ensuring the UED's temporary <b>dominance</b> of the sector.|$|E
5|$|Early medieval Sogdian costumes can {{be divided}} in two periods: Hephtalitic (5th and 6th centuries) and Turkic (7th and early 8th centuries). The latter did not become common {{immediately}} after the political <b>dominance</b> of the Gökturks but only in c. 620 when, especially following Western Turkic Khagan Ton-jazbgu's reforms, Sogd was Turkized and the local nobility was officially included in the Khaganate's administration.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian rule in Palestine {{resulted}} {{in the destruction of}} Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41. However, the Arraba-based Abd al-Hadi clan which rose to prominence under Egyptian rule for supporting Ibrahim Pasha, continued its political <b>dominance</b> in Jabal Nablus.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes <b>dominance</b> over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|England {{had four}} captains in Gatting, John Emburey, Chris Cowdrey and Graham Gooch, but each Test ended in West Indian <b>dominance.</b> They won each match except the first Test, which was drawn because of rain, and the series {{finished}} 4–0. The West Indies pace attack {{was the main}} difference between teams with Marshall being the most dangerous bowler, taking 35 wickets at an average of 12.65. This included a 7/22 in the third Test which he bowled with a broken left hand. Marshall was supported by Ambrose's bowling which yielded 22 wickets. After this series both teams would go into decline. Many of the great West Indian players such as Richards and Marshall would soon retire, and their <b>dominance</b> of the Test stage was nearing its end.|$|E
5|$|European <b>dominance</b> {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one step further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Federer was {{the first}} to come to {{prominence}} after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004. Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer, and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive weeks from July 2005 to August 2009. Djokovic, from 2007, and later Murray, from 2008, increasingly challenged Federer and Nadal's <b>dominance</b> with seasonal consistency. Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011, and in 2012 the quartet won one Major tournament apiece. In 2011, Nadal declared that his and Federer's period of joint <b>dominance</b> had ended, owing to the ascent of other players, notably Djokovic and later Murray.|$|E
5|$|Female rodents play {{an active}} role in {{choosing}} their mates. Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, <b>dominance</b> and spatial ability of the male. In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males.|$|E
5|$|Following the American Civil War, Texas's economy {{began to}} develop rapidly {{centered}} heavily on cattle ranching and cotton farming, and later lumber., Texas State Historical AssociationMelosi (2007), p. 188 Galveston became the world's top cotton shipping port and Texas' largest commercial center. By 1890, however, Dallas had exceeded Galveston's population, {{and in the early}} 1900s the Port of Houston began to challenge Galveston's <b>dominance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge <b>dominance.</b> The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
