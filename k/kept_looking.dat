Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death.

500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston.

According to Shiban, he was very near death and <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it just seemed right".|$|E

He also was again required to run without Lasix. [...] The horse stayed wide and had a clear trip the entire race, took the lead [...] out and won by [...] lengths.

After {{half an hour of}} coaxing, Frusciante agreed to play the show, though he asserted it would be his last. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "It was the most horrible show ever. Every single note, every single word, hurt, knowing that we were no longer a band. I <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> over at John and seeing this dead statue of disdain... And that night, John disappeared from the topsy-turvy world of the Red Hot Chili Peppers." [...] The band hired guitarist Arik Marshall to complete the rest of the tour, which included Lollapolooza and several European festivals. Marshall, however, was fired {{at the end of the}} tour.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy that rewards every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At first, I was simply pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> at the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E

Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed to be calm, cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I <b>kept</b> <b>looking</b> down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E
