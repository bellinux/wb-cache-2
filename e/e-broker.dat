50|$|In {{the early}} history of {{business}} models it was very typical to define business model types such as bricks-and-mortar or <b>e-broker.</b> However, these types usually describe only one aspect of the business (most often the revenue model). Therefore, more recent literature on business models concentrate on describing a business model as a whole, instead of only the most visible aspects.|$|E
40|$|The Internet and the World Wide Web {{provide a}} global virtual marketplace. However, {{there is little}} {{information}} about the behavior of e-commerce users worldwide. The goal of the paper is twofold. First, we give {{an overview of the}} architecture and implementation of the Miner Family of Web Agents for e-commerce. Then, we present a quantitative study of the user behavior of a large <b>e-broker</b> (i. e., the BookMiner). Considering that the <b>e-broker</b> is used by a large number of users that only speak Portuguese and live in Brazil, we discuss the influence of regional and cultural issues on the e-commerce activities. Although the Web opens a company to a global market, our findings clearly indicate that e-commerce is strongly tied to regional issues, such as language, national customs and regulations, currency conversion and logistics. Also, the Internet infrastructure, mainly the intercontinental links, affects the user behavior. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{behavior}} of e-commerce users based on actual logs from two large non-English <b>e-brokers.</b> We start by presenting a quantitative study of {{the behavior of}} <b>e-brokers</b> and discuss the influence of regional and cultural issues on them. We then discuss a model that quantifies the efficiency of the results provided by brokers in the electronic marketplace. This model is a function of factors such as server response time and regional factors. Our findings clearly indicate that e-commerce is strongly tied to local language, national customs and regulations, currency conversion and logistics, and Internet infrastructure. We found that the behavior of customers of online bookstores is strongly affected by brand and regional factors. Music CD shoppers show a different behavior that might stem from the fact that music is universal and not so language dependent. 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The tough game among <b>e-brokers</b> {{is still}} going on and is {{becoming}} more and more ruthless. The challenges they are facing will determine who will survive and who will be squeezed out of the market. Money they receive from shareholders will not always flow in if they do not prove that they are capable of achieving their break-even point and that will have an impact on stock prices. Thus in the race to attract as many clients as possible they should stop to rethink their strategy. The purpose of this article is to give a few references on the subject of on-line brokerage in order to understand the financial players' strategies on the Internet. We explain the challenges and the brokerage value chain and analyses the problem of the break-even point...|$|R
40|$|Originally XML {{was used}} as astandard {{protocol}} for data exchange in computing. The evolution ofinformation technology has opened upnew situations in which XML {{can be used to}} author, maintain, and deliver content and consequently, new applications of XML occurred. XML serves asadata model and background for databases of XML documents as well as for applications beyond today's data models (hierarchical structures, recursive structures, regular expressions). XML also plays asignificant role as atechnological platform for Semantic web. Amotivational power for XML databases has rootsinapplicationdemands like processing external data (Web pages, other text databases, structured data), E-commerce: lists ofproducts, personalized views ofthese lists orders, invoices in e-commerce, <b>e-brokering,</b> integration ofheterogeneous information sources (e. g. integrated processing data from Web pages and fromtablesofarelational database). To store XML data in adatabase means tomanage large numbers ofXML documents in more effective way. Although this idea looks attractively there is also skepticism from the side ofXML DB developers. For example, M. Kay (Software AG) says: Igenerally argue that XML is designed primarily for information interchange, and that the requirement for storage issecondary. In the world of databases wecan distinguish entities like adatabase model, database schema and query languages. During development XML technology, which includes also XML databases, many database-like approaches have been worked out. Some o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract ECbusiness models like e-brokers on the Web use WWW-based {{distributed}} XML databases. To flexibly model such applications, {{we need a}} modeling {{language for}} EC businesses, specifically, its dynamic aspects or business processes. To this end, we have adopted a query language approach to modeling, extended by integrating active database functionality with it, and have designed an active query language for WWW-based XML databases, called XBML. In this paper, we explain and validate the functionality of XBML by specifying <b>e-broker</b> and auction business models and describe {{the implementation of the}} XBML server, focusing on the distributed query processing in the WWW context. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} different generic <b>e-broker</b> {{models and}} describes the requirements and necessary concepts for establishing a broker service for tiles and related {{products in the}} supply chain of the tile industry. The objective of the service is to introduce innovation into the bidding and procurement processes between tile manufacturers, wholesalers and building contractors. The actors, relations and goods of the supply chain are presented, and the architecture chosen for the electronic marketplace and the support tools are described. The core functionality of the broker service, e. g. data exchange, repository access and negotiation, is outlined by means of UML use cases. The bid preparation and procurement processes of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are still predominantly based on traditional approaches, tools and communication channels [15]. Additionally, the reuse of bidding data in subsequent procurement and order-processing tasks is usually badly supported. Although th...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in the number of E-commerce web sites, Internet users are now able to purchase items from the web. Nevertheless, the large number of E-commerce web sites also brings about the problem of identifying sites that sell the desired products wanted by a potential buyer. To avoid broadcasting the same queries on products to large set of databases maintained at different E-commerce web sites, buyers can rely on a query routing system that matches the queries with the E-commerce database content. Much of the previous work in query routing has focused on databases that are document collections and queries that involve text attributes only. In this paper, we propose a new database selection technique designed for distributed E-commerce databases. The technique deals with queries that involve attributes of different data types. We have incorporated the proposed technique into an agent-based query routing system known as eBroker. The performance of <b>e-Broker</b> for the E-commerce databases of 5 online CD stores will be reported...|$|E
40|$|Coupling of Classes (UML Class Diagram) All auctions {{announce}} their commencement and the item(s) for sale, {{as well as}} a possible reserve price and minimum bid increment. A sealed auction has a publicly announced deadline, and will make no information about the current bids available to any future bidders until the auction is over, at which time the winner(s) is (are) announced. An open auction will make information about current bids available to any future bidders until the auction is over, at which time the winner(s) is (are) announced. One can open an auction with the <b>e-broker</b> operation startAuction(). Currently this can be either an English, a Vickrey or a First Price Sealed Bid Auction, which are described in Table 1. Through polymorphic messaging, the operations of the appropriate type of auction are triggered afterwards. For example, different auctions, closed via stopAuction() will compute the winners in different manners. Moreover, an English Auction has additional operations [...] ...|$|E
