These estimates vary {{because of the difficulty}} in separating genetic and environmental influences. The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.|$|E

5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect <b>individual</b> <b>differences.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the striped}} hyena, {{for which a}} number of {{subspecies}} were proposed in light of its extensive modern range, the spotted hyena is a genuinely variable species, both temporally and spatially. Its range once encompassed almost all of Africa and Eurasia, and displayed a large degree of morphological geographic variation, which led to an equally extensive set of specific and subspecific epithets. It was gradually realised {{that all of this}} variation could be applied to <b>individual</b> <b>differences</b> in a single subspecies. In 1939, biologist L. Harrison Matthews demonstrated through comparisons between a large selection of spotted hyena skulls from Tanzania that all the variation seen in the then recognised subspecies could also be found in a single population, with the only set of characters standing out being pelage (which is subject to a high degree of individual variation) and size (which is subject to Bergmann's Rule). When fossils are taken into consideration, the species displayed even greater variation than it does in modern times, and a number of these named fossil species have since been classed as synonymous with Crocuta crocuta, with firm evidence of there being more than one species within the genus Crocuta still lacking.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{evidence}} of widespread belief in conspiracy theories, {{there remains a}} dearth {{of research on the}} <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> correlates of conspiracist ideation. In two studies, we sought to overcome this limitation by examining correlations between conspiracist ideation and a range of individual psychological factors. In Study 1, 817 Britons indicated their agreement with conspiracist ideation concerning the July 7, 2005 (7 / 7), London bombings, and completed a battery of <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> scales. Results showed that stronger belief in 7 / 7 conspiracy theories was predicted by stronger belief in other real-world conspiracy theories, greater exposure to conspiracist ideation, higher political cynicism, greater support for democratic principles, more negative attitudes to authority, lower self-esteem, and lower Agreeableness. In Study 2, 281 Austrians indicated their agreement with an entirely fictitious conspiracy theory and completed a battery of <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> measures not examined in Study 1. Results showed that belief in the entirely fictitious conspiracy theory was significantly associated with stronger belief in other real-world conspiracy theories, stronger paranormal beliefs, and lower crystallized intelligence.

Experiments of transient thermal exposure were conducted for four subjects and the characteristics of <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> in themoregulatory response were observed quantitatively.

For each subject, the physiological coefficients used in the two-node model were adjusted {{in order to minimize}} the difference between experimental and calculated values in a series of a representative transient state in core and skin temperature. With the combination of the coefficients determined, the skin and core temperatures calculated with the two-node model agreed well with the experimental results for all the subjects involved in the experiments. This shows that the <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> in the regulation of body temperature is well described with the combination of the coefficients determined by the optimization...|$|R

40|$|Recently, <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> scaling {{has become}} one of the most active fields of {{research}} in psychometrics.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study that examined the impact of consumers' three cross-national <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> variables [...] country-of-origin perceptions, consumer ethnocentrism, and country attitudes [...] on their responses and attitudes toward foreign advertisements and advertised products. A model of consumer processing of international advertising has been proposed that consolidates a dual-element thesis comprising research on consumer processing of advertising, and several streams of research on cross-national <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> variables. Empirical analysis of the hypothetical model through structural equation modeling yields supportive results: positive effects of consumers' country attitudes on their responses to the creative presentation of international advertising, and positive effects of consumers' country-of-origin perceptions on their responses to the buying proposal of international advertising. However, the hypothesized negative effects of consumer ethnocentrism on their responses to international advertising was not confirmed. The study contributes to our understanding of cross-national <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> variables that precede and determine consumers' attitudes toward foreign advertisements. It has practical implications for standardization versus localization of international advertising strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{education}} is not to impart knowledge but instead to facilitate a child’s thinking and problem solving skills which can be transferred {{to a range of}} situations. The major purpose of teaching is that of helping students gain knowledge, feelings and valuing skills that they need to function effectively in the society. One way of making students acquire valuing skills is through use of <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> teaching strategy. In this respect, {{the purpose of the study}} was to find out the effect on the use of <b>Individual</b> <b>Difference</b> Strategy in the acquisition of Valuing Skills amongst youths in secondary schools in Kenya. The study was anchored on the Constructivism theory by Brunner and adopted a descriptive survey design biased to quantitative approach that utilize questionnaire to collect data from 13 teachers’ and 309 students. Stratified random sampling technique was employed to select the sample of students and purposive sampling was applied in choice of the teachers. Piloting of instruments was conducted in two schools outside the study area to test reliability, and the validity was established by the expertise of the supervisors. The collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study revealed that both teachers and students opined that using <b>individual</b> <b>difference</b> strategy facilitated youths in secondary schools in the acquisition of valuing skills. The study concluded that Teacher Services Commission (T. S. C) in liaison with Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (K. I. C.
