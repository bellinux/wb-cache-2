5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest <b>iron</b> <b>content)</b> was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine DTPA extractable <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> and some soil properties of peach (Prunus persica L.) orchards, total and 1 N HCl extractable <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> of leaves and investigate their relations with chlorosis. For this purpose, nine peach orchards, each of which included green, slightly chlorotic and severe chlorotic peach trees, were selected. Soil and leaf samples were taken from these orchards for chemical analysis. Soil samples were collected from the top 30 cm and from a 30 - 60 cm depth from the soils under the peach trees variously affected by iron induced chlorosis. Soil analysis revealed that results, in the top 30 cm, soil extractable <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> were negatively correlated with pH, EC and lime (r =- 0. 260 *,- 0. 621 ** and- 0. 298 **) respectively. Negatively significant correlations between extractable iron and exchangeable cations, were also found, but correlations were positively significant with organic matter at both soil depths (r= 0. 595 **, 0. 608 **). Most of the DTPA extractable soil <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> were found higher than the critical concentration range (4. 5 mg kg- 1) despite visually and analytically iron chlorosis determined in the plants. DTPA method is not capable of estimating and monitoring of iron chlorosis in the plants grown on calcareous soils. 1 N HCl extractable active <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> of the leaves were found relevant with the chlorosis degrees (r =- 0. 839 **) and recognized as a better nutritional iron indicator than total iron...|$|R
5|$|When stars form in {{the present}} Milky Way galaxy they are {{composed}} of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium, as measured by mass, with {{a small fraction of}} heavier elements.

5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high <b>iron</b> <b>content.</b> The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli {{contains}} {{at least}} two iron storage proteins, a ferritin (FtnA) and a bacterioferritin (Bfr). To investigate their specific functions, the corresponding genes (ftnA and bfr) were inactivated by replacing the chromosomal ftnA and bfr genes with disrupted derivatives containing antibiotic resistance cassettes in place of internal segments of the corresponding coding regions. Single mutants (ftnA::spc and bfr::kan) and a double mutant (ftnA::spc bfr::kan) were generated and confirmed by Western and Southern blot analyses. The <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> of the parental strain (W 3110) and the bfr mutant increased by 1. 5 - to 2 -fold during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase in iron-rich media, whereas the <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> of the ftnA and ftnA bfr mutants remained unchanged. The ftnA and ftnA bfr mutants were growth impaired in iron-deficient media, but this was apparent only after the mutant and parental strains had been precultured in iron-rich media. Surprisingly, ferric iron uptake regulation (fur) mutants also had very low <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> (2. 5 -fold less iron than Fur+ strains) despite constitutive expression of the iron acquisition systems. The iron deficiencies of the ftnA and fur mutants were confirmed by Mössbauer spectroscopy, which further showed that the low <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> of ftnA mutants are {{due to a lack}} of magnetically ordered ferric iron clusters likely to correspond to FtnA iron cores. In combination with the fur mutation, ftnA and bfr mutations produced an enhanced sensitivity to hydroperoxides, presumably due to an increase in production of “reactive ferrous iron. ” It is concluded that FtnA acts as an iron store accommodating up to 50 % of the cellular iron during postexponential growth in iron-rich media and providing a source of iron that partially compensates for iron deficiency during iron-restricted growth. In addition to repressing the iron acquisition systems, Fur appears to regulate the demand for iron, probably by controlling the expression of iron-containing proteins. The role of Bfr remains unclear...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{quality of}} the kaolin is always {{measured}} by <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> since this element gives undesirable reddish color which limits the usage {{of this type of}} minerals. Reducing the <b>iron</b> <b>contents</b> to increase the value of kaolin by bleaching process is investigated. The effects of factors which can improve the whiteness of kaolin have been studied. The dosage of sodium dithionite, pH value, solid-to-liquid ratio and reaction time were chose as factors based on mono-factor experimental results. Orthogonal experiments were carried out and the optimum processing conditions of the reductive bleaching were obtained as the dosage of sodium dithionite 3 %, pH 2, solid-to-liquid ratio 1 : 3 and reaction time 45 min. After bleaching process described above, we obtained a great improvement in the whiteness from 69. 93 % to 81. 31 % and a decrease of Fe 2 O 3 content from 0. 52 % to 0. 40 % of the kaolin...|$|R
25|$|A new {{workshop}} at Bjørnevatn {{was completed in}} 1973 and the following year a new silo opened at Bjørnevatn, which also allowed for separating out ore with low <b>iron</b> <b>content.</b> Construction of a second pellets facility started in 1972 and was opened on 4 September 1974. This allowed the company's entire production to switch to pellets. Because the two pellets plants used a combined 20,000 tonnes of bentonite each year, a new import dock was built. The pellets production required increased freshwater access. This was fetched from Førstevatn, and to fill that lake, water was pumped from Svartakslavannet.|$|E
