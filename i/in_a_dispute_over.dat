5|$|Beorhtwulf and his wife, Sæthryth, {{may have}} had two sons, Beorhtfrith and Beorhtric. Beorhtric is known from {{witnessing}} his father's charters, but he ceased to do so {{before the end of}} Beorhtwulf's reign. Beorhtfrith appears in later sources which describe his murder of Wigstan, the grandson of Wiglaf, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> Beorhtfrith's plan to marry Wigstan's widowed mother Ælfflæd. Beorhtwulf's death is not recorded in any surviving sources, but it is thought that he died in 852.|$|E

5|$|Plato {{wrote about}} epikleroi in his Laws, {{offering}} idealized laws to govern their marriages. In mythology and history, {{a number of}} Greek women {{appear to have been}} epikleroi, including Agariste of Sicyon and Agiatis, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV. The status of epikleroi has often been used to explain the numbers of sons-in-law who inherited from their fathers-in-law in Greek mythology. The Third Sacred War originated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> epikleroi.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom and the German Empire {{were locked}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> {{control of the}} Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's {{research}} indicates Harrison {{played a key role}} in determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of lumbago.|$|E
5|$|King {{was cast}} as Sarah Palmer in the horror remake of My Bloody Valentine 3D, {{which opened in}} January 2009. She {{appeared}} in the Star Wars-themed comedy Fanboys, which had a release date pushed first to January 2008 when director Kyle Newman received additional funding to shoot new scenes, but the busy schedule of the actors postponed filming. Still delayed, the filmmakers and its distributor, the Weinstein Company, are involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> which version to release.

England and Scotland separately played internationals against various European teams, but the Home Nations withdrew from FIFA <b>in</b> 1928, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> amateurism, and did not rejoin till 1946, missing the first three World Cups.|$|R
5|$|Aristotle related {{that the}} revolt of Mytilene against Athens in 428BCE {{originated}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> epikleroi. The Sacred War of 356–346 BCE, between Thebes and Phocis, was also started by a disagreement over epikleroi. It {{is likely that}} Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon who married Megacles of Athens, was an epikleros. Likewise, the widow of the Spartan king Agis IV, Agiatis, was forced to marry Cleomenes, {{the son of the}} man who had executed Agis, King Leonidas II. Plutarch stated that the reason Leonidas married Agiatis to Kleomenes was that Agiatis was a patrouchos from her father, Gylippos. Another Spartan example may have been Gorgo, the only daughter of King Cleomenes I, who was married to Cleomenes' brother Leonidas I.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed these restrictions. He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> a wage increase.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, I Ching {{interpretation}} {{divided into}} two schools, originating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> minor differences between different editions of the received text. The first school, known as New Text criticism, was more egalitarian and eclectic, and sought to find symbolic and numerological parallels between the natural world and the hexagrams. Their commentaries provided {{the basis of the}} School of Images and Numbers. The other school, Old Text criticism, was more scholarly and hierarchical, and focused on the moral content of the text, providing the basis for the School of Meanings and Principles. The New Text scholars distributed alternate versions of the text and freely integrated non-canonical commentaries into their work, as well as propagating alternate systems of divination such as the Taixuanjing. Most of this early commentary, such as the image and number work of Jing Fang, Yu Fan and Xun Shuang, is no longer extant. Only short fragments survive, from a Tang dynasty text called Zhou yi jijie.|$|E

5|$|In 1071, {{the sixth}} Count of Flanders, Arnulf III, {{was killed in}} the first Battle of Cassel by the forces of Robert the Frisian <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the {{succession}} to the title of count. Although Arnulf was numerically superior and was supported by King Philip I of France, Robert was able to defeat his rival's army and took the title of Count of Flanders with the acquiescence of Philip I after a further five years of struggle. The town was re-fortified, possibly by Robert, with a castle and a new set of walls built on the remains of the old Roman walls. The castle does not survive today – it was already in ruins by the early 18th century – but is depicted on old engravings as a large square tower, the Tour Grise, dominating the western flank of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In 1197, Hubert Walter, who was Archbishop of Canterbury and Justiciar, {{appointed}} William to {{the administration}} of the royal stannaries, or tin mines, and in 1198 William was placed in charge of tin production, an office later known as the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. Under his control the mines became much more lucrative for the king, and accounted for a total of £1100 in William's first year of administration. As part of his administrative work he became the first warden of Lydford Castle after it was constructed in the 1190s. In 1199 he was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the stannaries with another official, Hugh Bardulf, temporarily losing control of them– along with his office as sheriff– in 1200. The reason for the loss of these offices is uncertain. After restoration to office, he remained as Lord Warden of the Stannaries until 1215.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hervik {{said that}} the cartoon {{controversy}} must {{be seen in the}} context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002. Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that Jyllands-Posten and the Danish government were innocent victims <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> freedom of speech inaccurate. Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.|$|E

5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner {{told him that he}} had to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc in the Congress in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 midterm elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa. Kirchner took part in a commission to investigate money laundering with fellow legislator Elisa Carrió, and got into conflicts with her. She ran again for senator in the 2001 midterm elections.|$|E
5|$|The match {{took place}} in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 {{and was the first}} to receive an American {{broadcast}} in prime time. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{route of}} US-50 {{was created in}} 1976. This {{iteration}} of US-50 has its origins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the route of Interstate 70 in Utah. While I-70 was in the planning stage Colorado lobbied for {{an extension of the}} original proposal to run across Colorado and into Utah. Utah supported an extension using then US-6/50 to connect Denver, Colorado with Salt Lake City. However, federal planners did not see value in this route and instead supported a route {{that could be used to}} connect Denver with Los Angeles, California. I-70 was built using the federally selected route. In 1976, US-50 was changed again to a routing mostly concurrent with I-70. The portion of modern US-50 between Delta and Scipio had been previously numbered State Route 26, and the portion between Scipio and Salina had been numbered State Route 63, with the SR-63 portion being transferred to SR-26 in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was acquired, {{along with many}} other Netherlandish and Flemish works, by the Musée du Louvre in 1794, during the plundering of the estates of aristocrats in the years of the French revolutionary army's occupation of the Southern Netherlands. Other works acquired in this way include the centre panels of van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece, Hans Memling's Moreel Triptych and Gerard David's Judgement of Cambyses. Many, including the van der Paele panel, were returned to Bruges in 1816. The return of the panel became entangled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> control and ownership between the French and Dutch-speaking officials of Bruges, but it was entrusted to the Flemish Academy of Bruges. In 1855 it became part of the municipal collections, at first at the Bogaerdeschool Museum, until it became part of the collection of the Groeningemuseum in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Written by Mervyn Haisman & Henry Lincoln, this storyline was {{considered}} around mid-1968. The story {{would be set}} in Scotland in Jamie's ancestral home, Castle McCrimmon, where the Doctor's old foe the Great Intelligence plans to use Jamie's body. At {{the end of the}} story Jamie would remain behind as the new laird. By late April 1968, it was clear that Frazer Hines would be leaving the series sometime during Season Six. One candidate for his departure story was Haisman and Lincoln's third Yeti serial, which they were working on around the start of June. Over the summer, however, the writers became embroiled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> copyright with the BBC regarding the Quarks, robot monsters which had appeared in their previous Doctor Who commission, The Dominators. The ensuing acrimony resulted in the abandonment of The Laird of McCrimmon during August 1968.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Seven moved {{between three}} leagues during this time, {{and for a}} time were {{independent}} of any league. In February 1904, during the CAHL season, Ottawa resigned from the league <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>over</b> the replaying of a game. The team had arrived late for a game in Montreal and the game had been called at midnight, with a tied score. The league demanded that the game be replayed. The club agreed to play only if the game mattered in the standings. The impasse led to Ottawa leaving the league. For the rest of that winter, the club played only in Cup challenge series. Quebec {{went on to win the}} championship of the league and demanded the Stanley Cup, but the Cup's trustees ruled that Ottawa still retained it. The trustees offered to arrange a challenge between Ottawa and the CAHL champion, but the CAHL refused to consider it. The next season, Ottawa joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL), winning the league championship. The club was only in the FAHL for one season, and the Montreal Wanderers became their new rival. For the 1906 season Ottawa, along with the Wanderers and several of the CAHL teams, formed the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), unifying the top teams into one league.|$|E
