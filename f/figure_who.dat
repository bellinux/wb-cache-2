5|$|In this episode, a {{group of}} demons convene in a {{doughnut}} shop to share stories of tempting and damning humans. However, their stories all seem to include one mysterious <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> can see them for who they really are—Frank Black (Lance Henriksen).|$|E
5|$|St. Gatien was ridden {{in most of}} his races by Charles Wood, who won the Championship in 1887. Wood was a {{controversial}} <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> was later “warned off” (banned from racing) for almost nine years for his involvement in illegal betting and suspected race-fixing.|$|E

5|$|The chasms {{that open}} {{throughout}} {{the sea in}} the final moments of the book derive from the Hollow Earth theory. The area closest to the Pole is also, surprisingly, warm rather than cold, as Symmes believed. Symmes also believed there were civilizations inside this Hollow Earth and the enshrouded <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> appears at the end may indicate one such civilization near the Pole.|$|E
5|$|The mythological legends {{regarding}} {{the origin of}} Kerala are Hindu in nature. Kerala produced several saints and movements. Adi Shankara was a religious philosopher who contributed to Hinduism and propagated the philosophy of Advaita. He was instrumental in establishing four mathas at Sringeri, Dwarka, Puri and Jyotirmath. Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was another religious <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> composed Narayaniyam, a collection of verses in praise of the Hindu God Krishna.|$|E
5|$|Varanasi {{remained}} {{the centre of}} activity for intellectuals and theologians during the Middle Ages, which further contributed to its reputation as a cultural centre of religion and education. Several major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir who was born here in 1389, and Ravidas, a 15th-century socio-religious reformer, mystic, poet, traveller, and spiritual <b>figure,</b> <b>who</b> was born and {{lived in the city}} and employed in the tannery industry.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the books}} that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Sanh's {{activities}} in the 1910s, there were {{two members of the}} Nguyễn Dynasty who commanded respect among Vietnamese monarchists. The first was the boy emperor Duy Tân, who was himself deported in 1916 after staging an uprising. Duy Tan's grandfather, Emperor Dục Đức, was the adopted son of the childless Emperor Tự Đức, the last independent emperor of Vietnam. The second <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> was seen by Vietnamese as a possible leader of an independent monarchy was Prince Cường Để. Cường Để was a direct descendant of Emperor Gia Long, who had established the Nguyễn Dynasty and unified Vietnam in its modern state. Cường Để was a prominent anti-colonial activist who lived in exile in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In Bulgarian and South Slavic {{folklore}} in general, Momchil is glorified {{in numerous}} songs and epic tales as a brigand, {{defender of the}} people and a prominent fighter against the Turks. Indeed, some of the earliest heroic songs in Bulgarian folklore tradition deal with Momchil's exploits. In some folklore material, Momchil, referred to as a duke, acts as the uncle of Prince Marko, another legendary <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> in epic poetry is a fighter against the Turks. In the folklore version of Momchil's last battle, his wife, and not the citizens of Peritheorion, betrays him and is to blame for his death. On the other hand, Momchil's legendary sister Yevrosima is described as the mother of Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, {{was first published}} in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title , was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, Anne Frank quickly was identified as an important cultural <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> represented the destruction of youth during the war.|$|E
5|$|Journey is Thatgamecompany's latest game. The player {{controls}} a robed <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> {{wakes up}} in a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination.

5|$|Kesha {{was named}} rights group Humane Society of the United States's first global {{ambassador}} for animal rights, {{for which she}} is expected to bring attention to such practices as cosmetics testing on animals and shark finning. Kesha received the Wyler Award presented by The Humane Society as a celebrity or public <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> increases awareness of animal issues via the media. She received the award March 23, 2013, at The 2013 Genesis Awards Benefit Gala. She also appeared alongside rock singer Iggy Pop in a campaign for PETA, protesting the clubbing of baby seals in Canada and later wrote {{on behalf of the}} organization to fast food chain McDonald's over the conditions of their slaughterhouses.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{determine}} {{that one of}} the dead men belonged to an Islamic terrorist group, the Isfahan, and using the ATM video are able to track down Lauren. A screenshot of the video reveals a blurry <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> appears to be Howard Graves. The agents meet with Lauren at her home and after initially denying it, she admits to the incident but knows nothing about the murders. Upon leaving, the agents find their car going out of control on its own, leading it to crash into another car. At a repair shop, the car is found to have no evidence of tampering, but an electrical charge is detected within it.|$|E
5|$|Paid {{additional}} content was released alongside the games, {{in the form}} of extra levels used to improve the units' strength or gather exclusive resources. A series of additional storylines were also released to expand on the main narrative. The first is Before Awakening, in which the Avatar is transported to Ylisse, the setting of Fire Emblem Awakening, and aids its heroes Chrom, Frederick, and Lissa in fighting off the forces of Valla. The second, Hidden Truths, centers around Awakening characters Owain, Inigo, and Severa as they are contacted by a mysterious <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> asks for their help in saving Valla. To this end, they are given new powers and names: Odin, Laslow, and Selena. The trio ultimately join with the kingdom of Nohr as retainers.|$|E

5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at {{the head}} of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a {{national}} civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of Liberalism and those seeking a return to Absolutism. PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E
5|$|Some Scottish kings {{were very}} {{interested}} in the development of cannon, including the unfortunate James II, who was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460. Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is perhaps the most famous example of a Scottish cannon. James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance <b>figure,</b> <b>who</b> also had a fascination with cannon, both at land and at sea. By 1502, he was able to invest in a Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of cannon — his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners.|$|E
5|$|The Outsider (Billy Lush) {{offers to}} help Corvo in his quest. Described as {{a mixture of}} God and the Devil, The Outsider {{imprints}} his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities, and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart) that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark, and special abilities, to other characters. Smith described the character as an amoral <b>figure</b> <b>who</b> grants abilities, but leaves the choice of {{how to use them}} up to the recipient.|$|E
