5000|$|The French <b>horn,</b> <b>like</b> the German and Vienna horns, {{is usually}} {{referred}} to {{simply as the}} [...] "horn". The bore of the French horn is small, between 10.8 and 11 mm, compared to 11.5 mm for the German horn, but not as small as the Vienna horn at 10.7 mm. A musician who plays the French <b>horn,</b> <b>like</b> the players of the German and Vienna horns, is called a horn player (or less frequently, a hornist). French horns have piston valves (similar to a trumpet's).|$|R

5000|$|It {{is named}} by Giovanni Domenico Santorini. The word [...] "Corniculate" [...] has a Latin root [...] "cornu". Cornu means <b>horn</b> <b>like</b> {{projections}}. The projections of Corniculate cartilage look like [...] "horns" [...] hence the name.|$|R
5000|$|Cyanophages {{like other}} Bacteriophage rely on brownian motion {{to collide with}} bacteria, and then use {{receptor}} binding proteins to recognize cell surface proteins, which leads to adherence. Viruses with contractile tails then rely on receptors found on their tails to recognize highly conserved proteins {{on the surface of}} the host cell. [...] Cyanophages also have several surface proteins with Ig like domains, which are used for adherence. Some cyanophages also produce a <b>horn</b> <b>like</b> structure, which projects from the vertex opposite of the tail. The <b>horn</b> <b>like</b> structure is hypothesized to aid in attachment to cells in the natural environment; however, this has not been confirmed.|$|R

5000|$|Turanoceratops ("Turan horned face") is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur {{from the}} late Cretaceous Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan. The fossils dated from the mid-late Turonian stage, roughly 90 million years ago. The skull bore a pair of long brow <b>horns</b> <b>like</b> those seen in the Ceratopsidae, {{although}} Turanoceratops {{appears to have been}} transitional between earlier ceratopsians and ceratopsids, and not a ceratopsid itself.|$|R
30|$|In {{the industrialized}} {{production}} of low temperature fruiting type mushrooms <b>like</b> <b>Pleurotus</b> eryngi and Flammulina velutipes, usually only one flush of fruitbodies is harvested (biological efficiency 60 – 65 %) because the biological {{efficiency of the}} successive flushes are not high enough (approximately 30 %) to  make a profit where facilities and air cooling systems are expensive. Currently, most of the spent substrate is burnt to generate steam for substrate sterilization and heating of mushroom farms, some spent substrate is used as organic fertilizers in orchards. Nutrients and energy in the substrate is not fully exploited, as evidenced by over 100 % total biological efficiency in non-industrialized mushroom production under natural environmental conditions where 3 – 4 flushes were harvested (Philippoussis et al. 2001; Mandeel et al. 2005). In recent years, many experiments have been conducted to recycle the spent substrate for cultivation of other mushrooms (usually high temperature fruiting types) (Royse 1992; Li 2013).|$|R

40|$|Mushrooms {{have been}} {{cultivated}} worldwide for commercial purposes. However, {{little research has}} been done to ascertain the antibacterial properties of indigenous edible mushrooms. Four species of cultivated and wild varieties were taken for the present study. Among the cultivated species Ganoderma shows inhibitory activity against Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp.,and all other cultivated species <b>like</b> <b>Pleurotus</b> obstreactus, Lentinus edodes, Agaricus bisporus shown no inhibitory activity until 48 hours of incubation. In the wild species strain 1 shows activity against Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus aureus and other strains didn’t show any such activity. The results obtained in this study suggest that the cultivated varieties doesn’t show any antibacterial activity due to alteration of genes and loss of microbial activity by continuous sub culturing from mother spawn and the wild varieties shows some activity confirms that they posses such character in a given natural population...|$|R

50|$|One widely {{familiar}} gazelle is the African species Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni), {{which is}} around 60 to 80 cm in height {{at the shoulder}} and is coloured brown and white with a distinguishing black stripe.

5000|$|Originally {{entitled}} [...] "Dublin Bay", {{the first}} movement of Lincolnshire Posy {{is the shortest}} - a brisk, simple, lilted melody in 6/8 time. The main theme of the movement is presented first in the muted trumpets and bassoon, and is set against a war-like motif in the <b>horns.</b> <b>Like</b> the fourth movement, this movement ends in a serene, suspended pianissimo that contrasts the general tone of the movement as a whole. It is in strophic form.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the five}} {{original}} specimens parts of three skulls were discovered, detached from their owner's body and fragmented. Despite this, the skull {{showed that the}} animal had only small bumps over the eyes rather than full-grown <b>horns</b> <b>like</b> in the more famous ceratopsians such as Triceratops. The nasal horn was thick and low, while its neck frill was moderately large. Unfortunately the specimens were incomplete so it cannot be determined if there were parietal openings in the frill like some other ceratopsians possessed.|$|R
