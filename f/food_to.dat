5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing {{it back into}} the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the <b>food</b> <b>to</b> move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the <b>food</b> <b>to</b> the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E

5|$|When {{the legendary}} donor Karna {{died in the}} epic Mahabharata war, his soul transcended to heaven, where he was offered gold and jewels as food. However, Karna needed real <b>food</b> <b>to</b> eat and asked Indra, the lord of heaven, the reason for serving gold as food. Indra told Karna that he had donated gold all his life, but had never donated <b>food</b> <b>to</b> his {{ancestors}} in Shraddha. Karna said that since {{he was unaware of}} his ancestors, he never donated anything in their memory. To make amends, Karna was permitted to return to earth for a 15–day period, so that he could perform Shraddha and donate food and water in their memory. This period is now known as Pitru Paksha. In some legends, Yama replaces Indra.|$|E

5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated <b>food</b> <b>to</b> prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods.

These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed <b>food</b> <b>to</b> the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E

5|$|Antioxidant {{vitamins}} {{are found}} in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, and E can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the bioavailability of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes <b>food</b> <b>to</b> heat and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Kesiny struck Madagascar {{during a}} period of {{political}} strife after the Malagasy presidential election in 2001. In the election, incumbent president Didier Ratsiraka lost to Marc Ravalomanana, but rejected the results; after the election, Ratsiraka declared the city of Toamasina as the new capital of the country. The political crisis caused difficulties after the storm in distributing food, and Ratsiraka's operational center in the city was damaged. During the storm, Toamasina experienced severe flooding, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes. Emergency volunteers provided water and <b>food</b> <b>to</b> the affected residents. Workers from the World Health Organization and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) provided medical assistance to residents in Toamasina during the storm. Damaged roads contributed to economic contraction, after trucks were unable to use roads and bridges in the eastern portion of the country. By October, the political crisis had ended, and the government repaired most of the damaged infrastructure. The cost of repairing the roads and bridges was about $2.5million (2002 USD), which was paid by a $50million credit from the World Bank Group. Due to poor harvest related to the storm in some areas, the World Food Programme provided 18,000tonnes of <b>food</b> <b>to</b> 394,250residents, beginning in November 2002 {{at the request of the}} Malagasy government. After the storm, the government of Norway donated kr1.2million (2002Norwegian krone, 172,000 USD) for storm relief, and the government of Switzerland provided about $33,000 (USD).|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, the palace {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention.

Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by the palace. The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.|$|E
