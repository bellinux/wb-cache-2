5|$|Under new Head Coach Wim Jansen, Celtic had to {{negotiate}} two qualifying rounds {{to qualify for}} the first round proper of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Welsh Inter Cabel-Tel were comfortably disposed of 8–0 on aggregate, but the next qualifying round against Tirol Innsbruck proved more difficult. An abysmal first leg performance in Austria was salvaged only by a late Alan Stubbs free kick, Celtic losing 21 on the night but netting a valuable away goal. The return match in Glasgow was an exciting see-saw affair. Celtic twice took the lead in the first half, only for Innsbruck to equalise on each occasion, their second goal an own goal by Henrik Larsson just before half-time. Goals in the second half from Simon Donnelly and Craig Burley put Celtic ahead on aggregate, but Gernot Krinner's header on 82 minutes levelled the tie on aggregate and gave the Austrians the advantage because of the away goals rule. But Celtic responded with three minutes to go, Wieghorst showed excellent skill in the penalty box to control Donnelly's knockdown before shooting in. With the match going into injury time and the tie poised on a <b>knife-edge,</b> Larsson went on a mazy run forward before passing to Burley who scored from close range to clinch a 63 win on the night to progress on aggregate. Celtic were then drawn against Liverpool in the first round proper.|$|E

The <b>knife-edges</b> method has been widely used to measure PSF because it provides a relatively easy way to get the point spread function.

In this paper, we propose a new method {{to solve the problem of}} phase influence for calibrating PSF of space plane array camera.

5000|$|In the Riefler escapement, {{the energy}} {{required}} to keep the pendulum swinging is instead supplied by bending the short straight spring strip which suspends the pendulum. [...] The {{upper end of the}} suspension spring is not attached to a fixed support as in most clocks, but instead is attached to a heavy metal bearer, which pivots on two aligned <b>knife-edges</b> on its underside which rest on flat agate plates. The bending point of the suspension spring is in alignment with the line of contact of the <b>knife-edges.</b> When the pendulum passes its bottom point, the escape wheel is unlocked and pushes the bearer, and the bearer pivots suddenly on its knife edges by a small angle, flexing the spring. The spring is bent by a small amount in addition to that caused by the swing of the pendulum, and thus provides the impulse for the next swing. So the suspension spring is used for two functions: suspending the pendulum and giving it impulse.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{restoration}} of nickel-base turbine blade <b>knife-edges</b> with controlled Laser Aided Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) process was investigated. The alloy contains about 9 weight percent Ti/Al composition, {{which makes it}} difficult to repair due to the cracking issue. Infrared temperature signal emitted from melt pool was adopted for process control. The deposition with and without process control was compared. The deposition with process control can avoid the hot-cracking which often occurs during deposition of nickel-base super-alloys. The results showed that the process control can also guarantee a better dimensional accuracy. The microstructure of the deposited layers in the cross-section was examined under both microscope and SEM. It displayed directionally solidified fine columnar dendrites which grew following the change of the heat conduction condition. The EDX line scanning verified that chemical composition remained homogeneous distribution in the deposited thin wall. Spot EDX analysis identified that TiC is most likely the main type of carbides formed at the grain boundaries. The results demonstrated that the LAAM process is feasible for the recondition of the gas turbine blade <b>knife-edges...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} in situ beam {{characterization}} technique to analyze femtosecond optical beams in a folded {{version of a}} 2 f- 2 f setup. This technique makes use of a two-dimensional spatial light modulator (SLM) to holographically redirect radiation between different diffraction orders. This manipulation of light between diffraction orders is carried out locally within the beam. Because SLMs can withstand intensities of up to I~ 10 ^ 11 W/cm, this makes them suitable for amplified femtosecond radiation. The flexibility of the SLM was demonstrated by producing a diverse assortment of "soft apertures" that are mechanically difficult or impossible to reproduce. We test our method by holographically <b>knife-edging</b> and tomographically reconstructing both continuous wave and broadband radiation in transverse optical modes.

40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an analysis for inelastic columns, with cross-sections composed of one or more materials, loaded with axial load and biaxial moments. The column can have both rotational and directional restraints at its ends. The analysis has been programmed for a computer and subsequently tested against published results for steel columns, reinforced concrete columns, and concrete-encased steel composite columns and shown to give good agreement. A test rig with an axial load capacity of 2 MN and capable of testing full-scale columns of any practical length has been designed and built. Columns with elastic and elastic-plastic rotational restraints or, pin-ends or any combination can be tested and column end-moments of up to 50 kNm can be applied through the beams. One important feature of the test rig is sets of crossed <b>knife-edges,</b> which give both major and minor axis rotational freedom and thus allow accurate positioning of the axial load. Eight elastically restrained concrete-encased steel composite no-sway columns have been tested, three with biaxial restraints and loadings, using the rig. The results from the tests have been compared with predictions using the computer program and agreement between the observed and predicted results for ultimate loads, deflections, and end-moments is good. The behaviour of column lengths within rigid-Jointed no-sway frames with both plastically and elastically designed beams has been studied. For the case of a column with elastic restraints design proposals have been checked and shown to be conservative. When the beams are designed plastically it is recommended that a conservative approach should be adopted until further research has been carried out into this topic...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} higher data rates in {{wireless}} communication {{systems and the}} lack of available frequency space has led the researchers in developing new technologies, such as UWB. Ultra-wideband systems utilise signals with very short duration and very large bandwidth, from which the benefits are twofold; more information can be exchanged and coexistence with narrowband technologies is possible, as such systems perceive UWB as noise and interference is thus avoided. The increased bandwidth offers multipath resolution, which when properly treated can enhance system's performance and reliability. Signal distortion however, may prohibit system's optimum performance. It is more efficiently treated directly into the time-domain. The lack of information on the propagation of UWB signals in a complex environment, other than single reflected and diffracted waves, was tackled in this work. Easy-to-use and accurate reflection and transmission coefficients for a wave impinging on a dielectric slab were deduced. An algorithm for the prediction of a signal, which is multiply diffracted waves on an number of absorbing <b>knife-edges</b> and/or imperfect conducting wedges was also implemented. The algorithm accurately took into account the arisen higher-order fields, that are created in such cases, according to the Uniform Theory of Diffraction. A tool for signal prediction in a complex environment was constructed, based on the environment discretisation into tiles and segments. Its validity was initially tested for the narrowband case, by comparing its predictions with measurement, with a quite good agreement. Then, it was modified, so as to incorporate the dispersive nature of the channel. This was accomplished in the time-domain, where the TD ray-trace model not only predicts the arrival times of the multipaths but also their shape.

Then a little set of us plunged suddenly into what we called at first sociological discussion. I can still recall even the physical feeling of those first tentative talks. I remember them mostly as occurring in the rooms of Ted Hatherleigh, who kept at the corner by the Trinity great gate, but we also used to talk a good deal at a man's in King's, a man named, if I remember rightly, Redmayne. The atmosphere of Hatherleigh's rooms was a haze of tobacco smoke against a background brown and deep. He professed himself a socialist with anarchistic leanings--he had suffered the martyrdom of ducking for it--and a huge French May-day poster displaying a splendid proletarian in red and black on a barricade against a flaring orange sky, dominated his decorations. Hatherleigh affected a fine untidiness, and all the place, even the floor, was littered with books, {{for the most part}} open and face downward; deeper darknesses were supplied by a discarded gown and our caps, all conscientiously battered, Hatherleigh's flopped like an elephant's ear and inserted quill pens supported the corners of mine; the highlights of the picture came chiefly as reflections from his chequered blue mugs full of audit ale. We sat on oak chairs, except the four or five who crowded on a capacious settle, we drank a lot of beer and were often fuddled, and occasionally quite drunk, and we all smoked reckless-looking pipes,--there was a transient fashion among us for corn cobs for which Mark Twain, I think, was responsible. Our little excesses with liquor were due far more to conscience than appetite, indicated chiefly a resolve to break away from restraints that we suspected were keeping us off the instructive <b>knife-edges</b> of life.

40|$|Purpose: The general aim of {{this study}} and those {{presented}} in Parts 2 – 4 of this series was to characterize the structure, properties, wear, and fracture of prosthetic retaining screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses after long-term use in vivo. This part of the overall investigation addresses whether there are differences in thread wear between the screws closest to the fulcrum and those that are farthest from the fulcrum in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. Materials and Methods: The total number of prosthetic retaining screws used in this study was 100 (10 new and 90 used). New screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) were divided into Group 1 (slotted) and Group 2 (hexed). Ninety used screws (in service 18 – 120 months) were retrieved from fixed detachable hybrid prostheses in 18 patients (5 screws from each patient, 60 from NB and 30 from Sterngold). The used screws were divided into 18 groups. Additionally, each group was subdivided into A and B categories. Category A contained the middle three prosthetic screws, which were considered the farthest screws from the fulcrum line. Category B contained the most posterior two screws, which were considered the screws closest to the fulcrum line. All 100 screws were subjected to thorough, nondestructive testing. Results: Light and scanning electron microscopic examination of all used screws for each group revealed surface deterioration of the active profile of the screw threads consistent with adhesive wear. The observed thread profile deterioration ranged from mild to severe. The wear was aggressive enough to cause galling, which led to thinning of the threads and, in severe cases, to <b>knife-edges</b> at thread crests. In ten groups, the most anterior three screws exhibited more wear than the most posterior two screws. In addition to thread wear, severe plastic deformation was detected on the bottom part of each screw for three groups, and a long external longitudinal crack was detected in one screw of Group 2. Conclusions: The findings of this study and those presented in Parts 2 – 4 demonstrate that different retaining screws from the same manufacturer and/or from different manufacturers have different geometrical design, microstructures, major alloy constituents, and microhardness, and that these differences influence their preload and fractured load values. In this part of the overall investigation, the occurrence of galling as a result of wear involving prosthetic retaining screws appears to be an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of long-term use in vivo in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses regardless of the intended/original preload value. The galling rate is greater on the middle three screws compared to the most posterior two screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. The wear pattern is consistent with an adhesive wear mechanism; however, this study does not provide enough data to support a definitive analysis. King Saud Universit...|$|R
