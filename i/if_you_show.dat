500|$|Burton {{approached}} Sam Hamm, a {{comic book}} fan, to write the screenplay. Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that [...] "unlocking the mystery" [...] would {{become part of the}} storyline. He reasoned, [...] "You totally destroy your credibility <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>show</b> the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman." [...] Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character. One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty {{the night of the murder}} of Bruce Wayne's parents. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted, reducing it to a photo in the Gotham Globe newspaper seen in the film.|$|E

He also considered sending Zhang Hong, but he still preferred Yu Fan. Yu Fan refused and said, [...] "I'm like one of your treasured possessions. You might lose me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>show</b> me to others and they want me. That's why I don't want to go there." [...] Sun Ce laughed and said, [...] "I still have military campaigns to complete so I can't return home yet. You're like my Xiao He. I intend to let you return to Kuaiji as an Officer of Merit to help me guard the commandery." [...] Yu Fan travelled back to Kuaiji three days later.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, it won't; not <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>show</b> {{them the}} way out. If it does, it's better to be unhappy striving for higher things, like a man, than to be content in a wallow like swine." ...|$|E
