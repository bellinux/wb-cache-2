50|$|During a house search, {{a junkie}} named René Wehrli (Manuel Löwensberg) {{falls out of}} the window. Strähl gets {{suspended}} from police service. Moreover, René and his girlfriend Carol “Caro” Hertig (Johanna Bantzer) blackmail Strähl for smart money. The drug addict couple buys a lot of articles in a kiosk, and Strähl {{has to pay for}} them (René also fills out a “Toto”-ticket (sports betting) there, and Strähl positively influences him doing it). Despite that, René doesn’t want to take back his <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statement</b> - René demands a huge amount of heroin from Strähl.|$|E
50|$|As his secretary, Lajos Eskütt {{who had a}} {{major role}} in the {{corruption}} cases, placed an <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statement</b> upon him, he resigned from the ministerial position. Szabó returned to his birthplace. The looking for his truth and fearing for his political career Eskütt rejected the offered secret agreements and emigration opportunity and he required rehabilitation and a mandate instead of these things. Because of this Szabó and Bethlen prosecuted him (libel trial). Szabó would be one of the crown witness' but before the trial he died between suspicious circumstances. Miklós Horthy and István Bethlen also participated in his funeral.|$|E
40|$|This article first {{demonstrates}} that courts historically {{did not trust}} penal interest statements in general, and that courts were extremely suspicious of any statements by a third party that implicated the defendant. Since Washington adopted Federal Rule of Evidence 804 (b) (3) verbatim, this article then analyzes the legislative history of the rule. The article concludes that the legislative history favored exclusion of <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> but that Congress failed to codify the exclusion because of unrelated problems. Finally, the article discusses the confrontation clause problems that arise when <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> are allowed into evidence. This article argues that the Parris holding should be narrowed, in a case now pending {{in the court of}} appeals, to exclude <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> altogether. The authors urge a rule of exclusion notwithstanding the supreme court 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of this claim as having little merit...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the police}} arrived they arrested Clarkson, {{informed}} {{her of her}} right to retain and instruct counsel, and then charged her {{with the murder of}} Mr. Clarkson. Clarkson was taken to the hospital along with her aunt, Lorna Estey. Along the way the police overheard Clarkson make several <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> to her aunt.|$|R
2500|$|Here, the Court adopted Blackmun's {{argument}} from Parker, finding {{that there were}} many imaginable <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> that could cause a corroborating statement to be [...] "devastating" [...] to a defense. [...] The Court argued that the content and existence of Cruz's own confession was open to question because it depended on the acceptance of Norberto's testimony, which his codefendant's confession was actually video-recorded.|$|R
5000|$|... 1971 - Appeared in the Supreme Court {{on behalf}} of the Crown in the matter of Ruth Thelma Piche. The major issues {{involved}} the right to silence, the voluntariness of <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements,</b> and the admissibility of inconsistencies between exculpatory statements given at different times. Piche, pre-Charter and prior to the landmark of R v Lavallee, is an early burning bed case.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{directions}} hearing {{took place}} before Justice Coghlan. The prosecutor, Mark Gibson, {{indicated that the}} case against Blumberg had also been [...] "resolved" [...] and that, [...] "It is the intention of Mr Emini and Mr Blumberg, as I understand it, to make <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> against Mr Smith". The statements would be ready within a month. Blumberg and Emini were ordered to appear on 18 July 2011 at which time {{they are expected to}} plead guilty and be sentenced.|$|R
50|$|On March 8, 1996, the Second District Illinois Appellate Court {{unanimously}} reversed and remanded {{the case}} for a new trial on the ground that Cowlin erred in failing to grant a motion to suppress Gary’s allegedly <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements.</b> In an unpublished opinion written by Judge S. Louis Rathje, with Judges Robert D. McLaren and Fred A. Geiger concurring, the court held that the statements were the fruit of an arrest made without probable cause and therefore should not have been admitted at the trial.|$|R
5000|$|The voluntariness of a {{confession}} {{is a legal}} inquiry subject to plenary appellate review. United States v. Robinson, 20 F.3d 320, 322 (8th Cir.1994). To determine if Fellers's <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> at the jail were voluntary, we must determine if, [...] "in light of {{the totality of the}} circumstances, the pressures exerted by the authorities overwhelmed the defendant's will. Coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding that {{a confession}} is not voluntary in the constitutional sense." [...] Id. (citing Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986)) (internal citation omitted).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} judicial {{approaches to}} cell-plant interrogations in Canada and the United States. These are surreptitious interrogations whereby the police inject an undercover state agent into the detention environment with {{the object of}} eliciting <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> from an accused. This thesis examines and compares {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of Canadian and United States judicial approaches to cell-plant interrogations, and their respective applications of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Sixth Amendment of the U. S. Bill of Rights. In both countries, an accused can seek to have their incriminating statements excluded from evidence where they persuade the court that such statements were elicited by a state agent. Despite the seemingly similar language of their legal tests, Canadian and U. S. jurists define state agency and elicitation in very different ways leading potentially to very dissimilar outcomes based on the same factual circumstances...|$|R
50|$|At a pre-trial hearing, Fellers {{moved to}} {{suppress}} the statements he made to the offices from evidence. During the hearing, the magistrate {{in charge of the}} case recommended that portions of Fellers' statements, including the statement he made at his house, should be suppressed as fruits of the poisonous tree. The District Court subsequently suppressed the statement made during the initial confrontation, but admitted the jailhouse statement into evidence, arguing that under Oregon v. Elstad, Fellers knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights before making the statement. At the actual trial itself, Fellers was convicted by a jury for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Fellers appealed, arguing that the statement made in the jailhouse should be suppressed just like the statement at the house as a violation of the Sixth Amendment. The Nebraska Court of Appeals affirmed the initial verdict, concluding,":Fellers argues that the district court should have suppressed his <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> made at the jail because the primary taint of the improperly elicited statements made at his home was not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights at the jail.|$|R
500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his right to remain silent, nor {{that he did not want}} to talk to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequence—did he believe in God, did he pray to God, and did he pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|R
40|$|The last Term of the Supreme Court {{addressed}} the constitutionally protected rights of criminal defendants {{not only at}} trial but at the post-conviction stage as well. The Court dealt with the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s rights to a speedy trial and effective assistance of counsel in Vermont v. Brillon; the claim was that these constitutional protections were substantially frustrated by underfunded public defender offices, thereby leaving the defendant improperly incarcerated for three years. The Court also considered a case wherein the State had utilized a jailhouse snitch to elicit <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> from a defendant in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Post conviction relief was a matter before the court; the defendant in In reDavis sought to challenge his conviction {{which was based on}} witnesses who had subsequently recanted. In District Attorney 2 ̆ 7 s Office v. Osborne, the defendant was seeking to conduct a new DNA test of the critical evidence in the case against him. Accountability of lab experts was at the forefront in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts. Lastly, in Baze v. Rees, the Court had held that the risk of pain from the maladministration of an otherwise humane three-drug cocktail method of lethal execution does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth amendment. Subsequent to Baze, the first single-drug lethal injection anywhere in the United States was administered in Ohio, thus stirring heated debate within the legal community. This context frames this Article 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s criminal law jurisprudence of the 2008 Term...|$|R
25|$|Miranda v. Arizona, , was a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} United States Supreme Court. In a 5–4 majority, the Court held that both <b>inculpatory</b> and exculpatory <b>statements</b> made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed {{of the right to}} consult with an attorney before and during questioning and of the right against self-incrimination before police questioning, and that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.|$|R
40|$|The United States Sentencing Guidelines (hereinafter Guidelines) allow federal {{district}} courts to reduce a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s sentence if the defendant 2 ̆ 2 clearly demonstrates a recognition and affirmative acceptance {{of personal responsibility}} for his criminal conduct [...] 2 ̆ 2 In United States v. Perez-Franco, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the above Guidelines section on acceptance of responsibility did not require a defendant {{to accept responsibility for}} charges that were to be dismissed as part of a plea agreement. The Perez-Franco decision is an affront to the fundamental principle that a defendant ought to take personal responsibility for the crime that defendant actually committed if he or she desires mercy from the sentencing court. It may also encourage prosecutors to usurp the judicial function of determining which defendants deserve a sentence reduction pursuant to the acceptance-of-responsibility section. The Perez-Franco court offered two primary grounds for its decision. First, the court interpreted the express language of the Guidelines pertaining to acceptance of responsibility. Second, the court observed that certain statements by the defendant about his or her conduct, beyond facts contained in the offense of conviction, might be used in a subsequent criminal prosecution and would violate the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. This violation would occur where the defendant was required to make <b>inculpatory</b> <b>statements</b> about conduct beyond that in the offense of conviction and these statements were subsequently used against the defendant in a criminal trial. This article will criticize the first ground in the Perez-Franco decision by providing an alternative interpretation of the language in the Guidelines 2 ̆ 7 acceptance-of-responsibility section. In addition, this article will challenge the second ground in the decision by demonstrating that if a sentencing court requires a defendant to make self-incriminating statements to receive a sentence reduction, then those statements are involuntary under the fifth amendment and cannot be used in a subsequent criminal trial. Judges should have the authority to determine whether a defendant is repentant for the real offense he or she committed as opposed to a lesser crime negotiated in a plea bargain. Furthermore, judges should be able to ask a defendant about the real-offense behavior to curb potential prosecutorial abuses of discretion...|$|R
