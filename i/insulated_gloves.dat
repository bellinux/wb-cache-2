50|$|Carbon dioxide is {{increasingly}} toxic starting at concentrations above 1%, {{and can also}} displace oxygen resulting in asphyxia if equipment is not used in a ventilated area. In addition, because carbon dioxide is heavier than air, exhaust vents are required to be at or near ground level to efficiently remove the gas. At normal pressure dry ice is -78 C and must be handled with <b>insulated</b> <b>gloves.</b> Eye and ear protection are required to safely use dry ice cleaning equipment. Compared to other blasting-cleaning methods, dry ice blasting produces fewer waste products and does not require clean-up of a blasting medium.

40|$|Thermal {{effects as}} sources of errors in {{holographic}} interferometry are illustrated on an example of reflection holography patterns obtained on graphite-epoxy specimens exposed before and after compressive loading. The numerical interpretation of the obtained holograms indicated some peculiar unexpected thickness changes in the specimen. In addition, some patterns showed random occurrence of zones of low and zero contrast. These discrepancies occurred usually {{in the first of}} the two exposures and were traced to thermal warping and thermal relaxation patterns caused by small temperature gradients that resulted from heat transfer to the photographic plates during their installation. Suggested precautions to minimize thermal effects include using thick holographic plates (photographic plates attached to glass plates) and <b>insulated</b> <b>gloves</b> during handling and allowing time to establish thermal equilibrium before the exposure...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the susceptibility of an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator to electromagnetic interference in an electrically hostile work site environment, with the ultimate goal of allowing the patient to return to work. Background. Normal operation of an implanted cardioverterdefibrillator depends on reliable sensing of the heart's electrical activity. Consequently, there is concern that external electromagnetic interference from external sources in the work place, especially welding equipment or motor-generator systems, may be sensed and produce inappropriate shocks or abnormal reed switch operation, temporarily suspending detection of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Methods. The effects of electromagnetic interference on the operation of one type of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (Medtronic models 7217 and 7219) was measured by using internal event counter monitoring in 10 patients operating arc welders at up to 900 A or working near 200 -hp motors and 1 patient close to a locomotive starter drawing up to 400 A. Results. The electromagnetic interference produced two sources of potential interference on the sensing circuit or reed switch operation, respectively: 1) electrical fields with measured frequencies up to 50 MHz produced by the high currents during welding electrode activation, and 2) magnetic fields produced by the current in the welding electrode and cable. The defibrillator sensitivity was programmed to the highest (most sensitive) value: 0. 15 mV (model 7219) or 0. 3 mV (model 7217). The ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation therapies were temporarily turned off but the detection circuits left on. Conclusions. None of the implanted defibrillators tested were affected by oversensing of the electric field as verified by telemetry from the detection circuits. The magnetic field from 225 -A welding current produced a flux density of 1. 2 G; this density was not adequate to close the reed switch, which requires ∼ 10 G. Our testing at the work site revealed no electrical interference with this type of defibrillator. Patients were allowed to return to work. The following precautions should be observed by the patient: 1) maintain a minimal distance of 2 ft (61 cm) from the welding arc and cables or large motors, 2) do not exceed tested currents with the welding equipment, 3) wear <b>insulated</b> <b>gloves</b> while operating electrical equipment, 4) verify that electrical equipment is properly grounded, and 5) stop welding and leave the work area immediately if a therapy is delivered or a feeling of lightheadedness is experienced...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Safe {{hands-on}} defibrillation (HOD) {{will allow}} uninterrupted chest compression during defibrillation and may improve resuscitation success. We tested {{the ability of}} electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> to protect the rescuer during HOD using a ‘worst case’ electrical scenario. Materials and method Leakage current flowing from the patient to the ‘rescuer’ during antero-lateral defibrillation of patients undergoing elective cardioversion was measured. The ‘rescuer’ maintained firm (20 kgf) contact with the patient during defibrillation, wearing Class 1 electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> while simulating an inadvertent contact with the patient, through an additional wired contact between ‘rescuer’ and patient. Results Data from 61 shocks from 43 different patients were recorded. The median leakage current from all defibrillations was 20. 0 ?A, (range: 2. 0 – 38. 5). In total, 18 of the shocks were delivered at 360 J and had a median leakage current of 27. 0 ?A (range: 14. 3 – 38. 5). Conclusion When using Class 1 electrical <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> for hands-on defibrillation, rescuer leakage current is significantly below the 1 mA safe threshold, allowing safe hands-on defibrillation if the rescuer makes only one other point of contact with the patient...|$|R

RSG is close to Volvo Cars laboratory, and the interviewed firefighters think that RSG gets good information from Volvo, but that {{there are several other}} EV models that they know little about.

40|$|Natural rubber (NR) {{products}} are being applied in many protective tools for life-line applications, including insulating boots, blankets, sleeves, <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves,</b> or flexible coverings. Due to the inherent risk of such works {{it is imperative}} ensuring {{the quality of the}} safety products involved. The dielectric properties of NR-based products rely heavily on the compounding formulation and manufacturing processes involved. Considerable efforts are being applied to improve the dielectric performance of NR formulations to ensure that maintenance personnel work in the safer and most comfortable conditions. This work studies the addition of different weight fractions of surface-modified BaTiO 3 -OH nanoparticles to NR formulations to enhance dielectric properties such as breakdown strength and leakage current. The results presented in this work show that the addition of a low weight fraction of surface-modified BaTiO 3 -OH nanofillers (= 1 wt. %) enhances the surface and volume resistivity, crystallinity, breakdown strength under ac conditions and lowers the leakage current under dc stress.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} This article {{summarizes}} current {{knowledge of the}} causes and consequences of interruption of chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Recent findings Pauses in chest compressions occur during analysis of the heart rhythm, delivery of ventilation, interventions such as intubation, and gaining intravenous access, but pauses may also be unprompted. Pauses related to defibrillation are because of preshock pauses for rhythm analysis and charging, and postshock pauses to evaluate {{the outcome of the}} shock. Prolonged pauses, mainly preshock pauses (> 10 s) are associated with decreased survival to discharge in retrospective analyses. Measures to reduce preshock and postshock pauses include resuming chest compressions during defibrillator charging, continued chest compression during defibrillation by mechanical chest compression devices or during manual chest compression with sufficiently <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves</b> for the rescuer, and eliminating postshock rhythm and pulse checks. New filtering techniques may allow rhythm analysis during chest compressions. Summary It is important to avoid any unnecessary pause in chest compressions before and after a defibrillation shock. Pauses should be kept to an absolute minimum, preferably to less than 10...|$|R
5000|$|Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) {{or without}} (3-pin) a neutral connector. Earth were {{provided}} via the shield. The connectors {{were available in}} different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were rectangular. These connectors were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by [...] "Arbetsmiljöverket"). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through {{the hands of a}} person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears <b>insulating</b> <b>gloves).</b> Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the ground screw could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.|$|R

40|$|Daily working {{activities}} and functions require a high contribution of hand and forearm muscles in executing grip force. To study {{the effects of}} wearing different gloves on grip strength, under a variety of hand skin temperatures, an assessment of the maximum grip strength was performed with 32 healthy male workers with a mean age (standard deviation) of 30. 44 (5. 35) years wearing five industrial gloves at three hand skin temperatures. Their ages and anthropometric characteristics including body mass index (BMI), hand length, hand width, hand depth, hand palm, and wrist circumference were measured. The hand was exposed to different bath temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C) and hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer with and without wearing the gloves (chemical protection <b>glove,</b> rubber <b>insulating</b> <b>glove,</b> anti-vibration impact glove, cotton yarn knitted glove, and RY-WG 002 working glove). The data were analyzed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Tukey test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the within-subject design analysis. The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength. Wearing the RY-WG 002 working glove produced a greater reduction on the maximum grip when compared with the bare hand, while low temperatures (5 °C) had a significant influence on grip when compared to medium (25 °C) and high (45 °C) hand skin temperatures. In addition, participants felt more discomfort in both environmental extreme conditions. Furthermore, they reported more discomfort while wearing neoprene, rubber, and RY-WG 002 working gloves...|$|R
40|$|Gloved {{work has}} been shown to {{increase}} the effort required to perform manual tasks. In power grip tasks, these differences have been observed as reductions in strength and increases in muscular effort. Decreases in force output have been attributed to a number of factors, including loss of tactile sensitivity, glove flexibility or suppleness, thickness, changes in hand geometry, and friction at the glove-object interface. Glove research has rarely quantified glove attributes, and often compared gloves of varying material and physical properties. This research had the unique opportunity to control for a number of these properties by using three sets of identical <b>gloves</b> (powerline maintainers? <b>insulating</b> rubber <b>gloves),</b> differing only in thickness. Administering the Von Frey Hair Test indicated that the gloves did indeed decrease tactile sensitivity. This research showed that increasing glove thickness led to large decreases in maximum power grip force. Small changes in hand geometry, such as increased interdigital space or grip span, affected force output. In the same hand posture, participants increased their grip force with increasing glove thickness for the object lifting task but were able to maintain a fixed submaximal force with visual feedback. The decrease in tactile sensitivity is a likely cause of this difference. 	Muscular activity was affected by wearing the gloves while performing manual tasks. Inconsistent responses of muscular activation were seen in gloved maximum grip effort, while overall increases in electromyographic activity were recorded for tasks at submaximal levels when wearing gloves. Interdigital spacing had different effects on maximal and submaximal tasks. For maximum effort power grip, interdigital spacing decreased force output by as much as 10 %, with no significant changes in muscle activation. For submaximal tasks, no significant differences were seen in muscular activity or in force output. The overall force capability of the gloved user is hindered by changes in interdigital spacing at near maximal effort, but {{does not appear to be}} for tasks requiring lower grip force, such as the lifting task which required roughly 20 %MVC. Overall, the effect of wearing these gloves on the users, the powerline maintainers, is a substantially increased effort to work. This research contributes to a greater understanding of why and how gloves inhibit performance...|$|R
