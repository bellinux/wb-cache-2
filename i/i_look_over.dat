25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
2500|$|C. Lee Hanson, whose son, daughter-in-law, {{and baby}} granddaughter were killed, felt that {{building}} {{a tribute to}} Islam {{so close to the}} World Trade Center site would be insensitive: [...] "The pain never goes away. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> there and I see a mosque, it's going to hurt. Build it someplace else." [...] Rosemary Cain, whose son was killed, called the project a [...] "slap in the face", and said [...] "I think it's despicable. That's sacred ground", and [...] "I don't want a mosque on my son's grave". Nancy Nee, whose brother was killed, said: [...] "It's almost like a trophy. The whole thing just reeks of arrogance at this point." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1921, Stieglitz's {{photographs}} of O'Keeffe {{were included in}} a retrospective exhibition at the Anderson Galleries. Stieglitz started photographing O'Keeffe when she visited him in New York City to see her 1917 exhibition, and continued taking photographs, {{many of which were}} in the nude. It created a public sensation. When he retired from photography in 1937, he had made more than 350 portraits of her. In 1978, she wrote about how distant from them she had become, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the photographs Stieglitz took of me-some of them more than sixty years ago—I wonder who that person is. It is as if in my one life I have lived many lives." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{may have}} tumbled down-stairs in the dark, {{but he never}} walked down or ran down. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the banisters, and I was alone with the thunder.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{the side}} of the ship at the dark-blue water. Oh, how I longed to plunge into it and be {{released}} for ever from this abiding nightmare! ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} at the yellow paper and the faded script. At the head was written: [...] "Baskerville Hall," [...] and below in large, scrawling figures: [...] "1742." ...|$|R

60|$|I was {{in hopes}} that this volume might have gone its way without preface; but as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the sheets, I find in them various fallings short of old {{purposes}} which require a word of explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad conscience," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "I've been {{where you}} have been--Miss Grimes. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the edge and I jumped. I'd stay where you are, if I were you." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} of our arrival {{we were sitting in}} the Colonel's gun-room after dinner, Holmes {{stretched}} upon the sofa, while Hayter and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his little armory of Eastern weapons.|$|R
5000|$|..... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> ... and Martin {{was very}} quietly {{sitting in the}} chair, and a tear ran down his cheek. It was a victory like none other. It was an {{affirmation}} of the movement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think that}} Wilberforce's report {{shows that they}} have a right to that title now. Take a seat, Mr. O' Connor, and a newspaper--there are some that arrived two days ago--while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> your report." ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> what I have written, I am {{sensible}} it {{is vastly}} {{different from the}} ordinary style of courtship--but I shall make no apology--I know your good nature will excuse what your good sense may see amiss.|$|E
6000|$|She laughed. [...] "It is charming," [...] she said, [...] "but {{there are}} so many places where there is just as good a breeze, or perhaps better. How I would like to go to some one of them! To me this island is lonely and doleful. Every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the sea for a ship I hope that one will come that can carry us away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And as I stood hearkening, dulcimers, haut-boys, and shawms, And violoncellos, and a three-stringed double-bass, Joined in, {{and were}} intermixed with a singing of psalms; And <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> {{at the dead}} men's dwelling-place.|$|R
60|$|We {{hastened to}} the gun pointed out, and while I was {{standing}} there waiting for orders, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the side, and, for the first time, {{became aware of the}} cause of these proceedings.|$|R
6000|$|I {{shut the}} door into the inner office and moved up behind him. He made no sign that he saw or heard. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and read, amid half-formed words, sentences, and wild scratches:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No doubt, sir. Would {{you walk}} in? Mr Lightwood ain't {{in at the}} present moment, but I expect him back very shortly. Would you take a seat in Mr Lightwood's room, sir, while <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> our Appointment Book?' Young Blight made a great show of {{fetching}} from his desk a long thin manuscript volume with a brown paper cover, and running his finger down the day's appointments, murmuring, 'Mr Aggs, Mr Baggs, Mr Caggs, Mr Daggs, Mr Faggs, Mr Gaggs, Mr Boffin. Yes, sir; quite right. You are a little before your time, sir. Mr Lightwood will be in directly.' ...|$|E
60|$|Whilst <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> {{this paper}} {{to have it}} copied, I see a {{manifesto}} of the Assembly, as a preliminary to {{a declaration of war}} against the German princes on the Rhine. This manifesto contains the whole substance of the French politics with regard to foreign states. They have ordered it to be circulated amongst the people in every country of Europe,--even previously to its acceptance by the king, and his new privy council, the club of the Feuillants. Therefore, as a summary of their policy avowed by themselves, let us consider some of the circumstances attending that piece, as well as the spirit and temper of the piece itself.|$|E
6000|$|... 245. I {{said that}} in this second paper I would try to give some brief history of the rise, and the issue, of that Pre-Raphaelite school: but, as <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> two of the essays[47] that were printed with mine in that last number of the Nineteenth Century--the first--in laud of the Science which accepts for {{practical}} spirits, inside of men, only Avarice and Indolence; and the other,--in laud of the Science which [...] "rejects the Worker" [...] outside of Men, I am less and less confident in offering to the readers of the Nineteenth Century any History relating to such despised things as unavaricious industry,--or incorporeal vision. I will be as brief as I can.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was up in}} {{a second}} and shinning down the hill. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. He said: ...|$|R

60|$|It {{is not my}} custom to be {{discouraged}} by a first failure. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the letters which {{had been sent to}} me in answer to my advertisement, and wrote to another of the applicants, who very promptly came to see me.|$|R
60|$|My dear Forster, I cannot {{sufficiently}} say {{how proud}} I am {{of what you}} have done, or how sensible I am of being so tenderly connected with it. When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> this note, I feel as if I had said no part of what I think; and yet if I were to write another I should say no more, for I can't get it out. I desire no better for my fame, when my personal dustiness shall be past the control of my love of order, than such a biographer and such a critic. And again I say, most solemnly, that literature in England has never had, and probably never will have, such a champion as you are, in right of this book.|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S.--As <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> my {{statement}} {{there is only}} one omission which I can see. It concerns the unfortunate man McPherson, who was foolish enough to write to his wife and to make an appointment with her in New York. It can be imagined that when interests like ours were at stake, we could not leave them to the chance of whether a man in that class of life would or would not give away his secrets to a woman. Having once broken his oath by writing to his wife, we could not trust him any more. We took steps therefore to insure that he should not see his wife. I have sometimes thought {{that it would be a}} kindness to write to her and to assure her that there is no impediment to her marrying again." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{asked the}} old countryman about it, {{and he told}} me of strange women who had come from it, and who would come into a house having the {{appearance}} of countrywomen, but would know all that had happened in that house; and how they would always pay back with increase, though not by their own hands, whatever was given to them. And he had heard, too, of people who had been carried away into the hill, and how one man went to look for his wife there, and dug into the hill and all but got his wife again, but at the very moment she was coming out to him, the pick he was digging with struck her upon the head and killed her. I asked him if he had himself seen any of its enchantments, and he said, 'Sometimes when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> to the hill, I see a mist lying on the top of it, that goes away after a while.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over,</b> {{and there}} was the gallant sounding-boat booming away, the unprincipled Tom {{presiding}} at the tiller, and my chief sitting by him with the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool's errand to fetch. Then that young girl said to me-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I declare!' said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> my {{shoulder}} as I rowed, 'there is his head upon {{the crest of}} a wave. Easy, or we shall be over him! Two more strokes and be ready to seize him! Keep up, friend! There's help at hand!' ...|$|R
