5|$|As {{inert gas}} is {{introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} hydrocarbon vapors and air, it increases the lower <b>flammable</b> limit or lowest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. At {{the same time it}} decreases the upper <b>flammable</b> limit or highest concentration at which the vapors can be ignited. When the total concentration of oxygen in the tank reaches about 11%, the upper and lower <b>flammable</b> limits converge and the <b>flammable</b> range disappears.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flammable</b> {{materials}} in the cabin were replaced with self-extinguishing versions.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, {{it tends to}} accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with <b>flammable</b> materials.|$|E

5|$|Concentrated {{acetic acid}} can be ignited only with {{difficulty}} at standard temperature and pressure, but becomes a <b>flammable</b> risk in temperatures greater than , and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures (explosive limits: 5.4–16%).|$|E
5|$|Diving gases, {{including}} compressed air, oxygen, nitrox, heliox, trimix, helium and argon, are non-toxic, non <b>flammable,</b> {{and may be}} oxidizer or asphyxiant, and {{are rated}} in Transport category 3.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen (H) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 1. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, nonmetallic, tasteless, highly <b>flammable</b> diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.

5|$|In Beijing, {{authorities}} halted renovation projects {{similar to}} the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after the blaze. The projects, intended to save energy by installing insulation, were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work. The insulation is still <b>flammable,</b> despite the use of fire retardants. Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations after the fire, but later allowed them to resume.|$|E
5|$|The German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker {{invented the}} first soluble forms of {{cellulose}} acetate in 1903, which was much less <b>flammable</b> than cellulose nitrate. It was eventually made available in a powder form from which it was readily injection moulded. Arthur Eichengrün developed the first injection moulding press in 1919. In 1939, Arthur Eichengrün patented the injection moulding of plasticised cellulose acetate.|$|E
5|$|The boranes (boron {{hydrogen}} compounds) {{and similar}} gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, {{it is not}} an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly <b>flammable</b> and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.|$|E
5000|$|The flash {{channel and}} {{discharge}} itself {{are not the}} only causes of injury, ignition or damages, i.e., ground currents or explosions of <b>flammables.</b>|$|R
25|$|Moreover, {{dissolution}} of sodium hydroxide is highly exothermic, {{and the resulting}} heat may cause heat burns or ignite <b>flammables.</b> It also produces heat when reacted with acids.|$|R

5|$|A carcass was {{a hollow}} {{projectile}} usually formed either by an iron cage of ribs joining two small rings or a cast iron ball with holes. A carcass was {{so named because}} the iron cage was thought to resemble the ribs of a body. A carcass {{was filled with a}} highly <b>flammable</b> mixture. Carcasses were used for the first time by the French under Louis XIV in 1672.|$|E
5|$|Air Mata Iboe may be lost. Movies in the Indies were {{recorded}} on highly <b>flammable</b> nitrate film, {{and after a}} fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become <b>flammable</b> or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|Asmara Moerni was {{screened}} {{as late as}} November 1945. The film {{is likely}} lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly <b>flammable</b> nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.

5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of <b>flammable</b> varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking in shallow water nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly <b>flammable</b> material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
50|$|By 10:30 am, {{the fire}} subsided. Two hours later, it had engulfed all <b>flammables</b> and simply burned itself out. Medical teams, fire crews and police were then {{able to enter}} the office towers and search for survivors. Upon {{completing}} their search, authorities found that 179 people died in this fire. At the time, this had been the greatest death toll in any high-rise building fire.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the fire}} reached the building's only {{stairwell}} and climbed {{as high as}} the 15th floor. It did not reach any higher {{because of a lack of}} <b>flammables</b> in the stairwell, however it filled the stairwell with smoke and heat, making it impassable. Fire crews attempted to gain access to the building using this stairwell, but could not go any higher than the 11th floor.|$|R
5000|$|At worst, vapor {{intrusion}} can be {{a safety}} hazard, e.g., when <b>flammables</b> are involved in form of an explosion.Noxious vapors can cause health effects, either acutely such as CNS disturbances like headaches or mental status changes, and they can have chronic health effects, e.g. {{in the case of}} radon, which can cause lung cancer.Lastly, vapors can be severe [...] "aesthetic problems", e.g., odors from hydrogen sulfide.|$|R

Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be <b>flammable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kedok Ketawa was {{screened}} {{as late as}} August 1944, but may be a lost film. As {{elsewhere in}} the world, movies in the Indies were then shot on unstable and <b>flammable</b> nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. While the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost, J.B.
