5|$|Development on Gotcha {{began in}} July 1973, as Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. The company was {{interested}} in producing a very different game from their previous success of Pong, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games. After the release of Space Race, development immediately moved on to Gotcha. The design of the game was done by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong and developer for Space Race. Alcorn had {{the idea for the}} game from a defect he sometimes saw when testing Pong machines: if part of the circuit that converted scores to images on the screens was broken, then parts of the numbers would be scattered across the screen. Alcorn thought that combining that defect intentionally with a motion circuit could create <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> mazes. A prototype design was developed by Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari.|$|E
25|$|Logistically, poor {{roads and}} rail lines, limited port facilities, and overextended airlift {{hampered}} the wings. Organizationally, they were without regular status, such as authorization for personnel and equipment or for promotions. Even with these handicaps and hardships, the tactical support wings performed valiantly. They {{worked hard to}} make combat airfields operable and to provide the support and control combat units needed. They struggled {{to keep pace with}} the <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> battle lines, opening new bases and forward operating locations as needed.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary {{differential}} equations (ODEs) arise in many contexts {{of mathematics and}} science (social as well as natural). Mathematical descriptions of change use differentials and derivatives. Various differentials, derivatives, and functions become {{related to each other}} via equations, and thus a differential equation is a result that describes <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> phenomena, evolution, and variation. Often, quantities are defined as the rate of change of other quantities (for example, derivatives of displacement with respect to time), or gradients of quantities, which is how they enter {{differential equations}}.|$|E

25|$|Like {{previous}} Mortal Kombat games, Mortal Kombat Xs gameplay {{consists of}} two players, or one player and the CPU, fighting against each other with their selected character, using a large, varied array of character specific attacks. The game contains several modes, such as a story mode, which takes place twenty years after the previous Mortal Kombat game, several 'Tower' modes, which feature <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> challenges, numerous online modes, and the 'Krypt', a mode played in a first-person perspective where players explore the areas unlocking a variety of in-game items.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, A. J. M. Chadwick {{patented}} a 4WD system, GB 1113068, {{that used}} hemispherical wheels for an all-terrain vehicle. Twenty years later, B. T. E. Warne, patented, GB 2172558, an improvement on Chadwick's design {{that did not}} use differential gear assemblies. By using near-spherical wheels with provision to tilt and turn each wheel co-ordinatively, the driven wheels maintain constant traction. Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing of wheels is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number of wheels are possible without affecting the system's integrity. Progressive deceleration is made possible by <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> the front-to-rear effective wheel diameter ratios.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the {{institute}} was granted complete autonomy by the State Government of Maharashtra, thus {{giving it the}} freedom to set its own curriculum and manage its own finances. With permanent affiliation to the Savitribai Phule Pune University, {{the institute}} now is an autonomous engineering school. This has been the biggest change as far as pedagogy at COEP is concerned. The following years have seen a multitude of positive changes in administration and academic strategies. Many of these {{have been responsible for}} the growing innovation in project work of college students. The institute contends that its autonomy now grants it greater flexibility in <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> its syllabus to suit the changing needs of the industry.|$|E

Our experimental platform uses USRP devices operated by the GNU radio platform for physical and MAC layers operations. Over the deployed soft-ware archietcture, we have compared 2 existing DTN imple-mentations then run a set of expirements in order to chatac-terize the reaction of the DTN bundle protocol to <b>dynamically</b> frequency <b>changing</b> environment. Our experiments show that DTN can offer lower delivery delays in cognitive radio net-works. This improvement can reach 35 % over highly dy-namic spectrum bands. I...|$|R
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E
500|$|In {{any given}} SGD {{there may be}} a large number of vocal {{expressions}} that facilitate efficient and effective communication, including greetings, expressing desires, and asking questions. [...] Some SGDs have multiple pages of symbols to accommodate a large number of vocal expressions, and thus only a portion of the symbols available are visible at any one time, with the communicator navigating the various pages. Speech-generating devices generally display a set of selections either using a <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> screen, or a fixed display.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} {{algorithms}} {{to pick out}} a random combination from a given set or list. Rejection sampling is extremely slow for large sample sizes.

40|$|We {{present a}} slow-light {{system based on}} dual Raman {{absorption}} resonances in warm rubidium vapor. Each Raman absorption resonance is produced by a control beam in an off-resonant Λ system. This system combines all optical control of the Raman absorption and the low-dispersion broadening properties of the double Lorentzian absorption slow light. The bandwidth, group delay, and central frequency of the slow-light system can all be tuned <b>dynamically</b> by <b>changing</b> {{the properties of the}} control beam. We demonstrate multiple pulse delays with low distortion and show that such a system has fast switching dynamics and thus fast reconfiguration rates...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{computer}} software must adapt <b>dynamically</b> to <b>changing</b> conditions. The correctness of adaptation cannot be properly addressed without precisely specifying {{the requirements for}} adaptation. In many situation, these requirements involve absolute time, {{in addition to a}} logical ordering of events. This paper introduces an approach to formally specifying such timing requirements for adaptive software. We introduce TA-LTL, a timed adaptation-based extension to linear temporal logic, and use this logic to specify three timing properties associated with the adaptation process: safety, liveness, and stability. A dynamic adaptation of interactive audio streaming software is used to illustrate timed temporal logic. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a system that}} supports practical, vision-based user interfaces, addressing the issues of a usable interaction paradigm, support for application developers, and support for application deployment in real-world environments. Interfaces are defined as configurations of predefined interactive widgets that can be moved from one surface to another. Complex interfaces can be <b>dynamically</b> reconfigured, <b>changing</b> both form and location on the fly, because the functional definition of the interface is decoupled from the specification of its location in the environment. We illustrate the power of such an architecture {{in the context of}} projected interactive displays. Keywords: Vision-based interaction – Perceptual user interfaces...|$|R

Between 1812 and 1821, the total length fluctuated by [...] As a result of the <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> nature of the spit, the true age of its formation is unknown.

2500|$|The second {{constraint}} of {{the differential}} is passive—it is actuated by the friction kinematics chain through the ground. The difference in torque on the roadwheels and tires (caused by turns or bumpy ground) drives the second degree of freedom, (overcoming the torque of inner friction) to equalise the driving torque on the tires. The {{sensitivity of the}} differential depends on the inner friction through the second degree of freedom. All of the differentials (so called [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive") use clutches and brakes for restricting the second degree of freedom, so all suffer from the same disadvantage—decreased sensitivity to a <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> environment. The sensitivity of the ECU controlled differential is also limited by the time delay caused by sensors and the response time of the actuators.|$|E
2500|$|Porsche also {{developed}} the car's aerodynamics, which {{were designed to}} increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had fixed suspensions). Its [...] "zero lift" [...] aerodynamics were {{a big part of}} keeping it drivable. The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) which was at the time the most advanced all-wheel-drive system in a production car. Capable of <b>dynamically</b> <b>changing</b> the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a [...] "super" [...] street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of available power to the rear wheels, helping {{make the most of the}} rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. [...] The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tire and equipped with a built-in tire pressure monitoring system.|$|E
