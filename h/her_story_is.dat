5|$|With Bran now awake, Old Nan {{tells him}} {{a tale of}} a long-ago endless winter, when the White Walkers first {{appeared}} riding their dead horses and raising Wights from the men they slaughtered. <b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> interrupted by Robb who sadly confirms to Bran that his injuries are permanent, and he'll never walk again. Bran, saying {{he is unable to}} remember anything about his fall, wishes he were dead.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt is {{captured}} by a French patrol after witnessing them execute an Arab prisoner. A French military officer, Comte (Richard Moire), imprisons and abuses her. Eberhardt befriends an Arab prisoner named Sayed, who is later executed. Slimene reveals that Comte executed Sayed {{in the hopes}} of provoking a war. Eberhardt writes to Barracund telling him everything; <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> printed as front page news. Shortly thereafter Eberhardt is viciously attacked and wounded by an Arab swordsman. Eberhardt believes that Comte is responsible for the attack. At the conclusion of the sentencing of her attacker to life imprisonment, the French authorities deport Eberhardt. She moves to Marseille, where she is accompanied by Slimene the following year. The two become married, which allows Eberhardt to return to Algiers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> told in {{the book}} [...] "The Courage To Give" [...] by Jackie Waldman. [...] <b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in the 2010 book Women of Spirit, by Katherine Martin.|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>her</b> <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> folktales set in Chile's {{northern}} {{region and}} touched on conditions of poverty, violence, and injustice. Alonso {{was recognized as}} one of the country's most distinguished writers about rural life, and <b>her</b> <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> collected in many books.|$|R
50|$|Some of <b>her</b> <b>stories</b> <b>were</b> {{televised}} as marionette plays.|$|R
5|$|<b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the Gaudiya and Nimbarka {{schools of}} Vaishnavism give the highly esoteric nature of Radha's {{relationship}} to Krishna {{as the reason}} why <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> not mentioned in detail in the other Puranic texts.|$|E
25|$|A {{white woman}} {{believed}} to have been an English castaway stranded on the shores of Lambasi in South Africa, She married into the amaTshomane family, to Chief Matoyi’s son. She was given a Xhosa name 'Gquma'. Xhosa people distinctively remember her as {{this was one of the}} royal families in that area, which explains why <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> recorded in both oral and written history.|$|E
25|$|<b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> dramatized in {{an episode}} of Deadly Women.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> told on the {{historical}} documentary series Mummies Alive ...|$|R

25|$|Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue (French: Justine, ou Les Malheurs de la Vertu) is a 1791 {{novel by}} Donatien Alphonse François de Sade, {{better known as}} the Marquis de Sade. Justine is set just before the French Revolution in France and {{tells the story of a}} young woman who goes under the name of Thérèse. <b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> recounted to Madame de Lorsagne while {{defending}} herself for her crimes, en route to punishment and death. She explains the series of misfortunes that led her present situation.|$|E
25|$|Alice courageously {{faces the}} shame of bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is the test of the title—of herself, her family, and her community. <b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold feet at the news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E
500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Jacobite {{rebellion}} of 1745, Flora MacDonald became famous for rescuing Prince Charles Edward Stuart from the Hanoverian troops. <b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at Kilmuir. She was visited by Samuel Johnson and James Boswell during their 1773 Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland and written on her gravestone are Johnson's words that hers was [...] "A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour". In the wake of the rebellion the clan system was broken up and islands of the Hebrides became a series of landed estates.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>stories</b> <b>are</b> also {{printed in}} the book [...] "Give Me The Children", co-written with her sister Pola Arbiser. <b>Her</b> <b>stories</b> have <b>been</b> printed in {{newspapers}} and magazines including The New York Post, and the book Chicken Soup for the Jewish Soul.|$|R
500|$|Another common {{criticism}} {{was that the}} book was aimed at fans of The Simpsons and not a general audience. A preview in People said the bottom line was that the book is [...] "for die-hard fans only." [...] Bacchus concurred, saying [...] "Cartwright writes {{as if she were}} speaking to devotees of The Simpsons Fan Club, too often providing bland tidbits of background that only obsessives would ever really care about." [...] Rob Sheridan of the National Post also believes that the book is [...] "aimed squarely at rabid Simpsons fans", and criticized the writing, commenting that [...] "the chronology of <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> sometimes muddled, and a lot of sentences have that first-draft feeling [...] But none of this is anything to have a cow about." ...|$|E
500|$|Sycorax's silent role {{plays an}} {{important}} part in postcolonial interpretations of The Tempest. [...] Because she is native to Algiers and <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> only heard through others (Prospero, Ariel, and Caliban), she is championed by some scholars as a representation of the silenced African woman. Postcolonial authors have also claimed her; for example, Kamau Brathwaite, in his 1994 work Barabajan Poems, includes [...] "Sycorax's book" [...] as a counterpart to [...] "Prospero's book" [...] (mentioned in Act 5 of Shakespeare's play). In an attempt to give voice to unspoken indigenous cultures, Brathwaite's poems outline the history of the Caribbean through Sycorax's eyes. Sycorax is presented as Brathwaite's muse, possessing him and his computer to give full voice to the history of the silenced, who in Brathwaite's philosophy are not only Caribbean natives, but any culture under-represented during the colonial period.|$|E
500|$|Christine A. Colón and Bonnie E. Field, two {{single women}} in their thirties, {{expressed}} their frustrations with the Ludys' book in Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church. Colón, an English professor at Wheaton College; and Field, a former English professor at Wayland Baptist University, criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. They argue that [...] "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" [...] and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states [...] "the more delay'd, delighted." [...] Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Her</b> <b>story</b> <b>was</b> also {{included}} in Julina Khusaini's National Geographic documentary Hidden Genders (2003).|$|R

500|$|A. O. Scott {{identifies}} the script's precise {{use of force}} and adept use of language, including a memorable line created by Fletcher for the adaptation: a [...] "risky, remarkable film adaptation, written by Geoffrey Fletcher, the facts of Precious's life are also laid out with unsparing force (though not in overly graphic detail). But just as Push achieves an eloquence that makes it {{far more than a}} fictional diary of extreme dysfunction, so too does Precious avoid the traps of well-meaning, preachy lower-depths realism. It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> that of a writer discovering a voice. 'These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,' she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Jacobite {{rebellion}} of 1745, Flora MacDonald became famous for rescuing Prince Charles Edward Stuart from the Hanoverian troops. Although she was born on South Uist <b>her</b> <b>story</b> <b>is</b> strongly associated with their escape via Skye and she is buried at Kilmuir in Trotternish. [...] Samuel Johnson and James Boswell's visit to Skye in 1773 and their meeting with Flora MacDonald in Kilmuir is recorded in Boswell's The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides. Boswell wrote, [...] "To see Dr Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute Miss Flora MacDonald in the isle of Sky, was a striking sight; for though somewhat congenial in their notions, it was very improbable they should meet here". Johnson's words that Flora MacDonald was [...] "A name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour" [...] are written on her gravestone. After this rebellion the clan system was broken up and Skye became a series of landed estates.|$|E
500|$|<b>Her</b> <b>Story</b> <b>is</b> an {{interactive}} movie game, {{focusing on a}} series of seven fictional police interviews from 1994. As the game begins, players are presented with an old desktop, which contains several files and programs. Among the programs are instructional text files, which explain the game's mechanics. One of the programs automatically open on the desktop is the [...] "L.O.G.I.C. Database", which allows players to search and sort video clips within the database, of which there are 271. The video clips are police interviews with Hannah Smith, a British woman. The interviews are unable to be watched in their entirety, forcing players to view short clips. In the interviews, Hannah answers unknown questions to an off-screen detective, prompting players to decipher the context of the answers. Hannah's answers are transcribed, and players find clips by searching in the database for words from the transcriptions, attempting to solve the case by piecing together information. As players select clips, they can enter user tags, which are then available as searchable terms. One of the files on the desktop is a database checker, which allows players to review the amount of clips that have been viewed; as a clip is viewed, the red box in the database checker changes to green. The desktop also features the minigame Mirror Game, based on the strategy board game Reversi.|$|E
