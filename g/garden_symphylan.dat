50|$|Symphyla are rapid runners. They are {{primarily}} herbivores and detritus feeders living {{deep in the}} soil, under stones, in decaying wood, and in other moist places where they feed on the root hairs and rootlets and can sometimes cause crop failure. The <b>garden</b> <b>symphylan,</b> Scutigerella immaculata can be a serious pest of vegetable crops and tree seedlings and occurs in greenhouses as well as agricultural situations. A species of Hanseniella has been recorded as a pest of sugar cane and pineapples in Queensland. A few species are found up trees and in caves. A species of Symphylella {{has been shown to}} be predominantly predatory, and some species are saprophagous.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} of {{the response of the}} <b>garden</b> <b>symphylan,</b> Scutigerella immaculata (Newport), to naturally occurring chemicals. Results of olfactometer studies with plant odors were inconclusive because air currents in one olfactometer and the shape of another had undesirable effects on symphylan behavior. Non-random distributions of symphylans in chambers designed to investigate the response of symphylans to chemotactic stimuli suggested that symphylans produced an aggregation pheromone. The existence of an aggregation pheromone was confirmed when an average of 81. 4...|$|E
40|$|Garden symphylans (Scutiger-ella immaculata Newport) are small, white, “centipede-like ” soil arthropods, {{common in}} many {{agricultural}} production systems in Oregon, Washing-ton, and California (Berry and Robinson, 1974; Michelbacher, 1935). They feed on roots and other subter-ranean plant parts, causing significant crop losses in some cases. Control {{can be extremely}} difficult due to symphylans’ vertical movement in the soil, the com-lexity of sampling, {{and the lack of}} sim-ple, effective control methods (Umble and Fisher, 2003 a). With the recent spread of organic agri-culture and better soil management tech-niques, crop damage associated with sym-phylans has become more commonplace. It is ironic that these pests are such a problem on farms that practice good soil management — maintaining soil with good tilth, high organic matter, and low compaction. Damage Diagnosing a <b>garden</b> <b>symphylan</b> prob-lem is sometimes difficult, since damage may be exhibited in a number of forms and garden symphylans are not always easy to find, even when their damage is obvious. Economic damage may result from direct feeding on root and tuber crops and reduced stands of direct-seeded or transplanted crops (Umble and Fisher, 2003 a). However, most commonly, root feed-ing reduces the crop’s ability to take up water and nutrients, which leads to gen-eral stunting. Root damage may also render plants A <b>garden</b> <b>symphylan</b> {{is about the size of}} this letter ”l. ” Soils with high organic matter, good structure, and reduced disturbance, as in these hand-dug garden beds, are ideal habitat for garden symphylans...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 <b>Garden</b> <b>symphylans</b> (Scutigerella immaculata Newport) are {{increasingly}} important pests of below-ground parts of over 100 crops in Oregon. The {{focus of our}} work was to improve S. immaculata management through 1) development of a bait sampling method, 2) examination of the susceptibility of selected crops to S. immaculata feeding {{in the field and}} laboratory and a reanalysis of previously published results, and 3) investigation of the suitability of selected crops and soil for the development of S. immaculata populations in the field and laboratory. Sample size requirements were developed for the bait and soil sampling methods. Estimating densities of 1 to 20 S. immaculata at fixed precision levels required 1. 5 times more sample units for the baiting method than the soil method. Sampling recommendations for the baiting method performed well when validated by resampling a large independent data set. The bait sampling method provides an effective reliable alternative to the standard soil sampling method. In the laboratory, as S. immaculata densities increased, dry weight of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) seedlings were significantly reduced from 85 to 89...|$|R
40|$|Sweet corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops produced in New York, in terms of acreage, crop value and number of producers. Fresh market and processing sweet corn are produced for local, regional, and national markets. With the exception of rust and seed decay, sweet corn has relatively few disease problems relative to other vegetables. A wide variety of insects attack the crop, causing losses in yield as well as quality. However quality is critical, especially in the fresh market wholesale business. Wholesale buyers of sweet corn can reject entire shipments if damage levels are as low as 10 %. New York sweet corn producers generally use sound integrated pest management practices in managing insects and other pests. While a relatively large number of insecticides are registered for use, organophosphates remain important tools for resistance management and/or control for pests such as seed corn maggot, flea beetles, <b>garden</b> <b>symphylans,</b> and aphids. Weeds are also major pests of sweet corn. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbufos, atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, bentazon, and propiconazole would have significant impacts on production and profitability...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Studies were {{conducted}} on the mechanisms contributing to resistance in broccoli, Brassica oleracea italica, to the <b>garden</b> <b>symphylan,</b> Scutigerella immaculata (Newport). Differences in resistance to symphylan injury were shown between five selected broccoli cultivars. The hybrid cultivars, Crusader, Green Duke and Bravo, showed {{a higher level of}} resistance to symphylans than the cultivars Waltham and Spartan. Results indicated that tolerance was the major mechanism contributing to symphylan resistance in the cultivars. Of the cultivars studied, Crusader was the most tolerant followed by Green Duke, Bravo, Waltham and Spartan. There {{were no significant differences between}} the cultivars with respect to preference and antibiosis. Field experiments confirmed that there were differences in resistance between the cultivars to symphylan injury...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Presentation date: 1968 - 02 - 14 A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} biological relationships between the <b>garden</b> <b>symphylan,</b> Scutigerella immaculata (Newport), and an entomogenous fungus, Entomophthora coronata (Costantin), which attacks it under certain conditions. Until this fungus was found to infect this pest, no organism which seemed to offer promise of control had been discovered. Symphylan populations were exposed to E. coronata and the pathology followed. When new syrnphylans were added to an infected culture as the diseased individuals died, an epizootic condition developed to {{a point at which}} symphylans were infected and killed in less than two days. E. coronata survived in contaminated containers for as much as five months without susceptible hosts as evidenced by infection of reintroduced symphylans. Wax moth larvae, Galleria, and European house crickets showed high mortality when injected with spores suspended in physiological saline solution. Wax moth larvae and mealworms, Tenebrio, were infected when they were dusted with spores and incubated at 15 °C temperature in high humidity. Penetration of the cuticle by germ tubes from attached spores is the usual pathway of infection. Temperature ranges for both organisms correspond closely. Both become active a few degrees above freezing and reach an optimum between 20 ° and 30 °C. Lethal temperature for both is somewhat below 37 °C. Eight sulfonamides and an equal number of antibiotics were tested against the fungus. None showed inhibitory effects. Fungal inhibiting agents Mycostatin, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, sorbic acid, and formalin were destructive at rates used in insect rearing media. E. coronata grows well on a large number of high protein media. Mass-rearing for large experiments seems possible...|$|E
