5|$|Little <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general {{sweep of}} the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's brooch, but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole {{one of the other}} Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous Team Rocket, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how much <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three years following the events of Red and Blue. After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of Red and Blue, who the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.|$|E

Another aspect is the image that <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last decade in regards of pigeon racing, since nowadays it stands for a fine art within the country, with symbolic prizes and bets. A high collaboration with pigeon fanciers from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany is also observed.|$|E

25|$|UNHCR's mandate has {{gradually}} been {{expanded to include}} protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) and people in IDP-like situations. These are civilians who {{have been forced to}} flee their homes, but who have not reached a neighboring country. IDPs do not fit the legal definition of a refugee under the 1951 Refugee Convention, 1967 Protocol and the 1969 Organization for African Unity Convention, because they have not left their country. As the nature of war <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few decades, with more and more internal conflicts replacing interstate wars, the number of IDPs has increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|As the 20th century progressed, {{trade on}} the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides {{gradually}} declined, until by the eighties {{both sides of the}} river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. A decision was taken by local government to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s following a master plan. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> space of a few years into a vibrant area. It is ironic that this development has partially returned the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.|$|E

People in 20 different states assessed the country's reputation in terms of culture, politics, exports, its people and its attractiveness to tourists, immigrants and investments. Germany has been named the world's second most valued nation among 50 countries in 2010. Another global opinion poll, for the BBC, revealed that Germany is recognised for the most positive influence in the world in 2010. A majority of 59% have a positive view of the country, while 14% have a negative view.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{bacteremia}} {{caused by}} dental procedures (in most cases due to streptococci viridans, which reside in oral cavity), {{such as a}} cleaning or extraction of a tooth {{was thought to be}} more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current American Heart Association guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1995 that a {{constitutional}} reform recognized such cultural leaders, {{but they have not}} been fully restored to previous powers, as so much of society <b>has</b> <b>changed.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> pre-colonial era, all the Acoli believed in the same superior being, lubanga, through an intermediary deity, known as the jok-ker, which meant ‘the ruling deity’. Killing of a person was prohibited but if it took place, negotiations for blood money were led by the victim's family, with agreement followed by rituals of a reconciliation ceremony to restore the killer to the community, and to bring peace between clans. In addition, the people have important rituals for cleansing homes and sites, to welcome back people who have been away a long time, to clear spirits from places where killings have occurred, and to welcome people who have been captive.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} animated film, the Beast does little singing {{apart from a}} brief solo during [...] "Something There" [...] because Menken and Ashman {{had not been able}} to agree upon a suitable moment within the film during which the Beast could have performed his own song. However, Menken considered it imperative that the character sing a solo in both the stage and live-action adaptations because he believes the Beast is actually the story's protagonist [...] "whose life <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> most dramatic way." [...] In the stage production, the Beast performs the ballad [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] after he frightens Belle away from the castle, wondering if he will ever be able to love anyone since he struggles to love her. Menken and Condon had deliberated whether or not the song should be re-used in the remake; despite Menken's strong attachment to [...] "If I Can't Love Her", the musical number was ultimately omitted because it had been written specifically to conclude the first act of a Broadway musical. Screenwriter Stephen Chbosky had originally suggested that the character receive a new song to perform some time after he has saved Belle from the wolves. Due to the remake's three-act structure, Menken and Condon concluded that it would be best to replace [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a song that better depicts the Beast's feelings for Belle after he has finally learned to love her and realizes she is no longer his prisoner, while accepting the grimm reality that releasing her would ultimately decrease his chances of becoming human again. Rice, who co-wrote [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with Menken, further convinced the composer to substitute [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] with a more appropriate song, joking, [...] "it would be like writing 'Don't Cry for Me Brazil'," [...] referring to [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina", a song he famously wrote for the stage musical Evita.|$|E
