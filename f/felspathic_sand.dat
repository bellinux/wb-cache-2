A stream flowed over this debris, dividing into branches before reaching the lake-bed, where its waters were collected, and whence it meandered southward to fall into the Yangma.|$|E
40|$|The cone pressuremeter is an in situ {{testing device}} {{comprising}} a pressuremeter mounted behind a cone penetrometer {{of the same}} diameter. Previously reported tests had indicated that the cone pressuremeter can provide measurements of soil strength, stiffness and in situ stress. The study presented in this thesis is aimed at developing methods of interpretation of the cone pressuremeter {{that can be applied}} with confidence to a variety of soil types. Carbonate sands have been the cause of significant problems associated with the design of foundations for offshore structures. A programme of cone pressuremeter testing in a carbonate sand from the west coast of Ireland is presented. Tests were carried out in a calibration chamber where conditions of vertical and horizontal stress and relative density were controlled. The influence of these parameters on measured values of cone resistance and pressuremeter limit pressure is assessed. Similar tests were also carried out in a <b>felspathic</b> <b>sand,</b> and correlations have been presented for deriving horizontal stress and relative density that are applicable to most types of sand. The influence of creep strains and of overconsolidation were other features of carbonate sand that have been assessed with the cone pressuremeter. A numerical model which accounts for the crushing characteristics of carbonate sand is presented, and is shown to improve significantly predictions of limit pressure measured in the calibration chamber. Cone pressuremeter tests were carried out in soft clay at the Bothkennar test site in Scotland. An analysis based upon cavity expansion theory was shown to provide good estimates of undrained shear strength and stiffness compared with results from other in situ and laboratory tests. Estimates of the in situ horizontal stress were found to be unrealistically high. Shear modulus in both sand and clay has been measured from unload-reload cycles carried out during pressuremeter expansion. The stress levels and strain amplitudes of these cycles have been shown to influence the shear modulus greatly. In sand, a procedure for relating these moduli to those at an extremely small reference strain is presented. In clay, shear moduli are shown to give a remarkably close agreement to others reported from Bothkennar, when due account of the strain amplitude is made. Finally, a time/cost analysis between the cone pressuremeter, the cone penetrometer and the self-boring pressuremeter is presented. The cone pressuremeter is found to be a cost-effective device bearing in mind the amount and quality of information it can provide...|$|E
40|$|In the Maizuru Zone develope the Permian Maizuru Group, the Lower Middle Triassic Yakuno Group, and the Carnian Nabae Group. Studies on the {{sandstones}} {{of these}} groups seem to throw light on the geohistory of this zone. In this paper, the writer first describes the general characters of the sandstones, based chiefly on the observations under the microscope, {{and at the same}} time on field observations. Some compositional and textural properties of the sandstones have been examined, rather in detail; especially from the viewpoint of their maturity. Generally speaking, the sandstones of the Maizuru Group are the most immature; next come those of the Yakuno Group; and the sandstones of the N_ 2 formation of the Nabae Group are mostly mature. It is supposed that the sediments of the Maizuru Group were supplied mainly from the large exposure of andesite, effusive ã€œ hypabyssal acid rocks, and shale etc., judging from the fact that the fragments of these rocks are very abundant in the sandstones of this group, especially in the coarser grained ones. It has been suggested further that these rockfragments were not decomposed into fine-gained sands, but were changed directly into finer clayey detrital matters, and joined with other clayey materials which has been produced by weathering at their provenance. These clayey detritals were not separated from the sand grains, but deposited together with the sands in the same places. The turbidity current theory seems to account well for such a mechanism of deposition. The Yakuno Group grew to its maturity chiefly by selective breaking and selective transportion of felspar grains. As quartz fragments are endurable against destruction, they must have been deposited almost keeping their original sizes. As the result of the selective transportation, felspar grains 0. 1 - 0. 2 mm in size were accumulated in certa in places, while, at the same time, quartz grains were concentrated in other places. Hence, if the term "maturity" is to be used, the felspar-rich finer sandstone and the quartz-rich coarser sandstone should be considered to be in the same degree of maturity. Such are matters of no small concern also in the studies on the sandstones of the Maizure Group. Decomposition of rock fragments and production of detrital clay must have occurred also in the course of sedimentation of the Yakuno Group. But, in this case the removal of the clay followed; and, the sandstones of this group have little detrital clay matrix. Removal of clay, like that of <b>felspathic</b> fine <b>sands,</b> is due to different modes of motions of sediment grains of various sizes, under the same velocity of the stream. The sandstones of the N_ 2 formation have very distinct characteristics from those of the other groups. Removal of clay has been sufficient. The compositional properties of these sandstones, rich both in quartz and in felspar, may be due not only to their maturity, but also to the nature of their provenance. From the abovestated facts is follows that, for the examination of the maturity of sandstones, we should consider both their compositional and textural properties and especially their mutual relation. Selective breaking and selective transportation of various components of sandstones are the two factors of the most importance in study on sandstone maturity...|$|R
