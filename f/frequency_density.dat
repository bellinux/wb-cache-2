The <b>frequency</b> <b>densities</b> of electrons penetrating to a depth x in a target, with a fraction of initial kinetic energy, u, are calculated using Monte Carlo methods for beam energies of 50, 80, 100, 120 and 150 keV in a tungsten target.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Recently, the big {{sagebrush}} taxa {{has been}} split into subspecies and forms. Four habitat types related to subspecies of big sagebrush were studied in Eastern Oregon. Response of understory vegetation was measured following three range improvement techniques implemented on the four habitat types for several ages of treatment. Crown cover, density, and frequency of three subspecies of big sagebrush were measured, the relationship of sagebrush to improvement treatment and composition of understory vegetation was evaluated. In general, the same plant species responded differently on four habitat types manipulated by spray-release treatment. Approximately one-third of the perennial grass species increased, one-third decreased, and one-third showed no change in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover between treated and untreated areas four years after treatment on the basin big sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass-bottlebrush squirreltail habitat type. However, total grass representation increased after treatment. Perennial forb and shrub species generally showed no change in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover in the fourth year following spray-release treatment on the same habitat type. Perennial grass and shrub species generally showed no change while perennial forb species generally decreased in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover between treated and untreated areas in the fourth year following spray-release treatment on the Wyoming big sagebrush-Thurber needlegrass habitat type. Perennial vegetation generally showed no difference in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover between treated and untreated areas in the sixth year following spray-release treatment on mountain big sagebrush-Idaho fescue habitat type. Perennial grass species generally increased, perennial forb species generally showed no change, and shrubs species generally decreased in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover between treated and untreated areas in the sixth year after spray-release treatment on the Wyoming big sagebrush-bluebunch wheatgrass habitat type. The same plant species responded differently to three improvement treatments implemented on the Wyoming big sagebrush-Thurber needlegrass habitat type. Annual vegetation generally increased in frequency on treated areas compared to untreated areas in six years following spray-seed treatment on this habitat type. Approximately half of the native perennial grass species decreased and half showed no change in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover after six years following spray-seed treatment on this habitat type. Total grass representation increased after treatment. Perennial forb and shrub species generally showed no change in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover after six years following spray-seed treatment on this habitat type. Approximately half of the annual forb and grass species increased in frequency and the rest either decreased or showed no change in frequency on treated and untreated areas in ten years following plow-seed treatment on this habitat type. Total representation of annual vegetation increased after treatment. Perennial grass species generally decreased in density, frequency, and cover in ten years following plow-seed treatment on this habitat type. Total grass representation, however, increased after treatment on this habitat type {{as a result of}} seeding crested wheatgrass. Perennial forb and shrub species generally showed no change in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover ten years after plow-seed treatment on this habitat type. Sagebrush did decrease in representation while green rabbitbrush increased after treatment. Annual vegetation generally showed no change in frequency in the fourth year after spray-release treatment on the Wyoming big sagebrush-Thurber needlegrass habitat type. Perennial grass species generally showed no change, perennial forb species generally decreased, and shrub species generally showed no change in <b>frequency,</b> <b>density,</b> and cover between treated and untreated areas in the fourth year after spray-release treatment on this habitat type. Sagebrush was found to reinvade at a constant rate in the Wyoming big sagebrush-Thurber needlegrass habitat type in the sixth year following spray-seed treatment. Extrapolation of data showed in approximately 7. 4 years the density of sagebrush on the treated area would be the same as on untreated areas.

The unique structure has earlier been shown to enhance heat transfer in pool boiling applications as well as in convective boiling in both small and large channels. Pool boiling tests were conducted in R 134 a and in the dielectric fluid FC- 72 and were visualized with a high speed imaging system. Data on bubble size, bubble <b>frequency</b> <b>density,</b> heat transfer coefficient and the latent and sensible heat flux contributions were collected and calculated at heat flux varying between 2 and 15 W/cm 2. The enhanced surface produces smaller bubbles and sustains a high bubble <b>frequency</b> <b>density</b> in both fluids, even at low heat flux. An enhanced latent heat transfer mechanism of up to 10 times, compared to that of a plain reference surface, is the main reason for the improved boiling heat transfer performance on the enhanced surface. The data also suggests that the high nucleation bubble <b>frequency</b> <b>density</b> leads to increased bubble pumping action and thus enhancing single phase convection of up to 6 times.
