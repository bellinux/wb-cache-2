5|$|The Fringe team discovers a Triad {{gang member}} and ties to several shell {{companies}} the gang {{has set up}} in the US. They interview Elizabeth Jarvis (Ingrid Torrance), one of the companies' large investors, but she seems unaware of her investment's criminal background. While at her house, Peter (Joshua Jackson) observes signs of obsessive compulsive and germaphobe characteristics such as large quantities of <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer.</b> Walter informs him the worm has a medicinal purpose, not a narcotic one as they previously believed. These two discoveries lead Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv) back to Jarvis' house, and they learn that her son (Colby Paul) has an immunodeficiency disorder. To allow him {{to be able to go}} outside, his mother and doctor have been giving him an injection to his spleen once a month, though he is unaware of the medicine's origins.|$|E
25|$|Hand washing using hand {{sanitizing}} wipes is {{an alternative}} during traveling {{in the absence of}} soap and water. Alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer</b> must contain at least 60% alcohol to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is used {{in medical}} wipes and most common {{antibacterial}} <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer</b> gels as an antiseptic. Ethanol kills organisms by denaturing their proteins and dissolving their lipids and is effective against most bacteria and fungi, and many viruses. However, ethanol is ineffective against bacterial spores.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> {{are most}} {{effective}} against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. Alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus or Norwalk type viruses, {{the most common cause}} of contagious gastroenteritis.|$|R
50|$|The term {{sanitizer}} {{has been}} used to define substances that both clean and disinfect. More recently this term has been applied to alcohol-based products that disinfect the <b>hands</b> (alcohol <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers).</b> Alcohol <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> however are not considered to be effective on soiled hands.|$|R

25|$|Alcohol-free <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer</b> {{efficacy}} {{is heavily}} dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs. More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride {{have been shown to}} have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.|$|E
25|$|The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA {{recommends}} {{hand washing}} over <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer</b> rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty. The {{increasing use of}} these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve {{as a replacement for}} proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer</b> or hand {{antiseptic}} is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In {{the late}} 1990s and {{early part of}} the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity. Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.|$|E
40|$|These studies {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} ethanol <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> with or without organic acids to remove detectable rhinovirus from the hands and prevent experimental rhinovirus infection. Ethanol <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> were significantly more effective than hand washing with soap and water. The addition of organic acids to the ethanol provided residual virucidal activity that persisted for at least 4 h. Whether these treatments will reduce rhinovirus infection in the natural setting remains to be determined...|$|R

40|$|With {{respect to}} the {{realization}} that hand hygiene is a prerequisite for the prevention of diseases, the conventional method of washing hand with soap is not quite popular these days. Instead it is the use of handsanitizer, which has gradually become the method of choice due to its various advantages. In the present work, alcoholic and nonalcoholic <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> were prepared in the form of polymer based gels and their antiseptic efficacy was evaluated. Microbiological methods revealed that alcoholic <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> were more efficacious in providing hand hygiene...|$|R
500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizer</b> readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E

25|$|Frequent use of alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> {{can cause}} dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers {{are added to}} the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or {{eliminated}} by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based <b>hand</b> <b>sanitizers</b> containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur. The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.|$|R
