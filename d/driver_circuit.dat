2500|$|Base {{triggering}} input circuit: {{the input}} trigger signal is fed {{directly to the}} base via a fast switching diode , possibly after being shaped by a pulse shaping network. This way of driving an avalanche transistor was relatively less employed in first generation circuits because the base node has a relatively low impedance and an input capacitance [...] which is highly nonlinear (as a matter of fact, it is exponential) under the large signal regime: this causes a fairly large, input voltage dependent, delay time, which was analyzed in detail in the paper [...] However, the required inverse voltage for the feed diode is far lower respect diodes {{to be used in}} collectior trigger input circuits, and since ultra fast Schottky diodes are easily and cheaply found, this is the <b>driver</b> <b>circuit</b> employed in most modern avalanche transistor circuit. This is also the reason why the diode [...] in the following applicative circuits is symbolized as a Schottky diode.|$|E

50|$|Stepper motor {{performance}} is strongly {{dependent on the}} <b>driver</b> <b>circuit.</b> Torque curves may be extended to greater speeds if the stator poles can be reversed more quickly, the limiting factor being the winding inductance. To overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly, one must increase the drive voltage. This leads further to the necessity of limiting the current that these high voltages may otherwise induce.|$|E
50|$|The only {{intrinsic}} limitation in commutation {{speed is}} due to the internal capacitances of the MOSFET (see figure 4).
