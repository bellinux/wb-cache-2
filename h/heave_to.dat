5|$|Amazon {{went on to}} join Nelson in {{the chase}} to the West Indies and back during the Trafalgar Campaign. During the voyage across the Atlantic, Nelson wanted to pass on {{specific}} instructions to his captains about how he wished to engage the French, but {{did not want to}} lose time by ordering his ships to <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> Instead he gave the plans to Parker, who was described by Pulteney Malcolm as the 'best frigate captain in the service', and Parker sped along the line in Amazon, delivering the instructions so efficiently that the fleet lost 'hardly a yard of ground'. Once more in European waters after the fleet's return, Amazon captured the Spanish privateer Principe de la Paz off Ushant on 17 September 1805. Principe was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns and four swivels. Her crew of 160 men, under the command of Captain François Beck, were principally French. She had been out five weeks and had captured the packet Prince of Wales from Lisbon, and the letter of marque Lady Nelson, which had been sailing from Virginia to Glasgow. A number of Lady Nelsons crew were aboard Principe, as was a considerable amount of specie.|$|E
25|$|On 9 January 1917, Seeadler {{came upon}} a single-funneled steamer, raised a signal {{requesting}} a time signal (not an uncommon thing for a sailing ship long out of contact with land to do), and raised the German ensign {{too late for the}} target ship to take any evasive action. Three shots were needed to persuade the 3,268 ton Gladys Royle, carrying coal from Cardiff to Buenos Aires, to <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> Her crew was taken off unharmed, and she was scuttled.|$|E
25|$|At 3:00 {{am on the}} 6th, Ariel was {{approaching}} Dungeness, so started signalling for a pilot. At 4:00 am she hove to and continued to signal with flares and rockets. Taeping, also signalling for a pilot, was coming up fast and was close astern of Ariel at 5:00 am. There was no sign that Taeping would <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> so Captain Keay ordered Ariel's sails to be filled to keep ahead of the other ship, {{to be sure of}} getting the first pilot. On Taeping Captain MacKinnon conceded and also hove to.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heaving</b> <b>to</b> in {{the junk}} rigged yacht is simple. Simply luff the boat {{into the wind}} with the sails close hauled and then put the helm down when the forward speed is spent. The battens will tame the luffing sails. <b>Heaving</b> <b>to</b> in severe weather is done by {{dropping}} the forward junk sails into their cradle and reefing the aft junk rigged sails—both tasks that are simplified by the junk rig. <b>Heaving</b> <b>to</b> in light winds can be difficult {{due to the lack}} of sail drive up wind.|$|R

25|$|Overnight {{there was}} a strong {{northwest}} wind and heavy sea, drenching everyone in the boats. At first light on 24 October the boats could not see each other. Mr Vernon's boat hoisted its sail and set off before the wind, until at 1010 hrs his crew sighted the Third Officer's boat several miles to the southwest. They tried to steer towards it, but the heavy weather prevented them. At 1230 hrs Vernon abandoned the attempt and altered course to the southeast. At 1700 hrs he ordered the sail lowered and the boat to <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> with her sea anchor. At 2300 hrs the rudder broke off at the top pintle, so two of Vernon's men used an oar as an improvised and unsatisfactory steering oar. On 25 October the weather was still wild so Mr Vernon's boat drifted before the wind with her sea anchor and sail.|$|E
25|$|After {{an opening}} ten overs which yielded 46 runs for Sri Lanka, Sanath Jayasuriya was trapped lbw by Deighton Butler {{with the last}} {{delivery}} of the tenth over, following which Daren Powell and Dwayne Smith tied the Sri Lankans down with good pace bowling. Powell got Kumar Sangakkara's wicket for 7, before Smith dug out two wickets with successive balls as Sri Lanka moved to 73/4. Mahela Jayawardene gave an <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> Powell, and Sri Lanka were five down for 92, after 25 overs. Banks finished with 26 runs from his ten overs, securing the wicket of Chandana, following which Sri Lanka felt were compelled to lash out {{in order to have}} a go at reaching the target. The part-timer Deonarine got two wickets, including the final one of Russel Arnold, who made a slow 59, before bowling Sri Lanka out to 193 at the end of the 47th over, thereby helping his team win their first game of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her to <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> and be prepared to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast loose the number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that he was all right and requested the Seneca to go ahead and he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, Seeadler encountered another steamship, which {{refused to}} identify itself. The German ensign was raised and a shot fired across {{the bow of}} the Lundy Island, which was carrying sugar from Madagascar. The steamer still refused to <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> and Luckner fired four rounds directly at her. The steamer then hove to and lowered her boats, but her captain ignored an order to come to Seeadler. A German boarding party was sent over and discovered that the crew had abandoned ship when the first shots were fired, leaving the captain alone on board. Captain Bannister later told Luckner that he had previously been captured by a German raider and had given his parole, which he had broken; thus, he was not anxious to be a prisoner of war again. Luckner continued his voyage southwards, and by 21 January he was in mid-Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa when he found the 2,199 ton French three-masted barque Charles Gounod, which was loaded with corn. She was quickly dispatched, but her log book recorded information about other ships she had met and their intended route.|$|E
25|$|The trawler {{designated}} Khánh Hòa Province Trawler (map reference #2) {{was first}} sighted by Market Time aircraft on 29 February approximately 90 miles east northeast of Nha Trang with a southwesterly course. Surveillance was continued by Market Time vessels until {{she crossed the}} 12 mile limit 28 miles northeast of Nha Trang. Ignoring warning to <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> for boarding, the trawler continued on towards the beach. A South Vietnamese Navy patrol boat opened fire on the trawler and it quickly changed course and returned fire. Assisted by a U.S. Air Force AC-47 gunship, swift boats PCF-42, PCF-43, PCF-46, PCF-47, PCF-48 and two SVN junks sortied to help the patrol craft chase the trawler to a cove where it ran aground in the Hon Heo Secret Zone At 0230, 1 March, five 81-millimeter mortar rounds from PCF-47 were direct hits and the trawler exploded with a massive explosion due to the munitions aboard. Fourteen dead North Vietnamese sailors were recovered the following morning. Rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers; along with considerable ammunition and explosives were recovered from the sunken trawler. The salvage operations extended over 12 days and included the recovery of a 14.5 millimeter antiaircraft gun and 68 cases of ammunition.|$|E
500|$|Clive Carey, who {{had been}} in Australia during the war, was brought back to replace Joan Cross and rebuild the company. The critic Philip Hope-Wallace wrote in 1946 that Carey had begun to make a difference, but that Sadler's Wells needed [...] "a big <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> get out of mediocrity". In the same year, The Times Literary Supplement asked whether the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells {{companies}} would stick to their old bases, [...] "or shall they boldly embrace the ideal of a National Theatre and a National Opera in English?" [...] Carey left in 1947, replaced in January 1948 by a triumvirate of James Robertson as musical director, Michael Mudie as his assistant conductor and Norman Tucker in charge of administration. From October 1948, Tucker was given sole control. Mudie became ill, and the young Charles Mackerras was appointed to deputise for him.|$|E

500|$|The ship, which {{identified}} {{herself as}} Willmoto, did not satisfactorily identify {{herself to the}} American warships. After ordering [...] "Willmoto" [...] to <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> Omahas captain dispatched an armed boarding party. At 05:37 Lieutenant George K. Carmichael, along with the boarding party, began {{to make way for}} the vessel. Around this time, the merchant hoisted the signal flags [...] "Fox Mike", indicating that the ship was sinking and that they required assistance. Two distinct explosions could be heard within the ship when the boarding party began to climbing the ship's ladder. In an attempt to leave the sinking ship, several of the crew had lowered lifeboats, but Lt. Carmichael ordered them to return to the ship. At 05:58, Carmichael signaled to Omaha that the ship was indeed a German ship and that the crew had attempted to scuttle her. She was identified as Odenwald, a German blockade runner and that her holds were filled with [...] of rubber, along with 103 B. F.

500|$|A similar {{conclusion}} {{was the result}} of the capture of a steel hull trawler 15 July 1967 after three days of tracking by patrol aircraft and the radar picket, [...] After playing a cat-and-mouse game for three days with TF115 units the trawler headed for the mouth of the Sa Ky River on the Batangan Peninsula late on 14 July. The trawler was directed by Point Orient to <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> but the hail was answered with gunfire. The cutter returned fire along with Wilhoite and gunboat , destroyer , and PCF-79. At 02:00 on 15 July, the trawler was boxed in and ablaze, and ran aground [...] from shore. South Korean marines directed artillery fire from the shore and at 06:00 with the trawler apparently abandoned, a U.S. Navy demolitions expert from Walker boarded the trawler and defused 2,000 pounds of TNT charges that were designed to scuttle the craft. Found on board were several thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition, mortar and rocket rounds, anti-personnel mines, grenades, and several thousand pounds of C-4 plastic explosive and TNT. Weapons found included several hundred machine guns, AK-47 rifles, AK-56 rifles, and B-40 rocket launchers.|$|E
500|$|After two weeks, Worsley {{began to}} worry about the lack of {{sightings}} and advised Shackleton he could not calculate their position to less than [...] accuracy. As a result, Shackleton opted to aim for the western side of South Georgia which meant, given the prevailing winds, that if they missed their target they would be carried onto the east coast of the island. The following day, they began to observe drifting seaweed and seabirds circulating overhead, indicating the presence of land ahead. On 8 May, through mists and squalls, the crew sighted South Georgia's Cape Demidov, precisely in line with the course calculated by Worsley. He saw a [...] "...towering black crag, with a lacework of snow around its flanks. One glimpse, and it was hidden again. We looked at each other with cheerful, foolish grins." [...] Sea and wind conditions were such that they were unable to {{make their way to the}} Norwegian whaling stations, some [...] away, on the east coast; instead they made for King Haakon Bay. Now out of drinking water, they were forced by the high seas to approach the rocky coast with care and <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> for the night. A gale blew strongly the following day and despite their best efforts, they stayed offshore for a further night. Conditions were much better on 10 May and after adverse winds caused failure of his first few attempts, Worsley carefully sailed the James Caird through a rocky reef guarding King Haakon Bay and onto the beach.|$|E

2500|$|By 6 January 1941, Detmers {{was ready}} to {{relocate}} to a point west of the Mediterranean {{because of a lack}} of targets, but that afternoon, Kormoran encountered the 3,729-ton Greek freighter Antonis. The raider ordered the freighter to <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> and not send any wireless transmissions, and sent a boarding party over. Antonis was armed with three British machine guns and loaded with 4,800 tons of Welsh coal. Though Germany was not at war with Greece, the presence of Allied weapons and cargo allowed Detmers to sink her or take her as a prize. As coal was of little use to the Kriegsmarine, the weapons, ammunition, and 29 crew were transferred to Kormoran, and the boarding party scuttled her at [...] British Admiralty notifications for raider activity gave the wrong date and location for the attack, and initially attributed it to the raider Thor. Kormoran then headed southeast, avoiding the convoy routes from the Mediterranean to America or down the African coast, in order to seek vessels sailing alone and without warship escort.|$|E
2500|$|At about 08:45 on 19 February, Alcantara was {{steaming}} north-north-east up its patrol line, lookouts spotted smoke off {{the port}} beam and Wardle manoeuvred closer {{to identify the}} source of the smoke. Unbeknownst to them, the smoke was from SMS Greif. A few minutes later Andes signalled [...] "Enemy in sight north-east 15 knots" [...] Wardle ordered Alcantara to turn north at maximum speed and soon sighted a ship with one funnel, flying Norwegian flags. Another message from Andes described a two-funnelled ship and the identity of the ship in sight remained doubtful. A few minutes later, Andes was seen to starboard seeming to be steaming north-east at speed, as if in pursuit. Before joining the chase, Wardle decided to examine the unknown ship and fired two blanks to force it <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> going to action stations. By 09:20, Wardle was signalled by Andes that it had altered course to the south-east, which only added to the ambiguity, because the ship hove to could not be the one being pursued. The lookouts on the Alcantara could see the Norwegian name Rena on the stern and that the ship looked authentic.|$|E
