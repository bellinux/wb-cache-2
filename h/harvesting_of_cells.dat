Hybridoma cells are cultured in horizontal tissue culture flasks until 90 % confluent, {{and then the}} flasks are filled with culture medium {{and placed in a}} standing position and left in the incubator for 3 – 4 weeks until most of the cells have died. At this time, the culture fluid is harvested for antibodies. With this method, which involves only a single cell plating and one change of medium, the yield of antibodies from one tissue culture flask is 6 - to 9 -fold higher than is obtained by the usual method of sequential replating and <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> and media.

By means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), the water content, mechanical properties, and adhesion forces of the microgel films are studied as a function of temperature.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{chloroplast}} ribosomal RNAs of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii which sediment at 15, 000 g is increased when cells {{are treated with}} chloramphenicol. Preparations of chloroplast membranes from chloramphenicol-treated cells contain more chloroplast ribosomal RNAs than preparations from untreated cells. The membranes from treated cells also contain more ribosome-like particles, some of which appear in polysome-like arrangements. About 50 % of chloroplast ribosomes are released from membranes in vitro as subunits by 1 mM puromycin in 500 mM KC 1. A portion of chloroplast ribosomal subunits is released by 500 mM KCl alone, a portion by 1 mM puromycin alone, and a portion by 1 mM puromycin in 500 mM KCl. Ribosomes are not released from isolated membranes by treatment with ribonuclease. Membranes in chloroplasts of chloramphenicol-treated cells show many ribosomes associated with membranes, {{some of which are}} present in polysome-like arrangements. This type of organization is less frequent in chloroplasts of untreated cells. Streptogramin, an inhibitor of initiation, prevents chloramphenicol from acting to permit isolation of membrane-bound ribosomes. Membrane-bound chloroplast ribosomes are probably a normal component of actively growing cells. The ability to isolate membrane-bound ribosomes from chloramphenicoltreated cells is probably due to chloramphenicol-prevented completion of nascent chains during <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> Since chloroplasts synthesize some of their membrane proteins, and a portion of chloroplast ribosomes is bound to chloroplast membranes through nascent protein chains, it is suggested that the membrane-bound ribosomes are synthesizing membrane protein...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mapping DNaseI hypersensitive {{sites is}} {{commonly}} used to identify regulatory regions in the genome. However, currently available methods are either time consuming and laborious, expensive or require large numbers of cells. We aimed to develop a quick and straightforward method {{for the analysis of}} DNaseI hypersensitive sites that overcomes these problems. Results We have developed a modified Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) approach for the identification and analysis of genomic regulatory regions. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by simultaneously analysing 20 loci from the ENCODE project for DNaseI hypersensitivity in a range of different cell lines. We were able to obtain reproducible results with as little as 5 × 10 4 cells per DNaseI treatment. Our results broadly matched those previously reported by the ENCODE project, and both technical and biological replicates showed high correlations, indicating the sensitivity and reproducibility of this method. Conclusion This new method will considerably facilitate the identification and analysis of DNaseI hypersensitive sites. Due to the multiplexing potential of MLPA (up to 50 loci can be examined) it is possible to analyse dozens of DNaseI hypersensitive sites in a single reaction. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of MLPA means that fewer than 10 5 cells per DNaseI treatment can be used, allowing the discovery and analysis of tissue specific regulatory regions without the need for pooling. This method is quick and easy and results can be obtained within 48 hours after <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> or tissues. As no special equipment is required, this method can be applied by any laboratory interested in the analysis of DNaseI hypersensitive regions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Although {{diffusion}} MRI {{has shown}} promise for {{the characterization of}} breast cancer, it has low specificity to malignant subtypes. Higher specificity might be achieved if the effects of cell morphology and molecular exchange across cell membranes could be disentangled. The quantification of exchange might thus allow the differentiation {{of different types of}} breast cancer cells. Based on differences in diffusion rates between the intra- and extracellular compartments, filter exchange spectroscopy/imaging (FEXSY/FEXI) provides non-invasive quantification of the apparent exchange rate (AXR) of water between the two compartments. To test the feasibility of FEXSY for the differentiation of different breast cancer cells, we performed experiments on several breast epithelial cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, we performed the first in vivo FEXI measurement of water exchange in human breast. In cell suspensions, pulsed gradient spin-echo experiments with large b values and variable pulse duration allow the characterization of the intracellular compartment, whereas FEXSY provides a quantification of AXR. These experiments are very sensitive to the physiological state of cells and can be used to establish reliable protocols for the culture and <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> Our results suggest that different breast cancer subtypes can be distinguished {{on the basis of their}} AXR values in cell suspensions. Time-resolved measurements allow the monitoring of the physiological state of cells in suspensions over the time-scale of hours, and reveal an abrupt disintegration of the intracellular compartment. In vivo, exchange can be detected in a tumor, whereas, in normal tissue, the exchange rate is outside the range experimentally accessible for FEXI. At present, low signal-to-noise ratio and limited scan time allows the quantification of AXR only in a region of interest of relatively large tumors. © 2016 The Authors.

40|$|Detection and {{quantification}} of {{cell viability}} and growth in two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) cell cultures commonly involve <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> and therefore requires a parallel set-up of several replicates for time-lapse or dose–response studies. Thus, developing a non-invasive and touch-free detection of cell growth in longitudinal studies of 3 D tumor spheroid cultures or {{of stem cell}} regeneration remains a major unmet need. Since surface acoustic waves (SAWs) permit mass loading-based biosensing and have been touted due to their many advantages including low cost, small size and ease of assembly, we examined the potential of SAW-biosensing to detect and quantify cell growth. Herein, we demonstrate that a shear horizontal-surface acoustic waves (SH-SAW) device comprising two pairs of resonators consisting of interdigital transducers and reflecting fingers {{can be used to}} quantify mass loading by the cells in suspension as well as within a 3 D cell culture platform. A 3 D COMSOL model was built to simulate the mass loading response of increasing concentrations of cells in suspension in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well in order to predict the characteristics and optimize the design of the SH-SAW biosensor. The simulated relative frequency shift from the two oscillatory circuit systems (one of which functions as control) were found to be concordant to experimental data generated with RAW 264. 7 macrophage and A 549 cancer cells. In addition, results showed that SAW measurements per se did not affect viability of cells. Further, SH-SAW biosensing was applied to A 549 cells cultured on a 3 D electrospun nanofiber scaffold that generate tumor spheroids (tumoroids) and the results showed the device's ability to detect changes in tumor spheroid growth over the course of eight days. Taken together, these results demonstrate the use of SH-SAW device for detection and quantification of cell growth changes over time in 2 D suspension cultures and in 3 D cell culture models, which may have potential applications in both longitudinal 3 D cell cultures in cancer biology and in regenerative medicine...|$|E

The diesel-degrading {{capabilities}} of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus isolates LT 1, LT 1 A and V 2 {{were established in}} previous studies. LT 1 and LT 1 A were isolated from diesel-contaminated soil and V 2 was from soil contaminated with used engine oil. Isolates were grown in Bushnell-Haas medium supplemented with 1 % sterile diesel. Determination of diesel-degradation patterns by gravimetric analysis and <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> for RNA extraction were performed at regular time intervals over a 60 day period. The involvement of genes alkM, alkR, rubA, rubB, estB, lipA, lipB, and xcpR in hydrocarbon degradation {{has been reported in}} previous studies. LT 1, LT 1 A, and V 2 were compared in terms of gene expression levels by real-time quantitative PCR. Expression levels were assessed by relative quantification and normalized against the 16 S rRNA reference gene using the Relative Expression Software Tool - XL (REST-XL). Amplification of all genes, except rubB, was achieved {{with a high degree of}} efficiency. The expression of rubA, alkM, alkR, xcpR, and lipB based on pair-wise randomization, was all down-regulated in LT 1 A in relation to LT 1. Highest expression levels of the aforementioned genes were documented during the initial stages of incubation for LT 1 while LT 1 A showed highest expression levels midway through the study period. LT 1, LT 1 A, and V 2 achieved 58. 6 %, 51. 7 %, and 48. 3 % diesel degradation after 5 days of incubation, respectively. The higher percentage of diesel degradation achieved by LT 1 can be attributed to higher levels of overall gene expression in the initial stages of degradation. Amplification of alkane hydroxylase alkM of V 2 revealed a possible second hydroxylase gene that was expressed after 20 days of incubation. Amplification of alkR and xcpR in V 2 isolates also resulted in multiple product formation. Very low lipB and lipA expression was detected in LT 1 and LT 1 A and the absence of lipA expression in V 2 suggests that lipases were not involved in diesel degradation. In contrast, estB was predominantly expressed in V 2, and suspected to be involved in the release of a bioemulsifier that was only observed in V 2 samples. Although all three isolates were comparably efficient in degrading diesel, the results of this study suggest that different mechanisms may be employed in the degradation process...|$|E

Here, we describe a hydrodynamic system that allows easy <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> at very early biofilm stages. Using the metal ion-reducing gammaproteobacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 as a model organism, we analyzed the transcriptional changes occurring during surface-associated growth between 15 and 60 minutes after attachment. 230 genes were significantly upregulated and 333 were downregulated by a factor of $ 2. Main functional categories of the corresponding gene products comprise metabolism, uptake and transport, regulation, and hypothetical proteins. Among the genes highly upregulated those implicated in iron uptake are highly overrepresented, strongly indicating that S. oneidensis MR- 1 has a high demand for iron during surface attachment and initial biofilm stages. Subsequent microscopic analysis of biofilm formation under hydrodynamic conditions revealed that addition of Fe(II) significantly stimulated biofilm formation of S. oneidensis MR- 1 while planktonic growth was not affected.

Several researchers recently reported co-culturing of filamentous fungi with microalgae so that microalgae cells can be co-pelletized {{in order to}} facilitate the cell harvest. This algae pelletization via the filamentous fungi represents an innovative approach to address both the cost and sustainability issues in algae biofuel production and also has potential with direct commercial applications. This paper reviews the current research status in this area and some possible drawbacks of this method in order to provide some possible directions for the future research...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{oxidation}} of glucose by freshly <b>harvested</b> resting <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> P. pestis strain A- 1122 {{was accelerated}} by 20 to 41 per cent {{in the presence}} of insulin. The stimulatory action was not noted when cell-free enzyme preparations were employed and was less marked after storage <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> for 3 days. Although insulin was not oxidized by the organism, the amount of oxygen consumed during the dissimilation of a unit weight of glucose was increased {{in the presence of}} the hormone...|$|R

The research in his laboratory is directed towards understanding the factors infl uencing the behaviour of human brain stem cells derived from the normal and neurogenetically diseased brain. He is also interested in novel ways of deriving human embryonic stem cells and in deriving brain stem cells from these cells. Dr Schwartz conducts a human embryonic and brain stem-cell culture training course...|$|R
