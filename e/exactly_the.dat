5|$|B.s. 'Coastal Candles', {{propagated}} by Merv Hodge, {{came from}} Philip Vaughan's 'Schnapper Point' plant. Some plants are behaving differently, {{so it may}} be that not all material is <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same clone.|$|E

25|$|A {{directly}} applied index {{means that}} the interest rate changes <b>exactly</b> with <b>the</b> index. In other words, the interest rate on <b>the</b> note <b>exactly</b> equals <b>the</b> index. Of the above indices, only the contract rate index is applied directly.|$|R

5|$|Conversely, every {{directed}} acyclic graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, {{this property}} {{can be used as}} an alternative definition of the {{directed acyclic graph}}s: they are <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> graphs that have topological orderings.|$|E
5|$|The {{clips from}} The Underwater Menace, episode 2 were later found to {{precisely}} match the edits {{to the print}} discovered in late 2011, suggesting that the recovered episode was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same print that had been censored decades before.|$|E
5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests are <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E
25|$|Each such path {{corresponds}} to a unique sequence of votes and will end at (p, q). A sequence is 'good' <b>exactly</b> when <b>the</b> corresponding path never goes above the diagonal line y=x; equivalently, a sequence is 'bad' <b>exactly</b> when <b>the</b> corresponding path touches the line y=x+1.|$|R
50|$|The (light) {{compensation}} {{point is the}} amount of light intensity on the light curve where the rate of photosynthesis <b>exactly</b> matches <b>the</b> rate of respiration. At this point, the uptake of CO2 through photosynthetic pathways is <b>exactly</b> matched to <b>the</b> respiratory release of carbon dioxide, and the uptake of O2 by respiration is <b>exactly</b> matched to <b>the</b> photosynthetic release of oxygen.|$|R

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} started on June1, CSU issued a mid-season {{forecast}} on August4, which predicted 11named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. Six {{days after the}} CSU prediction, NOAA also released a mid-season outlook, forecasting <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same amount of activity, 11named storms, 7hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. With a 75% percent chance of above average activity, there was an elevated risk of landfalling hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances {{in front of the}} multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E

5|$|And, {{at the end}} of the day, that's {{one thing}} we can't get past—serious BlackBerry enthusiasts will tell you that the {{interface}} is doing just fine, and there are plenty of reasons to get hooked on these devices. For us, however, the BlackBerry UI is showing its age, and ultimately, beautiful hardware aside, this device is essentially <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as every other BlackBerry.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same number of calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E
5|$|Because each {{configuration}} {{has only}} a bounded number of predecessors, the evolution of Rule 90 preserves the entropy of any configuration. In particular, if an infinite initial configuration is selected by choosing the state of each cell independently at random, {{with each of the}} two states being equally likely to be selected, then each subsequent configuration can be described by <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same probability distribution.|$|E

5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms is <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same size and shape. A grand {{stairway}} {{is located at the}} end of the mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} {{exception}} to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple in <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E
5|$|Certain foreign {{partnerships}} and same-sex marriages are recognised as civil partnerships since 13 January 2011. While Glenn Cunningham and Adriano Vilar are {{often cited as}} the first same-sex couple to have their civil partnership formally recognised in Ireland, in fact several hundred couples were recognised together at the <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same time. The couple formed a civil partnership at a ceremony in Northern Ireland in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is not <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E
5|$|Embarrassed {{at having}} become <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> {{sort of person}} he used to ridicule, Troilus tries to keep his love secret. However, he pines for Cressida and becomes so {{withdrawn}} that his friend Pandarus asks why he is unhappy and eventually persuades Troilus to reveal his love.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
