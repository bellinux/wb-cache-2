50|$|The current racing version, the BMW M3 DTM, is {{the product}} of the {{intensive}} development work put in by BMW Motorsport, in close cooperation with colleagues at BMW M GmbH and the BMW Production Development department. More than 50 of the 5,000 plus parts that make up the car are standard components, which are used in all DTM cars. One of these is the carbon-fibre monocoque, which sets benchmarks in terms of safety in motorsport. With an <b>integrated</b> <b>tank</b> and steel roll cage, as well as additional crash elements, it provides the drivers with effective protection should he be involved in a crash. Components like the gearbox, clutch, suspension and rear wing are all identical in all DTM cars. This regulation was implemented in order to keep a lid on development costs. Despite this, the BMW Motorsport engineers were still able to incorporate the BMW Group’s immense technical resources as they applied all their powers of innovation. The goal was to establish a performance advantage over the opposition, whilst complying with the strict regulations. BMW Motorsport began developing the DTM version of the latest BMW M3 back in autumn 2010, when the board of BMW AG confirmed the company’s decision to return to the DTM.|$|E

40|$|ATK Space Systems – Commerce (ATK Commerce), {{formerly}} known as Pressure Systems, Inc. (PSI), has been supplying pressure vessels to the aerospace industry for over 45 years. Its first 3 decades of existence can be characterized by the maturing of its tank technologies and the securing of its market niche. The primary focus at {{that period of time}} was on maintaining its foothold in the aerospace industry, and less emphasis was given to developing breakthrough technologies. However, beginning in the early 1990 ’s and under new leadership, ATK Commerce has introduced a string of new technologies in the design and fabrication of its pressure vessels. Many innovations were industry firsts. They demonstrated dynamic use of materials to achieve the various design goals of low mass, low cost, excellent packaging efficiency, and exceptional performance.

40|$|Tanks are {{important}} means to conserve water resources in semi-arid areas. Tank irrigation in general, and in Tamil Nadu in particular, {{has a long}} history, {{and it can be}} traced to prehistoric times. Poor management of the <b>integrated</b> <b>tank</b> system including its structures and distribution system {{is one of the major}} reasons for decline of tank irrigated area. Rehabilitating tanks enhanced groundwater recharge leads to increased water table in the wells located in the command area. Hence well owning farmers can able to cultivate three times paddy crop in a year with the available ground water. Also they can provide water for adjacent non-well owning farmers for their second crop (during maturity stage) and third crop (whole season) cultivation by charging either cash or kind. This local ground water market helps villagers to cultivate more area and season, leads to efficient water use and increased income generation for the villagers. To prove the above statement a study was carried out in rural village of South India with an interview schedule and the data were analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science). The result shows that the tank rehabilitation is highly correlated with local ground water market in post rehabilitation period...|$|E
40|$|The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Liquid Low-Level Waste (LLLW) System {{collects}} aqueous {{radioactive waste}} solutions in large underground storage tanks from various programmatic sources for on-site neutralization, concentration, and storage. Due {{to the nature}} of the concentrated, highly alkaline LLLW, remote-handled transuranic (RH-TRU) sludge accumulated in the system as precipitants settled out of the LLLW. To support treatment of the RH-TRU sludge by the Foster Wheele r Environmental Corporation (Foster Wheeler), the U. S. Department of Energy privatization subcontractor, all ORNL RH-TRU sludge is being transferred into the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs) as part of an <b>integrated</b> <b>tank</b> waste consolidation plan. The MVSTs are eight large 189 m 3 (50, 000 -gallon) capacity tanks that provide the majority of storage for ORNL’s untreated RH-TRU sludge. Operation of the MVSTs will be turned over to Foster Wheeler during fiscal year (FY) 2001 in preparation of RH-TRU sludge and associated LLLW retrieval and treatment operations that will be conducted at the planned ORNL TRU Waste Treatment Facility. Several high profile tank waste removal projects have been successfully completed at ORNL as part of the sludge consolidation activities. Over 466 m 3 (123, 000 gallons) of RH-TRU sludge have been transferred to the MVSTs from various inactive and active LLLW storage tanks since the sludge consolidation activities began of in FY 1997. Approximately 840 m 3 (222, 000 gallons) of RH-TRU sludge will be transferred to the MVSTs upon the completion of the sludge consolidation activities at the end of FY 2001.

40|$|A {{full-scale}} modular solid/liquid separation (SLS) {{system was}} designed, fabricated, installed, and successfully deployed {{for treatment of}} liquid low-level waste from the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The SLS module, utilizing cross-flow filtration, was operated {{as part of an}} <b>integrated</b> <b>tank</b> waste pretreatment system (otherwise known as the Wastewater Triad) to remove suspended solids and prevent fouling of ion-exchange materials and heat exchange surfaces. The information gained from this testing was used to complete design specifications for the full-scale modular SLS system in May 1997. The contract for detailed design and fabrication of the system was awarded to NUMET in July 1997, and the design was completed in January 1998. Fabrication began in March 1998, and the completed system was delivered to ORNL on December 29, 1998. Installation of the system at the MVST facility was completed in May 1999. After completing an operational readiness assessment, approval was given to commence hot operations on June 7, 1999. Operations involving two of the eight MVSTs were performed safely and with very little unscheduled downtime. Filtration of supernatant from tank W- 31 was completed on June 24, 1999 and W- 26 processing was completed on August 20, 1999. The total volume processed during these two campaigns was about 45, 000 gal. The suspended solids content of the liquid processed from tank W- 31 was lower than expected, resulting in higher-than-expected filtrate production for nearly the entire operation. The liquid processed from tank W- 26 was higher in suspended solids content, and filtrate production was lower, but comparable to the rates expected {{based on the results of}} previous pilot-scale, single-element filtration tests. The quality of the filtrate consistently met the requirements for feed to the downstream ion-exchange and evaporation processes. From an equipment and controls standpoint, the modular system (pumps, valves, sensors, monitors, controls, shielding, and containment) functioned very well during each campaign. Evaluation of the Endress+Hauser Promass 63 F Mass Flowmeter (a secondary objective of the project) indicated reasonably accurate and reliable performance. This instrument was installed on the feed pipeline for the SLS system, and it provided very accurate mass flow and density data, and reasonably accurate solids content data. Near the end of tank W- 31 processing, the solids content of the feed to the SLS system increased to a very high concentration. This behavior was caused by the increased mixing of liquid and sludge phases within MVST Tank 31 as the level of liquid being decanted from the tank approached the level of the settled sludge. The physical properties of the heavy sludge caused some difficulties in draining and flushing of the system. Other minor equipment problems were encountered, but none resulted in significant downtime or safety issues. Operational data collected during the campaign were useful in evaluating the performance of the system. The 50 -ft{sup 2 } cross-flow filter was designed to provide filtrate at the rate of 1 to 5 gal/min (flux range of 0. 02 to 0. 1 gal min{sup - 1 } ft{sup - 2 }) of filtrate, and actual production was between 0. 6 and 8. 0 gal/min (flux range of 0. 012 to 0. 16 gal min{sup - 1 } ft{sup - 2 }). Additional operating data will be needed, however, to assess the long-term performance of the system with wider variations in the composition of the tank waste feed. The SLS will be employed in further processing campaigns during FY 2000, and more performance data will be collected...|$|E
