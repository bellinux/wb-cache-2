5|$|Six {{million people}} were {{unemployed}} when the Nazis took power in 1933 and by 1937 there were fewer than a million. This was {{in part due to}} the removal of women from the workforce. Real wages dropped by 25 percent between 1933 and 1938. Trade unions were abolished in May 1933 with the seizure of the funds and arrest of the leadership of the Social Democratic trade unions. A new organisation, the German Labour Front, was created and placed under NSDAP functionary Robert Ley. The average German worked 43 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in 1933 and by 1939 this increased to 47 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E

He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> to turn out more films.

5|$|Under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), {{students}} and their educational employers are exempted from paying Social Security taxes. The Treasury Department issued a regulation in 2004, declaring those who worked more than 40 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> were ineligible for such an exemption. The Mayo Foundation filed suit to challenge the regulation and for a refund of the taxes it had paid on its medical residents—recently graduated physicians who work more than full-time providing patient care, but who are still considered trainees by the medical profession. The District Court ruled for the Mayo Foundation and struck the regulation, but was reversed by the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was to {{find that}} heading a leading music college was {{incompatible}} with {{a career as a}} composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, Disraeli, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, {{with the support of the}} faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010.

These will {{take the form of a}} £400 payment following the agreement of union members and a further £1,000 to be paid once the planned changes have been implemented. In addition the Royal Mail agreed to keep 75% of the workforce as full-time, rather than part-time staff, and to reduce working hours from 40 to 39 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> In exchange, the CWU agreed to Royal Mail's modernisation strategy which include plans to introduce the automated walk sequencing machinery.|$|E

5|$|In August 1934, Hitler {{appointed}} Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in {{the following}} year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war. Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews. Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936. Hitler oversaw {{one of the largest}} infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 percent. The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E

Lincoln spent many <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.|$|E
5|$|With 16,000 employees, the Glasgow factory {{was one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} operations in Scotland.

In total 23,675 engines were produced. Worker absenteeism became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of air-raid shelters.
