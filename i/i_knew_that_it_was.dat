500|$|Pyramid Head {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in the 2006 film adaptation of Silent Hill as [...] "Red Pyramid", and is portrayed by Roberto Campanella. In the film, the psyches of the female characters shaped the character's physical appearance. Gans claimed that replicating the character's head exactly and having the actor move while wearing {{it proved to be}} impractical; he noted that, despite the name, Pyramid Head actually wore [...] "a basin" [...] instead of a triangle-shaped head. Red Pyramid's sword and head were constructed out of lightweight material painted to appear heavy. For the role, Campanella wore a [...] "five-part prosthetic"; it took two-and-a-half to three hours to get him into costume and make-up. His boots had a hidden [...] sole which made him just under [...] tall. Patrick Tatopoulos, who worked on the make-up effects and monsters, enjoyed the project of designing the character. According to him, Red Pyramid serves {{as a symbol of the}} town's darkness and harbinger of its changed character. Gans considered the monsters of the film [...] "a mockery of human beings", and commented: [...] "The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I think that may have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E
2500|$|Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, {{a recent}} recruit of the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action now being called Lebanon's Cedar Revolution, alleged {{in the wake}} of the {{assassination}} that on 26 August 2004 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad threatened Hariri, saying [...] " [...] Lahoud is me. ... If you and Chirac want me out of Lebanon, I will break Lebanon." [...] He was quoted as saying [...] "When I heard him telling us those words, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his condemnation of death." [...] This meeting between Hariri and Assad, which had been on 26 August 2004, lasted for just fifteen minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Ryan, one of {{the last}} actors to be cast, was invited because Iñárritu had seen her in the play Detroit. Lindsay Duncan had vast {{experience}} in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because {{of the quality of the}} script. [...] "It's delicious because of the writing." [...] But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said [...] "I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him". Iñárritu described Laura as [...] "a very wacky, quirky role", but said [...] "when [...] did it <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging".|$|E
2500|$|Gans {{described}} {{the concept of}} the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: [...] "It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded." [...] He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is [...] "in [...] head". [...] "It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person." [...] In speaking about the creatures in Silent Hill, Gans said that [...] "these monsters are , with the poetic direction of the term: they are a little like the Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [...]" [...] "The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in the year, in November, {{she played}} the role of the Mona Lisa in the two-part episode [...] "Mona Lisa's Revenge" [...] in The Sarah Jane Adventures. In December, Jones starred in the Manchester Royal Exchange's {{production}} of Blithe Spirit, by Noël Coward, which ran until late January 2010. Jones was nominated for the Times Breakthrough Award at the 2010 South Bank Show Awards, the last ever ceremony, but lost to David Blandy. When discussing her nomination she said, [...] "You do question 'What am I breaking through?' Am I breaking through the perception of people who just thought I was a screaming banshee in Coronation Street? Is it that I've worked hard and I've got better? Is it that now it's alright to say that I'm alright? I don't know what I was breaking through, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nice to feel included and patted on the back for a lot of hard work". Jones was described by Andrew Billen of The Times as being in a category of [...] "those brave, talented few who earn their wings on a soap and then fly gloriously beyond it". In March 2010 Jones starred in Five Days, a non-connected sequel to the 2007 series of the same name, as the female lead DC Laurie Franklin. Later in the year, she starred as Sarah in Single Father on BBC1, a character who {{falls in love with a}} widower, Dave (David Tennant), who was married to her best friend before her death.|$|E

2500|$|Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, {{a recent}} {{adherent}} to the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action, alleged {{in the wake of}} the assassination that in August 2004 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad threatened Hariri, saying [...] " [...] Lahoud is me. ... If you and Chirac want me out of Lebanon, I will break Lebanon." [...] He was quoted as saying [...] "When I heard him telling us those words, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his condemnation of death." [...] The United States, the EU and the UN have stopped short of any accusations, choosing instead to demand a Syrian pullout from Lebanon and an open and international investigation of the Assassination. Jumblatt's comments are not without controversy; the BBC describes him as [...] "being seen by many as the country's political weathervane" [...] - consistently changing allegiances to emerge on the winning side of the issues de jour through the turmoil of the 1975-90 civil war and its troubled aftermath. He was a supporter of Syria after the war but switched sides after the death of former Syrian president Hafez al-Assad in 2000. His account is quoted, but not confirmed, in the UN's FitzGerald Report. The report stops short of directly accusing Damascus or any other party, saying that only a further thorough international inquest can identify the culprit. The Lebanese government has agreed to this inquiry, though calling for the full participation, not supremacy, of its own agencies and the respect of Lebanese sovereignty. (See international reaction below.) ...|$|E
