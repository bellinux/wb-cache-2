50|$|In {{all of the}} {{algorithms}} {{the messages}} emanating from check nodes are the same; however, since the verification rules are different for different algorithms the messages produced by variable nodes will be different in each algorithm. The algorithm given above works {{for all of the}} VB-MPA's, and different algorithms use different rules in <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and 2. For instance, Genie algorithm uses D1CN rule in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1, and in fact the <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 2 which uses ZCN rule is useless in Genie algorithm. LM algorithm uses D1CN in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and XH algorithm uses ECN rule in this stage instead of D1CN. SBB algorithm also uses both D1CN and ECN rule in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1. All of these rules can be efficiently implemented in update_rule function in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1.|$|R

50|$|Due to The J. Peterman Company's {{acquisition}} {{of this particular}} necklace through the sale of props from the film, this design {{is often referred to}} as the J. Peterman design, though officially the necklace does not hold this designation. This particular design is another blue cubic zirconia; however, it is cut into the shape of a heart rather than a trillion cut. The main stone is surrounded by <b>round</b> <b>cut</b> cubic zirconias and features a white <b>round</b> <b>cut</b> stone at the top where it attaches to the chain. The chain is composed of white <b>round</b> <b>cut</b> cubic zirconias, with a larger inverted pear cut cubic zirconia as the bail. This particular design is featured in the film for a brief moment when Caledon retrieves the necklace from his safe during the sinking, this is the only time the necklace is seen on screen. This particular necklace is believed to still be in the possession of the J. Peterman Company.|$|R
