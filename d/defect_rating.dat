The presented topic is quite actual these days, {{because the number of}} bedridden patients is constantly increasing, in which the potential risk of the formation of pressure ulcers arise. "Decubitus ulcer is a bedsore, which arises as a consequence of pathological pressure on the predilection place. " (Pejznochová, 2010, p. 23). Mostly immobile patients suffer from this disease. Pressure ulcers can be prevented by regular adjust or with anti-decubitus aids. The treating of already existing pressure ulcer today is preferably with the use of modern therapy, the so-called "wet treatment". This dissertation is divided into a theoretical and an empirical part. The theoretical part outlines the formation issue and the assessment of pressure ulcers, the most common place of origin, the <b>defect</b> <b>rating</b> scale, the importance of prevention and subsequent treatment of pressure ulcers. And finally, it describes how the treatment of pressure ulcers is done in hospitals and home care agencies. Two goals were set for the practical part, to describe new methods in the treatment of pressure ulcers and to compare options in the treatment of pressure ulcers in hospitals and home care agencies. To achieve the set goals, a qualitative research was used, which was performed through interviews with nurses from inpatient ward of the hospital of Czech Budejovice, {{as well as with the}} nurses from the City Charity in Czech Budejovice and nurses of nursing home care and nursing services ALICE in Czech Budejovice. When interviews were making, two sets of questions were prepared. The research group was consisted of 11 respondents. The respondents came from the dermal ward, ward of internal medicine and aftercare ward. These respondents were identified as respondents under No. 1 to 4. The nurses of home nursing care agencies were signified as respondents from No. 5 to 11. This selection of respondents enables to compare the specific patient care on the wards and in home care agencies. The data were collected from February to March 2013. At the beginning of the research project, five research questions related to the. The first question was concerned of new ways in the treatment of pressure ulcers. The second focused on the nursing care of a patient with pressure ulcers in hospitals. The third question examined the area of nursing care for patients with pressure ulcers in home care agencies. The last two questions were focused on the use of surgical dressings for the treatment of pressure ulcers in hospitals and home care agencies. Based on the survey, it was found that in both institutions proper prevention is ensured, which means the client positioning, nutrition, hygiene and the use of anti-decubitus aids. The research showed the original relieving aids were often replaced by blankets and pillows, as these tools are the more available and fulfil its purpose. The use of surgical dressings on patient units and home care agencies, there is a predominant use of moist therapy and appropriate therapy materials for this purpose. In therapy, this method is considered to be better, because it accelerates the healing of the defect, less surgical dressings are needed and they are less painful for the client. The evaluation of nurses showed that the majority of nurses in home care agencies believe that the agencies are providing better care than in hospital. Certainly nurses from inpatient department think the opposite. Except one respondent, all of the others regularly attend professional seminars, where, within these seminars, new materials and methods of treatment are presented to them. The work will be used for improvements in nursing care of patients with pressure ulcers and will serve as a study material for students in medical fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} CMOS technology {{has increased the}} density and allowed the integration of multiple processors into a single chip. Although solutions based on MPSoC architectures can increase application's speed through TLP exploitation, this speedup is still limited {{to the amount of}} parallelism available in the application, as demonstrated by Amdahl's Law. Moreover, with the continuous shrinking of device features, very aggressive <b>defect</b> <b>rates</b> are expected for new technologies. Under high <b>defect</b> <b>rates</b> a large amount of processors of the MPSoC will be susceptible to defects and consequently will fail, not only reducing yield but also severely affecting the expected performance. This paper presents a run-time adaptive architecture that allows software execution even under aggressive <b>defect</b> <b>rates.</b> The proposed architecture can accelerate not only highly parallel applications but also sequential ones, and it is a heterogeneous solution to overcome the performance penalty that is imposed to homogeneous MPSoCs under massive <b>defect</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

30|$|Table  2 {{shows that}} as <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the mean SSAR {{difference}} between two models increases. The reason {{can be explained}} as follows: when <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> increases, new position assignment of vehicles would be limited {{and would not be}} flexible as lower <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> case so the mean SSAR of both models get closer. Numerical study in Table  2 also shows that enlargement of the buffer capacity increases the mean SSAR difference between two models. Smaller size buffers restrict the position change of vehicles therefore the difference between optimal and rule-based heuristic resequencing model decreases or even same results are obtained from both models. However, larger size buffers allow to change many of the vehicles` positions, so optimal resequencing model outperforms.|$|R

40|$|As we {{move towards}} the end of the {{technology}} roadmap, and potentially to newer technology flavors besides conventional CMOS, transistor <b>defect</b> <b>rates</b> are expected to increase significantly. Till recently, industry has dealt with defects (including both manufacturing defects and defects at run-time) using conservative approaches- discarding non-functioning chips at test time and extensive guardbanding. With increasing <b>defect</b> <b>rates,</b> however, these conservative approaches will become untenable, resulting in prohibitive yield and performance loss. This is the challenge that Instruction Subset Architectures (ISA) try to address — how do we design and architect processors, either single- or multi-core, that degrade gracefully with increasing <b>defect</b> <b>rates.</b> More specifically, how do we guarantee functional correctness, possibly at the expense of a performance penalty, in a system where each core has one or mor...|$|R
30|$|According to Table 11, the {{accuracy}} rate of all algorithms is decreased except for Immunos 1 and Immunos 99. Therefore, {{it means that}} the findings could be a challenging fact because it shows that the performance of each classifier could tightly related to <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> in the datasets. So previously suggested classifiers {{may not be the best}} choices anymore to build a prediction model when the <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> is changed. Accuracy in almost all the algorithms is fallen down, but if we consider AUC for evaluation, we see that this value grows in two other algorithms that are basically from one category, GLONALG and CSCA [30]. It could be concluded that by increasing the <b>defect</b> <b>rate,</b> the artificial immune classifiers perform better and gives a finest prediction model compared to others.|$|R

Product reliability is identified with <b>defect</b> <b>rates.</b> Producers first choose reliability levels and then compete in prices. For given <b>defect</b> <b>rates,</b> allowing returns makes products closer substitutes, enhancing competition and reducing prices. Being closer substitutes makes higher reliability less worthwhile, which reduces reliability. While the decrease in reliability reduces consumer welfare, the decrease in prices raises it. The latter dominates, so that aggregate consumer welfare increases with return policy. ...|$|R

Then, we perform a numerical study to compare the performance of rule-based model with optimal resequencing model. According to numerical study, (i) as the coordination between paint and FA increases to determine scheduled sequence, i.e., high PER, rule-based model performs as good as optimal resequencing model. (ii) rule-based model is {{more sensitive to the}} PER rather than <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> and buffer capacity, at low PER optimal resequencing outperforms even <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> or buffer capacity increases. (iii) as <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> increases, the mean SSAR difference between two models increase, (iv) the increase on buffer capacity increases the mean SSAR difference between two models. (v) rule-based model holds larger inventory and, however, responses quickly, so a trade-off between holding large inventory and ceasing the production to decide optimal FA entrance should be made.|$|R

30|$|In Table  2 at low PER levels, since {{rule-based}} model rebuilds the FA entrance sequence {{according to}} the defined rules rather than optimization, mean SSAR difference is high relative to high PER levels. As PER level raises, i.e., the number of vehicles which is correctly ordered {{with respect to the}} scheduled sequence increases, there will be less change in the positions of vehicles; so the mean difference between optimal resequencing and rule-based model decreases. Generally, after 50 % PER levels, there is no difference between rule-based model and optimal resequencing model. Therefore, if a certain level of similarity between scheduled sequence and paint entrance sequence is achieved, i.e., above 50 % PER, rule-based heuristic model can be used instead of optimal resequencing model. As a second insight, the difference between optimal and heuristic solution is very sensitive to the PER rather than <b>defect</b> <b>rate</b> and buffer capacity. At 30 % PER in all <b>defect</b> <b>rates</b> and buffer capacities optimal resequencing model outperforms. However in other PER levels, it is possible to achieve same SSAR levels with optimal resequencing model by increasing the buffer capacity or decreasing the <b>defect</b> <b>rate.</b> This insight leads manufacturers that if the coordination between paint and FA is poor, rule-based heuristic model will not be effective as optimal resequencing model.|$|R
