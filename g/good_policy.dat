40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the hypothesis that aid effectiveness {{can be linked to}} 'good policies' and thus that aid, if it is to have maximum impact, should be directed at countries following <b>good</b> <b>policies.</b> This is an idea which we have considerable sympathy with in principle and have built upon in the past. Indeed at one level it is almost a truism and yet in practice we find little empirical evidence in support of it when we restrict <b>good</b> <b>policies</b> to mean free market policies. 'Good policies' appear to matter in stimulating growth, but they do not appear to impact on aid effectiveness. Unlike much of other recent work the analysis is of a simultaneous system of equations of which growth is just one. The results suggest a complex interaction between macroeconomic variables and <b>good</b> <b>policies,</b> but it also suggests the need to widen our definition of <b>good</b> <b>policies</b> to increase both the theoretical and empirical relevance of the hypothesis.

40|$|In {{a context}} where 46 {{countries}} now consider their fertility rate {{to be too}} low, attention is turning {{to the need for}} policy actions to increase fertility rates. This article discusses the reasons why action is required and why countries have been slow to take policy action. It then considers a wide range of possible policies and assesses them against a set of eleven social policy principles. The policies examined include tax-transfer policies, subsidised services, childcare and early childhood education, parent leave and working hours policies, employment policies for young people, public education campaigns and broader social arrangements. The conclusion drawn is that the focus of policy should not be pronatalism as such but support for families with children. Support for families with children means <b>good</b> family <b>policy,</b> <b>good</b> gender <b>policy,</b> <b>good</b> employment/human capital <b>policy,</b> <b>good</b> child development <b>policy</b> and, if {{there is a need to}} increase or sustain birth rates, it will also mean <b>good</b> birth <b>policy.</b> ...|$|R

2500|$|Churchill offered Auchinleck {{command of}} the newly created Persia and Iraq Command (this having been {{separated}} from Alexander's command), but Auchinleck declined this post, as he believed that separating the area from the Middle East Command was not <b>good</b> <b>policy</b> and the new arrangements would not be workable.

However, the appointment of the new command's Supreme Commander, Admiral Louis Mountbatten, was not announced until August 1943 and until Mountbatten could set up his headquarters and assume control (in November) Auchinleck retained responsibility for operations in India and Burma while conducting a review and revision of Allied plans based on the decisions taken by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff at the Quadrant Conference which ended in August.|$|E

Second, we show that the econometric results in Burnside and Dollar emphasising the crucial role of interaction between aid and <b>good</b> <b>policies</b> in the growth process are fragile, as they are extremely data dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that the Burnside and Dollar data lend support to the idea that the association between aid and growth can be approximated by decreasing returns to aid.
