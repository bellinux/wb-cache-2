As the pump spectrum broadens inside the silicon waveguide, the effective Raman gain is reduced considerably. We obtain an analytical form of the nonlinear phase accumulated during propagation inside a silicon waveguide and use it to calculate the total spectral broadening experienced by a pump pulse.

The filter doesn’t introduce any relevant impairment in the downstream signal, as the optical power reaching the ONU, at the resonant wavelength, is generally so small that nonlinear effects can be generally neglected.

The need for establishing the feasibility of employing lasers of subpicosecond pulse width in Laser Induced Stress Waves Thermometry (LISWT) for single crystalline silicon processing motivated the work. The model formulation developed is of a hyperbolic type capable of characterizing non-thermal melting and thermo-elastoviscoplastic deformation as functions of laser input parameters and ambient temperature. A plastic constitutive law is followed to describe the complex elasto-viscoplastic responses in silicon undergoing Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) annealing at elevated temperatures. A system of nine first-order hyperbolic equations applicable to describing 3 -D elasto-viscoplastic wave motions in silicon is developed. The group velocities of certain selected frequency components are shown to be viable thermal indicators, thus establishing the feasibility of exploiting nanosecond laser induced propagating stress waves for the high-resolution thermal profiling of silicon wafers. Femtosecond laser induced transport dynamics in silicon is formulated based on the relaxation-time approximation of the Boltzmann equation. Temperature-dependent multi-phonons, <b>free-carrier</b> <b>absorptions,</b> and the recombination and impact ionization processes governing the laser model and carrier numbers are considered using a set of balance equations. The balance equation of lattice energy and equations of motion of both parabolic and hyperbolic types are derived to describe the complex thermo-elastoplastodynamic behaviors of the material in response to ultrafast laser pulsing. The solution strategy implemented includes a multi-time scale axisymmetric model of finite geometry and a staggered-grid finite difference scheme that allows both velocity and stress be simultaneously determined without having to solve for displacements.

Due to quantum confinement effect in the nanowire array structure, the surface plasmon and surface plasmon polariton modes induced by inter- and intraband transitions can have different features. For bulk metals, the interband SPR induced mainly by electronic transition from higher-energy sp-band to lower-energy d-band determines {{the color of the}} metal. At the same time, the intraband SPR within the sp- and d-bands gives <b>free-carrier</b> optic <b>absorption</b> which leads mainly to a lower-frequency background optic reflection. Because Cu is a better conductor than Ni, Ni normally reflects more strongly the visible light radiation than Cu does. However, for nanowire arrays, the electronic states in different bands are quantized. The intraband electronic transition accompanied by the absorption of photons can be achieved via inter-subband transition events which can result in resonant optical absorption when photon energy approaches the energy spacing between two subbands. Thus, intraband optical absorption can be enhanced in nanowire arrays. The results shown in Figure 3 b indicate that the enhancement of intraband optical absorption in Ni nanowire arrays is stronger than that in Cu nanowire arrays. As a result, Cu nanowire arrays reflect more strongly the infrared radiation than Ni arrays do. Because the quantum confinement effect affects mainly the electronic states in different bands in the array structure, the main features of OR due to interband electronic transition does not change very significantly. This is why Ni nanowire arrays can reflect more strongly the visible radiation than Cu arrays can, as shown in Figure 3 a and similar to the case for bulk materials.|$|R

Realizing these resonator structures in high-index contrast silicon enables dense and large scale integration of large arrays of functionalized resonators in a CMOS-compatible technology platform. Based on these motivations, {{the main focus of}} this Ph. D. research has been on the device physics, modeling, implementations, and applications of planar ultra-high Q silicon traveling-wave microresonators in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Microdisk, microring, and racetrack resonators are the three general traveling-wave resonator architectures of interests that I have investigated in this thesis, with greater emphasis on microdisks. I have developed efficient tools for the accurate modeling of these resonators. The coupling to these resonators has been through a nano-waveguide side coupled to them. For this purpose, I have developed a systematic method for engineering a waveguide-resonator structure for optimum coupling. I have addressed the development of nanofabrication techniques for these resonators with efficient interaction with a nano-waveguide and fully compatible with active electronic integration. The outcome of the theoretical design, fabrication, and characterization of these resonators is a world-record ultra-high Q (3 × 10 [superscript 6]) with optimum waveguide-resonator interaction. I have investigated the scaling of these resonators toward the ultimate miniaturization and its impact on different physical properties of the resonators. As a result of these investigations, I have demonstrated miniaturized Si microdisk resonators with radii of ~ 1. 5 micron and Q > 10 ⁵ with single-mode operation over the entire large free-spectral range. This is the highest Q (~ one order more than that in previously reported data) that has been obtained for a Si microdisk resonator with this size on a SiO₂ substrate. I have employed these resonators for more advanced functionalities such as large-scale integration of resonators for spectroscopic and filtering applications, as well as the design of flat-band coupled-resonator filter structures. By proposing a systematic method of design, I have shown ultra-compact coupled-resonator filters with bandwidths ranging from 0. 4 to 1 nm. I have theoretically and experimentally investigated the performance of ultra-high Q resonators at high powers and in the presence of nonlinearities. At high powers, the presence of two-photon <b>absorption,</b> <b>free-carrier</b> generation, and thermo-optic properties of silicon results in a rich dynamic in the response of the resonator. In both theory and experiment, I have predicted and demonstrated self-sustained GHz oscillation on the amplitude of an ultra-high Q resonator pumped with a continuous-wave laser. Ph. D.
