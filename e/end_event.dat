It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around a supernatural being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic <b>end</b> <b>event.</b> The record is a social critique which utilizes this premise {{as a metaphor for the}} fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman has said that the underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to disaggregate water flow data {{collected}} from high resolution smart water meters into different water end use categories. The data was obtained from a sample of 252 residential dwellings located within South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. An integrated approach was used, combining high resolution water meters, remote data transfer loggers, household water appliance audits and a selfreported household water use diary. Disaggregating water flow traces into a registry of <b>end</b> use <b>events</b> (e. g. shower, clothes washer, etc.) is predominately a complex pattern matching problem, which requires a comparison between presented patterns and those contained with a large registry of categorised <b>end</b> use <b>events.</b> Water flow data collected directly from water meters includes both single (e. g. shower event occurring alone) and combined events (i. e. an event which comprises of several overlapped single events). To identify these former mentioned single events, a hybrid combination of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) provided the most feasible and accurate approach available. Additional <b>end</b> use <b>event</b> physical context algorithms have been developed to aid accurate <b>end</b> use <b>event</b> categorisation. This paper firstly presents a thorough discussion on the single water <b>end</b> use <b>event</b> analysis process developed and its internal validation with a testing set. This is followed by the application of the developed approach on three independent households to examine its degree of accuracy in disaggregating two weeks of residential flow data into a repository of residential water <b>end</b> use <b>events.</b> Future stages of algorithm development and testing is discussed in the final section.
