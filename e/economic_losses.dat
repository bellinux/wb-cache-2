40|$|This study emphasises the {{divergence}} between the legal approach to pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> and the <b>economic</b> one, {{and focuses on}} the latter. Traditional economic theory is grounded on the divide between social and private loss and is employed in formulating policy recommendations for an efficient outcome. However, it fails to explain why pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> cases are treated differently in different legal systems. This study suggests that pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> {{should be regarded as}} the internalisation of positive externalities through a mechanism (tort law) primarily designed for negative externalities. The pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> problem is a problem of choosing between secondbest solutions, because tort law generally fails to provide first-best internalisation of both types of externalities. Within this framework, some new hypotheses on the comparative law and economics of pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> will be discussed. <b>economic</b> <b>loss,</b> financial loss, tort, damage, compensation,...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule {{states that}} a {{plaintiff}} cannot recover damages for a pure financial loss. The {{comparative study of}} the pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule reveals that in different jurisdictions, the legal definitions of the rule frequently lump together diverse situations. The actual significance {{of the notion of}} “economic loss ” varies considerably across Western legal systems. Legal doctrines provide little insight as to why liability should, or should not, be denied. On the other hand, economic models of liability provide some valuable guidance for classifying different categories of <b>economic</b> <b>loss,</b> and identifying cases in which denial of recovery for <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> would lead to inefficient outcomes. A law and economics analysis shows that a key factor in determining the optimal scope of the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule is in the relationship between pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> and social <b>loss.</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>loss</b> should be compensable in torts {{only to the extent that}} it corresponds to socially relevant loss. After identifying several factual categories, this paper characterizes the optimal level of liability with reference to the relevant <b>economic</b> and social <b>loss</b> components and the resulting optimal incentives to reduce risk. In a few situations, the application of the optimal liability rule finds obstacles in entrenched principles of civil liability. Generally, however, the legal applications of the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule are consistent with the ideal liability rule identified by the economic model. As generally understood in the law and economics literature, the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule states that a plaintiff cannot recover damages for a pure financial loss. The comparative study of the pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> rule reveals that the recognition and significance attributed to such rule and to the notion...|$|R

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} <b>economic</b> <b>losses,</b> so may {{be treated}} as an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

As a result, the price of produce across the nation jumped substantially. In Yesan alone, a town where more than 1,500 families relies on their apple orchards for a living, losses to the orchards reached ₩300billion (US$265.4million). The prices of spinach, cabbage, and lettuce rose by 124%, 72%, and 26% respectively in just one day. Total losses throughout the country were estimated at ₩420billion (US$374.3million).

5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing <b>economic</b> <b>losses,</b> the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E

5000|$|Negligence {{which causes}} no {{physical}} or psychiatric harm, but causes <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> {{to an individual}} or organisation, is termed pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss.</b> The idea that a duty of care may be owed {{to protect against the}} <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> of others has been seen as problematic, as the bounds of such liability are potentially unforeseeable, and difficult to establish. Thus, there are several limits in place on the recovery of pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss,</b> with some categories of <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> being totally unrecoverable altogether. Those affected by damage caused to the property of another company or individual, or who suffer loss due to the purchase of a defective product, for example, cannot ordinarily recover any losses incurred as a result.
