5|$|Hurley {{confesses to}} Libby {{that he has}} an eating disorder, and shows her a stash of Dharma food. Hurley expresses {{interest}} in getting rid of it, and she encourages him to do so. Just after Hurley destroys his supplies, other survivors go into the jungle. Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky. After Hurley panics {{at the suggestion of}} again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jungle.|$|E
25|$|A ruling Igumen (so {{long as he}} {{is inside}} his own monastery) and a bishop may carry his paterissa (crozier) when he is in church. However, the paterissa is never to be carried inside the sanctuary; instead, when <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> altar, the paterissa is either handed to an altar server or left leaning against the iconostasis outside the Holy Doors.|$|E
25|$|Dasein is {{therefore}} enabled to participate authentically in co-creating meaningful truth {{for his life}} as he engages in healthy, meaningful relationshipsâ€”including in therapy. Where other mainstream approaches discourage dialogue about subjective meaning and truth {{in an effort to}} maintain therapist objectivity and value-neutrality, ontological hermeneutics encourages authentic dialogue between therapist and client that co-creates meaningful, subjective truth to enrich the life of the client. This process not only provides new perspective for the client via the fusing of horizons, but it also serves {{as a model for the}} client to follow when <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world and seeks authentic relationships vital to psychological well-being.|$|E

2500|$|A zvonar is a bell ringer. In the Orthodox church, {{this is a}} tonsured (clerical) position, {{and there}} is a {{distinct}} service of the [...] "Setting Apart of a Bell Ringer". The use of electric bells is forbidden in the Orthodox Church, because it is a sacred function, and may only be performed {{by a member of the}} church. Before <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> belltower, the zvonar will go to the priest (or the igumen if it is a monastery) for a blessing to ring the bells.|$|E
2500|$|George's {{occasional}} impulsiveness {{often gets}} him into trouble, {{like when he}} flees a burning kitchen, knocking over several children and an old woman in the process, so he could escape first during his girlfriend's son's birthday party in [...] "The Fire". However, there are moments where George exhibits remarkable courage, but usually accidentally and often in support of inane lies he'd rather not confess to. For instance, in [...] "The Marine Biologist", <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea alone to save a beached whale because his date, a woman on whom he had a crush in college, thinks he's a marine biologist and even tells her the truth about his occupation after he saves the day. However, this causes her to reject him immediately, and he's forced to take the bus home.|$|E

2500|$|The work {{of record}} {{producer}} Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as [...] "the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio." [...] Brian later reflected: [...] "I {{was unable to}} really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." [...] He explains: [...] "Before Spector, people recorded all the instruments separately. They got great piano, great guitar, and great bass. But {{he thought of the}} song as one giant instrument. It was huge. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard." [...] In 1999, when asked if he was a religious man, Wilson responded: [...] "I believe in Phil Spector." ...|$|E

Critic Michael Hann cites an [...] "extraordinary rush of avant-pop creativity between 1965 and 1967". In the belief of writer Richard Goldstein: [...] " [...] never realized his full potential as a composer. In the light of electronica and minimalism, {{you can see how}} advanced his ideas were, but they remain bursts of inspiration from a mind that couldn't mobilize itself into a whole. This was the major tragedy of rock in the sixties." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Legacy {{relates the}} tale of Palin Majere, the son of Caramon and the nephew of Raistlin Majere, as he takes his Test of Magic. [...] In the Tower of High Sorcery, the mages tell Caramon that they believe Raistlin intends to steal Palin's body {{to return to the}} world. [...] Caramon and Palin go with Dalamar to the Tower of High Sorcery at Palanthas, where they go to {{laboratory}} where Raistlin had worked his magic. [...] The door will not open for Dalamar, but Palin can go in. [...] His Test begins. [...] He believes <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Abyss and rescues Raistlin, and then back in the world Raistlin tries to allow Takhisis into the world. [...] Palin tries to close the Portal and Raistlin attacks him, though he in fact survives as it was all part of the Test. [...] Having passed, Palin is allowed out. [...] Raistlin stays in the room and, in a monologue, reveals that when Dalamar tried to summon his illusion Raistlin actually appeared, though not by Dalamar's power but by his own choice. [...] Raistlin says he has paid his final debt and gives the Staff of Magius to Palin, then goes back to his sleep. [...] Palin is made a true mage, and leaves for home.|$|E
