50|$|Insert jacks {{themselves}} {{can be the}} source of intermittent signal problems. <b>Internal</b> <b>jack</b> contacts may get too loose over time and they may oxidize, impeding electrical conduction. Regular use of the jack helps keep oxidization down. The manufacturer using high quality jacks and good assembly practices helps reduce failures over time.|$|E
50|$|A {{location}} {{chosen for}} emplacement of the D-30 {{should be as}} level as reasonably possible. Firstly, the carriage is raised via an <b>internal</b> hydraulic <b>jack</b> located under the cradle of the gun. Once the gun is at the required height, the wheels are raised via the wheel lifting lever; this allows the two split stabilizer legs {{to be separated from}} the mono stabiliser leg and brought rearward into firing configuration.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Sony {{released}} 2 camcorders with {{a built-in}} projector. HDR-PJ200 lacks <b>internal</b> memory, microphone <b>jack</b> and surround sound recording. The Sony HDR-PJ260 offers improved features such as an 8.9 megapixel still camera but includes 16GB internal memory. More expensive models include the HDR-PJ580, HDR-PJ600 and HDR-PJ760.|$|R
50|$|So for {{the example}} given above of Jack (taller than) Joan, Bertrand Russell {{claims that the}} {{ordering}} of the relation is not <b>internal</b> to <b>Jack</b> and Joan taken together. The order is something external imposed on the couple Jack and Joan. This however leaves {{the question as to}} the status of the ordering, since it cannot be non-existent. A further step in the process is needed to get beyond Russell's objection and this is to include the person doing the ordering in the example, so we have Jack is taller than Joan, according to Tom, or in symbolic form (Jack(R)Joan)(R2)Tom. However, here again we have another kind of ordering which is not included in the grouping.|$|R
40|$|The Lisp {{interface}} to Jack {{will allow}} general programming of <b>Jack</b> <b>internals</b> and should simplify {{all forms of}} Jack development. It will be distributed with Jack- 5. 7 and will allow users without source code to extend or modify Jack, and users with source code to have a high-level, object-oriented, interactive prototyping environment. After prototyping in lisp, developers can rewrite their code in C++ if speed is crucial, otherwise, code can be left in lisp to simplify maintenance and to insure upward compatibility with future Jack versions...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{relations}} are clearly internal {{in the sense}} that, for example, four would not be four unless it were related to two {{in the way it}} is. Some {{relations are}} internal to their bearers under one description but not under another, for example, a wife would not be a wife unless suitably related to a husband, but Mary would still be Mary had she not married. Or take the <b>internal</b> relation where <b>Jack</b> is taller than his wife, Joan. Here the relation is internal to both of them together, in symbolic form it can be given as: Jack(R)Joan, where R is the ordered relation of [...] "Taller than".|$|R
25|$|Several more {{disputes}} arose {{between the}} parties in the early 1990s, revolving around Burger King's desire to enter the Australian market directly. In 1992 Burger King considered buying out Hungry Jack's and its stores, either itself, through a third party or through a joint venture, but Hungry Jack's rejected these proposals. In 1993 Burger King commenced negotiations with Shell to open Burger King outlets in some of Shell's service stations — initially including but later excluding Hungry Jack's from the discussions — which culminated in the opening of seven outlets from 1995. During this time a senior Hungry Jack's executive was leaking secret information to Burger King about Hungry <b>Jack's</b> <b>internal</b> operations, and advising Burger King of methods it might employ to force Hungry Jack's to sell out its business to Burger King.|$|R

Caption: "This was the crash scene minutes after the tragedy, as survivors struggle out of the ill-fated bus which plunged 23 feet {{over the side of}} a narrow bridge near Hydro early Thursday. Six persons were killed in the state`s worst highway accident since 1949. A greyhound bus and an automobile, their bumpers locked together, plunged into a creek bed near Hydro on U. S. 66 Thursday killing six people and injuring 35 in what was described as the state`s worst highway accident since 1949. Thursday`s tragic accident put August in line for the dubious honor of being the bloodiest month on state highways so far this year, with 16 fatalities in only six days. If that rate continues, 75 persons will die in highway accidents before the month is over. one highway patrol spokesman said. The highway patrol termed Thursday`s crash the worst in the state since February 2, 1949 when seven persons were killed in Tulsa in an automobile-train collision. Dead in the accident near Hydro are: Mrs. W. F. Brady, 75, Little Rock, Ark., killed instantly. Mrs. P. A. Ferguson, 48, Compton, Calif., killed instantly. Mrs. Susie Webster, 65, Joplin, Mo., who died shortly after noon in the Oklahoma General hospital at Clinton of <b>internal</b> injuries. <b>Jack</b> Paris, 70, McAlester, killed instantly. His wife was injured. Mrs. Jean Louis Wilkey, 20, Springfield, Ill., wife of the driver of the car. She was killed instantly. Jerry Ruth Wilkey, 2, daughter of Mrs. Wilkey. Officers said Mrs. Brady was Mrs. Ferguson`s mother. They were traveling together and both formerly lived in El Reno. Mrs. Webster died five hours after the crash. Critically injured were Mrs. Vivian Cornman, 19, Riverside, Calif., and Mrs. Margaret Thompson, 55, Clovis, N. M. ...|$|R
5000|$|According to 1961 <b>internal</b> memo by <b>Jack</b> Lydman, Indonesia {{was seen}} as making strong {{economic}} progress. Lydman noted that the Indonesian economy was the strongest {{that it had been}} in the past three years. He also noted that the Indonesians were economically well-off, and resistant to foreign incursions due to their self-sufficiency. The Indonesians needed to rely on the Soviet and American superpowers very little aside from modern arms. Therefore, Sukarnos continued positive relationship with the Soviet Union caused the CIA to fear the continued delivery of Soviet weapons to the Indonesian government. Despite this, the CIA was happy that Djuanda had gained power of Indonesias economic situation as the United States felt that he [...] "was the best man we could have in that position." [...] Nevertheless, despite Indonesias positive economic situation, CIA intelligence did not believe that this would appease Indonesians that were politically unsatisfied. The CIA believed that, as opposed to other countries throughout the world, Indonesians relatively consistent economic security meant that their political beliefs were less influenced by their economic conditions. That being said, the CIA was fearful of the PKIs ability to recruit followers in the rural areas of Indonesia.|$|R
40|$|Samuel Richardson's second novel, Clarissa: or, The History of a Young Lady, one of {{the longest}} novels in English, has {{appeared}} in dozens of significantly different editions, many of them abridgments. This study examines the means by which Richardson and later editors altered the text of Clarissa, primarily by working with three variables: its epistolary format, its length, and its explicit moral lessons. The first half of the study reviews relevant scholarly research and traces Richardson's uses of internal editors in his four editions of the novel. Richardson's omniscient editor, the most visible and conventional of the internal editors of ClarissR, operates {{both inside and outside the}} epistolary framework of the novel. Inside, the editorial voice adds identifying tags to letters and summarizes missing letters. Outside, the editor emphasizes moral elements of the novel by means of a preface and postscript, numerous footnotes, a list of principal characters, and a judgmental table of contents. Richardson expanded the role of this editor in each of his successive editions. Richardson's mastery of the epistolary format further appears in his use of all the major correspondents as <b>internal</b> editors. <b>Jack</b> Belford operates most visibly, assembling correspondence to and from Clarissa and Lovelace to vindicate Clarissa's memory and instruct possible readers. Belford's Conclusion serves a similar function to the nameless editor's preface and postscript. Richardson also gave Clarissa, Anna Howe, and Lovelace editorial tasks, including introducing and summarizing letters, footnoting, and altering letters before showing them to someone other than the intended recipient. Each major correspondent also has a unique individual editorial function. The study's second half analyzes and compares seven abridgments of Clarissa published between 1868 and 1971, concluding that all seven drastically change the novel (yet in differing fashions) despite their retention of its plot and epistolary format. All seven external editors alter Richardson's stated intentions. Four variables shape the comparison: stated editorial intent, omissions, alterations, and additions. An appendix lists the contents of all seven abridgments by individual letter. Department of EnglishThesis (Ph. D. ...|$|R
