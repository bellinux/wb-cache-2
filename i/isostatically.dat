2500|$|The Baltic Sea, {{with its}} unique {{brackish}} water, {{is a result}} of meltwater from the Weichsel glaciation combining with saltwater from the North Sea when the straits between Sweden and Denmark opened. Initially, when the ice began melting about 10,300 BP, seawater filled the <b>isostatically</b> depressed area, a temporary marine incursion that geologists dub the Yoldia Sea. Then, as post-glacial isostatic rebound lifted the region about 9500 BP, the deepest basin of the Baltic became a freshwater lake, in palaeological contexts referred to as Ancylus Lake, which is identifiable in the freshwater fauna found in sediment cores. The lake was filled by glacial runoff, but as worldwide sea level continued rising, saltwater again breached the sill about 8000 BP, forming a marine Littorina Sea which was followed by another freshwater phase before the present brackish marine system was established. [...] "At its present state of development, the marine life of the Baltic Sea is less than about 4000 years old", Drs. Thulin and Andrushaitis remarked when reviewing these sequences in 2003.|$|E

50|$|The {{removal of}} mass from a region will be <b>isostatically</b> {{compensated}} by crustal rebound. If we {{take into consideration}} typical crustal and mantle densities, erosion of an average 100 meters of rock across a broad, uniform surface will cause the crust to <b>isostatically</b> rebound about 85 meters and will cause only a 15-meter loss of mean surface elevation. An example of isostatic uplift would be post-glacial rebound following the melting of continental glaciers and ice sheets. The Hudson Bay region of Canada, the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States, and Fennoscandia are currently undergoing gradual rebound {{as a result of}} the melting of ice sheets 10,000 years ago.|$|E

50|$|About 360 km across, it is {{situated}} in the south western part of Galileo Regio, a huge almost circular dark region on Ganymede's north eastern flank. Although almost level today, it is a relic of a massive impact and once was a deep impact crater whose walls have slumped and its floor has risen <b>isostatically,</b> smoothing out the remaining topography with slush.|$|E
50|$|The high {{elevations}} of the Axial Zone (generally above 3000 m) are compensated <b>isostatically</b> by {{an increased}} {{thickness of the}} continental crust. For instance below the Maladeta massif, a root zone formed so that the Mohorovicic discontinuity is encountered there {{at a depth of}} 50 km. Likewise over most peaks of the Axial Zone, a negative gravity anomaly can be detected which slowly disappears to the east.|$|E
50|$|Vespel can be {{processed}} by direct forming (DF) and isostatic molding (basic shapes - plates, rods and tubes). For prototype quantities, basic shapes are typically used for cost efficiency since tooling is quite expensive for DF parts.

50|$|The {{dynamics}} of mountain ranges {{are governed by}} differences in the gravitational potential energy of entire columns of lithosphere (see isostasy). If a change in surface height represents an <b>isostatically</b> compensated change in crustal thickness, {{the rate of change}} of potential energy per unit surface area is proportional to the rate of increase of average surface height. The highest rates of working against gravity are required when the thickness of the crust (not the lithosphere) changes.|$|E

5000|$|Sintering and hot {{isostatic}} pressing are processing techniques used to densify materials from a loosely packed [...] "green body" [...] into a solid object with physically merged grains. Sintering occurs below the melting point, and causes adjacent particles to merge at their boundaries, leading to a strong bond between them. In hot {{isostatic pressing}}, a sintered material is placed in a pressure vessel and compressed from all directions (<b>isostatically)</b> in an inert atmosphere to affect densification.|$|E
50|$|Parts {{processed}} in an autoclave are often vacuum bagged {{to enable the}} pressure to operate <b>isostatically</b> on the workpieces. In simplest form, the workload is fully contained inside a loosely fitting bag made of resilient plastic capable of withstanding the temperatures involved. When vacuum is drawn, the bag is compressed by atmospheric pressure and compacts the components inside. Between the parts and the bag, an absorbent material provides a channel for the evacuation {{of the air and}} wicks up the excess resin squeezed out during curing.|$|E
50|$|The early Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky Mountains of Colorado {{provides}} an example. As the uplift was occurring some 10000 ft of mostly Mesozoic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion over {{the core of}} the mountain range and spread as sand and clays across the Great Plains to the east. This mass of rock was removed as the range was actively undergoing uplift. The removal of such a mass from {{the core of the}} range most likely caused further uplift as the region adjusted <b>isostatically</b> in response to the removed weight.|$|E

Minute amounts of stishovite have been found within diamonds, and post-stishovite phases were identified within ultra-high-pressure mantle rocks. Stishovite may also be synthesized by duplicating these conditions in the laboratory, either <b>isostatically</b> or through shock (see shocked quartz).At 4.287 g/cm3 it is second densest polymorph of silica, after seifertite.

50|$|Zinc sulfide is {{also used}} as an {{infrared}} optical material, transmitting from visible wavelengths to just over 12 micrometers. It can be used planar as an optical window or shaped into a lens. It is made as microcrystalline sheets by the synthesis from hydrogen sulfide gas and zinc vapour, and this is sold as FLIR-grade (Forward Looking IR), where the zinc sulfide is in a milky-yellow, opaque form. This material when hot <b>isostatically</b> pressed (HIPed) {{can be converted to}} a water-clear form known as Cleartran (trademark).

5000|$|Roughly 8,000 years BP, the Laurentide Ice Sheet thinned {{and split}} into two lobes, one centred over Quebec-Labrador, the other over Keewatin. This drained Glacial Lake Ojibway, a massive proglacial lake south of the ice sheet, leading to the {{formation}} of the early Tyrrell Sea. [...] The weight of the ice had <b>isostatically</b> depressed the surface as much as 270-280 m below its current level, making the Tyrrell Sea much larger than modern Hudson Bay. [...] Indeed, in some places the shoreline was 100 to 250 km farther inland than at present. [...] It was at its largest at roughly 7,000 years BP.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} wind and water were able to {{chemically}} and mechanically erode and destroy the Hercynic mountain ranges. In the Permian, the main deposits in Europe were sandstone and conglomerate, products of erosion in the Hercynic mountain range. At the same time, crustal extension took place because the mountain range was <b>isostatically</b> unstable (this is called orogenic collapse). Due to extension, basins formed along the axis of the mountain range and felsic volcanism occurred. This was {{the first phase of}} rifting between Europe and Africa. Due to the rising sealevel in the Triassic period, the eastern margin of Pangaea was flooded. Shallow shelf seas and epicontinental seas existed in which evaporites and limestones were deposited.|$|E
5000|$|DÃ©collements {{can form}} from high angle normal faults. Uplift {{in a second}} stage of {{extension}} allows the exhumation of a metamorphic core complex (see Fig. 2). A half graben forms, but stress orientation is not perturbed due to high fault friction. Next, elevated pore pressure (Pp) leads to low effective friction that forces Ï1 to be parallel to the fault in the footwall. A low-angle fault forms and is ready to act as dÃ©collement. Then, the upper crust is thinned above the dÃ©collement by normal faulting. New high-angle faults control the propagation of the dÃ©collement and help crustal exhumation. Finally, major and rapid horizontal extension lifts the terrain <b>isostatically</b> and isothermally. A dÃ©collement develops as an antiform that migrates toward shallower depths.|$|E
5000|$|Ceramic tiles have a [...] "multiple hit capability" [...] {{problem in}} that they cannot sustain {{successive}} impacts without quickly losing much of their protective value. To minimise {{the effects of this}} the tiles are made as small as possible, but the matrix elements have a minimal practical thickness of about one inch (25 mm), and the ratio of coverage provided by tiles would become unfavourable, placing a practical limit at a diameter of about four inches (ten centimetres). The small hexagonal or square ceramic tiles are encased within the matrix either by <b>isostatically</b> pressing them into the heated matrix, or by gluing them with an epoxy resin. Since the early nineties it has been known that holding the tiles under constant compression by their matrix greatly improves their resistance to kinetic penetrators, which is difficult to achieve when using glues.|$|E
5000|$|During MIS 5e, {{the mean}} annual {{temperature}} was 3Â°C higher than today. At its end, during the cooler prelude of MIS 5d, c, b and a, the region {{continued to rise}} <b>isostatically.</b> Some water was recaptured in ice. Levels in the Eemian Sea dropped, and the opening to the White Sea was blocked. The post-Eemian brackish lake {{did not last long}} geologically speaking, but was covered totally with ice. The Weichselian glaciation starting fully in MIS 4, with an interstadial in 3 and a greatest extent in 2, produced, at its maximum in 20,000-18,000 BP, an ice sheet more than 3 km high. As the lake bed was only a few hundred metres deep, no lake could have existed. The ice extended southward into northern Europe as far as France and eastward as far as Poland. At its recession, the Baltic Ice Lake appeared.|$|E
50|$|The Cascade Seamount is an undersea {{mountain}} {{which has}} a height from its base higher than those on Tasmania. The peak of Cascade Seamount is currently 598 m deep. The top of the seamount is fairly flat and domed, but once down to 900 m deep the sides slope off very steeply. The Cascade Seamount is a volcano formed during the Late Eocene period {{as a result of}} the Balleny mantle plume. This volcano has produced volcanic breccia, hyaloclastite and alkali olivine basalt. The extra weight of the seamount <b>isostatically</b> depressed the adjacent plateau to form a basin. The basin filled with up to 1000 m of sediment during Late Eocene, and early Oligocene, and another 500 m of calcareous ooze and chalk during late Oligocene. Originally the volcano was more than 400 m above sea level. The age is confirmed by foraminifera microfossils Chiloguembelina cubensis, Globigerapsis index, Globigerapsis rubriformis, Subbotina angiporoides and Subbotina linaperta found in the sediment on the volcano. This sediment settled in shallow water.|$|E
50|$|The Andes of Bolivia {{began to}} rise about 200 million years ago (mya) during the Jurassic. The western margin {{of what is now}} South America had been the place of several other orogenies before the Andes rose. It has been {{hypothesized}} that the central Andes gained its great height 26 to 14 mya as result of a compressive failure of the lithosphere beneath Bolivia and neighboring areas. The great heights of the Altiplano, Codillera Occidental and Cordillera Oriental are <b>isostatically</b> compensated by an up to 70 km deep crust. Climate has responded to the formation of this important topographic barrier. It is not clear, however, if the rise of the Andes simply caused the extreme aridity of Atacama Desert and adjacent parts of Bolivia or if a preexisting desert climate and associated low erosion rates allowed the mountains to build up to their current heights. A hypothesis holds that scarce sediment supply to the Atacama Trench caused by arid climate induced high shear stresses in the subduction process that enhanced the Andean mountain building.|$|E

50|$|Hamiltonâs 2015 paper {{summarized}} data {{indicating that}} Venus and Mars, like Earth, had fractionated crusts, mantles, and cores very early, but, unlike Earth, both preserve on their surfaces an ancient bolide-bombardment history {{like that of}} the Moon. Almost all observers of Mars recognize this. So did early observers of radar imagery from Venus, but nearly all subsequent interpreters of that planet, unlike Hamilton, have instead attributed most of the thousands of large rimmed circular basins and craters to young mantle plumes. Hamilton emphasized that the direct correlation of gravity fields with topography require most Martian and Venusian topography to be supported by cold, strong upper mantles, and is incompatible with the popularly assumed hot, active mantles. (The very different correlation on Earth shows that topography of similar dimensions here floats <b>isostatically</b> on truly hot, weak mantle.) Purported Venusian and Martian volcanoes, including Olympus Mons, do not resemble Earthâs endogenic volcanoes, and instead are roughly circular, and commonly gentle-sided, products of vast masses of spreading melts from single events. They appear to be impact-melt constructs, mostly older than 3.9 b.y. by lunar analogy. Earth records a similar history of impact melting in its zircons from the Hadean eon, 4.5-4.0 b.y. ago.|$|E

30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that the structural deformation of basin marginal zones is related to boundary fault throw in rift basins (Wang et al. 2011). In a regional sense, structural deformations are defined as a coordinated system preserving regional extension or extensional strain. Normally, the hanging wall uplifts and the footwall <b>isostatically</b> sinks where the fault throw is smaller than it is at either side, whereas the hanging wall sinks and the footwall <b>isostatically</b> uplifts where the fault throw is greater than it is at either side (Jiang et al. 2010).
