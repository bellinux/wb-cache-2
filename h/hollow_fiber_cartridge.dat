50|$|One type of BAL {{is similar}} to kidney {{dialysis}} systems that employ a <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Hepatocytes are suspended in a gel solution, such as collagen, which is injected {{into a series of}} hollow fibers. In the case of collagen, the suspension is then gelled within the fibers, usually by a temperature change. The hepatocytes then contract the gel by their attachment to the collagen matrix, reducing the volume of the suspension and creating a flow space within the fibers. Nutrient media is circulated through the fibers to sustain the cells. During use, plasma is removed from the patients blood. The patient's plasma is fed into the space surrounding the fibers. The fibers, which are composed of a semi-permeable membrane, facilitate transfer of toxins, nutrients and other chemicals between the blood and the suspended cells. The membrane also keeps immune bodies, such as immunoglobulins, from passing to the cells to prevent an immune system rejection.|$|E

30|$|Extracorporeal function-assisted devices, such as {{artificial}} liver and pancreas, are large medical systems that provide short-term assistance in function compensation {{of a particular}} organ. They facilitate regular exchange and supplement of bioactive factors for cell functional maintenance. The extracorporeal devices are usually connected to recipients’ circulation system, which transmit functional factors into the host blood stream without direct interaction. There {{are two types of}} extracorporeal devices for temporary support: artificial and bioartificial support devices. Artificial support systems essentially use non-living components to remove the toxins accumulated in blood stream. Bioartificial support devices incorporate biologically living components (e.g. hepatocytes or islets) to provide biotransformative or synthetic functions. For example, {{artificial liver}} devices essentially use non-living components to remove the toxins accumulated due to liver failure, and several systems have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are Council of Europe (CE) labeled (e.g. conforms with health and safety standards of the European Union). Meanwhile, bio-artificial liver devices contain a cell-housing bioreactor, whose role is to replace the primary liver functions (i.e. oxidative detoxification, biotransformation, excretion, and synthesis) (Carpentier et al., 2009). Four types of bioartificial liver devices are currently under investigation, which are either based on <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cartridges</b> or chambers (i.e. ELAD, HepatAssist, MELS), monolayer cultures, or perfused matrices (i.e. BLSS, AMC-BAL) (David et al., 2004; Khalil et al., 2001) (Fig.  3 D–F).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Interventions {{to improve}} water quality, {{particularly}} when deployed at the household level, are {{an effective means}} of preventing endemic diarrheal disease, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developing world. We assessed the microbiologic performance of a novel water treatment device designed for household use in low-income settings. The device employs a backwashable <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> ultrafiltration <b>cartridge</b> and is designed to mechanically remove enteric pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoan cysts from drinking water without water pressure or electric power. In laboratory testing through 20, 000 L (~ 110 % of design life) at moderate turbidity (15 nephelometric turbidity unit [NTU]), the device achieved log 10 reduction values of 6. 9 for Escherichia coli, 4. 7 for MS 2 coliphage (proxy for enteric pathogenic viruses), and 3. 6 for Cryptosporidium oocysts, thus exceeding levels established for microbiological water purifiers. With periodic cleaning and backwashing, the device produced treated water at an average rate of 143 mL/min (8. 6 L/hour) (range 293 to 80 mL/min) {{over the course of the}} evaluation. If these results are validated in field trials, the deployment of the unit on a wide scale among vulnerable populations may make an important contribution to public health efforts to control intractable waterborne diseases...|$|R

The model parameters {{were taken from the}} HepatAssist 2000 device, a plasma perfused <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cartridge</b> with primary hepatocytes seeded in the extracapillary space. Cellular oxygen uptake was based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Oxygen transport due to the convective flow of plasma into the extracapillary space was considered. The effect of modulating several important parameters was investigated, namely, the Michaelis-Menten constant Vm (the maximum oxygen consumption per unit volume of the cell mass), the oxygen partial pressure, the flow rate of the plasma at device inlet, and the permeability of the cell mass contained in the extracapillary space. A computer implementation of the model was used to assess whether a given number of cells could be maintained within such a device. The results suggest that a substantial proportion of the hepatocytes are exposed to hypoxic conditions under which metabolism may be impaired...|$|E
40|$|An {{artificial}} kidney process based on ultrafiltration (called hemodiafiltration) more effectively removes blood toxins, {{particularly those of}} higher molecular weight, than conventional dialysis. In hemodiafiltration, replacement liquid must be added directly to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s blood to replace liquid filtered out of the blood in the ultrafiltration cartridge. This replacement liquid {{is made up of}} 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 water for injection 2 ̆ 2 (WFI) and other components such as salts and glucose. WFI is produced either by distillation or reverse osmosis and has a cost of 1. 00 per liter. A patient with kidney problems would require three hemodiafiltration treatments per week, each requiring 70 - 80 liters of WFI. Since the target cost of a treatment is less than 100, the cost of WFI alone, 70 - 80, makes the process not economically feasible. In order for the hemodiafiltration process to be widely used and to be affordable in third world countries, a system that produces WFI at a low cost is needed. A process to replace distillation or reverse osmosis must be capable of removing pyrogens. Some information is available in the literature indicating that ultrafiltration membranes can remove endotoxins, the main constituent of pyrogens; however, no studies have been done to establish the type of ultrafiltration membrane that gives optimal removal of endotoxins. Ultrafiltration is known to be a much less expensive process than distillation or reverse osmosis. It is thoroughly estimated that WFI produced by Ultrafiltration System would cost only 25 cents per liter. The purpose of this experimental work is to determine the type of ultrafiltration membrane that effectively removes endotoxins with an efficient flow rate. Regenerated cellulose and polyethersulfone membranes with various molecular-weight-cut-offs were evaluated to determine the endotoxin rejection and flux rates of the membranes. A stirred cell experiment was performed as a short-term test, using disc membranes with a diameter of 76 mm and three types of feed solutions. The Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Gel Clot test was performed to measure the concentration of pyrogen in the filtrates. The best candidate from the stirred cell experiment was tested in a <b>Hollow</b> <b>Fiber</b> <b>Cartridge</b> Ultrafiltration System over a longer time period. The results showed that a polyethersulfone membrane with a molecular-weight-cut-off (MWCO) of 10, 000 rejected endotoxin to below the US Pharmacopeia (USP) limit of endotoxin content, 0. 25 EU/ml, with the best flux rate. Since polyethersulfone membranes were not available in a cartridge form, the membrane with the closest molecular structure, a polysulfone membrane, was tested in a <b>Hollow</b> <b>Fiber</b> <b>Cartridge</b> Ultrafiltration System. The results showed that the polysulfone membrane cartridge rejected endotoxin content from 625 EU/ml to less than 0. 25 EU/ml consistently over a week-long test period. In addition, the flux rate remained constant at 129 L/m 2 /hr. Thus, the polysulfone membrane of 10, 000 MWCO can be used in an ultrafiltration system to produce Water for Injection (WFI) ...|$|E

We have developed a dynamic in vitro blood-brain barrier model designed to allow for extensive toxicological, pharmacological and physiological testing. Induction of blood-brain barrier properties in a tri-dimensional hollow fiber culturing apparatus was investigated by co-culturing a bovine aortic endothelial cell line (or rat brain endothelial cells) with rat brain astrocytes (or C 6 rat glioma cells) under pulsatile flow conditions to mimic intraluminal blood flow. Cell growth was monitored over time by measuring glucose consumption and lactate production: these experiments confirmed that the hollow fiber cell culturing systems can maintain viable cells in culture for extended (> 1 month) periods of time. Cells were visually inspected after culturing and dissociation from the <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cartridge</b> and identified as endothelial (by fluorescent Dil-Ac-LDL uptake) or glial (by GFAP immunoreactivity). Blood-brain barrier properties were tested by intraluminal injection of horse-radish peroxidase (HRP, mol. weight 44, 000), glucose (m. w. 180) or potassium. Either procedure demonstrated that aortic cells co-cultured with astrocytes (or C 6 cells) developed a selective barrier with an estimated electrical resistance of 2, 900 omega/cm 2. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of BAEC were also affected by the co-culturing process, suggesting that astrocytes induced CNS properties in these cells.

To optimise the volumetric productivity, we performed different fed-batch studies in a 5 -L bioreactor. We demonstrated that hIFNα 2 b was highly sensitive to proteases activity during high cell density culture. The target protein was totally degraded 20 h after the start of methanol feeding. Replacement of culture medium with fresh medium after glycerol fed-batch culture mode as well as medium enrichment with casamino acids at 0. 1 % and EDTA at 10 mM, had significantly improved hIFNα 2 b expression and prevented its proteolysis. Moreover, to further improve hIFNα 2 b production, three different methanol fed-batch strategies had been assayed in high cell density culture.

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel method to {{evaluate}} the partial pore wetting of gas absorption membranes is proposed. The method consists of two approaches, one by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), and the other by calculating the mass transfer resistances from the gas and liquid phase in the pore, using the parameter obtained by He gas permeation experiments. For this purpose, <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> were spun from polyetherimide (PEI) and polyethersulfone (PES). As well, the lumen of a PEI <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> was coated with silicone rubber. The <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> were then characterized by He gas permeation experiments, critical entry pressure of water (CEPw), contact angle, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and EDX. The <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> were then subjected to CO 2 gas absorption using aqueous NaCl solution as absorbent. After drying the <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> was subjected to the EDX analysis. The cross-sectional profile of Na and Cl content in the <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> revealed that the pores of the PES <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> were partially wetted, particularly at the pore inlet.

At 900 °C and 100 mL min– 1 helium gas sweep rate, the oxygen fluxes for disk, conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber,</b> modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber,</b> Ag-deposited modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber,</b> and Pt-deposited modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> membranes are 0. 10, 0. 33, 0. 84, 1. 42, and 2. 62 mL min– 1 cm– 2, respectively, denoting enhanced performance in this sequential order. More than 300 % enhancement of fluxes is evidenced by modifying the geometry from disk to conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber.</b> This is attributed to the thickness reduction from 1 mm to 0. 3 mm, thus implying bulk-diffusion and surface reaction as the jointly limiting transport step for this disk membrane. In contrast to a conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> that has a sandwich cross-sectional structure (e. g. dense center layer sandwiched by two finger-like layers) as well as dense outer and inner circumference surfaces, the modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> has only one dense layer in its outer circumference surface with finger-like porous layer extending {{all the way from}} outer cross-sectional part to the inner cross-sectional part.

To enhance the performance even further, catalyst (e. g., Ag or Pt) deposition on the outer circumference surface of modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> can be utilized to reduce its dominating surface reaction resistance.

40|$|The Hollow Fiber Diffusion (HFD) {{system is}} a novel {{approach}} for the in situ study of the survival of bacteria and viruses in the aquatic environment. The HFD system employs a tangential flow, <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>cartridge</b> with a large area (7 × 103 cm 2) of exchange surfaces for diffusion. When compared with diffusion chambers, the HFD system responded significantly faster and more accurately to changes in pH, Eh, nutrient concentrations and {{to the presence of}} disinfectants in the external aqueous environment. The T&#x 90; diffusion of low molecular weight substrates was 0. 6 h for the HFD system but was 4. 2 h for the diffusion chamber. The rate of diffusion or equilibration could be further improved by increasing the flow rate through the HFD system or reducing the volume of the sample reservoir. The HFD system was compatible with all test bacteria and viruses {{with the possible exception of}} tailed coliphages. The inactivation of tailed phages by the HFD system can be reduced or eliminated using a slower flow rate or larger diameter hollow fibers. Tailed coliphage inactivation in the HFD system was not apparent in natural waters. Neither adsorption of microorganisms to the hollow fiber membrane surfaces nor colonization of those surfaces was found to be a significant problem during its use in natural waters. A protocol for the decontamination and reuse of the hollow fiber cartridges using hydrogen peroxide was developed and applied successfully. The results of trials of the HFD system at five field sites suggests that the HFD system permits "real-time" accommodation to changes in the physicochemical parameters of the external aqueous environment which can influence the survival of microorganisms. Differences in the survival of microorganisms in the HFD system and in batch samples were shown. The HFD system demonstrated regrowth of Escherichia coli in the Rideau River which is an eutrophic, temperate river. It also demonstrated a diurnal inactivation pattern for Enterococcus durans with the slower decay of E. durans numbers in the hours of darkness. For the other water sources tested (the Ottawa River, the Kennedy Burnett Stormwater Ponds, the Gombak River and the Kroh River), the general order of survival of test microorganisms was MS- 2 coliphage > poliovirus > phage B > E. coli and E. durans. In the Rideau River, the order of survival was E. coli > poliovirus > MS- 2 coliphage > E. durans. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the survival of microorganisms in the two equatorial rivers compared with the survival of the organisms in the oligotrophic, temperate Ottawa River. The HFD system will be very useful in studying the survival and natural ecology of microorganisms in the aquatic environment. It can be applied to model the behavior of water quality indicators, pathogenic organisms and genetically engineered microorganisms.

The polypropylene <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> was coated with polydimethylsiloxane–divinylbenzene using sol–gel method and characterized. The developed method was compared with uncoated <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> LPME method for the extraction of simazine, atrazine, and propazine prior to gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis. Optimized conditions for both coated and uncoated <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> LPME methods were toluene as an acceptor phase, length of <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> (1. 5 cm), volume of acceptor phase (3. 0 µL), stirring rate (1200 rpm), and no addition of salt (sodium chloride).

50|$|Because {{thousands}} of <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> may be packed {{into a single}} <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> bioreactor, they increase the surface area of the cartridge considerably. As a result, cells can fill up the EC space to densities >108 cells/ml. However, the cartridge itself takes up a very small volume (oftentimes the volume of a 12-oz soda can). The fact that <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> bioreactors are very small and yet enable incredibly high cell densities has led to their development for both research and commercial applications, including monoclonal antibody and influenza vaccine production. Likewise, because <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> bioreactors use up significantly less medium and growth factors than traditional cell culture methods such as stirred-tank bioreactors, they offer a significant cost savings. Finally, <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> bioreactors are sold as single-use disposables, resulting in significant time savings for laboratory staff and technicians.|$|R
