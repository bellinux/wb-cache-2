40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a systematic method for estimating <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> from storage tank and wastewater treatment (WWT) units. <b>Fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> is the unintentional release of chemical vapors or gases that occur whenever there are discontinuities in the solid barrier maintaining the containment. While the amount released is very small, continuous exposure to chemical substances due to emission may adversely affect workers’ health. To achieve the objectives, a comprehensive review is conducted on currently available <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> estimation methods. A combination of emission factor, equation and software techniques is chosen as the methodology to study <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> from storage tank and WWT units. A total of eleven horizontal and vertical tanks as well as nine WWT units are selected in this study. The results are presented as precalculated <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> database for storage tank and WWT units. Dimensions data for storage tank and WWT units are also compiled from various sources for estimating chemical concentration. Three examples are given to demonstrate the application of the precalculated <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> database in estimating <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> and concentration from storage tank and WWT units. To calculate the other losses (e. g. working loss and evaporation loss), TANKS 4. 09 d software and evaporation loss equation are used. The typical range of <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> individual stream value for both storage tank and WWT units are found to be within 0. 01 - 0. 20 kg/h. Calculation using the EPA emission factor leads to higher emission estimates compared to using the controlled emission value. Evaporation loss is found to be the largest source of emission loss from storage tank and WWT compared to <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission,</b> working and breathing losse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFugitive {{emissions}} {{are one of}} the pollution that can affect environment, health and also economy. It is a deemed to be {{an important part of the}} debate on climate change because they represent a significant portion of greenhouse gas emission. It is estimated that 60 - 70 % of the <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> comes from valve. This paper presented a study which focusing on <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> by valve, which will be solved using GAMS to optimize the selection of valve and achieve the objective. The <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> is minimized by replacing the current valve with new valve based on its emission rate. Type of valve that has been considered in this study is ball valve, gate valve, butterfly valve, globe valve and plug valve. Based from the results, it can be said that plug valve, gate valve and butterfly valve is most preferable compare to other type of valve for <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. Different types of valves give different price, so, the selection of valve are depending on the budget of the project. The <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> can be reducing in easy way at the design stage by using GAMS application to optimize it...|$|R

5000|$|Leaks from {{pressurized}} {{process equipment}} generally occur through valves, pipe connections, mechanical seals, or related equipment. <b>Fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> also occur at evaporative {{sources such as}} waste water treatment ponds and storage tanks. Because of the huge number of potential leak sources at large industrial facilities and the difficulties in detecting and repairing some leaks, <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> can be {{a significant proportion of}} total emissions. Though the quantities of leaked gases may be small, gases that have serious health or environmental impacts can cause a significant problem.|$|E
50|$|New {{technologies}} are under development that could revolutionize the detection and monitoring of <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions.</b> One technology, known as {{differential absorption lidar}} (DIAL), {{can be used to}} remotely measure concentration profiles of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere up to several hundred meters from a facility. DIAL has been used for refinery surveys in Europe for over 15 years. A pilot study carried out in 2005 using DIAL found that actual emissions at a refinery were fifteen times higher than those previously reported using the emission factor approach. The <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> were equivalent to 0.17% of the refinery throughput.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fugitive</b> <b>{{emissions}}</b> are {{emissions of}} gases or vapors from pressurized equipment due to leaks and other unintended or irregular releases of gases, mostly from industrial activities. As {{well as the}} economic cost of lost commodities, <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> contribute to air pollution and climate change. A detailed inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from upstream oil and gas activities in Canada for the year 2000 estimated that fugitive equipment leaks had a global warming potential equivalent {{to the release of}} 17 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide, or 12 per cent of all greenhouse gases emitted by the sector. Venting of natural gas, flaring, accidental releases and storage losses accounted for an additional 38 per cent.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 25 Most {{states have}} adopted {{regulations}} that limit <b>fugitive</b> hydrocarbon <b>emissions</b> from mechanical seals in centrifugal pumps. In California, limits {{as low as}} 100 ppm have been imposed. Users are faced with few choices to meet these strict standards, and have turned to dual seals and sealless pumps to comply. Many have found that current <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> limits can be met with single seals by careful attention to detail retrofit and repair procedures. Discussed herein are the rigors required to successfully rebuild, maintain, and operate pumps-in most cases with a single seal. These techniques also enhance pump reliability and have been applied to over 100 pumps in harsh refinery environments...|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{technical}} difficulties and costs of detecting and quantifying actual <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> at a site or facility, and the variability and intermittent nature of emission flow rates, bottom-up estimates based on standard emission factors are generally used for annual reporting purposes.|$|E

In conducting the master work there has been used three evaluation methods: using the emission factors from (NPI) from the Australian Ministry of environment, conducting real, direct measurements at site using MICRO Dust pro instrument and through mathematic analyses by using software DISPER 5. 2 dust dispersion models are conducted and validation is made to the emission factors with the real measurements. Taking under consideration the complexity of the dispersion as a physical phenomena that needs a serious approach a conclusion was made that the calculation of the emission factors should be done very carefully taking under consideration the specifics of the ambient characteristics and the huge impact of the atmospheric conditions and it has been determined that in our cases the emission factors give us relatively more realistic values for surface sources than the emission factors for line and point dust sources...|$|R

In Europe, the SOF technique is Best Available Technology for measurements of <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> of VOC from refineries and it is presently being standardized within CEN together with several other optical methods. The method is used to screen all larger Swedish refineries and petrochemical. The measurements provide the total emission coming from the whole refinery (the bubble), divided into sub parts, e. g., process areas, crude oil storage, product storage tanks, water treatment facilities, flares, and loading operations.
