Injuries include: laceration, avulsion injuries, burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear, for discipline or torture. Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear, a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium, which can impair blood supply and healing. Owing to its exposed position, {{the external}} ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers, including squamous-cell carcinoma and basal-cell carcinomas.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines are {{traditionally}} characterized by several symplesiomorphic (ancestral) traits not {{shared with the}} simians, particularly the rhinarium.

The toothcomb is a synapomorphy (shared, derived trait) seen among lemuriforms, although it is <b>frequently</b> <b>and</b> incorrectly used to define the strepsirrhine clade. Strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing an epitheliochorial placenta. Unlike the tarsiers and simians, strepsirrhines are capable of producing their own vitamin C and do not need it supplied in their diet. Further genetic evidence {{for the relationship between}} tarsiers and simians as a haplorhine clade is the shared possession of three SINE markers.|$|E
