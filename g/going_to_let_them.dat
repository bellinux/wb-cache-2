500|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as {{the harder}} [...] "prime" [...] tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer [...] "option" [...] compound, {{as opposed to}} the previous year where the company brought the hard compound as the prime and medium compound as the option. Sauber's Head of Track Engineering, Giampaolo Dall'Ara, praised the updated choice, summing up that it will challenge teams to make time in the corners in addition to going for pure top speed, putting on a better show for the fans. However, Pirelli had received criticism from several drivers and commentators following tyre failures on Nico Rosberg's and Sebastian Vettel's cars at the Belgian Grand Prix. Prior to the Italian Grand Prix, Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone called for the drivers to keep their concerns to themselves, saying: [...] "We’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> [...] go.

Elliott would also enlist in further production work with Nisan Stewart for Spears' project, however none of the initial material saw the light of day.

In this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and accordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece. The two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my pistols with about four bullets each; and, in this posture, well provided with ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my expedition.|$|R
