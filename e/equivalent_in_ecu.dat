40|$|The {{development}} of advanced thermal management materials for Electronic Control Unit (ECU) {{is the key}} to achieving high reliability and thus safety critical operations <b>in</b> areas of <b>ECU</b> applications such as automotives and power systems. Thermal management issues associated with the operation of ECU at elevated temperature have accounted for some of the recent reliability concerns which have culminated in current systems failures in some automobiles. As the functions of <b>ECU</b> <b>in</b> systems have increased in recent times, the number of components per unit area on its board has also risen. High board density boosts internal heat generated per unit time <b>in</b> <b>ECU</b> ambient. The generated heat induces stress and strain at the chip interconnects due to variation in the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) and thermal conductivity of different bonded materials in the assembly. Thermal degradation impacts device’s efficiency and could become critical. The life expectancy of electronic components reduces exponentially as the operating temperature rises, thus making thermal management pivotal in electronic system reliability. Since materials’ properties vary with operating condition, material performance has become a major consideration in the design of heat dissipation mechanism <b>in</b> <b>ECU.</b> The {{development of}} advanced thermal management materials and hence improving the performance of ECU require an in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between materials’ properties and their behaviours at elevated temperatures. The paper presents an overview of thermal management materials for <b>ECU</b> <b>in</b> terms of material properties and processing technology. In addition, the paper outlines the crucial challenges in materials selection, including cost and manufacturing and other outstanding R & D issues...|$|R
