5|$|Outside these countries, Bennett {{remained}} almost unknown as a musician, {{although his}} reputation as a conductor led Berlioz to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join his Société Philharmonique, and the Dutch composer Johannes Verhulst solicited his support for the Netherlands Society for Encouragement of Music. Davison's attempts to interest the French composer Charles Gounod in Bennett's music led to polite but sardonic responses.|$|E
5|$|As Madge and {{her family}} turns to {{celebrate}} Christmas, the Doctor attempts to slip away, but Madge catches him, and as she sees the TARDIS realises {{that he is the}} man in the space suit from three years before. She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to go to see them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have Christmas dinner, as they had always set him a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E
5|$|The {{restrictions}} against royalist {{candidates and}} voters were widely ignored, and the elections {{resulted in a}} House of Commons that was fairly evenly divided on political grounds between Royalists and Parliamentarians and on religious grounds between Anglicans and Presbyterians. The new so-called Convention Parliament assembled on 25 April 1660, and soon afterwards welcomed the Declaration of Breda, in which Charles promised lenience and tolerance. There would be liberty of conscience and Anglican church policy would not be harsh. He would not exile past enemies nor confiscate their wealth. There would be pardons for nearly all his opponents except the regicides. Above all, Charles promised to rule in cooperation with Parliament. The English Parliament resolved to proclaim Charles king and <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return, a message that reached Charles at Breda on 8 May 1660. In Ireland, a convention had been called earlier in the year, and had already declared for Charles. On 14 May, he was proclaimed king in Dublin.|$|E

50|$|He had a rich {{baritone}} voice {{which was}} favoured {{by a number}} of accomplished composers of his time. Edward Elgar <b>invited</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sing at an early performance of his oratorio, 'The Dream of Gerontius', and Edward German <b>invited</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sing the part of the Earl of Essex in his opera, 'Merrie England', in Bournemouth.|$|R
5|$|At the World Indoor Championships 60 metres final, Chambers won {{a silver}} medal and {{recorded}} a new personal best of 6.54s to take second behind Olusoji Fasuba. The performance did not sway opinion: Chambers continued to encounter extensive criticism within athletics. Promoters did not <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> key athletics events, Eddie Kulukundis – who had supported Chambers earlier in his career – refused to sponsor the sprinter, and the British Olympic Association (BOA), prevented him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. To return to the track Chambers {{had to rely on}} the money he received from his partner, Leonie Daley, a civil servant whom he met at the Miss Jamaica UK competition. The couple now had a child, a boy named Skye who was born in September 2005, and Chambers desperately needed to earn a living to support his family and pay off debts incurred through the drug ban. He amassed a selection of cuttings about his fall from grace and the BALCO Scandal in order to show his son the risks of drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed {{when the}} three-year-old Wolf does not <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and bull terrier mix, {{for a run}} in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, {{following}} their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a mile away. Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to {{get close enough to}} the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.|$|E
5|$|Xander's dream {{begins when}} he wakes on Buffy's couch. After excusing himself {{to use the}} restroom, he finds himself the object of an {{attempted}} seduction by Joyce. In the restroom, he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz. Throughout the sequence Xander finds himself in his basement again and again, chased by an unseen pursuer, who is revealed as the First Slayer when she tears his heart out.|$|E

25|$|McDonald {{retired to}} California. In 1969, he {{published}} his autobiography, Union Man: The Life of a Labor Statesman. Although union members voted to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> their convention in 1966, Abel {{did not ask}} for him to come. When the USWA held its convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1976, McDonald was not invited to attend.|$|E
25|$|What a Mesh - The contractor’s initial {{work was}} up to standard, {{although}} using old methods. However, the task of tiling the entire ground floor overwhelmed him, and the standard deteriorated until he quit. Mike is impressed with the tile company (and their delivery vehicle) when they <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> redo the whole job with products they offer to donate, if he applies them using the correct methods.|$|E
25|$|On 13 October 2016, King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand {{died at the}} age of 88, in Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok.

They talk for a while in the laundromat, and then she <b>invites</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come to her house in a couple of days.|$|R
60|$|Mike made {{no further}} objections. The {{thought of that}} bed-sitting room in Acacia Road and the {{pantomime}} dame rose up and killed them. After all, Psmith was not like any ordinary person. There would be no question of charity. Psmith had <b>invited</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> the flat {{in exactly the same}} spirit as he had <b>invited</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his house for the cricket week.|$|R
25|$|After {{retiring}} from racing, Reutemann's popularity led the Justicialist Party {{of the province}} of Santa Fe to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> run for governor. He won the election and ran the province for one four-year term (19911995). The provincial constitution {{does not allow for}} re-election, but after four years Reutemann presented again and won the governorship for the period 19992003. During those years, his profile grew and {{he became one of the}} leading politicians in Santa Fe and in Argentina.|$|E
25|$|Alice {{developed}} a genuine friendship with Richard Nixon {{when he was}} vice president, and {{when he returned to}} California after Eisenhower's second term, she kept in touch and did not consider his political career to be over. Alice encouraged Nixon to reenter politics and continued to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> her famous dinners. Nixon returned these favors by inviting her to his first formal White House dinner and to the 1971 wedding of his daughter Tricia Nixon.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day after}} the 1964 general election, Smith waited for what he thought would be a certain phone call to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a cabinet {{minister}} in Harold Wilson's government. However, Wilson had a vague suspicion of Smith, and Smith's alliance with the more moderate side of the Labour Party meant that no such invitation was made. In early 1965, George Brown appointed Smith as chairman of the Northern Economic Planning Council, on which he served until 1970.|$|E

Jim remembers Mr. Tur Tur and his ability to appear as a giant when seen from afar, and Jim and Luke decide to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Morrowland to use his unique ability as a living lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Scotty was re-elected President of Nauru, amidst {{claims that}} his electoral {{campaign}} had been funded by Taiwan. Scotty's opponents {{claimed that the}} ROC wanted {{to ensure that a}} pro-Taiwan government remained in power. Scotty was replaced by Marcus Stephen in December 2007. Following Stephen's election, ROC President Chen Shui-bian telephoned him to congratulate him, assure him of the ROC's continued assistance for Nauru, request Nauru's continued support in return, and <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> visit Taiwan. Nauru has retained its relations with the ROC under the new government.|$|E
25|$|While Heraclius {{launched}} his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd {{was unable to}} muster his armies in time to provide the Byzantines with Persian support. Umar, allegedly aware of this alliance, capitalized on this failure: not wanting to risk a battle with two great powers simultaneously, he quickly moved to reinforce the Muslim army at Yarmouk to engage and defeat the Byzantines. Meanwhile, Umar ordered Saad to enter into peace negotiations with Yazdegerd III and <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Islam to prevent Persian forces from taking the field. Heraclius instructed his general Vahan {{not to engage in}} battle with the Muslims before receiving explicit orders; however, fearing more Arab reinforcements, Vahan attacked the Muslim army in the Battle of Yarmouk in August 636. Heraclius's Imperial army was routed.|$|E

25|$|King was {{especially}} concerned {{with issues of}} social welfare and {{was influenced by the}} settlement house movement pioneered by Toynbee Hall in London, England. He {{played a central role in}} fomenting a students' strike at the university in 1895. He was in close touch, behind the scenes, with Vice-Chancellor William Mulock, for whom the strike provided a chance to embarrass his rivals Chancellor Edward Blake and President James Loudon. King failed to gain his immediate objective, a teaching position at the University, but earned political credit with Mulock, the man who would <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Ottawa and make him a deputy minister only five years later. While studying at the University of Toronto, King also contributed to the campus newspaper The Varsity.|$|E
25|$|Johnny Carson's {{success on}} ABC's Who Do You Trust? led NBC to <b>invite</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take over Tonight {{a few months}} before Paar's departure. Carson {{declined}} the offer because he feared the difficulty of interviewing celebrities for 105 minutes daily. Bob Newhart, Jackie Gleason, Groucho Marx, and Joey Bishop all also declined. NBC finally convinced Carson to sign by early February 1962. Carson can be seen discussing his upcoming job {{for the first time on}} the February 11, 1962, episode of What's My Line?. Due to Carson having six months left on his ABC contract, NBC used multiple guest hosts until he could take over. Guest hosts included Merv Griffin, Art Linkletter, Joey Bishop, Arlene Francis (the first woman to host The Tonight Show), Bob Cummings, Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx, Donald O'Connor, and others.|$|E

The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him {{in order to get}} the money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is gone, that he has all their money, and that he and Paul had sex. In a fit of fury, she cruelly suggests that Rick's father had always questioned his son's sexuality. Soon afterwards Rick commits suicide.|$|E
