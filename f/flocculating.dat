40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{electrolyte}} concentration and pH on the settling behaviour, floc sizes and rheological behaviour of kaolinite suspensions were investigated. The {{results show that the}} settling behaviour of kaolinite changes with the ionic strength and pH of the suspension. In the acidic pH range, (pH 2) particles settle in <b>flocculated</b> form regardless of electrolyte concentration, however, in the basic pH range, the particles settle both, in dispersed form (at lower electrolyte concentrations) and in <b>flocculated</b> form (at higher electrolyte concentrations). The Bingham yield stress and time-dependent behaviour for these <b>flocculated</b> and deflocculated suspensions was investigated. In this study, the fundamental of structural kinetic model (SKM) was used to investigate the time-dependent viscosity behaviour of <b>flocculated</b> and deflocculated kaolinite suspensions. It was found that the kaolinite suspensions in the deflocculated form show viscosity time-independent behaviour with negligible Bingham yield stress. While, the <b>flocculated</b> suspensions show marked non-Newtonian time-dependent behaviour.

The interparticle energy at contact was controlled by adsorbing fatty acids of varying rnolecu-lar weight at the aluminddecalin interface.

2500|$|Protein {{precipitate}} formation {{occurs in a}} stepwise process. [...] First, a precipitating agent is added and the solution is steadily mixed. [...] Mixing causes the precipitant and protein to collide. Enough mixing time is required for molecules to diffuse across the fluid eddies. [...] Next, proteins undergo a nucleation phase, where submicroscopic sized protein aggregates, or particles, are generated. Growth of these particles is under Brownian diffusion control. Once the particles reach a critical size (0.1 µm to 10 µm for high and low shear fields, respectively), by diffusive addition of individual protein molecules to it, they continue to grow by colliding into each other and sticking or <b>flocculating.</b> This phase occurs at a slower rate. During the final step, called aging in a shear field, the precipitate particles repeatedly collide and stick, then break apart, until a stable mean particle size is reached, which is dependent upon individual proteins. The mechanical strength of the protein particles correlates with {{the product of the}} mean shear rate and the aging time, which is known as the Camp number. Aging helps particles withstand the fluid shear forces encountered in pumps and centrifuge feed zones without reducing in size.|$|E

The <b>flocculated</b> particles provide a potential food source for shrimp. Short-term tank experiments {{were conducted to}} determine the retention of nitrogen (N) from natural biota, dominated by <b>flocculated</b> particles, in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) at a high-intensity, zero-exchange shrimp farm in Central America (Belize Aquaculture (BAL)). There were two treatments: 'floc' and 'floc+ 20 %' (3 ױ 000 -l replicate tanks each) based on two densities of <b>flocculated</b> particles. The floc density in the 'floc' treatment was typical of shrimp growout ponds at BAL, whereas the 'floc+ 20 %' treatment had a 20 % higher density of <b>flocculated</b> particles. Three consecutive experiments were conducted with 1, 5 and 9 g shrimp, respectively. At {{the start of the}} experiment, 15 N-ammonium was added to the tanks and assimilated by the natural biota. Shrimp were maintained in these tanks for 48 h after the 15 N-nitrogen enrichment. After this time, shrimp were found to be enriched with 15 N-nitrogen. It was calculated that between 1 % and 3 % of the particulate nitrogen in the tanks, principally from the <b>flocculated</b> particles, was retained by the shrimp. The proportion of estimated daily nitrogen retention of the shrimp contributed by the natural biota was calculated to be 18 % to 29 % for 1 to 9 g animals in the floc treatment. There was a tendency for greater retention in the floc+ 20 % treatments, but this trend was not consistent. This study suggests that natural biota, which in this system was largely <b>flocculated</b> particles, can contribute substantially to the nutrition of L. vannamei. There are, therefore, benefits for shrimp in the promotion of <b>flocculated</b> particles in L. vannamei ponds.

Two experiments with different phytoplankton composition in <b>flocculated</b> concentrates from shrimp pond water were investigated to compare the effect on preservation and use of <b>flocculated</b> concentrates from intensive shrimp pond as a partial substitute for microalgae concentrates for the nursery culture of juvenile oysters (Crassostrea belcheri) was evaluated. The results show that total crude protein content in <b>flocculated</b> concentrates mostly contain unidentified nanocyanobacteria preserved in refrigerator at 4  °C gradually decreased from the first week in experiment 1, while a slight decrease in crude protein content appeared after the third week in <b>flocculated</b> concentrates dominated by the Bacillariophyceae and unidentified nanocyanobacteria groups in experiment 2. The pheophytin a:chlorophyll a ratio suddenly increased during the third week of storage and most of the fatty acid composition was absent after four weeks of storage in both experiments.

In the <b>flocculated</b> cultures, the H- 2 consumers were inhibited {{to a greater extent}} when compared to the granular cultures. The maximum H- 2 yields were 2. 52 +/- 0. 2 and 1. 9 +/- 0. 2 mol mol(- 1) glucose in the <b>flocculated</b> and granular cultures, respectively. The major long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) detected at which H- 2 attained a maximum value were LA (750 mg L- 1) and myristic acid (MA) (500 mg L- 1). Bacteroides sp. dominated the granular cultures whereas Clostridium sp. and Bacillus spp. were the major microorganisms in the <b>flocculated</b> cultures.

40|$|In bitumen {{recovery}} from oil sands, {{a percentage of}} the bitumen is lost to tailings. The effect of fugitive bitumen on fines settling and consolidation in tailings ponds remains controversial. In the current study, the settling performance of mature fine tailings (MFT) in response to flocculant addition was considered by studying MFT of varying bitumen content. Bitumen content in the MFT was adjusted by controlled removal of bitumen using a Denver flotation cell. The initial settling rate of <b>flocculated</b> MFT was observed to increase with decreasing bitumen content from 0. 45 to 0. 18 wt%. A further reduction in bitumen content was found to dramatically decrease the settling rate of <b>flocculated</b> MFT. Such behaviour seems counterintuitive since the polymer flocculant was found to have a greater affinity for 'clean' surfaces (Al 2 O 3) than for bitumen contaminated surfaces, as measured by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), which would predict a further increase in settling rate of <b>flocculated</b> MFT with decreasing bitumen content. The reduction in settling rate below a critical bitumen content is thought to result from selective removal of hydrophobic solids, since washing of untreated MFT with toluene is shown to significantly improve settling of <b>flocculated</b> solids.

Static and dynamic light scattering reveal that single particles coexist in dynamic equilibrium with <b>flocculated</b> networks at room temperature. These types of systems are classified as weakly <b>flocculated</b> and are quite rare. As weakly <b>flocculated</b> systems generally exist only within a narrow range of conditions, the effect of temperature was probed. When temperature is increased, the thermal motion of suspended particles increases, favoring dispersion, but in ILs suspensions, heating reduces the stabilizing effect of the interfacial structure of the IL. When subjected to a small increase in temperature, particle suspensions in ILs become unstable, indicated {{by the absence of}} a peak corresponding to single particles in the light scattering data. For EAN and DMEAF, further increasing temperatures above 40 °C returns the systems to a weakly <b>flocculated</b> state in which thermal energy is sufficient to break particles away from aggregates. Weakly <b>flocculated</b> suspensions in EAN and EtAN settle more rapidly than predicted by the Stokes equation, as the particles spend a significant portion of time in large, rapidly settling flocs.

The measurements have conclusively demonstrated that the acoustic properties of the <b>flocculated</b> particles are not solely controlled by the primary particles; {{some aspect of the}} floc structure is influencing the scattering characteristics.
