5|$|On opening, the Metropolitan Railway's trains were {{provided}} by the Great Western Railway, but these were withdrawn in August 1863. After a period hiring trains from the Great Northern Railway, the Metropolitan Railway introduced its own, Fowler designed, 4-4-0 tank <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> 1864. The design, known as the A class and, with minor updates, the B class, was so successful that the Metropolitan and District Railways eventually had 120 of the <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> use and they remained in operation until electrification of the lines in the 1900s.|$|E

5000|$|Father Eugenio Barsanti, was an Italian engineer, who {{together}} with Felice Matteucci of Florence invented {{the first real}} internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title [...] "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses". In 1860, Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas-fired internal combustion <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1864, Nikolaus Otto patented the first atmospheric gas <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1872, American George Brayton invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1876, Nikolaus Otto, working with Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, patented the compressed charge, four-cycle <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1879, Karl Benz patented a reliable two-stroke gas <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1892, Rudolf Diesel developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1926, Robert Goddard launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the Heinkel He 178 became the world's first jet aircraft.|$|R
5|$|S3D, {{a project}} that models the {{molecular}} physics of combustion, aims to improve the efficiency of diesel and biofuel <b>engines.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, using Jaguar, it produced the first fully resolved simulation of autoigniting hydrocarbon flames relevant to the efficiency of direct injection diesel engines.|$|E
5|$|The London and South Western Railway {{arrived in}} 1839 from London, {{and within a}} year it was {{extended}} to Winchester and Southampton. In 1848 a rival company, sponsored by the Great Western Railway built a branch from Reading. In 1854 a line was built to Salisbury by the London and South Western. In the 19th century Basingstoke began to move into industrial manufacture, Wallis and Haslam (later Wallis & Steevens), began producing agricultural equipment including threshing machines in the 1850s, moving into the production of stationary steam <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> the 1860s and then traction <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> the 1870s.|$|E

50|$|Clark {{had been}} {{undertaking}} pioneering engine work both {{on his own}} and with John F Endter. John Foos held the patent. In 1885 the company demonstrated a small 2-cycle <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> a small boat. The engine was based on a Dugald Clerk design. Clerk was a Scottish engineer who had patented the <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> the 1870s. Foos formed his own company, Foos Gas <b>Engine</b> Company, <b>in</b> 1889 using his own improved version of Clark Sintz's <b>engine.</b> <b>In</b> 1894 Elwood Haynes used a Sintz <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> his first car, as did Milton Reeves in 1896.|$|R
5000|$|In 1854 in the UK, the Italian inventors Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci {{tried to}} patent [...] "Obtaining motive {{power by the}} {{explosion}} of gases", although the application did not progress to the granted stage.

5|$|Since the T65 {{project was}} fading away, the Armored Force still needed a light {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, so {{they made a}} new project (called T65E1) based on the new T24 chassis (a prototype of the M24 Chaffee).

5|$|The Increased Performance Engine (IPE) program {{led to the}} 29,588lbf (131.6kN) F110-GE-129 on the Block 50 and 29,160lbf (129.4kN) F100-PW-229 on the Block 52. F-16s began {{flying with}} these IPE <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s. Altogether, of the 1,446 F-16C/Ds ordered by the USAF, 556 were fitted with F100-series engines and 890 with F110s. The United Arab Emirates’ Block 60 is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-132 {{turbofan}} with a maximum thrust of 32,500lbf (144.6kN), the highest thrust engine developed for the F-16.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Design Bureau started {{research}} on thrust vectoring {{as early as}} 1983, when the Soviet government tasked the bureau with the separate development of the Su-27M, which was an upgrade of the Su-27. At the insistence of General Director Mikhail Simonov, {{who had been the}} chief designer of the Su-27, Sukhoi and the Siberian Aeronautical Research Institute studied axisymmetrical vectoring nozzles. This was in contrast to the prevailing focus on two-dimensional nozzles in the Western press. Lyulka (later Lyulka-Saturn) also began studies of thrust-vectoring <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> 1985. By the late 1980s, Sukhoi were evaluating their research using the its flying test beds.|$|E
5|$|The ellipse {{also served}} as the design basis for the Spitfire's fin and {{tailplane}} assembly, once again exploiting the shape's favourable aerodynamic characteristics. Both the elevators and rudder were shaped so that their centre of mass was shifted forward, thus reducing control-surface flutter. The longer noses and greater propeller-wash resulting from larger <b>engines</b> <b>in</b> later models necessitated increasingly larger vertical and, later, horizontal tail surfaces {{to compensate for the}} altered aerodynamics, culminating in those of the Mk 22/24 series which were 25% larger in area than those of the Mk I.|$|E
50|$|For the Japanese {{market the}} {{fourth-generation}} Celica {{started with the}} 1S-iSU <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> the ST160 and 4A <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> the AT160. The 4A <b>engine</b> was terminated <b>in</b> August 1987 and the 1S-iLU engine {{was replaced by the}} 4S-Fi <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> the ST163 in May 1988. The 3S <b>engine</b> <b>in</b> various twincam forms was introduced in August 1987 in the ST162. The 3S-GTE turbo engine was also introduced {{at the same time in}} the all-wheel drive ST165 GT-Four. Two months later, a factory convertible (coded ST162C) was offered with the twincam 3S-FE engine. The vehicle with the 2.0 litre engine was regarded as the top trim level package due to the increased annual road tax so the GT was fully equipped to justify the tax liability.|$|R
