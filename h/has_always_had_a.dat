5|$|The square <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> park in its centre, {{which was}} {{originally}} Lammas land. The park's fortunes have varied over the centuries, reaching near dilapidation in {{the mid-19th century}} after changing ownership several times. It was restored {{under the direction of}} Albert Grant, which included the construction of four new statues and a fountain of William Shakespeare. The square was extensively refurbished and remodelled for the 2012 London Olympics, costing more than £15m and taking over 17 months to complete.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was {{adorned with a}} lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence {{for the use of}} a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E

5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it {{was legal}} to kill 22,500 porpoises {{per year to}} catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna {{has been known to}} follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E

There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.|$|E
5|$|York's {{location}} on the River Ouse and in {{the centre of the}} Vale of York means that it <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant position in the nation's transport system. The city grew up as a river port at the confluence of the River Ouse and the River Foss. The Ouse was originally a tidal river, accessible to seagoing ships of the time. Today both of these rivers remain navigable, although the Foss is only navigable for a short distance above the confluence. A lock at Naburn on the Ouse to the south of York means that the river in York is no longer tidal.|$|E

25|$|The {{language}} of Titus <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{central role in}} criticism of the play insofar as those who doubt Shakespeare's authorship have often pointed to the apparent deficiencies in the language as evidence of that claim.
