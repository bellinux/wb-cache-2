25|$|Dog {{fighting}} {{was considered a}} way for the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several daimyō, such as Chosokabe Motochika and Yamauchi Yodo, both from Tosa Province (present-day Kōchi Prefecture), were known to encourage dog <b>fighting.</b> <b>Dog</b> {{fighting was}} also popular in Akita Prefecture, which is the origin of the Akita breed.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} {{history of}} Pit Bulls {{makes it impossible}} to rule out a violent propensity for any one dog as gameness and aggressiveness can be hidden for years. Given the Pit Bull's genetical physical strengths and abilities, a Pit Bull always poses the possibility of danger; given the Pit Bull's breeding history as a <b>fighting</b> <b>dog</b> and the latency of its aggressiveness and gameness, the Pit Bull poses a danger distinct from other breeds of dogs which do not so uniformly share those traits.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} breed of the <b>fighting</b> <b>dog</b> was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed {{with a powerful}} build and strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice. Additionally, these {{foundation breed}}s were also bred for a powerful jaw that {{would enable them to}} defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals. These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives in order to be used in wars throughout history.|$|E

[...] In South Carolina, David Tant, breeder of <b>fighting</b> <b>dogs,</b> is serving a 30-year sentence, among the stiffest ever imposed for the crime. Tant, 63, formerly of the Charleston area, pleaded guilty in November 2004 to more than 40 counts of illegally breeding <b>fighting</b> <b>dogs,</b> and one assault count connected to a surveyor who was wounded by a booby trap after he wandered onto Tant’s property in southern Charleston County.

25|$|The Shar Pei {{has been}} {{identified}} as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. According to historical documents and artifacts, they have existed in China since ancient times, and their likeness was often used to decorate various objects, especially during the Han Dynasty. During this period, they were used as <b>fighting</b> <b>dogs,</b> and gradually became favorite pets of Chinese emperors.

25|$|Despite {{legality}} issues, {{dogs are}} still commonly used for fighting purposes {{all across the}} continent. The American Pit Bull Terrier {{is the most popular}} breed used for fighting, but foreign breeds, such as the Dogo Argentino (used widely in South America), and to a lesser extent, the Presa Canario are also gaining popularity. The Dogo Argentino is now often seen in dog fight circuits in areas of the United States where the American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) has been banned. In Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the APBT, American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (or any other dog that substantially conforms to any of these breeds' characteristics) is banned, the Dogo Argentino has become the main <b>fighting</b> <b>dog</b> of choice, being used at both organized and street level dogfighting.|$|E
25|$|Dog {{fighting}} is a felony in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, {{a person can}} be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other—depending on the evidence. In addition to felony charges for dog fighting, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, have provisions within their dogfighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dogfighting exhibition. Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog-fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, forty-six states, and the District of Columbia, make possessing, owning or keeping a <b>fighting</b> <b>dog</b> a felony.|$|E
25|$|Founded in March 1980 by Newkirk {{and fellow}} animal rights activist Alex Pacheco, the {{organization}} first caught the public's {{attention in the}} summer of 1981 during {{what became known as the}} Silver Spring monkeys case, a widely publicized dispute about experiments conducted on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case lasted 10 years, involved the only police raid on an animal laboratory in the United States, triggered an amendment in 1985 to that country's Animal Welfare Act, and established PETA as an internationally known organization. Today, it focuses on four core issues—opposition to factory farming, fur farming, animal testing, and the use of animals in entertainment. It also campaigns for a vegan lifestyle and against eating meat, fishing, the killing of animals regarded as pests, the keeping of chained backyard dogs, cock <b>fighting,</b> <b>dog</b> fighting, and bullfighting.|$|E
25|$|When bullbaiting {{became popular}} in England {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large <b>fighting</b> <b>dogs</b> were built too heavy and too slow {{for this type of}} combat. When <b>fighting</b> a bull, <b>dogs</b> were trained to grab onto the bull's nose and pin the bull's head to the ground. If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns. The British therefore decided to selectively breed <b>fighting</b> <b>dogs</b> for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw. These efforts resulted in the Old English Bulldog.|$|R

25|$|Japanese history, both {{verbal and}} written, {{describe}} {{the ancestors of}} the Akita, the Matagi dog （Japanese:）(hunting dog, Bear hunting dog, Deer hunting dog), {{as one of the}} oldest of the native dogs. Today's Akita developed primarily from dogs in the northernmost region of the island of Honshū in the Akita prefecture, thus providing the breed's name. The Matagi's quarry included wild boar, Sika deer, and Asian black bear. This precursor dog tracked large game, holding it at bay until hunters arrived to make the kill. The breed is also influenced by crosses with larger breeds from Asia and Europe, including English Mastiffs, Great Danes, St. Bernards, and the Tosa Inu, in the desire to develop a <b>fighting</b> <b>dog</b> for the burgeoning dog fighting industry in Odate in the early 20th century. During World War II the Akita was also crossed with German Shepherd Dogs in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled. The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese Shar-Pei is {{a unique}} and {{intelligent}} dog most often recognized for its wrinkles. Initially developed as a Chinese farm and hunting and later <b>fighting</b> <b>dog,</b> the breed does well today in obedience, agility, herding and tracking, with skills {{that would have been}} needed on the farm. Because the name Shar-Pei means [...] "sand coat", harshness is a distinctive feature in its two accepted coat types, either horse (short) or brush (up to an inch long). Other unique qualities include black mouth pigment, a slightly [...] "hippo-like" [...] head shape, small ears, deep-set eyes and rising top-line.|$|E
2500|$|In {{twentieth century}} America, despite the {{expansion}} of laws to outlaw dog <b>fighting,</b> <b>dog</b> fighting continued to flourish underground. Aiding in {{the expansion of}} dog fighting were the police and firemen, who saw dog fighting {{as a form of}} entertainment amongst their ranks. In fact, the Police Gazette served as a [...] "go to" [...] source for information about where one could attend a fight. When Henry Bergh, who started the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), witnessed police involvement in these fights, he was motivated to seek and receive authority for the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Agents to have arresting power in New York. Additionally, Bergh's 1867 revision to New York's animal cruelty law made all forms of animal fighting illegal. However, According to the ASPCA website, the Humane Law Enforcement department of ASPCA has been disbanded and NYPD has taken over its duty. As laws were passed to outlaw the activity, high-profile organizations, such as the United Kennel Club, who once endorsed the sport by formulating rules and sanctioning referees, withdrew their endorsement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>fighting</b> is a practice, {{illegal in}} many jurisdictions, where two dogs, often a molosser breed, {{are put into}} an area to fight and {{sometimes}} kill each other. <b>Dog</b> <b>fighting</b> has been reported {{as far back as}} AD 43 when the Romans invaded Britain.

50|$|The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals focuses {{heavily on}} the issue on <b>dog</b> <b>fighting.</b> There are various levels of <b>dog</b> <b>fighting.</b> There is “street” level, {{which means that the}} dogfights are {{informal}} because strict rules and regulations are absent from the matches. Another level is “hobbyists”, which are fights that are formally organized. They are mainly scheduled for income and speculators. The final level of <b>dog</b> <b>fighting</b> is “professional.” At the professional level, owners usually have more that fifty <b>fighting</b> <b>dogs</b> and carefully examine the specific breed, lineage, and winning history of each dog.|$|R
2500|$|After {{a life of}} {{training}} as a <b>fighting</b> <b>dog,</b> if a dog does not suffer its death while in such service, it is often euthanized. In Richmond, Virginia, when a dog fighter was sentenced in June 2007, it was revealed in court that over a dozen of his dogs had to be euthanized, either because of serious illness, injury or malnutrition, or because their training as fighting dogs made them too dangerous for adoption. Until 2006, the man had kept 16 pit bulls in the backyard of his house, confined with heavy chains used for automobile towing. Experts say chaining the animals is a dogfighting technique for building strength. [...] When an animal control officer arrived {{in response to a}} complaint from a neighbor that one of the dogs had died, he found the dead dog in a trash can. The others had no food, no clean water and no adequate shelter. Jody Jones, program manager of Richmond Animal Care and Control, said in court that the case produced more dogs euthanized than any other case she knows of from her 15-year career in animal control.|$|E
