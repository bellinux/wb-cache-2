5000|$|The [...] "viola part" [...] to the Sonata {{movement}} {{is not to}} be played by a viola. It is simply [...] "the viola part" [...] from the last page of the original Concerto sketch (where it is doubled by bassoon, and the downbeats to each triplet figure are doubled by tubular bells). When Ives added the line back to the Sonata movement (in the copy of the Transcriptions made by copyist Reiss), in both pencil sketch and ink patch, he simply called it [...] "viola part". <b>Ives</b> <b>never</b> intended it to be played by a viola. This {{is not the same as}} the optional flute part in the [...] "Thoreau" [...] movement, where a flute player is explicitly called for.|$|R
5000|$|Internationally the {{recording}} gained high praise with {{critics in the}} United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. Jazz Journal's Anthony Troon postulated on the reaction of Ives' himself to the music, giving the CD 4 of 5 stars, [...] "Presumably <b>Ives</b> <b>never</b> heard modern jazz but he would surely have been intrigued and impressed by this." [...] Again the significance of Ives music brought forward is recognized by Jazz Podium’s Tobias Böcker (translation), “...regardless of the (Ives) title, the listening time/music of the CD allows for big band jazz with a very happy, non-pedantic vitality, with great clarity and open musicality.” [...] While the vast majority or reactions were very positive, the music and media critic Tom Hull found {{the recording}} lacking, “big band Charles Ives, postmodern but third stream only in that it could use some swing.” ...|$|R

Isabel and himself remained the year round in Wales, and the first dawnings of education received by Lord Lumley were those he acquired conjointly with Francis from {{the care of the}} latter's father. They formed, with the interval of the time spent by Mr. Denbigh and Lady Pendennyss in town in winter, but one family. To the gentleman, the attachment of the grateful Ives was as strong as it was lasting.

5000|$|Ives is {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "the" [...] inventor of [...] "the" [...] halftone process, but this is incorrect and <b>Ives</b> <b>never</b> made such a claim for himself. There was not one halftone process, but a considerable number of them, the earliest dating nearly {{as far back as the}} introduction of practical photography in 1839. They varied widely in their degree of practicality and the quality of their results. The first attempts involved directly etching the unique images formed on metallic Daguerreotype plates. Although pleasing results were obtained, etching the plates required great skill and care, the images could not be printed along with ordinary type, and the delicate plates wore out after a very small number of impressions, making such processes useless for publishing on a commercial scale. More practical processes started appearing in the 1860s, but high cost, special printing requirements or low image quality variously kept these early processes from coming into widespread use.|$|R

5000|$|Coolidge had a {{reputation}} for promoting [...] "difficult" [...] modern music (though she declined to support one of the most modern of all composers, Charles <b>Ives).</b> But she <b>never</b> aimed at such {{a reputation}} and explained her preferences in music as follows: [...] "My plea for modern music is not that we should like it, nor necessarily that we should even understand it, but that we should exhibit it as a significant human document." [...] Though American herself, she had no national preferences, and in fact most of her commissions went to European composers. She didn't have any urge to specifically promote women composers, either.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1995 One of {{the most}} durable of the myths {{surrounding}} Charles Ives and his music is the myth of his isolation. But, {{while it is true}} that <b>Ives</b> was <b>never</b> closely associated with any single group of professional musicians during his active life as a composer, his highly successful insurance work, his spontaneous responses to important local, regional, and national issues, and most importantly his music provide overwhelming evidence that Ives actively sought out and participated in a wider culture. Ives's music shows a person directly involved with ideas that were of interest to vast numbers of Americans [...] not only composers, artists, writers, philosophers, and historians, but also "everyman. "Ives sought to devise an artistic expression that would embody the range of his involvement in his culture and convey his distinctive sense of America. He created a music that responded in two very distinct ways. The first was by quoting tunes [...] melodies and rhythms [...] that had long been associated with the culture of the Northeast in the nineteenth century. In doing so, Ives spoke to many people who were familiar with such references. Yet to touch a larger audience [...] one that might, as a result of time or distance, have no personal experience with those beloved musical memories [...] Ives had to refer to something more enduring, something more permanent, something that would transcend time and space. A second, more integral response was necessary. Ives found this enduring reference in the American place. He found an unmistakable way to identify a piece of music as being about America that was not as susceptible to fleeting memory as a melody: a way to call attention to the bountiful nation about which he felt so passionately. And Ives was passionate about America. Ives's use of place in his music reveals a web of personal and historical interconnections that "place" him directly in the mainstream of American culture. Using five "place pieces," this study will examine Ives's active involvement in numerous facets of American culture...|$|R
40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community onlyAs solo vocal repertoire continues to develop with current trends, institutional settings, including the private studio, continue to gravitate toward standard art songs and arias {{familiar to the}} classical-western tradition. In a rapidly changing world, {{it is important for}} 21 st century studio teachers to realize the need to connect with students on a global platform rather than focus solely on an established curriculum. As a modem educator and performer, it is important to make connections between the cross-disciplinary relationships of history, domestic/foreign affairs, politics, civil rights, racism, patriotism, social injustice, peace, and socialism through music. War-related repertoire challenges students, teachers, and performers to think beyond the confines of standard repertoire and fosters universal connections. Even with the cross-disciplinary benefits war-related music has to offer, this genre continues to be overlooked in studio teaching. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to introduce select classically oriented war-related repertoire, which reflects various war perspectives. Each chapter includes concise historical infonnation concerning the specific war, poet, and composer of the work under review. Equally important is the inclusion of selected musical analyses, interpretive textual guidelines, and a discussion of vocal aspects that pemlit the singer to more fully comprehend the emotional and musical possibilities of the piece. Additionally, suggested songs for further study and sample war-related vocal recital programs are presented as appendices. The culmination of these efforts manifests itself into a study of thirteen pieces for singers representing the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War.
