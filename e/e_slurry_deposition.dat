40|$|The {{behaviour}} of cohesionless soils {{is known}} to be influenced by the method of reconstitution. It is generally accepted in the literature that different reconstitution methods produce samples of varying fabric and thus samples of varying behaviour. Very little evidence has been presented to validate this statement. The main aim of this is thesis is firstly to observe the fabric of in situ and reconstituted gold tailings samples and secondly to investigate the difference in behaviour between these samples at the same state. The investigation focused on testing in situ and reconstituted gold tailings samples obtained from 3 positions on a tailings dam; pond, middle beach and upper beach. Laboratory reconstitution methods included moist tamping and <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition.</b> Fabric analysis involved the use of SEM images to classify the observed differences in the fabric of the undisturbed and reconstituted gold tailings samples. A particle interaction model based on the observed fabric was postulated to explain the differences or similarities in behaviour. The scope of behaviour investigated included sedimentation, collapse and swell, consolidation and compressibility, creep, stiffness and shear behaviour. The fabric analysis indicates that differences in the fabric of undisturbed and reconstituted gold tailings samples are visible. Moist tamping produces an aggregated fabric while <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> yields a homogeneous fabric {{similar to that of the}} undisturbed samples. Comparison of behaviour indicates that neither moist tamping nor <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> can replicate the behaviour of the undisturbed sample fully. Consolidation and compression is a function of the fabric while friction angle is independent of the fabric. Available shear strength and liquifaction potential is also affected by the preparation method and the resulting fabric. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

The acoustic matching layer can be designed to achieve higher acoustic energy transmission and operating bandwidth. Also included in this paper are a theoretical analysis of the device design and a micromachining technique to produce the novel transducer. Based on a design of a lead titanium zirconium (PZT) micropillar array, the constructed gradient acoustic matching layer has much better acoustic transmission efficiency within a 20 – 50 MHz operation range compared to a matching layer with a conventional quarter-wavelength thickness Parylene deposition. To construct the transducer, periodic microcavities are built on a flexible copper sheet, and then the sheet forms a designed curvature with a ball shaping.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Different {{specimen}} {{preparation methods}} such as moist tamping, dry funnel <b>deposition,</b> <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition,</b> dry air pluviation {{have been reported in}} the literature to investigate the undrained behavior of silty sands. Similarly, different means have been used to densify the soils prepared with such methods. However, the influence of the densification technique, utilized within a particular deposition method, on undrained behavior (e. g. change in initial peak deviator stress and instability angle) was not known. Therefore, a new densification technique is developed for the dry funnel deposition method, which avoids tamping, vibrating or mold tapping. This new method of densification is thought to create a much consistent soil fabric for different amounts of densification than other specimen densification techniques. The experimental results show that the change in undrained behavior with increasing density produced by densification is much less pronounced when compared to the other densification methods reported in the literature. Prior research efforts regarding the effect of non plastic silts on the liquefaction behavior of sands mainly focused on the influence of fines content, confining stress, and depositional techniques. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the influence of fines content on the undrained behavior of silty sands. Strain-controlled monotonic undrained triaxial compression tests were performed on a single base sand mixed with three different essentially nonplastic silts. First, silt size effects are investigated while other factors like fines content (20...|$|R

Chemical analyses of the soils revealed no differences between organic amendments, whereas significant differences were present between fields in all C, N and pH values.

Diversity and evenness values of the microbial communities, studied by PCR-DGGEs specific for bacteria, fungi, Pseudomonas and ammonia-oxidizing beta-proteobacteria, revealed different patterns, i. e. no differences between organic amendments, but clear differences between fields. Multivariate analyses done on individual species of the four groups, as represented by band location and size in PCR-DGGE fingerprints, and by inclusion of chemical and R. solani AG 2 - 2 IIIB growth parameters as `environmental' variables, revealed strong and occasionally significant effects of organic matter content, water-dissolvable organic carbon and pH on microbial communities.

Design/methodology/approach: The high temperature cyclic oxidation tests were carried out in 23 h cycles at constant temperature 1100 °C using Carbolite CWF 1300 chamber furnace. The samples were removed outside and were weighted after each cycle. The microstructure investigations {{of all kinds of}} the coatings were conducted by the use of light microscope (Nikon Epiphot 300) and a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S- 3400 N). In the analysis influence of each method have been taken into consideration, i. e. especially influence of the kind of process on microstructure, coating thickness, chemical composition, first of all aluminium content (in outer ȕ-NiAl layer so-called additive layer, diffusion layer and substrate). For the chemical composition examination x-ray energy dispersive (EDS) method was applied using Thermo equipment. Findings: It was found that the best high cyclic oxidation resistance of coating was obtained using CVD method (the maximal increase of samples weight after 28 th cycle was observed, whereas in case of the slurry sample after 3 rd and VPA after 5 th).

These uncertainties are partly method related, i. e. until now only two C sources in released CO 2 could be identified. We used a novel approach separating three carbon (C) sources in CO 2 efflux from soil. The approach is based on combination of different substances originated from C 3 or C 4 plants in different treatments and identical transformation of substances like C 3 sugar (from sugar beet) and C 4 sugar (from sugar cane). We investigated {{the influence of the}} addition of two substances having different microbial utilizability, i. <b>e.</b> <b>slurry</b> and sugar on the SOM or/and slurry decomposition in two grassland soils with different levels of Corg (2. 3 vs. 5. 1 % C). Application of slurry to the soil slightly accelerated the SOM decomposition. Addition of sugar lead to changes of SOM and slurry decomposition clearly characterized by two phases: immediately after sugar addition, the microorganisms switched from the decomposition of hardly utilizable SOM to the decomposition of easily utilizable sugar. This first phase was very short (2 ? 3 days), hence was frequently missed in other experiments. The second phase showed a slightly increased slurry and SOM decomposition (compared to the soil without sugar). The separation of three sources in CO 2 efflux from grassland soils allowed us to conclude that the C will be utilized according to its utilizability: sugar>slurry>SOM. Additionally, decomposition of more inert C (here SOM) during the period of intensive sugar decomposition was strongly reduced (negative priming effect). We conclude that, priming effects involve a chain of mechanisms: (i) preferential substrate utilization, (ii) activation of microbial biomass by easily utilizable substrate (iii) subsequent increased utilization of following substrates according to their utilizability, and (iv) decline to initial state.

40|$|In {{dredging}} works, fines are {{encountered in}} different ways. Fines {{can be produced}} during the cutting of rocks or {{can be found in}} natural deposited sand. The presence of fines in sand soil is generally recognized as problem in geotechnical engineering. It is believed that fines in a sand increases soil compressibility and tendency to creep. Also it is often assumed that the strength, stiffness, hydraulic conductivity and liquefaction potential of a soil increases with increasing fines content. Therefore, during tender phase of reclamation works, it is always recommended that the soil should contain minimum amount of fines 10 % of fines. It has been recognized that the availability of soils which have small amount of 10 % of fines is very rare. In most of projects soil with maximum amount of fines above 10 % are encountered. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the mechanical behavior of sand soil with different amount of fines. The main interest is on the compressibility of sandy soils. The compressibility of sandy soil is investigated and their results are shown. A series of oedometer test for saturated silt sand mixtures is presented. During testing the following material were used River Maas sand and crushed sand, artificial silt (crushed quartz) and Belgium silt. The mixture were created by mixing River Maas sand and crushed sand with either artificial silt or Belgium silt as percentage of dry mass. Sand silt mixtures with fines contents of 7 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, and 50 %. The samples were prepared in different initial relative densities using <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition</b> methods. In oedometer the mixtures were loaded in interval of 3. 5, 6. 9, 13. 9, 34. 6, 69. 8, 138. 5, 277. 1, 554. 2 and 1108. 3 kPa. Result shows that, the coefficient of consolidation of sand silt mixture increases with fines content from 7 % and reaches the peak value at 15 % then the coefficient of consolidation decreases with increase of fines contents. The compression index of silt sand mixtures decreases with increase on fines contents from 7 % to 30 % and then increases with increase of fines contents. The value of compression index for fines contents of 15 to 30 % is low due to its highest packing density. The secondary compression on artificial silt sand mixture is very low it is between 0. 001 - 0. 004 but for Belgium silt sand the secondary compression is significantly higher. The difference in secondary compression is due to their difference in mineralogical composition and grain size and shape. It can be conclude that the presence of fines on sand does not increase the compression and secondary compression of the sand but it is improving it. Therefore for mixtures with fines content above 10 % between 15 to 35 % are useful for reclamation activities because of their low primary compression and low secondary compression.

40|$|The {{profile of}} a delta formed by {{fine-grained}} mineral processing wastes, disposed of as aqueous <b>slurries</b> by subaerial <b>deposition</b> from a pipeline, has a significant bearing on the volume that is available for waste and water storage in a given containment structure. Earlier field data and laboratory experiments suggested that mine waste delta profiles could be predicted with good accuracy using data from small-scale laboratory deposition tests. The relationships between the profiles of full-size and laboratory-model deltas are analysed using the principles of kinematic similarity and a recent theory of delta formation based on engineering hydraulics. Measured profiles of full-size and model coal-mine tailings deltas are compared and the prediction of full-size profiles is discussed. It is shown that the data derived from laboratory-model deltas are insufficient to enable accurate prediction of full-size delta profiles. Initial slope data or other, equivalent data for the full-size delta are also required...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of the behaviour of newly deposited soil is important because of its direct applications in fields such as harbour siltation and storage of dredge slurries. In coastal regions the dominant mode for deposition of fine-grained cohesive material is through flocculation- the electrostatic aggregation of mud particles. The present study focuses on the measurement of both flocculation conditions and bed properties, towards the {{understanding of}} the influence of the former on the latter. A computerised laboratory setup, complete from sedimentation and flocculation to the long term consolidation allows each of these processes to be observed in instrumented perspex columns without the many variables present in an estuary. The bed deposition rates resemble those found in natural estuaries, and therefore this technique is a much improved method for examining natural processes than the method of <b>slurry</b> <b>deposition,</b> which is normally employed in soil mechanics. An image acquisition and analysis system has been designed specifically for this work. Image sequences are analysed in real time to give information about the dimensions and concentration of the particles, and the particle velocities. Floc sizes increase as the particle concentration increases in the column. Increasing the concentration further leads to an overall hindering of the sedimentation rate and breakup of the flocs. Images of beds formed through slow sedimentation clearly show aggregate features that are not present in slurry experiments. From low to medium sedimentation rates the bed height, normalised by the mass of sediment in the bed, increases. From medium to high rates of sedimentation, however, the normalised bed heights decrease. Overall slurry experiments have lower bed heights than slowly deposited experiments. Image analysis of the bed surface (top 0. 5 mm) has revealed that aggregates which are present immediately after deposition are broken down over tens of hours. The ISIS instrument has been modified to gather information about the resistance to erosion of the beds. A bed is more easily eroded after it has had a long period of consolidation. X-ray density measurements and imaging techniques are used to link the strength of the bed to biological factors. X-ray bulk density and pore pressure measurements allow calculations of void ratio, porosity, and effective stress. Bender element apparatus has been constructed to measure shear stiffness of the soil, and bed strength measurements are made using a shear vane. It is found that variations in the sedimentation conditions have significant effects on bed density and on void ratio. These effects continue to be visible in the consolidated bed, even after an order of magnitude increase in the total vertical bed stress (equivalent to the range of metres of overburden pressure). The variations in the bed structure can have profound effects on bed strength. Methods to compare floc measurements to bed measurements are complicated by the inherent variation in floc data. Possible techniques include the use of solids volume fraction, fractal dimension and intrinsic sediment properties. The usefulness of each of these is assessed. It is suggested that it is the frequency at which the bed is bombarded by flocs, and not the properties of the flocs themselves, that largely determines the bed properties.

40|$|The {{following}} {{equipment is}} commonly used to mix fluids: mechanical agitators, jets (pumps), shrouded axial impeller mixers (Flygt mixers), spargers, pulsed jet mixers, boiling, static mixers, falling films, liquid sprays, and thermal convection. This discussion will focus on mechanical agitators, jets, shrouded axial impeller mixers, spargers, and pulsed jet mixers, as these devices {{are most likely to}} be employed in Savannah River Site (SRS) Closure Business applications. In addressing mixing problems in the SRS Tank Farm, one must distinguish between different mixing objectives. These objectives include sludge mixing (e. g., Extended Sludge Processing), sludge retrieval (e. g., sludge transfers between tanks), heel retrieval (e. g., Tanks 18 F and 19 F), chemical reactions (e. g., oxalic acid neutralization) and salt dissolution. For example, one should not apply sludge mixing guidelines to heel removal applications. Mixing effectiveness is a function of both the mixing device (<b>e.</b> g., <b>slurry</b> pump, agitator, air sparger) and the properties of the material to be mixed (e. g., yield stress, viscosity, density, and particle size). The objective of this document is to provide background mixing knowledge for the SRS Closure Business Unit personnel and to provide general recommendations for mixing in SRS applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of different fertilization treatments on soil biological characteristics and microbial community structure was investigated. Soil samples {{were taken from}} a long-term field experiment which was conducted to explore the effect of eight treatments: control (non-fertilized), NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium), FYM (farmyard manure), FYM + NPK, CSl + St (cattle slurry + straw), CSl + St + NPK, CSl, CSl + NPK. The highest values of invertase activity were found in treatment fertilized with farmyard manure combined mineral fertilizers, similarly to total N content, activity of urease, and C of microbial biomass. Dehydrogenase activity was lower in all treatments with mineral fertilization. Bacterial and actinobacterial T-RFLP profiles of 16 S rRNA genes showed similar patterns in response to eight fertilization treatments. In both, the communities formed distinct groups, which were separated by organic fertilization i. <b>e.</b> cattle <b>slurry</b> and straw amendments along the x axes and by NPK amendments along the y axes using the Sammon’s method of multidimensional scaling. Significant correlations were determined in several situations related to diversity: between invertase and 1 /Db (dominance, bacteria), 1 /Da (dominance, actinobacteria) and between T-RFLP profiles of actinobacteria, nitrogen and organic carbon content and bacterial E (evenness) ...|$|R
40|$|Short-range impacts to {{sensitive}} ecosystems as {{a result}} of ammonia emitted by livestock farms are often assessed using atmospheric dispersion modelling systems such as AERMOD. These assessments evaluate mean annual atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and nitrogen deposition rates at the ecosystem location for comparison with ecosystem damage thresholds. However, predictions of mean annual atmospheric concentrations can be dominated by periods of stable night-time conditions, which can contribute significantly to mean concentrations. AERMOD has been demonstrated to overestimate concentrations in certain stable low-wind conditions and so the model could potentially overestimate the short-range impacts of livestock ammonia emissions. This paper tests several modifications to the parameterisation of AERMOD (v 12345) that aim to improve model predictions in low-wind conditions. The modifications are first described and then are applied to three pig farm case studies in the USA, Denmark and Spain to assess whether the modifications improve long-term mean ammonia concentration predictions through improved model performance. For these three case studies, most of the modifications tested improved model performance {{as a result}} of reducing the long-term mean concentration predictions, with the largest effect for low- or ground-level sources (<b>e.</b> g. <b>slurry</b> lagoons or naturally ventilated housing) ...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} (LCA) and simulation modelling (SM) {{has been used}} to assess and improve a collective manure management plan set up in Brittany (north-western France) by a group of farmers to comply with current Nitrogen reduction regulations in agriculture. The plan studied aimed at organizing the spreading of slurry surpluses produced by 11 pig farms (representing 57. 6 tons N/year) on crop land loaned by 22 crop farms located approximately 44 km away. LCA was used according to its normalized methodology to statically assess the potential environmental impacts based on 4 criteria: eutrophication, climate change, acidification and use of non-renewable energy. COMET, the dynamic systems model used in this study, has been implemented with the Vensim® software by coupling: logistics models, to simulate the transportation and spreading of manure, both at the individual (within farms) and collective (transfer plan) levels; biophysical models, mainly empirical, to simulate ammonia (NH 3) and methane (CH 4) emissions as the main criteria of the environmental evaluation with COMET. The approach encompassed four steps that alternated between the LCA and SM methodologies: (i) LCA was initially performed to assess the environmental impacts of two disposal scenarios, i. <b>e.</b> <b>slurry</b> biological treatment or transfer for application to remote crop farms. The analysis concluded the transfer scenario had the least environmental impact as, if properly implemented, it may save on the use of chemical fertilizers. (ii) SM using the COMET model simulated the logistics and agricultural feasibility of the transfer scenario to verify to what extent the collective management plan can be fully completed in due time on appropriate cropping systems. (iii) A second iteration of LCA was made to assess the environmental impacts of simulated variants of the transfer scenario, this time using simulation outputs instead of reference database information. These analyses showed important differences of impacts among the management options simulated. (iv) Finally, simulations with COMET were performed to examine the interaction between the individual level of management (manure spreading within animal farms) and the collective level (manure transfer plan to land loaners' crop farms). The variability of impacts between individual situations was very high, suggesting that farmer equipment should be adapted and collective rules made flexible to secure farm stock management. Beyond the results from the first three steps, this paper emphasises the more realistic outcomes achieved in the fourth and final step. This step allowed the variability of individual pig farm logistics and gas emissions to be analyzed, as well as simple techniques, that could be implemented by individual farmers to improve the whole system agricultural and environmental performance, to be checked. This paper concludes that benefits can be drawn from combining LCA and SM, as this makes possible to consider the diversity of actual farming situations and practices and, so, to design management rules balancing individual and collective needs...|$|R
