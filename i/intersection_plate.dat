30|$|The {{thickness}} of the overriding Tohoku arc crust under the Miyagi-Oki region is approximately 20 km, and the plate boundary meets the Moho (crust-mantle boundary) of the overriding crust at this depth. The location of the mainshock hypocenter almost coincides {{with that of the}} <b>intersection</b> of the <b>plate</b> boundary and the Moho. Since the activity of the foreshocks was significantly different on the trenchward and landward sides of the hypocenter of the mainshock, the difference can be interpreted in terms of the differences in the structure above the plate boundary. On the trenchward side of the mainshock hypocenter, where most of the foreshocks occurred, the shallow dipping subducting Pacific slab contacts the continental crustal layer (slab-crust contact zone). In contrast, no significant foreshocks were observed in the landward side of the mainshock hypocenter, where the Pacific slab contacts the forearc mantle (slab-mantle contact zone).|$|R

30|$|We {{relocated}} hypocenters of the foreshock, mainshock, and aftershocks of the 2011 off the Pacific {{coast of}} Tohoku earthquake (M 9.0) {{in the middle}} part of the Japan Trench where the earthquake rupture initiated. Ocean Bottom Seismographs (OBSs), deployed in the area, recorded the earthquakes and these data provide improved images of the hypocenter distribution. The mainshock hypocenter was relocated slightly westward from that reported by Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), placing it near the <b>intersection</b> between the <b>plate</b> boundary and the Moho of the overriding plate. The foreshock seismicity mainly occurred on the trenchward side of the mainshock hypocenter, where the Pacific slab contacts the island arc crust. The foreshocks were initially activated at the up-dip limit of the seismogenic zone ~ 30 km trenchward of the largest foreshock (M 7.3, {{two days before the}} mainshock). After the M- 7.3 earthquake, intense interplate seismicity, accompanied by epicenters migrating toward the mainshock hypocenter, was observed. The focal depth distribution changed significantly in response to the M- 9 mainshock. Earthquakes along the plate boundary were almost non-existent in the area of huge coseismic slip, whereas earthquakes off the boundary increased in numbers in both the upper and the lower plates.|$|R

Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems should provide up-to-date information about the actual condition, as well predict the structural life and required maintenance of the assets for more cost effective and reliable operation in future. Fatigue is regarded as a governing degradation mechanism in bridge decks. This paper presents the results of fatigue tests carried out on a representative test structure in the lab environment. The work is part of an ongoing research project to demonstrate the benefits of adaptive and scalable network technologies for SHM of orthotropic bridge decks. Fatigue cracks initiated and propagated in the root of the welded connections at the <b>intersection</b> of deck <b>plate</b> and open stiffeners at the crossbeam. The modeled crack growth adequately matched the measured crack growth. Acoustic emission (AE) sensors could identify crack activity at hot spot locations in an early stage of crack growth. This is of main importance for monitoring fatigue cracks at hot spot locations at which strain gauges cannot be effectively applied, such as at the weld root of deck plate cracks...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{intensity}} factors (SIFs) {{at the end}} points of flaws emanating from the corner formed by the <b>intersection</b> of a <b>plate</b> with a hole were determined using stress freezing photoelasticity and a numerical technique known as the Taylor series correction method to extract the SIF values from the photoelastic data. The geometries studied were crack depth to thickness ratios of about 0. 2, 0. 5, and 0. 75; crack depth to crack length ratios of about 1. 0 to 2. 0; and crack length to hole radius ratios of about 0. 5 to 2. 0. The SIFs were determined {{at the intersection of}} the flaw border with the plate surface (KS) and with the edge of the hole (KH). It is shown that extension of a crack emanating from a corner of intersection of a hole with a plate under monotonically increasing load is not self-similar and that as the flaw depth increases, KH decreases and KS increases. Existing theories and design criteria significantly overestimate the SIF at both the hole and the surface except for shallow flaws at the hole and deep flaws at the surface...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{analysis}} of the spine in autopsy cases with renal osteodystrophy. The spinal column was removed from nine autopsy cases with chronic maintenance dialysis and sectioned in the sagittal plane to a thickness of 1 millimeter using a surface-stained block grinding technique. A combination of two- and three-dimensional analysis included {{an evaluation of the}} spine deformity index (SDI), the bone volume (BV/TV), the trabecular interconnection (TBPf), the trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), the trabecular number (Tb. N) as well as a qualitative investigation of the structure of cancellous bone. The control group consisted of 26 autopsy cases with intact skeletons. An iliac crest biopsy made a direct comparison of the diagnostic biopsy location and the spinal column possible. The SDI showed vertebral fractures in renal osteodystrophy (ROD) of types I and II, in spite of a trabecular bone volume within normal limits. The trabecular bone volume showed mean values and a distribution throughout the spinal column familiar in the skeletally-intact control group. Those cases with a longer history of hemodialysis showed higher BV/TV values regardless of age and sex. A trabecular volume within normal limits did not mean physiological trabecular interconnection. Perforations were commonly observed with ROD. Classical, hidden and tunnelling perforations were distinguished. Microcallus formations were frequently seen in the periphery of vertebrae at rod nodes, rods and <b>plate</b> <b>intersections.</b> Three-dimensional analysis in ROD shows a greater alteration in architecture than can be assumed from the two-dimensional histological sections...|$|R
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} approach aiming at prediction of {{the probability of}} excessive leakage through degraded steam generator (SG) tubes is proposed in the paper. The excessive leakage is assumed to occur during postulated hypothetical accidental conditions when {{the sum of all}} individual leak rates through degraded tubes exceeds the predefined acceptable value. The leak rates through the individual defects were evaluated using models developed by EPRI for assessment of Outside Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking (ODSCC) at the tube support <b>plate</b> <b>intersections.</b> Additionally, a brief description of procedures which are used in the field to obtain conservative estimates of the total leak rate during accidental conditions is given. The conservativity of those methods is quantified through failure probability in the numerical examples. Two numerical examples are provided. They are based on inspection data obtained from Slovene and Belgian plants with 3 / 4 inch tubes made of Inconel 600 M. A. The numerical examples analyze the behavior of the model for both small ( 10 V). The discussion of results includes: • prediction and discussion of the probability of excessive leakage; • the conservativity of approximate summation procedures used in the field to obtain conservative estimates of the total leak rate during accidental conditions; some comments on the sensitivity of the probability of excessive leakage to the major uncertainties inherent to data and models used. As a conclusion, some suggestions to improve both the efficiency of the numerical procedures and models used to estimate the leak rates through individual defects are given.

30|$|Generally, various {{geophysical}} mechanisms {{can potentially}} affect interplate coupling beneath the forearc mantle wedge. Thermal and crustal structure studies in various subduction zones {{have shown that}} the downdip limit of the seismically coupled zone is related to temperature or to the depth of the hydrated forearc mantle wedge (Zhang and Schwartz, 1992; Tichelaar and Ruff, 1993; Hyndman et al., 1997). In warm subduction zones such as those in southwestern Japan and Cascadia, where a young, hot oceanic plate is subducting beneath a forearc, the downdip limit of large interplate earthquakes corresponds well to the depth at which the temperature reaches about 350 °C, which corresponds to the temperature at which thermally-activated stable sliding behavior occurs in crustal rocks (e.g., Tse and Rice, 1986; Blanpied et al., 1991, 1995). In old, cool subduction zones, such as those in northern Chile and Alaska, the downdip limit of interplate earthquakes is much shallower than the depth at which the temperature of 350 °Cis observed, but approximately corresponds to the <b>intersection</b> of the <b>plate</b> interface with the forearc Moho (e.g. Oleskevich et al., 1999). Hyndman and Peacock (2003) pointed out that because dry mantle rocks should be much stronger than crustal rocks, interplate earthquakes would be expected to occur at a considerable depth beneath a dry forearc mantle wedge. In contrast, a wet forearc mantle wedge, which contains a high percentage of aseismic hydrous minerals, such as serpentine and talc, should exhibit stable sliding behavior (Hyndman and Peacock, 2003). They therefore suggested that the downdip limit in these cool subduction zones could be explained by a high degree of hydration within the fore-arc mantle wedge.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} an {{approach}} for multi-scale numerical analysis on structural dynamic response and local damage in long-span bridges. The strategies of finite element modeling of long-span bridges for multi-scale numerical analysis was first investigated. A multi-scale model of the Tsing Ma Bridge (TMB) was then developed based on the design drawings and proposed strategies for multi-scale modeling. The procedures for multi-scale numerical analysis on the dynamic response and local damage are proposed, in which local deterioration processes at welded details of interconnects are able {{to account for the}} major effect of the damage and nonlinear influence on structural response. The multi-scale computations are implemented based on the software ABAQUS and the developed programs via the user interface provided by the software for the purpose of easier application to large civil structures. The accuracy of the calculated procedures is addressed with two smaller controlled examples before the approach {{can be applied to the}} Tsing Ma Bridge. Based on the online monitoring data acquired from the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system installed on TMB, the global dynamic response of the bridge and local damage accumulation of two typical weld details in the longitudinal truss of TMB under traffic loading are numerically analyzed by using the developed model and computational procedures. The maximum value of the accumulated damage is found on the toe of the weld of the upper and/or bottom chords with the diagonal and gusset <b>plate</b> <b>intersection.</b> The fatigue life obtained from the fully coupled calculation is smaller than that from the uncoupled computation, which suggests that the significant interaction between the damage and the structural response should be considered in the structural damage analyses using the multi-scale numerical computation...|$|R
60|$|XXVIII. There was, however, in {{this kind}} of involution, much to be admired as well as reprehended, the {{proportions}} of quantities were always as beautiful as they were intricate; and, though the lines of intersection were harsh, they were exquisitely opposed to the flower-work of the interposing mouldings. But the fancy did not stop here; it rose from the bases into the arches; and there, not finding room enough for its exhibition, it withdrew the capitals from the heads even of cylindrical shafts, (we cannot but admire, while we regret, the boldness of the men who could defy the authority and custom of all the nations of the earth for a space of some three thousand years,) in order that the arch mouldings might appear to emerge from the pillar, as at its base they had been lost in it, and not to terminate on the abacus of the capital; then they ran the mouldings across and through each other, at the point of the arch; and finally, not finding their natural directions enough to furnish as many occasions of intersection as they wished, bent them hither and thither, and cut off their ends short, when they had passed the point of <b>intersection.</b> Fig. 2, <b>Plate</b> IV. is part of a flying buttress from the apse of St. Gervais at Falaise, in which the moulding whose section is rudely given above at [=f], (taken vertically through the point f,) is carried thrice through itself, in the cross-bar and two arches; and the flat fillet is cut off sharp {{at the end of the}} cross-bar, for the mere pleasure of the truncation. Fig. 3 is half of the head of a door in the Stadthaus of Sursee, in which the shaded part of the section of the joint g g, is that of the arch-moulding, which is three times reduplicated, and six times intersected by itself, the ends being cut off when they become unmanageable. This style is, indeed, earlier exaggerated in Switzerland and Germany, owing to the imitation in stone of the dovetailing of wood, particularly of the intersecting of beams at the angles of châlets; but it only furnishes the more plain instance of the danger of the fallacious system which, from the beginning, repressed the German, and, in the end, ruined the French Gothic. It would be too painful a task to follow further the caricatures of form, and eccentricities of treatment, which grow out of this singular abuse--the flattened arch, the shrunken pillar, the lifeless ornament, the liny moulding, the distorted and extravagant foliation, until the time came when, over these wrecks and remnants, deprived of all unity and principle, rose the foul torrent of the renaissance, and swept them all away. So fell the great dynasty of mediæval architecture. It was because it had lost its own strength, and disobeyed its own laws--because its order, and consistency, and organization, had been broken through--that it could oppose no resistance to the rush of overwhelming innovation. And this, observe, all because it had sacrificed a single truth. From that one surrender of its integrity, from that one endeavor to assume the semblance of what it was not, arose the multitudinous forms of disease and decrepitude, which rotted away the pillars of its supremacy. It was not because its time was come; it was not because it was scorned by the classical Romanist, or dreaded by the faithful Protestant. That scorn and that fear it might have survived, and lived; it would have stood forth in stern comparison with the enervated sensuality of the renaissance; it would have risen in renewed and purified honor, and with a new soul, from the ashes into which it sank, giving up its glory, as it had received it, for the honor of God--but its own truth was gone, and it sank forever. There was no wisdom nor strength left in it, to raise it from the dust; and the error of zeal, and the softness of luxury smote it down and dissolved it away. It is good for us to remember this, as we tread upon the bare ground of its foundations, and stumble over its scattered stones. Those rent skeletons of pierced wall, through which our sea-winds moan and murmur, strewing them joint by joint, and bone by bone, along the bleak promontories on which the Pharos lights came once from houses of prayer--those grey arches and quiet isles under which the sheep of our valleys feed and rest on the turf that has buried their altars--those shapeless heaps, that are not of the Earth, which lift our fields into strange and sudden banks of flowers, and stay our mountain streams with stones that are not their own, have other thoughts to ask from us than those of mourning for the rage that despoiled, or the fear that forsook them. It was not the robber, not the fanatic, not the blasphemer, who sealed the destruction that they had wrought; the war, the wrath, the terror, might have worked their worst, and the strong walls would have risen, and the slight pillars would have started again, from under the hand of the destroyer. But they could not rise out of the ruins of their own violated truth.|$|R
