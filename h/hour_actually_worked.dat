30|$|Working time {{measurement}} has a long tradition at the IAB: Already in 1969 a differentiated approach {{was developed to}} record yearly <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> per employed person and the labour volume. The development of the AZR occurred against the background that the statistical recording of actual working hours was initially far from satisfactory. Only statistical fragments of varying quality and definition were available, {{which is one of}} the reasons why empirical analyses on diverse issues related to working time and the volume of work did not meet elementary requirements for a long time, and why shortcomings persist.|$|R
30|$|Measuring <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> in Germany {{and their}} single {{components}} is a complex task. This is mirrored by the AZR which we outlined in this article. The results cover time series on hours worked and {{the volume of}} work at an aggregate level, but also allows for discrimination along several criteria such as groups of employed persons and economic sectors. The componentwise approach which allows us to identify, among others, collective, calendar, personal and cyclical influences is a particularly effective and informative way of collecting and presenting statistical information on this topic.|$|R
40|$|This study uses nationally {{representative}} panel survey data for Australia {{to identify the}} role played by mismatches between <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> and working time preferences in contributing to reported levels of job and life satisfaction. Three main conclusions emerge. First, it is not the number of hours worked that matters for subjective well-being, but working time mismatch. Second, overemployment is a more serious problem than is underemployment. Third, while the magnitude of the impact of overemployment may seem small in absolute terms, relative to other variables, such as disability, the effect is quite large. ...|$|R
50|$|The similar {{concept of}} a man-day, man-week, man-month, or {{man-year}} is used on large projects. It {{is the amount of}} work performed by an average worker during one day, week, month, or year, respectively. The number of hours worked by an individual during a year varies greatly according to cultural norms and economics. The average annual <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> per person in employment as reported by OECD countries in 2007, for example, ranged from a minimum of 1,389 hours (in the Netherlands) to a maximum of 2,316 hours (in South Korea).|$|R
30|$|I use {{the data}} from the Ghana Standard of Living Survey (rounds 3 – 5) {{provided}} by the World Bank as part of the World Bank SHIP database. Using data from the labor/employment file for each of these rounds, I construct a log hourly wages variable as follows. First, I consider their last wage received from their primary jobs, given that the observation corresponds to employment in the manufacturing sector. I disregard observations for employent in non-manufacturing sectors. Then, I use information on the units of this observation to convert it to weekly wages. Finally, using the number of <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> per week, I convert this to hourly wages earned.|$|R
40|$|Deadlines and {{penalties}} {{are widely used}} to incentivize effort. We model how these incentive contracts affect the work rate and time taken in a procurement setting, characterizing the efficient contract design. Using new micro-level data on Minnesota highway construction contracts that includes day-by-day information on <b>work</b> plans, <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> and delays, we find evidence of moral hazard. As an application, we build an econometric model that endogenizes the work rate, and simulate how different incentive structures affect outcomes and the variance of contractor payments. Accounting for the traffic delays caused by construction, switching to a more efficient design would substantially increase welfare without substantially increasing the risk borne by contractors. ...|$|R
30|$|As another alternative, {{measurements}} of hours worked and volume of {{work can be}} derived directly from survey interviews. For most of the establishment surveys, however, the findings are limited to particular groups of persons or companies, questions relate to paid hours rather than actual hours worked, or interviews take place only infrequently. Also in household interviews, e.[*]g., labour force surveys, the questions to record <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> and not worked, respectively, are not sufficient to yield a solid overall figure. Besides typical problems with household surveys such as proxy interviewing or memory errors, questions on “hours <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> last week” or similar questioning may induce a systematic bias due to underreported occurrence of components such as holidays or sick leave which cause interviews not to take place. Likewise, multiple jobholding is underreported by survey participants as was found by Steward (2014) for U.S. data. Fleck (2009), who also discusses several other shortcomings of surveys when measuring hours worked, shows that, all in all, the hours worked series estimated directly from labour force surveys provide higher measures as compared to other concepts.|$|R
40|$|When {{employment}} increases, a corres-ponding rise {{in hours}} worked can usuallybe expected. And indeed, from 1976 to 2000, changes in employment were fairly accurately reflected in hours worked. However, since 2000, this relationship has greatly diminished (Chart A). From 2000 to 2004, employment rose 8. 1 %, {{compared with only}} 4. 3 % for overall hours worked. Such a differen-tial is unprecedented. The robust employment growth was surprising. Lower growth in hours seemed more consistent with reduced economic growth in Canada and the stagnation of employment in the United States. This contrast led some economists to question Cana-da’s exceptional employment record in recent years (RBC 2004). If employment is growing more rapidly than hours, then average hours per worker are declining. Accord-ing to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), average weekly <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> declined for three consecutive years— 2001, 2002 and 2003 —before rising slightly in 2004.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} household-level data on <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> by Japanese peasant {{families in}} the interwar period. As a preliminary analysis of a panel database for the 1931 - 41 period, currently being compiled under the auspice of Hitotsubashi's prewar Farm Household Survey micro-database project, the paper utilises data for 17 farm households from four prefectures, i. e. Ibaraki, Yamanashi, Osaka and Tokushima, focusing on proximate [...] rather than market and other economic [...] determinants of the hours worked by married women and by children. The {{most important of all}} factors considered in the paper is the working hours of the husband in the case of married women and those of the parent of the same sex in the case of unmarried children. It is demonstrated that the farm woman readily increased her supply of working hours whenever her husband had to work longer, thereby decreasing her hours spent for domestic tasks. Also shown is that the allocation of her work time was significantly influenced by alternating stages of the family life cycle, shaped under household formation rules of Japan's stem family system. 本論文では，両大戦間期の農家世帯内における労働時間の配分がどのようになされていたかを検討する．この予備的考察のために利用するのは，一橋大学の戦前期農家経済調査個票データベース・プロジェクトで作成中の， 1931 - 41 年の 11 年間を対象としたパネルデータの一部で，茨城・山梨・大阪・徳島の 4 府県における調査対象世帯 17 家族である．本稿は市場要因などに焦点をあてた経済学的な分析ではなく，農家世帯に特有の近接要因の分析に限定する．それらの要因のなかでもっとも重要であったのは，既婚女性であれば夫の，未婚の子供であれば父親または母親の労働時間であった．農家女性は，夫がより長時間働かなければならない状況となれば同じ割合で労働時間を増加させ，それに伴って家事にあてる時間を減少させていたのである．また，彼女らの労働時間供給行動には，日本の直系家族型家族周期の影響が有意にみられたことも明らかとなった...|$|R

This study contributes to prior research examining how the quality of work is affected by the economic crisis. Using data from the Spanish Labor Force Survey from 2005 to 2014, it tests three possible competing predictions for trends in working hour mismatches during the economic downturn. The study reveals that the level of mismatches has increased significantly with the economic recession due to the growing number of people who would wish to work more <b>hours</b> than they <b>actually</b> do. Findings show that the increase in hour mismatches has been particularly striking among workers employed under fixed term contracts, part-time contracts, those in low-status occupations and women.

40|$|The thesis {{draws on}} {{official}} statistics to examine comparative historical {{developments in the}} humanization of work in manufacturing industry, engaging with vital debates on societal distinctiveness. The empirical analysis spans the manufacturing sectors of eleven of the leading industrialised nations over the period 1960 - 95. This substantive core of the thesis is informed by an examination of research method {{in the field of}} employment relations. Initial assessment of the availability and construct validity to aggregate statistical indicators of the humanization of work results in consideration of three phenomena; the rate of incidence of fatal injuries, average annual <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked,</b> and the relative extent of managerial hierarchy. Detailed assessment of the conceptual basis of the available statistics then follows, with the aim of obtaining historically consistent and cross-nationally comparable data on these aspects of work humanization. Although dependable data on fatalities and hours are derived, the limits of the aggregate indicator of managerial hierarchy are ultimately stressed. The comparative historical patterns in the data are then examined for evidence of cross-national convergence in experiences of work humanization. With little indication of any historic convergence apparent the analysis turns to consider the forces which may shape distinctive societal experiences. Quantitative gauges of the shape of the broad political economy are assembled, with a particular attention focused on the quantitative characterisation of the power resources of employees, whether collective or individual. The meaning of these necessarily crude indicators is given extensive consideration. The thesis culminates in separate panel econometric investigations of the political economic characteristics associated with comparative fatal injury incidence and actual annual hours of work. Substantial evidence is presented that the humanization of work is associated with an attenuation of the vulnerability of employees to managerial prerogative...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Under{{reporting}}, or reporting fewer <b>hours</b> than <b>actually</b> <b>worked,</b> is a prevalent {{behavior among}} auditors at all levels. Underreporting {{can result in}} negative consequences such as tight budgets and reductions in future audit quality. In this paper, I propose a low cost reporting procedure that reduces underreporting. Using an experiment, I document that individuals with incentives to underreport report more accurately when reporting aggregated—relative to disaggregated—time. In contrast, when individuals do not face underreporting incentives aggregation does not influence reporting. Building on mental accounting theory, I also provide evidence suggesting that the utility loss that individuals mitigate by underreporting mediates {{the relation between the}} level of aggregation, underreporting incentives, and the degree of underreporting. In a second experiment, I document another reporting procedure—percentage reporting—that firms can use in concert with aggregation to mitigate the loss of data richness that results from aggregation. This study provides important insights to audit firms, partners, managers, and regulators who rely on audit hours for budgets, measures of staff efficiency, and measures of audit quality...|$|R
2500|$|To {{bring the}} UK back into {{compliance}} with basic standards in international law, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced. The minimum wage takes effect in every worker's contract. Workers {{do not need}} to show [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] or any other requirement except that they personally perform work for a wage and is not a client. One curious exclusion, however, is a pupil barrister who in Edmonds v Lawson was held to not be [...] "working" [...] but be [...] "conscientious in receiving instruction". The minimum wage rate is reset annually after guidance from the Low Pay Commission, and on 1 October 2014 it stood at £6.50 for over-21-year-olds, £5.13 for 18- to 20-year-olds, £3.79 for under-18-year-olds finished with compulsory education. Since 2010, the minimum was cut for [...] "apprentices", and stood in 2014 at £2.73. The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 spell out the details of how the minimum wage should be calculated. Total pay received is divided by the <b>hours</b> <b>actually</b> <b>worked</b> over an average [...] "pay reference period" [...] of one month. This definition has given rise to litigation in cases where a worker can stay at home but must answer phone calls, is allowed to rest or sleep during shifts, or must make themselves available [...] "on call" [...] over a long period. Generally speaking, it is irrelevant whether one is at home or not. If a worker is given sleeping facilities and is not awake, the minimum wage need not be paid. And if a worker is [...] "on call", then this time still counts at work if the worker is bound to stay within the vicinity of the workplace. However, an exception in regulation 28 allows an employer to agree with a worker what the <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> <b>actually</b> are, if they would ordinarily be unmeasured. In Walton v Independent Living Organisation Ltd a worker who cared for a young epileptic lady had to be on call 24 hours a day, 3 days a week, but could do her own activities outside tasks such as going shopping, making meals and cleaning. Her company made an agreement with her that her tasks took 6 hours and 50 minutes a day, which resulted in her £31.40 allowance meeting the minimum wage. Certain deductions may be made including £4.51 per day for any accommodation the employer provides, though extra bills, such as for electricity, should not ordinarily be charged. The minimum wage can be enforced individually through an ERA 1996 section 13 claim for a shortfall of wages in a Tribunal. A worker may not be subjected to any detriment for enquiring, or requesting records or complaining about it. However, because many workers will not be informed about how to do this, or have the resources, a primary enforcement mechanism is through inspections and compliance notices issued by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. A remedy of up to 80 times the minimum wage is available to the worker and HMRC can enforce a penalty of twice the minimum wage per worker per day.|$|R

Involuntary long hours in mining are related to 24 -hour operations and twelve hour shifts and worsened where employees lack input into the design of rosters. The findings suggest that, {{in order to promote}} „good job ‟ in the mining industry, there is both a need to revisit protections for employees against being forced to work „unreasonable‟ hours above the ostensible national standard of 38 hours per week and strong support even amongst mineworkers for a ceiling on hours worked per week...|$|R
40|$|Second-generation {{studies of}} wage {{determination}} {{are based on}} the observation that wages of employed workers are a biased sample of the true population values because of selectivity, and a well-known two-stage method to correct for selectivity bias has been proposed by Heckman (1976). The basic notion behind the second-generation approach is that, in a setting of optimal decision making, the individual's choice of market work or not conveys valuable information that can improve our ability to estimate market wage equations. In this paper, we extend second-generation studies by proposing that there is additional useful information for estimating market wage functions in knowing not only if participation occurs, but also knowing how many <b>hours</b> a person <b>actually</b> <b>works</b> in a household sector (as opposed to consuming "pure" leisure). Accordingly, we extend the conventional work-leisure model of labor supply to accommodate time devoted to household production and adopt an estimation technique that addresses simultaneously the issues of sample censoring and the joint determination of nonmarket returns and nonmarket time. It appears that the disentanglement of the effects of investments in human capital on market and nonmarket productivity lead to sizably higher labor market returns to schooling, tenure, and experience for women than those obtained by standard approaches. ...|$|R
