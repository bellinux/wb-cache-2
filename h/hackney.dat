50|$|Bassist and vocalist Bobby <b>Hackney's</b> {{three sons}} all became {{interested}} in punk rock without knowing anything about the rock group that their father had formed with their two uncles in the early 1970s. In 2006 the three younger <b>Hackneys</b> briefly formed a band to cover songs by seminal afropunks the Bad Brains. Meanwhile, Death's 1976 single began to resurface, falling {{into the hands of}} ex-Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra and many other record collectors who played it at parties and posted it on the Internet. These tracks eventually reached the younger <b>Hackneys,</b> who instantly recognized their father's voice. Excited to discover this music, the younger <b>Hackneys</b> learned the songs and formed a band to cover their father's and uncles' music. They named themselves Rough Francis in tribute to their late uncle David, who was largely responsible for Death's direction.|$|R

The species was grown at Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens, Woburn Abbey, Loddiges nursery in <b>Hackney,</b> John Miller's nursery in Bristol and George Hibbert's garden at Clapham Common.

5|$|Because {{the river}} system was tidal {{as far as}} <b>Hackney</b> Wick, several of the mills were tide mills, {{including}} those at Abbey Mills and those at Three Mills, one of which survives. Construction of the New River {{in the seventeenth century}} to supply drinking water to London, with subsequent extraction by waterworks companies, led to a lowering of water levels, and the river was gradually canalised to maintain navigation. Significant changes occurred with the creation of the Lee Navigation in 1767, which resulted {{in the construction of the}} <b>Hackney</b> Cut and the Limehouse Cut, allowing barges to bypass most of the back rivers. A major reconstruction of the rivers took place in the 1930s, authorised by the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, but by the 1960s, commercial usage of the waterways had largely ceased. Deteriorating infrastructure led to the rivers dwindling to little more than tidal creeks, and they were categorised in 1968 as having no economic or long-term future.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge {{or outside the}} city limits. This was very impractical for many passengers, who were forced to use <b>hackney</b> carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure {{announced}} a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at <b>Hackney</b> Road will be retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on <b>Hackney</b> Road {{will lead to}} a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel will pass under the Botanic Road intersection, then curve to the west under Rundle Park, Rundle Road and surface in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction was anticipated to start in late 2015 with the project completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. SAGE Automation will provide expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. It is still expected to be completed by the end of 2017.|$|E
