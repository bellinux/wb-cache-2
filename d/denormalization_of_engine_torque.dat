50|$|Torque {{steering}} is {{the influence}} <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> <b>torque</b> on the steering, especially in front-wheel drive vehicles with transversely mounted engines. For example, during heavy acceleration the steering may pull to one side, {{which may be}} disturbing to the driver. The effect is manifested either as a tugging sensation in the steering wheel, or a veering of the vehicle from the intended path. Torque steer {{is directly related to}} differences in the forces in the contact patches of the left and right drive wheels. The effect becomes more evident when high torques are applied to the drive wheels either because of a high overall reduction ratio between the engine and wheels, high <b>engine</b> <b>torque,</b> or some combination of the two. Torque steering is distinct from steering kickback.|$|R
