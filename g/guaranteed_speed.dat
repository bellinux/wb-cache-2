50|$|Accordingly, it was {{announced}} in January 1934 that if three orders could be obtained by 28 February, a specialist racer to be named the Comet would be built and sold for £5,000 each, that {{would be capable of}} achieving a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>speed</b> of 200 mph. The prescribed price was projected as being half of the incurred cost of manufacture.

Unfortunately, not every movie had the maximum number of reviews, in fact, there were some movies that did not have reviews at all. The reason we selected only 10 reviews for the ML- 100 k database is that this database was used in our preliminary experiments; hence, we needed a smaller set of reviews to <b>guarantee</b> <b>speed</b> in these experiments.

5000|$|The Vineyard Gazette {{wrote in}} June 1961: The Uncatena, built in 1902, was 187 feet long, {{and had a}} 31-foot beam. An {{innovation}} in her construction was the placing of her shaft low enough so that passengers, boarding the boat {{by way of the}} freight deck as was often necessary, walked over it on an incline. On the older boats they had to duck their heads and pass under the shaft. She had a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>speed</b> of 15 miles an hour, and she often showed her heels to other boats of the line. The Uncatena was the only sidewheeler of the Island line to have a poem, written to her and about her by the Pulitzer Prize poet, Robert Hillyer, in 1948. The title of this nostalgic poem was In Memoriam Sidewheeler Uncatena, and it was aboard the Uncatena that Mr. Hillyer, lifelong lover of the Island, first came to the Vineyard {{in the early years of}} this century.|$|E

50|$|After {{ordering}} six prototype {{torpedo boat}} destroyers from the specialist torpedo boat yards Yarrows, Thornycroft and Laird {{as part of}} the 1892-1893 shipbuilding programme, the British Admiralty planned to buy larger numbers of destroyers under the 1893-1894 programme, with orders being spread over more shipyards. The Admiralty specified a number of broad requirement, leaving the detailed design of the ships and their machinery to the builders. The new destroyers were required top reach a trials speed of 27 kn, with penalty charges imposed if the ship's did not meet the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>speeds</b> or were delivered late. A turtleback forecastle was to be fitted. Armament was to vary depending on whether the ship was {{to be used in the}} torpedo boat or gunboat role. As a torpedo boat, the planned armament was a single QF 12 pounder 12 cwt (3 in calibre) gun, together with a secondary gun armament of three 6-pounder guns, and two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. As a gunboat, one of the torpedo tubes could be removed to accommodate a further two six-pounders.|$|R

The British production contract stated that a maximum speed of [...] +/- 4% was required at rated altitude. In acceptance testing, actual production aircraft {{were found to be}} capable of only 371mph at 14,090ft. To enable the aircraft to make the <b>guarantee</b> <b>speed,</b> a variety of drag-reduction modifications were developed by Bell. The areas of the elevator and rudder were reduced by 14.2% and 25.2% respectively. Modified fillets were installed in the tail area. The canopy glass was faired to its frame with putty. The gun access doors on the wing had been seen to bulge in flight, so they were replaced with thicker aluminum sheet. Similarly, the landing gear doors deflected open by as much as two inches at maximum speed, so a stronger linkage was installed to hold them flush. The cooling air exit from the oil and coolant radiators was reduced in area to match the exit velocity to the local flow. New engine exhaust stacks, deflected to match the local flow and with nozzles to increase thrust augmentation, were installed. The machine gun ports were faired over, the antenna mast was removed, a single-piece engine cowling was installed and an exhaust stack fairing was added.|$|R
