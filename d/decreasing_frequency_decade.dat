40|$|The frequency-dependent {{electrical}} characteristics of Au/Poly (3 -Substituted thiophene) (P 3 DMTFT) / n-GaAs Schottky barrier diodes {{have been investigated}} by using capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G/ω-V) measurements at room temperature. Negative capacitance behavior has been observed in the C-V characteristic for each frequency. The magnitude of absolute value of C was found to increase with <b>decreasing</b> <b>frequency</b> in the forward bias region. The value of G/ω increases with <b>decreasing</b> <b>frequency</b> in the positive region. This {{can be attributed to}} the increase in the polarization at low frequencies and to the fact that more carriers are introduced into the structures. Negative capacitance phenomenon can be explained by the loss of interface charges from the occupied states below the Fermi level, caused by impact ionization process. According to obtained result, the values of C and G/ω are strong functions of frequency and applied bias voltage, particularly in the accumula-tion an inversion region. Doping concentration (Nd), diffusion potential (Vd), Fermi energy level (Ef), and barrier height (Φb(C-V)) values have been calculated from reverse bias C− 2 -V plots for 3 MHz.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that approximately 80 % of all persons with DM 2 are obese, and the prevalence of diabetes increases With increasing age and body weight. Intensive control resulting in near-normal glycemia in obese DM 2 holds great potential for reducing morbidity and mortality, but is associated with weight gain. In turn, modest weight loss improves glycemia considerably. Current weight loss programs, with <b>decreasing</b> <b>frequency</b> of interventions over time, result in a weight loss pattern of a U-shaped curve indicating an inability in maintaining the lower weight. We hypothesized that increasing vs <b>decreasing</b> <b>frequency</b> of treatment visits over time would result in better weight loss and metabolic control.

A randomized, double blind trial published in JAMA in 1994 showed that management for alcohol withdrawal that was guided by the CIWA scale resulted in decreased treatment duration and total use of benzodiazepines. The goal of the CIWA scale is to provide an efficient and objective means of assessing alcohol withdrawal.
