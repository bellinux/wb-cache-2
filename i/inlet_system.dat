40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between UT-Battelle (Contractor) and MDS Sciex (Participant) and ESA, Inc. (Participant) is to research, develop and apply new types of {{ionization}} sources and sampling/inlet systems for analytical mass spectrometry making use of the Participants state-of-the-art atmospheric sampling mass spectrometry electrochemical cell technology instrumentation and ancillary equipment. The two overriding goals of this research project are: to understand the relationship among the various instrumental components and operational parameters of the various ion sources and <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> under study, the chemical nature of the gases, solvents, and analytes in use, and the nature and abundances of the ions ultimately observed in the mass spectrometer; and to develop new and better analytical and fundamental applications of these ion sources and <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> or alternative sources and inlets coupled with mass spectrometry {{on the basis of}} the fundamental understanding obtained in Goal 1. The end results of this work are expected to be: (1) an expanded utility for the ion sources and <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> under study (such as the analysis of new types of analytes) and the control or alteration of the ionic species observed in the gas-phase; (2) enhanced instrument performance as judged by operational figures-of-merit such as dynamic range, detection limits, susceptibility to matrix signal suppression and sensitivity; and (3) novel applications (such as surface sampling with electrospray) in both applied and fundamental studies. The research projects outlined herein build upon work initiated under the previous CRADA between the Contractor and MDS Sciex on ion sources and <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> for mass spectrometry. Specific ion source and <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> for exploration of the fundamental properties and practical implementation of these principles are given...|$|R

2500|$|For the {{analysis}} of volatile compounds, a purge and trap (P) concentrator system {{may be used to}} introduce samples. [...] The target analytes are extracted and mixed with water and introduced into an airtight chamber. [...] An inert gas such as Nitrogen (N2) is bubbled through the water; this is known as purging or sparging. [...] The volatile compounds move into the headspace above the water and are drawn along a pressure gradient (caused by the introduction of the purge gas) out of the chamber. [...] The volatile compounds are drawn along a heated line onto a 'trap'. [...] The trap is a column of adsorbent material at ambient temperature that holds the compounds by returning them to the liquid phase. [...] The trap is then heated and the sample compounds are introduced to the GC-MS column via a volatiles interface, which is a split <b>inlet</b> <b>system.</b> [...] P GC-MS is particularly suited to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and BTEX compounds (aromatic compounds associated with petroleum).|$|E

40|$|This project {{developed}} the <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system.</b> An <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system</b> represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or bleed off valves (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. Bleed off valves represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system</b> is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system</b> operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system</b> can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system</b> is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} <b>inlet</b> metering <b>system</b> is more efficient than using a bleed off valve, but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|R

40|$|Top {{inlet flow}} field and inlet {{performance}} data are presented which provide preliminary {{insight into the}} feasibility of upper-fuselage mounted <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> for transonic-supersonic fighter aircraft. Presented data span the Mach 0. 2 to 2. 0 envelope and enable evaluation {{of the influence of}} key aircraft configuration variables - inlet location, wing position, wing leading-edge extension (LEX) planform area, and variable incidence canards - on top inlet performance. The viability of this concept relative to more conventional inlet/airframe integrations is assessed via comparative evaluation of top and conventional inlet flow field parameters at transonic and supersonic speeds. It is shown that the action of the wing LEX vortex system produces a significant improvement in top inlet performance. Currently available transonic-supersonic data indicate that top <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> pose a viable configuration option for fighter aircraft requiring moderate angle of attack capability.

40|$|Tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> {{are found}} {{all over the}} world. These highly dynamic coastal {{features}} can be classified into three main types wave-dominated, tide-dominated or river-dominated tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems.</b> A tidal <b>inlet</b> is described as {{an opening in the}} shoreline that provides a connection between the ocean and a bay and is maintained by tidal currents. Tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> are the whole area of the near shore ocean, inlet and bay with river catchment area. Recently, Thuy (2013) developed a dimensionless hydraulic parameter tool to classify tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems.</b> The study focusses on wave-dominated tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems</b> and specifically the sub-class intermittently open natural inlets. The question arises if the intermittently open natural inlets can be distinct by use of the parameter. This type of sub-class has an alternately open or closed connection to the ocean, which is indicated by the word intermittently. A natural inlet is defined as an inlet with no other human interventions at the inlet entrance other than artificial breaching of the entrance berm when the lagoon water level exceeds a critical value. The distinction for the sub-class can be integrated into the wave-dominated classification parameter, therefore the overall objective is to make a contribution to the wave-dominated classification parameter of Thuy (2013) to make a more accurate classification for the sub-class intermittently open natural inlets. The overall objective is too extensive to be answered completely by only this study, therefore a specific objective is formulated. The specific objective is to predict the lagoon water level of intermittently open natural inlets forced by waves, tide and river discharge. The prediction of the lagoon water level will indicate the important forcing working on the inlet, while the entrance is in an open state. In total nine opening/closure events are found in the data and analysed. Data included, offshore wave climate, tidal water levels, lagoon water level and rainfall. To get a more accurate representation of the wave climate near the research sites, the offshore wave climate is adjusted to get the near shore wave climate. Based on the analysis the following main conclusion is found. The lagoon water level is a crucial parameter for prediction of the entrance state open or closed. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} in which way the high waves will affect the elevation of the lagoon water level. Two analytical models are introduces to understand the forces that work on the open inlet. A basic energy equation, after Nielsen (2009), is the starting point of both models. The basic energy equation describes the river discharge and flood tide as inflow parameters, but the effect of waves is not taken into account. The first introduced model is the extended energy equation. The data analysis indicated that shore-normal waves are dominant during the elevation of the lagoon water level. The shore-normal wave forcing is introduced by means of a wave overwash discharge. The outcome of this model gives an underestimation of the lagoon water level, although the model performs better than the basic energy equation. The second introduced model is an alternative approach of the basic energy equation. The data analysis indicates that the near shore wave heights are very important for the elevation of the lagoon water level. Accordingly the elevation of the lagoon water level is assumed to be a function of the near shore wave height. The alternative model gives a better performance of the lagoon water level than the basic and the extended model. Based on this study it is recommended to further develop the alternative model for further research of different tidal <b>inlet</b> <b>systems.</b> A meaningful addition to the model could be the introduction of an entrance width that varies in time. During closure the inlet entrance gets narrower, which will result in different forcing and a different response of the lagoon water level.

50|$|While {{a higher}} {{compression}} ratio is helpful in raising efficiency, diesel engines {{are much more}} efficient than gasoline (petrol) engines when at low power and at engine idle.

This creates parasitic loss and destruction of availability of the incoming air, reducing the efficiency of petrol engines at idle.
