Feelings – novel, satisfying, intense, prolonged, challenging or transcendent – are sought by bungee jumpers, mountaineers and practitioners of ‘extreme’ sports; by millions of consumers of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and other recre- ational drugs; by users of pornography, music and painkillers; and by consumers at festivals, carnivals, fairgrounds, music events, cinemas and sports stadia. The management of feeling is integral to identities that are both gendered (‘big boys don’t cry’) and cultural (‘keep a stiff upper lip’) and emphasised by advice to ‘keep a cool head’ to make unbiased, ratio- nal decisions. Simultaneously, the fabric of everyday relating includes countless conversations that begin with some reference to feeling (“So, how are you today?”), conversations of which a sizeable minority take feeling as their primary focus (“I’m sorry I upset you”). In fact, the ubiq- uity and relevance of feeling is such that sometimes it is even parodied (“so – <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> you feel ?”) [First paragraph]Peer-reviewedPost-print...|$|E

40|$|Although JP courts did {{not escape}} the general {{deterioration}} of Congolese administrative structures, Congolese people continue to use these courts to resolve their conflicts. Based on qualitative research carried out in Lubumbashi, this article attempts to understand why people bring their cases to the JP court. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> litigants <b>make</b> <b>that</b> decision in the first place? Once their cases are underway, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> they deal with the trial? The authors emphasise the fact that while litigants denounce the corruption that occurs within the legal system, they continue nevertheless to have confidence in justice itself and in the State. This faith reflects {{the importance of the}} law and the formal ideal of institutions that were inherited from the Belgian colonial period in various areas of the daily life of Congolese people. But it also suggests that, counter to the dominant paradigm {{in the study of the}} State in Africa, these institutional norms do not simply represent an illusion without basis in reality. Where circumstances allow, these norms do indeed play a structuring role in the functioning of bureaucracy in Congo. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} the interactions between the processes of mapping and rerepresentation within analogy making. Analogical reasoning systems for use in design tasks require representations that are open to being reinterpreted. The framework, interpretation-driven mapping, casts the process of constructing an analogical relationship as requiring iterative, parallel interactions between mapping and interpreting. This paper argues that this interpretation-driven approach focuses research on a fundamental problem in analogy making: <b>how</b> <b>do</b> the representations <b>that</b> <b>make</b> new mappings possible emerge during the mapping process? The framework is useful for both describing existing analogy-making models and designing future ones. The paper {{presents a}} computational model informed by the framework Idiom, which learns ways to reinterpret the representations of objects as it maps between them. The results of an implementation {{in the domain of}} visual analogy are presented to demonstrate its feasibility. Analogies constructed by the system are presented as examples. The interpretation-driven mapping framework is then used to compare representational change in Idiom to that in three previously published systems...|$|R

But attributing positive change to our own work is often uncertain. At the same time, as our presence {{in the media and}} in discussions with policy-makers grows, and is seen to grow, we face a hostile audience as never before. There are many—our direct targets and others—who would like to dis-credit and dismiss human rights organizations, or are skeptical of the value of con-demning human rights abuse {{in the absence of an}} appetite among influential governments to apply meaningful leverage. Both the hostility and the skepticism raise the stakes for us to explain our purpose and our tactics, including in terms of how we assess that we are effective. Yet even major, established human rights organizations are still getting to grips with more systematically evaluating whether and how we achieve the outcomes we seek from our advocacy efforts. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> we locate the reliable evidence that our approaches to human rights problems actually work?

40|$|The {{concept of}} “style of thought” or Denkstil is today {{probably}} primarily {{associated with the}} Polish microbiologist and philosopher of science Ludwik Fleck and his writings from the 1930 s. It was however used quite extensively already by Karl Mannheim in his writings on the sociology of knowledge from the 1920 s. Quite interestingly, the concept of style of thought was also used twice by Rudolf Carnap {{in the preface to}} Der logische Aufbau der Welt from 1928. No doubt, the concept must have been in the air during the interwar period. In what follows I will characterize the early positivism in Nordic philosophy in terms of a certain style of thought or as a certain habitus of thought.

We asked subjects to learn the novel dynamics of a robotic tool while moving it in four directions.

This strategy was correlated with better performance on test trials. However, even when participants performed perfectly on a movement, they did not avoid repeating that movement. The probability of repeating an action did not drop below chance even when no errors were observed. This behavior led to suboptimal performance.

5000|$|Patsy was {{the last}} of a string of {{children}} born to an aging bohemian mother in Paris. She and Edina Monsoon were childhood friends, and since her mother despised and neglected her—regarding her more as a rival than a daughter—she came to rely on the Monsoons for most of her shelter, comfort, and food (though she has only been seen eating twice since 1973). She mentioned that her mother would have had an abortion, though she mistook her pregnancy for the onset of the menopause. The first few years of her life were spent locked in a room, and the rest of her childhood was dismal by Patsy's own description, without friends, parties, or presents. She claims to have blocked out everything before 1968, though occasionally memories come back to her in the form of flashbacks. She is an outrageous, narcissistic, nymphomaniacal, past-her-prime fashion model. However, she is a notoriously unsuccessful model, only getting work through latching on to high-profile designers and models, such as Zandra Rhodes and Erin O'Connor, and manipulating them into feeling sorry for her. A flashback to the Sixties reveals Patsy wreaking havoc on the set of one of Zandra's photo shoots. She dubs herself an [...] "ex-Bond girl" [...] (although her only [...] "actual" [...] Bond films were Bond Meets Black Emmanuelle, Boldfinger, and The Man with Thunder Balls - Joanna Lumley was a genuine Bond Girl in On Her Majesty's Secret Service) who drinks and smokes heavily. She shares a codependent existence with Edina. This relationship usually results in hilarious, albeit dysfunctional, behaviour and over-the-top conflicts. Patsy was born on 30 October, although her actual age is never clearly divulged; she often states herself to be between 39 and 43. In one episode ("Paris"), her passport states she was born in 1919, although this seems unrealistic. In one episode ("Cold Turkey") a nurse guesses that she is around 65 years old. Patsy also has a sister named Jackie, whom Eddy abhors and who twice tried to kill Patsy with drug overdoses. Jackie intimidates Patsy into stating that Patsy is the elder of the two. In the same episode, Jackie reveals that she is 72 years old, to which Patsy replies [...] "My God, then <b>how</b> old <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> me?"; suggesting <b>that</b> Patsy has lied about her age so often that she can no longer remember her real age.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary concern}} of the {{research}} study was the problem of effective measurement and comparison of diverse business unit economic performance, with particular emphasis upon the identification and empirical investigation of selected value added measures of organizational performance. ^ The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether or not value added measures can be effectively utilized as comparative measures of diverse business unit performance. The study 2 ̆ 7 s source of data was the Strategic Planning Institute 2 ̆ 7 s PIMS Project Data Base, and the exploratory study consisted of three phases. ^ The first phase focused on the following questions: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> selected value added measures compare with the more traditional measures of organizational performance? The second phase addressed three questions: (1) What independent variables (such as market share, capital intensity, and others identified in PIMS findings) exhibit a strong relationship with return on value added (ROVA) ? (2) What independent variables explain the variance of ROVA? (3) What is the value of ROVA, given the interaction of selected independent variables? The third phase addressed the following question: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> the elements <b>that</b> <b>make</b> up value added differ by lifecycle stage and type of business unit?^ The investigation has generated the following conclusions: First, change in net sales and change in value added are growth measures which can be used to compare businesses of all types. Second, ROVA is the least variant overall measure of organizational performance, regardless of the lifecycle stage, type of business, and vertical integration. Third, six independent variables [...] market share, investment intensity, marketing intensity, employee productivity, capacity utilization, and relative product quality [...] are major determinants of ROVA. Market share has the most consistent and positive impact on ROVA. Fourth, the mean values of the ten elements comprising value added provide preliminary normative guidelines when the criterion is type of business unit or lifecycle stage. ^ Based upon the results of the study, top management can use the quasi-invariant value added efficiency measure, ROVA, as an effective comparative measure for six of eight diverse types of businesses. ...|$|R
