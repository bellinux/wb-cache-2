5000|$|The other {{safety issues}} are common with other powered model categories. <b>Hand-starting</b> very {{powerful}} engines, with very sharp propellers, {{can be quite}} hazardous. An electric starter can be used, but <b>hand-starting</b> methods are reasonably safe. One such method is the [...] "back-bump" [...] method, where the engine is choked and flipped through with no battery attached to create favorable starting conditions. Once prepared, all that is necessary is to rock the engine backwards so that it coasts up to compression, and if done correctly, starts forwards. This provides time to move the hand {{out of the way}} and the fingers are not in contact with the propeller or spinner when the engine starts. Care must be taken even choking the engine as modern engines with their accurate piston/cylinder fit can [...] "bump" [...] or even start without the battery attached. Once the propeller is rotating, extreme care must be taken when preparing for flight and adjusting the engine. A starting accident frequently results in a small cut to the finger, but once the engine is at full speed any injury that is encountered is likely to be quite severe.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{the present}} study was to test whether there is a {{relationship}} between manual preference and hand-digit mapping in 369 French adults with similar numbers of right- and left-handers. Manual laterality was evaluated with the finger tapping test to evaluate hand motor asymmetry, and the Edinburgh handedness inventory was used to assess manual preference strength (MPS) and direction. Participants were asked to spontaneously "count on their fingers from 1 to 10 " without indications concerning the hand(s) to be used. The results indicated that both MPS and hand motor asymmetry affect the <b>hand-starting</b> preference for counting. Left-handers with a strong left-hand preference (sLH) or left-hand motor asymmetry largely started to count with their left hand (left-starter), while right-handers with a strong right-hand preference (sRH) or right-hand motor asymmetry largely started to count with their right hand (right-starter). Notably, individuals with weak MPS did not show a <b>hand-starting</b> preference. These findings demonstrated that manual laterality contributes to finger counting directionality. Lastly, the results showed a higher proportion of sLH left-starter individuals compared with sRH right-starters, indicating an asymmetric bias of MPS on <b>hand-starting</b> preference. We hypothesize that the higher proportion of sLH left-starters could be explained by the congruence between left-to-right hand-digit mapping and left-to-right mental number line representation that has been largely reported in the literature. Taken together, these results indicate that finger-counting habits integrate biological and cultural information...|$|E
50|$|A {{four-stroke}} twin-cylinder {{petrol engine}} (the 12HP ST4/ST4M/ST4MR/ST4RE) {{was introduced in}} May 1968. Rated at 12 HP, {{it was the most}} powerful engine in the range. This side-valve engine was 955 cc capacity and weighed 155 kg. Both <b>hand-start</b> and electric-start versions were produced, but production was only about 150 engines, and it was phased out in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{the engine}} was a problem on the early cars; with no {{independently}} powered compressor, the compressed-air starting relied on the limited reserves of the car's reservoirs. There were many reports of cars being started by being pushed or towed by locomotives or even horses, after the compressed air ran out. Later cars, with an independent gasoline-driven compressor which could be <b>hand-started,</b> did not suffer from these problems.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{at least}} two versions:The GA-468 was a single-seater. It took about five minutes to inflate to about at full size, it was 19 ft long, with a 22 ft wingspan. A pilot would then <b>hand-start</b> the {{two-stroke}} cycle, [...] Nelson engine, and takeoff with a maximum load of 240 lb. On 20 US gallons (76 L) of fuel, the aircraft could fly 390 mi, with an endurance of 6.5 hours. Maximum speed was 72 mph, with a cruise speed of 60 mph. Later, a [...] engine {{was used in the}} aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{track and}} field races, the runner must react to the {{starting}} gun, which takes approximately 0.24 seconds, based on FAT timing. A runner with a reaction time less than [...]100 is subject to disqualification as that is deemed too fast of a reaction time. For electronically timed 40-yard dashes, the runner is allowed to start when he wishes, and a timer <b>hand-starts</b> the clock. This aspect means that comparisons with track times are impossible given that a reaction time is not factored in. Furthermore, the use of hand-timing in the 40-yard dash can considerably alter a runner's time; the methods are not comparable to the rigorous electronic timing used in {{track and field}}.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from its}} method of propulsion, the Djinn was a {{relatively}} conventional helicopter, featuring a two-seat side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cabin. The cockpit is provided {{with an array of}} plexiglas panels, which provide the occupants {{with a high level of}} all-round visibility. Directly to the rear of the cockpit was the rotorcraft's single Palouste engine. The engine lacked any electronics and had to be <b>hand-started</b> via a crank handle located on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Djinn possessed the ability to fly at high overload weights for around 5 sec by correctly harnessing the accumulated kinetic energy of the rotor; this 'jump' technique was successfully used to achieve certification for it to be operated to carry heavy payloads, some of which could represent up to 54 per cent of the rotorcraft's overall gross weight.|$|R
2500|$|The S-37 was a two bay {{sesquiplane}} using parallel interplane struts and bracing wires. Based on the S-35 {{its construction}} was very similar, an all metal fuselage and main wing made of Duralumin {{and covered with}} fabric. The empennage featured a triple tail with the rudders placed in the slipstream of each engine and a center vertical stabilizer that was adjustable from a lever in the cockpit. The first S-37 was initially powered by [...] Gnome-Rhône 9A Jupiter engines with the main fuel tanks located in the fairings behind each engine. A small two-cylinder <b>hand-started</b> auxiliary power unit mounted in the fuselage below the cockpit generated compressed air used to start the main engines. Main wheel brakes were hydraulically controlled with differential braking. The nose of the fuselage was hinged and concealed an opening [...] wide by [...] tall {{that could be used}} for baggage or an auxiliary fuel tank.|$|R
50|$|The Bamby {{featured}} a fiberglass body with left side gull-wing door. All Bamby cars were three-wheelers {{with the single}} wheel in the rear. Initial models were equipped with <b>hand-started</b> Minarelli 49cc engines, cable brakes and single headlamps. Improvements introduced included replacing the original engines with the type fitted by Yamaha to their Passola moped, using the main frame components as a subframe for attaching {{to the body of}} the car. Brakes were converted to hydraulic discs, but the single headlamp was retained until a further face-lift, from which time two headlights were fitted. At this time the gull-wing entry was deleted and a front-hinged door installed instead. Also introduced was a Suzuki engine, attached via a full chassis, in place of the previously used subframe. The new model was exhibited at the Ideal Home Exhibition of 1984, meeting with overall public approval, but few were made and the final Bamby left the factory within a few months.|$|R
