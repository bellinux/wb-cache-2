5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker.

After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half, and in their opening drive, Robinson rushed for six yards and threw a 20-yard pass to Drew Dileo before Alabama's defense forced a punt. Alabama's next drive started strong with a 28-yard reception by Kevin Norwood {{and a pair of}} 14-yard runs by T. J. Yeldon. However, McCarron was sacked for a 16-yard loss and as a result, Cade Foster later missed a 52-yard field goal wide left. On the Michigan drive that ensued, the Wolverines stalled at around midfield, but Michigan elected to <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first down on fourth and three. Robinson then rushed for what was initially ruled a three-yard first down, but later was overturned by video evidence that turned the ball over on downs. Alabama then drove to the Michigan 33-yard-line where Foster connected on a 51-yard field goal that extended the Crimson Tide lead to 34–7. The Wolverines responded on their next possession with their final points of the game after Robinson connected with Devin Gardner for a 44-yard touchdown reception to make the score 34–14 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. After each team again traded punts, on their second possession of the fourth quarter the Crimson Tide started at their own 43-yard-line. On the drive, Jalston Fowler rushed for 25 yards, McCarron passed to Kelly Johnson for 16 yards and Michigan was called for a 15-yard pass interference penalty to set up a one-yard touchdown run for Yeldon and a 41–14 Alabama lead. After this, Michigan and Alabama traded possessions without scoring, and on Michigan's last possession of the game, backup Michigan quarterback Russell Bellomy threw an interception to Alabama's Dillon Lee.|$|E
