40|$|Data was {{analysed}} for {{a sample of}} 195 Thai transgendered females (i. e., male-to-female (MtF) transgenders) who had completed a questionnaire covering, inter alia, demographics, transition histories and sexual/gender identities. Mean age was 25. 4 years. For demographic data, we found that our participants were often among the youngest in their family, that females played {{a prominent role in}} their lives (often rearing them without any male help), and that around one in five brothers (natural or step) were also transgendered. With regard to transition histories, we found that many participants had transitioned very early in life, beginning to feel different to other males, and identifying as non-male by middle childhood. By adolescence many were living a transgendered life. Many took hormones, beginning to do so by a mean age of 16. 3 years, and several from as early as 10 years. Many underwent surgeries of various kinds, on average in the twenties, with one undergoing SRS as early as 15 years. As to identity, most of our participants thought of themselves simply as phuying (women), with a smaller number thinking of themselves as phuying praphet song (a 'second kind of woman'). A small number thought of themselves as kathoey (a more general Thai term embracing a variety of <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformities).</b> While most participants would prefer to be a woman, there were a few who seemed comfortable being transgendered. A few foresaw {{that they would not be}} living a transgendered life into old age. The vast majority expressed a sexual attraction to men. © 2006 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

40|$|Work {{on sexual}} {{citizenship}}, or the imbrication {{of citizenship and}} sexuality, has traditionally focused {{on the role of}} heteronormativity in social organization and the impacts of that organization on the lives of LGBTQ persons. Little work has examined the utility of this framework for understanding the experiences and positioning of persons with cognitive (dis) abilities, though they too {{have a long history of}} sexual oppression and civic disenfranchisement. In addition, few studies have empirically investigated the sexual and gender identities or intimate lives of this population. This study sought to fill these gaps in basic and theoretical understanding through in-depth, Internet facilitated interviews with 24 adults on the autism spectrum. Autism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by differences in social communication and unusual behaviours or interests, as well as sensory differences. Two levels of thematic analysis were conducted on interview data. A semantic analysis of participants 2 ̆ 7 intimate experiences and sexual-gender identities demonstrates that participants were successful at developing satisfying relationships and using intimate and genital touch for self-regulation. On the other hand, participants struggled with sensory-based barriers to sexual satisfaction, courtship difficulties, and experiences of intimate violence and betrayal. This analysis also substantiates previous research indicating a propensity toward <b>gender</b> and sexual <b>non-conformity</b> among persons on the spectrum, as well as delayed sexual milestones. A latent analysis connecting participants 2 ̆ 7 everyday experiences with structural processes demonstrates that participants were positioned as marginal citizens through the workings of ability and (hetero) sexual normativity in their everyday lives. Participants 2 ̆ 7 sexual citizenship was limited by the operation of these normativities evident in experiences of structural and cultural ableism, as well as heteronormativity and the primacy of monogamous sexual relationships. Participants also enacted and enhanced their sexual citizenship through the sexual economy and (hetero) sexual normalization, as well as social support, an Autistic identity, and the deployment of proactive strategies for managing (dis) ability. Finally, participants articulated new gender, sexual, and ability normativities that better facilitated their access to sexual citizenship. These analyses illustrate how normative sexuality is predicated on typical ability. Further, they show how ability and sexuality separately and in their entwined aspect mediate access to full citizenship...|$|R

5000|$|Bem {{proposes a}} theory on the {{relationship}} between childhood <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity,</b> which he refers to as the [...] "exotic become erotic." [...] Bem argues that biological factors, such as prenatal hormones, genes and neuroanatomy, predispose children to behave in ways that do not conform to their sex assigned at birth. Gender nonconforming children will often prefer opposite-sex playmates and activities. These become alienated from their same-sex peer group. As children enter adolescence [...] "the exotic becomes erotic" [...] where dissimilar and unfamiliar same-sex peers produces arousal, and the general arousal become eroticized over time. Bem's theory does not seem to fit female homosexuality. Perhaps, males who demonstrate gender nonconformity experience more alienation and separation from same-sex peers, because cultural constructions of masculinity are generally more rigid than femininity.|$|E
5000|$|For women, adult <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with lesbianism due to the limited identities women are faced with at adulthood. Notions of heterosexual womanhood often require a rejection of physically demanding activities, social submission to a male figure (husband or boyfriend), an interest in reproduction and homemaking, and an interest in making oneself look more attractive for men with appropriate clothing, make-up, hair styles and body shape. A rejection of any of these factors may lead to a woman being called a lesbian regardless of her actual sexual orientation, or indeed to a man [...] "crossing her off the list" [...] as a potential romantic or sexual partner regardless of whether he actually believes she is a lesbian. Therefore, attracting a male romantic or sexual partner can be a strong factor for an adult woman to suppress or reject her own desire to be gender variant.|$|E
50|$|Gender norms vary {{by country}} and by culture, {{as well as}} across {{historical}} time periods within cultures. For example, in Pashtun tribes in Afghanistan, adult men frequently hold hands, without being perceived as gay, whereas in the West this behavior would, in most circumstances, be seen as proof of a homosexual relationship. However, in many cultures, behaviors such as crying, an inclination toward caring for and nurturing others in an emotionally open way, an interest in domestic chores other than cooking, and excessive self-grooming can all be seen as aspects of male <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity.</b> Men who exhibit such tendencies are often stereotyped as gay. One study found {{a high incidence of}} gay males self-reporting gender-atypical behaviors in childhood, such as having little interest in athletics and a preference for playing with dolls. The same study found that mothers of gay males recalled such atypical behavior in their sons with greater frequency than mothers of heterosexual males. But while many gay or bisexual men exhibit traditionally feminine characteristics, many of them do not, and not all feminine men are necessarily gay or bisexual.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{recent studies}} - from the National Center of Transgender Inequality (NCTE) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) - {{have shown that}} {{transgender}} individuals in the United States particularly face discrimination within their own family units and schools, in employment and housing, within government settings, through hate crimes, and under the justice and legal systems. From a young age, children are often brought up in heteronormative settings within their own homes and in school. Parents oftentimes respond quite negatively when their children cross gender barriers, prompting transgender youth to run away. As a result, homeless transgender youth {{are more likely to}} turn to drug dealing, car theft, and sexual exploitation. According to the Human Rights Campaign, less than 43% of gender-expansive youth said they could turn to an adult in their family if they were worried or sad.

40|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} {{are undergoing}} dynamic {{change in the}} 21 st Century, with development towards egalitarian values. Gender identity has become a social rights focus due to a rising number of gender non-conformists. Whilst previous research has suggested a relationship between gender stereotype deviance and higher socioeconomic status, little research has explored gender identity deviance and socioeconomic status. This study’s hypotheses were that gender stereotype adherence would decrease with increased socioeconomic status, and that gender identity deviance would positively correlate with higher socioeconomic status due to decreased social stigma concerning <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity.</b> 18 participants, aged 15 - 16, from a Dorset school were measured on socioeconomic status, gender stereotype adherence and gender identity adherence through questionnaires and interviews. Correlational analysis confirmed a significant, one-tailed relationship between high socioeconomic status and low gender stereotype adherence, supporting the first hypothesis. Correspondence analysis displayed that <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity</b> was more prevalent amongst higher socioeconomic status participants; a trend which supported the second hypothesis. These findings encourage further research into confirming definitive relationships between the factors and exploring causational relationships between gender stereotypes, gender identity and socioeconomic status, to determine how prejudice and environmental resources may impact adolescent self-expression and attitudes towards non-conforming gender minorities...|$|E

In addition, the relationship of homophobic name-calling to mental health in gender non-conforming adolescents is not well understood. This study examined the relationship between homophobic verbal victimization and mental health in adolescents, accounting for their sexual orientation and level of <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity.</b> Survey data was collected from 513 adolescents (ages 11 - 17) who attended eight schools in and around Amsterdam, the Netherlands; 56. 7 % of the participating adolescents were female and 11. 1 % reported same-sex attractions. As hypothesized, male adolescents and those with same-sex attractions {{were more likely to report}} victimization from homophobic name-calling than were their female and non-same-sex attracted peers. Contrary to expectations, homophobic name-calling was not independently associated with psychological distress after controlling for gender, sexual attractions, <b>gender</b> <b>non-conformity,</b> and other negative treatment by peers. The hypothesis that homophobic name-calling would be more strongly associated with psychological distress in male, same-sex attracted, and gender non-conforming adolescents was also not supported. The results suggest that same-sex attracted and gender non-conforming youth are particularly vulnerable to homophobic name-calling, in the Netherlands as in other contexts, but also that other forms of peer victimization may be more strongly related to mental health...|$|E
