To improve the <b>ejector</b> <b>effect</b> and vacuum performance, it is important to clarify the flow behavior within the ejector. In this study a simple rectangular model of ejector is used to obtain the flow pattern in the ejector. The internal flow of the ejector is visualized by shadowgraph and schlieren methods and the stagnation pressure of the secondary flow is measured to investigate the ejector performance with and without the secondary flow rate. It is found how flow behavior of the ejector influences the ejector performance...|$|E
40|$|Buoyancy-driven natural {{ventilation}} in ventilation shafts is investigated {{with a small}} scale physical experiment within a duct and CFD simulations of an office building. For a fixed exhaust opening, smaller shafts lead to higher flow rates in upper floors of a multi-storey building with a shared ventilation shaft. These higher flow rates are caused by increased vertical momentum within the smaller shafts that induce flow through upper floors, an effect {{referred to as the}} “ejector effect”. In the small scale duct, a 0. 5 m by 0. 5 m shaft leads to a slight reverse flow of 0. 0029 m[superscript 3]/s through the upper floor. Holding all other parameters constant and reducing the shaft to 0. 25 m by 0. 5 m leads to a positive flow rate of 0. 012 m[superscript 3]/s through the upper floor. In the CFD simulations of a three storey office building, this same pattern is observed. A 3 m by 2 m shaft leads to a flow rate of 0. 0168 m[superscript 3]/s through the third floor, while the reduced shaft of 2 m by 2 m leads to a flow rate of 0. 766 m[superscript 3]/s through the same floor. This increased airflow rate from the <b>ejector</b> <b>effect</b> can allow {{natural ventilation}} to be used in buildings where it may otherwise have been deemed inappropriate. Most airflow network models neglect air momentum and fail to account for the <b>ejector</b> <b>effect.</b> To improve these models, an empirical model is incorporated into the airflow network model CoolVent in a manner easily transferable to most airflow network models.

40|$|Several {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a one-sixth scale Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine model at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The UAH RBCC facility consists of a rectangular duct with a vertical strut mounted in the center. The scaled strut consists of two supersonic rocket nozzles with an embedded vertical turbine between the rocket nozzles. The tests included mass flow, flow visualization and horizontal pressure traverses. The mass flow test indicated a c:hoked condition when the rocket chamber pressure is between 200 psi and 300 psi. The flow visualization tests narrowed the rocket chamber pressure range from, 250 psi to 300 psi. Also, from this t. est, an assumption of a minimum <area choke was made. Horizontal pressure traverses were performed at locations both upstream and downstream of the nozzle exit plane.

Experiments using photographic techniques have been conducted to study {{the influence of the}} inner jet on outer conical sheet spray characteristics such as spray cone angle and break-up length. The core spray has a strong influence on the outer sheet when the pressure drop in the latter is low. This is attributed to the pressure variations caused by <b>ejector</b> <b>effects.</b> This paper also discusses the merging and separation behavior of the liquid sheets which exhibits hysteresis effect while injector pressure drop is varied...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the {{rotating}} exhaust acted {{as an effective}} wall at {{the outer edge of}} the engine base, and the entire base area effectively is pumped down below ambient due to <b>ejector</b> pump <b>effect,</b> creating an effective suction cup at the bottom in atmosphere. This could be alleviated using makeup gas to develop base pressure, requiring effectively an additional rocket engine to fill up the base of the main rocket engine. (Similar problems would have occurred in a conventional aerospike engine, but there, natural recirculation plus use of the turbopump gas-generator's exhaust as the makeup gas would have largely alleviated the problem [...] "for free.") ...|$|R

40|$|NASA and Aerojet are {{developing}} a Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine under the Advanced Reusable Technology program. The rocket application requires that the combustion process be stable, complete, and take place in as short a distance as possible without compromising the structural integrity of the injector itself. A novel gaseous hydrogen-oxygen rocket injector element design was arrived at through an iterative design process making extensive use of CFD simulations, {{which resulted in a}} design that is meeting design goals. Sub-scale versions of the injector have been built and tested in a unique test-rig and in a sub-scale RBCC engine. The Aerojet RBCC concept integrates small rocket thrusters into the rearfacing base area of struts placed in the flowpath of a scramjet (Supersonic Combusting Ramjet) engine.

40|$|Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) {{concepts}} {{attempt to}} improve the performance of launch vehicles at all points in the launch trajectory and make highly reusable launch vehicles a reality. The Aerojet Strutjet RBCC concept consists of a variable geometry duct with internal, vertical struts that functions in ducted rocket, ramjet, scramjet, and pure rocket modes. These struts have rocket and turbine exhaust nozzles imbedded within them. The rocket flows create an <b>ejector</b> <b>effect</b> with the ingested air at subsonic flight velocities. In ramjet and scramjet modes, the fuel rich nozzle flows react with the ingested air producing an afterburner effect. Under a NASA Marshall Space Flight Center contract, the UAH Propulsion Research Center (PRC) has designed and built a Strutjet simulation facility. A scale model of a single strut has been built and is undergoing cold-flow testing to investigate the mixing of the rocket and turbine exhausts with the ingested air. A complementary experimental program is also underway to examine the induced flow-field generated by rocket nozzles confined in a rectangular duct. Characterizing the induced flow behavior is critical to understanding and optimizing the performance of future Strutjet-based RBCC propulsion systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The ejector mode of rocket-based {{combined}} cycles is {{a concept}} that has the ability to gain thrust from atmospheric air and reduce fuel consumption and thus reduce the cost of rocket launches. This thesis develops a threedimensional rocket nozzle design that includes the potential for incorporating the <b>ejector</b> <b>effect.</b> The nozzle is designed such that the diverging portion of the nozzle geometry must pass through a gate that is placed on the outer perimeter whose shape does not have to remain axisymmetric, thus creating a void for air intake into the centre of an annular rocket exhaust stream. Viscous effects are included via Edenfield’s displacement thickness δ correlation for turbulent boundary layers. Comparison of computational fluid dynamics to a predefined Mach number distribution is within 1. 6 % of an inviscid solution and 6. 8 % for a viscous simulation using the k-ɛ turbulence model. I. COMBINED CYCLES Air-augmented rockets also known as Combined Cycles (CC), that present the notion of increasing thrust in addition of mass flow, 70 % reducing propellant mass fraction, 10 – 20 % increasing the specific impulse at atmospheric conditions. It leads to reducing launch costs of atmospheric flight. These Cycles are classified as hybrid rocket, operates better than the rocket or ramjet separately. Combined Cycles is attained through the addition of a diffuser downstream of the exhaust. It includes three parts that is ejector, air intake, thrust chamber.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} control devices and techniques are evaluated to determine their suitability for increasing the short takeoff performance of a supersonic short-takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft. Analysis {{was based on a}} rigid-body mathematical model of the General Dynamics E- 7, a single engine configuration that utilizes ejectors and thrust deflection for propulsive lift. Alternatives investigated include increased static pitch, the addition of a close-coupled canard, use of boundary layer control to increase the takeoff lift coefficient, and the addition of a vectorable aft fan air nozzle. Other performance studies included the impact of individual E- 7 features, the sensitivity to <b>ejector</b> performance, the <b>effect</b> of removing the afterburners, and a determination of optional takeoff and landing transition methods. The results pertain to both the E- 7 and other configurations. Several alternatives were not as well suited to the E- 7 characteristics as they would be to an alternative configuration, and vice versa.

40|$|The flow-field {{within a}} {{two-dimensional}} thrust augmenting ejector {{has been documented}} experimentally. Results are presented on the mean velocity field and the turbulent correlations by Laser Doppler Velocimeter, surface pressure distribution, surface temperature distribution, and thrust performance for two shroud geometries. The maximum primary nozzle pressure ratio tested was 3. 0. The tests were conducted at primary nozzle temperature ratios of 1. 0, 1. 8 and 2. 7. Two ejector characteristic lengths have been identified based on {{the dynamics of the}} ejector flow field, i. e., a minimum length L sub m below which no significant mixing occurs, and a critical length L sub c associated with the development of U'V' correlation in the ejector. These characteristic lengths divide the ejector flow field into three distinctive regions: the entrance region where there is no direct interaction between the primary flow and the ejector shroud; the interaction region where there is an increased momentum of induced flow near the shroud surface; and a pipe flow region characterized by an increased skin friction where x is the distance downstream from the <b>ejector</b> inlet. The <b>effect</b> of the coflowing induced flow has been shown to produce inside the ejector a centerline velocity that has increased over the free-jet data...|$|R
40|$|A turbine-engine-based hybrid {{propulsion}} system is described. Turbojet engines are integrated with a single-throat ramjet {{so as to}} minimize variable geometry and eliminate redundant propulsion components. The result is a simple, lightweight system that is operable from takeoff to high Mach numbers. Non-afterburning turbojets are mounted within the ramjet duct. They exhaust through a converging-diverging (C-D) nozzle into a common ramjet burner section. At low speed the <b>ejector</b> <b>effect</b> of the C-D nozzle aerodynamically isolates the relatively high pressure turbojet exhaust stream from the ramjet duct. As the Mach number increases, and the turbojet pressure ratio diminishes, the system is biased naturally toward ramjet operation. The common ramjet burner is fueled with hydrogen and thermally choked, thus avoiding the weight and complexity of a variable geometry, split-flow exhaust system. The mixed-compression supersonic inlet and subsonic diffuser are also common to both the turbojet and ramjet cycles. As the compressor face total temperature limit is approached, a two-position flap within the inlet is actuated, which closes off the turbojet inlet and provides increased internal contraction for ramjet operation. Similar actuation of the turbojet C-D nozzle flap completes the enclosure of the turbojet. Performance of the hybrid system is compared herein {{to that of the}} discrete turbojet and ramjet engines from takeoff to Mach 6. The specific impulse of the hybrid system falls below that of the non-integrated turbojet and ramjet because of ejector and Rayleigh losses. Unlike the discrete turbojet or ramjet however, the hybrid system produces thrust over the entire Mach number range. An alternate mode of operation for takeoff and low speed is also described. In this mode the C-D nozzle flap is deflected to a third position, which closes off the ramjet duct and eliminates the ejector total pressure loss...|$|E
40|$|An {{absorption}} {{power cycle}} with two ejectors is proposed for {{ocean thermal energy}} conversion. The ammonia–water is used as the working fluid. The ejectors are driven by vapor and solution from the sub-generator. Based on {{the first and second}} law, the mathematical model for this cycle is developed and theoretical analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of thermodynamic parameters on the performance of this cycle. Results show that the absorption temperature is increased by 2. 0 – 6. 5 _C by employing the two-stage ejector sub-cycle, which indicates that this proposed cycle can be driven with a lower temperature difference. Further, the thermal efficiency, net thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of this cycle can reach to 4. 17 %, 3. 10 % and 39. 92 % respectively. Besides, the generation pressure, the heating source temperature, the solution concentration, and the expansion ratio, as well as the entrainment ratio of the first stage <b>ejector</b> have significant <b>effects</b> on the absorption temperature, the thermal efficiency, the exergy efficiency and the exergy loss of this cycle. In addition, 49. 80 % of exergy loss in this proposed cycle occurs in the generators and reheater, followed by the ejectors of 36. 12 %...|$|R
40|$|A vapour jet {{refrigeration}} system (VJRS) {{is an alternative}} to the conventional mechanically driven vapor-compression {{refrigeration system}}. The VJRS utilizes a supersonic ejector as a thermal compressor and has the potential to reduce energy consumption in refrigeration systems [1]. In the present study, the performance characteristics of VJRS ejectors with R 134 a as refrigerant have been investigated numerically using ANSYS Fluent. VJRS works on the principle that the high-pressure vapour from generator gets expanded through the convergent-divergent nozzle to produce high velocity stream which entrain the refrigerant vapour from the evaporator. Both the streams mix together in the mixing chamber. It results in pressure rise in the mixing chamber due to formation of shock waves followed by flow through the diffuser. The constant pressure mixing chamber where primary and entrained fluids mix together is the area of concern in the ejector. In the present work, two-dimensional analysis on the ejector geometry of VJRS (capacity = 3. 5 kW) is carried out to examine the turbulent behavior and boundary layer distribution in the constant pressure mixing chamber. Also the performance of ejector at low generator temperature and low evaporator temperature has been evaluated. In addition, the present study includes the effect of area ratio and mixing chamber length of the <b>ejector.</b> Turbulence <b>effects</b> in the <b>ejector</b> have been modeled using the standard k-epsilon turbulence model [2]. The primary nozzle profile is developed by method of characteristics. The geometry presented here uses five different values of throat area ratio for fixed diameter of constant area mixing chamber. The exit diameter of the convergent-divergent nozzle, diameter and length of diffuser and length of constant area mixing chamber have been optimised. The ejector geometry is assumed axisymmetric and quadrilateral mesh is used for the present study. The computed results are initially validated with available literature and experimental data. For the numerical simulations on the selected ejector, generator temperature is varied from 340 K to 370 K, the condenser temperature is varied from 290 K to 310 K and the evaporator temperature is varied from 263 K to 283 K. The numerical results obtained contribute to understanding the local structure of the flow and demonstrate the role of the secondary choking in deciding the entrainment ratio. Moreover, the results help in identifying the optimum operating condition for each value of nozzle throat area ratio...|$|R
40|$|Two-phase {{ejectors}} are devices {{capable of}} improving the performance of refrigeration and air conditioning cycles by means of expansion work recovery. Ejector studies often focus on the design and performance of the two-phase <b>ejector</b> and the <b>effect</b> it can have {{on the performance of}} the ejector cycle. However, the ejector is not the only component of the system that can have a significant influence on the performance of the ejector cycle. Recent experimental work has shown that the effect of evaporator design on ejector cycle performance can be quite significant, though there is very little research available on the relation between evaporator design and ejector cycle performance. In this paper, a numerical model of a microchannel air-to-refrigerant evaporator, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects, is developed and used to investigate the effect that different evaporator dimensions have on the performance of ejector cycles. The model is validated with experimental data from previous ejector cycle studies. There are two ejector cycles of interest: The standard ejector cycle, in which the ejector is used to directly lift the compressor suction pressure, and the ejector recirculation cycle, in which the ejector recirculates excess liquid through the evaporator but does not directly lift compressor suction pressure. The effects of microchannel port hydraulic diameter, number of evaporator passes, refrigerant outlet state, and air-side resistance are investigated. The analysis is performed with refrigerants R 134 a and CO 2 (R 744) in order to demonstrate how proper evaporator and ejector cycle design is different for different refrigerants...|$|R
40|$|A Vapour Jet Refrigeration System (VJRS) is an {{alternative}} to the conventional mechanically driven vapour-compression refrigeration system. The VJRS utilises a supersonic ejector as a thermal compressor and has the potential significantly to reduce energy consumption in air conditioning systems. Experimental investigations and analysis of large supersonic jet ejectors such as those used for steam jet refrigeration, has been carried out in past literature. In the present study the performance characteristics of small VJRS ejectors using R 12 as the working fluid (ie ejectors with throat diameters of several millimetres only) have been investigated using experimental, analytical and C F D (computational fluid dynamics) techniques. In practice ejector performance may be affected by the choking phenomena in the secondary stream, superheating of vapour leaving the evaporator and generator, nozzle and diffuser efficiency. The present author developed a model for a small, single-fluid VJRS ejector using the theory of secondary vapour choking which was introduced by Munday and Bagster (1977). This theory was employed by the present researcher to design and test a small R 12 ejector. Results of a computer simulation that models secondary choking in the converging part of the <b>ejector</b> and the <b>effects</b> of superheat conditions on the ejector performance are presented. In the present work further developed has been carried out to examine the optimum nozzle position when the ejectors operated at fully developed choked conditions. It has been confirmed that for the small ejectors the choking phenomenon {{plays an important role in}} ejector performance. It was also recognised that the nozzle position is a very important factor of the ejector geometry for small VJRS ejectors. In the secondary choking theory, ejector performance may be taken to be a function of the 2 ̆ 2 effective area 2 ̆ 2 available to the secondary fluid within the mixing chamber of the ejector. The present study involved experimental investigation of how this effective area is influenced by operating conditions such as evaporator temperature and nozzle position. In the present investigation the geometry of the converging part of the ejector has also been studied and the shock pressure recovery process examined in the constant area mixing tube. The present author has developed a CFD simulation of the ejector using the PHOENICS-BFC code based on the finite volumetric technique. Comparisons have been made between the predictions of the entrainment ratio using the one-dimensional, constant area analysis, CFD results and experimental results. In the present study analysis of two-fluid VJRS ejectors carried out based on the one-dimensional analysis, constant area method. It was found that using an appropriate fluid-pair, the entrainment ratio is likely to be substantially better than for the single fluid VJRS...|$|R
