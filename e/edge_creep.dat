40|$|Metamaterial (MTM) {{absorbers}} {{are typically}} {{designed to reduce}} specular reflection from a flat and infinite metallic ground plane. In reality, however, absorbing coatings are applied to curved surfaces, implying the need of suppressing further scattering mechanisms (<b>edge</b> diffraction, <b>creeping</b> and surface waves). This paper is an overview of our recent theoretical and experimental results on electromagnetic scattering from canonically shaped electrically large scatterers with MTM coatings...|$|R

The mesoblast appears as solid mesoblastic somites. In the section above Figure 4 this layer is shown as having split into somatopleur (so.) and splanchnopleur (spch.). Figure 3 answers to Figure 6 of the frog, and Figure 4 is a later stage, in which the medullary groove is beginning to close at its middle part. The clear club-shaped area around the embryo (a.p.) is the area pellucida; the larger area without this is the area opaca (a.o.), in which the first bloodvessels arise by a running together and a specialization of cells. The entire germinal area grows steadily at its <b>edges</b> to <b>creep</b> over and enclose the yolk.|$|R
40|$|Spline and {{polynomial}} type {{surfaces are}} commonly used in high frequency modeling of complex structures such as aircraft, ships, reflectors, etc. It is therefore of interest to develop an efficient and accurate solution to describe the scattered fields from such surfaces. An extended Uniform Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (UTD) solution for the scattering and diffraction from perfectly conducting cubic polynomial strips is derived and involves the incomplete Airy integrals as canonical functions. This new solution is universal in nature {{and can be used}} to effectively describe the scattered fields from flat, strictly concave or convex, and concave convex boundaries containing edges. The classic UTD solution fails to describe the more complicated field behavior associated with higher order phase catastrophes and therefore a new set of uniform reflection and first-order edge diffraction coefficients is derived. Also, an additional diffraction coefficient associated with a zero-curvature (inflection) point is presented. Higher order effects such as double <b>edge</b> diffraction, <b>creeping</b> waves, and whispering gallery modes are not examined. The extended UTD solution is independent of the scatterer size and also provides useful physical insight into the various scattering and diffraction processes. Its accuracy is confirmed via comparison with some reference moment method results...|$|R
5000|$|As part of Executive Producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins's, {{attempt to}} modernise EastEnders and to reflect trendy areas in East London like Shoreditch, Sharon and Phil {{were given a}} new wine bar in the soap to front in 2014. Treadwell-Collins said to the Radio Times: [...] "It should feel more like London. It's been frozen in aspic for too long. Sharon said {{recently}} that she's looking to be a landlady. As a result you'll see the <b>edges</b> of Shoreditch <b>creeping</b> into EastEnders. It's got to reflect the modern world." [...] Treadwell-Collins stated that his aim {{was not to be}} too pretentious or [...] "try-hard cool" [...] with Sharon's new bar, but for the bar to be somewhere where viewers would want to visit and something for them to laugh at.|$|R
40|$|A uniform {{geometrical}} optics (UGO) and an extended uniform geometrical theory of diffraction (EUTD) solution is {{developed for the}} scattering and diffraction from perfectly conducting cubic polynomial strips. The new solution overcomes the difficulties of the classic GO/UTD solution near caustics and composite shadow boundaries. The approach for constructing the UGO/EUTD solution {{is based on a}} spatial domain physical optics (PO) radiation integral representation for the scattered field which is then reduced using a uniform asymptotic procedure. New uniform reflection, zero-curvature diffraction, and edge diffraction coefficients are derived and involve the ordinary and incomplete Airy integrals as canonical functions. Higher order effects such as double <b>edge</b> diffraction, edge-excited <b>creeping</b> waves, and whispering gallery modes are not examined in this work. The UGO/EUTD solution is very efficient and provides useful physical insight into the various scattering and diffraction processes. It is also universal in nature and can be used to effectively describe the scattered fields from flat, strictly concave or convex, and concave-convex boundaries containing edges. Its accuracy is confirmed via comparison with some reference moment method (MM) results...|$|R
40|$|A current {{research}} focus in subsonic aeronautics is {{the reduction of}} noise, emissions and fuel burn. The Silent Aircraft Initiative, NASA N+ 2 and N+ 3 projects are examples of recent efforts investigating innovative aircraft configurations to meet the future goals of air transportation. This requires novel methodologies to assess unconventional aircraft designs. This thesis {{is part of the}} N+ 2 program and focuses on the development of a method for the assessment of turbomachinery noise shielding in hybrid wing body aircraft. The preliminary design and assessment of novel aircraft configurations require both low computational cost and versatility of the shielding method. High fidelity methods, such as for example boundary element methods, are computationally expensive and not amenable for optimization framework integration. On the other hand, low fidelity methods, such as the barrier shielding method, are limited in their source and geometry definitions. The diffraction integral method is a simplified ray tracing method capturing <b>edge</b> diffracted rays. <b>Creeping</b> rays and reflected rays are not accounted for making the method suitable for flat geometries with sharp edges.

40|$|Asymptotic/high-frequency {{solutions}} are developed for analyzing the non-specular scattering mechanisms associated with coated convex surfaces and edges simulated by approximate boundary conditions. In particular, the standard impedance boundary conditions (SIBC's) {{and the second}} order generalized impedance boundary conditions (GIBC's) are employed for a characterization of the <b>edge</b> diffraction, <b>creeping</b> wave, and surface diffracted wave contributions. To study the creeping wave and surface diffracted wave mechanisms, rigorous UTD (uniform geometrical theory of diffraction) diffraction coefficients are developed for a convex coated cylinder simulated with SIBC's and GIBC's. The ray solutions obtained remain valid in the transition region and reduce uniformly {{to those in the}} deep lit and shadow regions. A uniform asymptotic solution is also presented for observations in the close vicinity of the cylinder. The diffraction coefficient for a convex cylinder are obtained via a generalization of the corresponding ones of the circular cylinder. To validate the asymptotic/high-frequency solution, integral equations are derived for both E and H-polarization and solved numerically using the method of moments. Results are presented for a single and three layered coated convex cylinder. Some insights are also provided on the accuracy of the employed GIBC's versus SIBC's for application to curved surfaces. To characterize the scattering by impedance wedges illuminated at skew incidence, diffraction coefficients are derived from an approximate solution of the governing functional difference equations. This solution exactly recovers the known ones for an impedance half plane or an arbitrary wedge at normal incidence, and to validate it for other wedge angles, a moment method code was used. Finally, to test the usefulness of the approximate skew incidence impedance wedge diffraction coefficient for three dimensional structures, equivalent currents are derived {{in the context of the}} physical theory of diffraction (PTD) for a finite length impedance wedge of arbitrary internal angles. These are incorporated in a standard general purpose PTD code and results are presented for a number of different impedance structures...|$|R
40|$|Anticipating the {{implementation}} of advanced SiC/SiC composites into turbine section components of future aero-propulsion engines, the primary objective of this on-going study is to develop physics-based analytical and finite-element modeling tools to predict the effects of constituent creep on SiC/SiC component service life. A second objective is {{to understand how to}} possibly manipulate constituent materials and processes in order to minimize these effects. Focusing on SiC/SiC components experiencing through-thickness stress gradients (e. g., airfoil leading <b>edge),</b> prior NASA <b>creep</b> modeling studies showed that detrimental residual stress effects can develop globally within the component walls which can increase the risk of matrix cracking. These studies assumed that the SiC/SiC composites behaved as isotropic viscoelastic continuum materials with creep behavior that was linear and symmetric with stress and that the creep parameters could be obtained from creep data as experimentally measured in-plane in the fiber direction of advanced thin-walled 2 D SiC/SiC panels. The present study expands on those prior efforts by including constituent behavior with non-linear stress dependencies in order to predict such key creep-related SiC/SiC properties as time-dependent matrix stress, constituent creep and content effects on composite creep rates and rupture times, and stresses on fiber and matrix during and after creep...|$|R

The diffraction integral method is a simplified ray tracing method capturing <b>edge</b> diffracted rays. <b>Creeping</b> rays and reflected rays are not accounted for making the method suitable for flat geometries with sharp edges. It is based on the Maggi-Rubinowicz formulation of the Kirchoff diffraction theory for monopole source descriptions and is inherently a high frequency method. The diffraction line integral requires numerical integration and does not account for flight effects. A new method described in this thesis was developed to address these shortcomings. It is based on the Miyamoto and Wolf formulation of the boundary diffraction theory to allow the definition of source directivity inherent to turbomachinery noise. It is amenable to multipole and directional point source descriptions. Bulk flight effects are modelled with a generalized Prandtl-Glauert approach. Computational cost is dramatically decreased using uniform asymptotic theory to reduce the diffraction integral into a simple Fresnel integral. The Fresnel integral is solved via an analytical approximation such that the resulting shielding method does not require numerical integration. The method is applicable to three-dimensional aircraft configurations and comparison with an equivalent source method for sphere and disk shielding test cases show good agreement at high frequencies. Its analytical formulation offers compatibility with optimization frameworks facilitating new perspectives in aircraft design for noise reduction. by Dorian Frederic Marie Colas. Thesis (S. M.)
