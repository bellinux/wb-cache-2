25|$|Tourism is {{important}} to the state as it is the only sector that is growing and brings substantial income from outside the state, although most tourism is concentrated in the capital and along the coast. In 2007, there were 1,927 small grocery stores, 70 tianguis and 167 municipal markets. Tourism accounts for about 30% of the commerce sector of Oaxaca's economy.

In 2004, the United States signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with India even though the latter is {{not a part of}} the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The US argued that India's strong nuclear non-proliferation record made it an exception, however this has not persuaded other Nuclear Suppliers Group members to sign similar deals with India.

25|$|At a site just to {{the east}} of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington and Chelsea Council <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> for a station at North Kensington / Kensal off Ladbroke Grove & Canal Way, as a {{turn-back}} facility will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Rise, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Amongst the general public there is a huge amount of support for the project and Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail's overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost of a Crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the Borough. TfL is conducting a feasibility study on the station and the project is backed by National Grid, retailers Sainsbury's and Cath Kidston, and Jenny Jones (Green Party member of the London Assembly).|$|E

In João Marcelino view, [...] "The game between Porto and Benfica had to {{forcibly}} answer some questions — {{and it did not}} disappoint expectations. The easy win by Fernando Santos' team clearly showed who still is, almost six years later, the best team in domestic football; and the way that Jupp Heynckes accepted defeat could be used as evidence that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> his players to their current limit." ...|$|E

500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> the envelope to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wen has {{progressively}} amped up {{his liberal}} rhetoric as his Premiership continued, remarking in August 2010 that [...] "Without political reform, China may lose {{what it has}} already achieved through economic restructuring". Wen's comments were largely censored in state media, but he gained support {{from a group of}} some 23 party elders in October, who denounced the authorities' censorship of Wen's remarks in an open letter to the National People's Congress. In an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's Global Public Square television program aired in October 2010, Wen made the following statement: [...] "I have summed up my political ideals into the following four sentences. [...] To let everyone lead a happy life with dignity. [...] To let everyone feel safe and secure. [...] To let the society be one with equity and justice. [...] And to let everyone have confidence in the future. [...] In spite of the various discussions and views in the society, and in spite of some resistance, I will act in accordance with these ideals unswervingly, and advance within the realm of my capabilities political restructuring. [...] I will like to tell you the following two sentences to reinforce my view on this point. [...] I will not fall in spite of the strong wind and harsh rain, and I will not yield until the last day of my life." [...] At the 2012 National People's Congress, Wen mentioned the word [...] "reform" [...] 70 times. He remarked that China must [...] "press ahead with both economic structural reforms and political structural reforms, in particular reforms on the leadership system of the Party and the country." [...] There is also indication from party insiders that Wen <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> the case for the political rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.|$|E
