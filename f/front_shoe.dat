60|$|The morning passed, with Wade slowly {{climbing}} {{to the edge}} of the black timber. Then, in a hollow where a spring gushed forth, he saw the tracks of a few cattle that had halted to drink, and on top of these the tracks of a horse with a crooked left <b>front</b> <b>shoe.</b> The rider of this horse had dismounted. There was an imprint of a cowboy's boot, and near it little sharp circles with dots in the center.|$|E
60|$|Wade {{remained}} {{all night}} with Lewis, and next morning rode six miles along the divide, and then down into a valley, where at length he found a cabin described by the prospector. It was well hidden in {{the edge of the}} forest, where a spring gushed from under a low cliff. But for water and horse tracks Wade would not have found it easily. Rifle in hand, and on foot, he slipped around in the woods, as a hunter might have, to stalk drinking deer. There were no smoke, no noise, no horses anywhere round the cabin, and after watching awhile Wade went forward to look at it. It was an old ramshackle hunter's or prospector's cabin, with dirt floor, a crumbling fireplace and chimney, and a bed platform made of boughs. Including the door, it had three apertures, and the two smaller ones, serving as windows, looked {{as if they had been}} intended for port-holes as well. The inside of the cabin was large and unusually well lighted, owing to the windows and to the open chinks between the logs. Wade saw a deck of cards lying bent and scattered in one corner, as if a violent hand had flung them against the wall. Strange that Wade's memory returned a vivid picture of Jack Belllounds in just that act of violence! The only other thing around the place which earned scrutiny from Wade was a number of horseshoe tracks outside, with the left <b>front</b> <b>shoe</b> track familiar to him. He examined the clearest imprints very carefully. If they had not been put there by Wilson Moore's white mustang, Spottie, then they had been made by a horse with a strangely similar hoof and shoe. Spottie had a hoof malformed, somewhat in the shape of a triangle, and the iron shoe to fit it always had to be bent, so that the curve was sharp and the ends closer together than those of his other shoes.|$|E
5000|$|A.P. Indy {{was given}} the summer off to allow his hoof to {{completely}} heal, then returned on September 13 with a dull performance in the Molson Export Million, finishing fifth. On October 10, he {{finished third in the}} Jockey Club Gold Cup after stumbling at the start and tearing off his right <b>front</b> <b>shoe.</b> [...] "There wasn't much foot left," [...] Drysdale recalled later. [...] "Fortunately, acrylic had just been developed, and farrier Joey Carroll rebuilt his foot that night." [...] Finishing ahead of him were Pleasant Tap, who was having an outstanding year, and Strike the Gold, the previous year's Kentucky Derby winner.|$|E

5000|$|Bell {{boots are}} usually worn to prevent {{overreaching}} (when the horse [...] "grabs" [...] his front heels with {{the toes of}} his back feet, resulting in injury), or if the horse is wearing shoe studs, {{to protect him from}} accidentally injuring himself with the stud of the opposing hoof. In some cases a horse with corrective or poor shoeing wears shoes that protrude behind the foot, making it easier for a horse to overreach and spring or completely pull off the shoe. This is most commonly seen when the horse is jumping, working in mud or on a slippery surface, running cross-country, or longeing, and bell boots can help prevent this from occurring. Bell boots are occasionally worn when shipping a horse, if the bandages or boots used do not provide protection to the heel region, or if a horse tends to pull his <b>front</b> <b>shoes</b> by stepping on them with his back feet. Bell boots are also sometimes used when the horse is turned out, for extra protection or to help prevent him from accidentally pulling a shoe if he is especially exuberant while playing.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{generation}} of the shoe was introduced during the 2014 CrossFit Games. The <b>front</b> of the <b>shoe</b> has a duracage protection layer and enhanced toe-wrap for durability. It also features a rigid sole that provides more grip and stability than the previous Nano models.|$|R

50|$|Hammer toes are {{unsightly}} {{and reveal}} a toe that is curled {{due to a}} bend in the middle joint of the toe. A hammer toe occur chiefly because the shoe is too tight at the front or the heels are too high.

25|$|The City Turbo's {{suspension}} {{was more}} refined {{than that of}} the ordinary City. The four-wheel independent system used progressive rate coil springs, with stabilizers at both the front and the rear. Tires were the 165/70HR12 radials, and stopping power was provided by ventilated disc brakes at the <b>front</b> and semi-metallic <b>shoes</b> at the rear. The Turbo II's flared fenders weren't just cosmetic, but were necessary to accommodate a 30mm (20mm in the rear) wider track and bigger 185/60 R13 tires.|$|R
50|$|Fort Elliott had a dual purpose: (1) It quieted the Indians on the {{reservation}} while the slaughter of the bison continued, (2) It encouraged Anglo-Americans to settle beyond the 100th meridian. As soon as the fort was established, the cattle industry expanded throughout northwest Texas. Ranches were established on the open range between 1876, with the JA Ranch, and 1886, with the fencing of the XIT Ranch. Fort Elliott was situated on a high elevation of Sweetwater Creek, with the <b>front</b> of the <b>shoe</b> facing the southwest.|$|R
50|$|It {{was once}} the largest retail shoe store in the South, and earned a {{reputation}} as the premiere footwear store in downtown Nashville. The most up-to-date electric lighting and holophone reflectors provided lighting for the store. Its <b>front</b> window displayed <b>shoes</b> on revolving pedestals.

Also, the BSA Gold Star was proving formidable opposition in the Clubman Racing scene, so popular in the 1950s. So sales of the 1950s Norton International were somewhat muted, and by the mid-1950s it had disappeared from the catalogue, available only to special order.|$|R
50|$|The well-proven Venom was {{improved}} by Velocette designer (and owning-family member) Bertie Goodman with rearward placed footrests having brake pedal and remote gear-change linkage to suit, close-ratio four speed gearbox, alloy rims, twin-leading <b>shoe</b> <b>front</b> brake and 'clip-on' handle bars. The engine gained a race specification cylinder head to accommodate extra-large valves, a downdraught inlet port and an Amal 5GP2 13/8 bore carburettor with extended inlet tract {{which was so}} long it required a special cut out {{in the rear of}} the fuel tank.

500|$|Of the {{aforementioned}} equipment, climbing shoes {{have the most}} direct impact on performance. Besides protecting the climber's feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes {{are designed to help}} the climber secure and maintain footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear, and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations: High-top shoes, for example, provide better protection for the ankle, while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The <b>front</b> of the <b>shoe,</b> called the [...] "toe box", can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the run-up}} the bowler will bring his lead foot down on the pitch with the knee as {{straight}} as possible. This aids in generating speed but can be dangerous due to the pressure placed on the joint by this action. Knee injuries are not uncommon amongst fast bowlers: for example, the English pace bowler David Lawrence was sidelined for many months after splitting his kneecap in two. The pressure on the leading foot is such that some fast bowlers cut the <b>front</b> off their <b>shoes</b> to stop their toes from being injured as they are repeatedly pressed against the inside of the shoe. The bowler will then bring their bowling arm up over their head and release the ball at the height appropriate to where they want the ball to pitch. Again, the arm must be straight although this is a stipulation of the laws of cricket rather than an aid to speed. Bending the elbow and [...] "chucking" [...] the ball would make it too easy for the bowler to aim accurately at the batsman's wicket and get them out.|$|R
