The enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (ePOP) instrument suite will be launched on the Canadian CASSIOPE spacecraft in early 2008 for space-ground coordinated research. This low-earth-orbit payload will include three instruments for radio-scientific investigation of the ionosphere.

RRI will be fed by four 3 -metre monopoles, arranged in a crossed configuration, each connected to a high-input <b>impedance</b> <b>preamplifier.</b> The RRI bandwidth will extend from 10 Hz to 18 MHz. RRI will measure the electric fields of either spontaneous waves or waves created by ground transmitters, such as ionosondes, high-frequency radars and ionospheric heaters.

40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{includes}} two separated parts: (1) Probabilistic Discriminant Analysis for fMRI analysis. A novel functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data analysis framework is developed to detect neural activated brain regions {{based on an}} iterative segmentation that exploits probabilistic discriminant analysis (PDA). Given hemodynamic response function (HRF) model and experiment paradigm, the PDA framework alternates between estimation of the hemodynamic response (HDR) signals and noise component for clusters of brain voxels and refinement of the voxel segmentation. The latter process is effected through minimization of misclassification risk. The ensemble of HDRs helps to reduce the multiple comparison problems that exist in conventional univariate analysis of fMRI data. The statistical parametric mapping is generated by a general linear model (GLM) approach, but operating on the final optimized clusters rather than individual voxels. Assessment of the PDA framework using synthetic activation data embedded in temporally and spatially correlated noise shows that when optimized using a linear discrimination function, the PDA method outperforms the traditional regular GLM and independent component analysis (ICA) approaches. Comparison among these methods of results from human data suggests that the PDA framework can enhance both sensitivity and specificity, yielding more reliable detection of activated brain regions for fMRI studies. ^ (2) Model-based Tuning Algorithm for MRI coil array. A model-based tuning method for MRI receiver coils is developed that optimal tunable component values can be predicted and manual operations in coil tuning process can be minimized. For multi-element/channel MRI receiver arrays, it is generally difficult to achieve effective isolation among all channels by only overlapping neighborhood coil loops. Applying low input <b>impedance</b> <b>preamplifier</b> after matching network is the major technique used for non-adjacent coil loop isolation, also known as preamp decoupling method. For MRI coil array tuning, besides matching loaded coil impedance for optimized the preamplifier noise figure at resonant frequency, maximizing the <b>preamplifier</b> decoupling <b>impedance</b> is also essential to constrain current flow in the coil loop thus reduce inductive coupling between coil channels. Both matching and <b>preamplifier</b> decoupling <b>impedances</b> can be adjusted by tunable components (typically capacitors) in the coil circuit. Given that circuit component values vary from nominal values, tuning operations beyond initial coil assembling are necessary so that coil elements can meet tuning specifications. Conventional manual tuning approach requires human experience and iterates over alternate steps of tuning the matching <b>impedance</b> and <b>preamplifier</b> decoupling <b>impedance</b> seperately. It costs extra tuning operations and capacitors {{in order to meet}} both impedance specifications simultaneously. The proposed model-based tuning method utilizes a parameterized coil model to estimate component values from impedance measurements and predict values of tunable components such that all specifications can be satisfied. From both simualtion and experiment on coil array tuning, the proposed method takes less tuning operations and also achieves more optimal matching performance than manual tuning method. ...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{research}} in magnetic resonance engineering focuses on reducing the acquisition time for obtaining an image while simultaneously maximizing the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) of the image. It is known that improvement in imaging time or resolution is obtained {{at the cost of}} SNR. Therefore wherever possible, RF coil engineers design the coil in such a manner so as to maximize SNR for that coil design. In one such design consideration, most coil designers prefer placing low <b>impedance</b> <b>preamplifiers</b> near the coil. The further the pre-amplifiers are from the coil, the greater will be the signal loss due to transmission and higher will be its input impedance as perceived at the coil which would degrade inter-coil isolation. Owing to the current trend of using increasing number of receiver channels (32, 64 or 128) for parallel imaging, placing the preamplifiers near the coil would greatly complicate the coil construction. The primary objective of this research was to find the relation between SNR and referred preamp impedance and whether preamps need to be placed on the coil, or if they can be placed outside the magnet {{at the end of a}} transmission line which would simplify the construction of large count array. In addition, SNR was studied as a function of coil design parameters - coil loading, array coil separation, and system frequency. Both theoretical and experimental methods were used to undertake this investigation. A popular electromagnetic modeling technique, finite difference time domain (FDTD), was used to model SNR in arrays of two 3 inch loop coils at 3 T and 1. 5 T. Results were also verified through bench measurement at 3 T and 1. 5 T and by evaluating SNR. To verify the robustness of our results and to assess the possibility of using low cost standard 50 ohm preamps, we carried out additional bench measurements at 4. 7 T.

Moreover, for compactness, the chips must be embedded inside the detector making crucial the reduction of the power consumption to 10 µWatt per channel. This is achieved using power pulsing, made possible by the ILC bunch pattern (1 ms of acquisition data for 199 ms of dead time).

40|$|Purpose/Introduction: Homogeneous {{excitation}} at field strengths {{as high as}} 9. 4 T {{is achieved}} by RF shimming approaches using parallel transmission through an array of independent RF coils. An actively detunable transmit array with 16 -elements arranged in two rows of 8 -elements each was built for this purpose[1]. Receive-only coil arrays constructed using close fitting helmets provide significant gain in SNR over volume coils[2]. In this work, we design a 31 -channel receive-only head array which operates {{in combination with the}} 16 -element transmit array[1]. Subjects and Methods: Experiments were performed on a Siemens 9. 4 T whole body MR scanner with a head gradient insert. 31 -receive elements were arranged in 4 rows on a tight fitting helmet. The top 2 rows have 10 -elements each and there were 7 -elements on the 3 rd row and 4 -elements on the 4 th row. 10 mm spacing was provided between the elements of the same row and they were decoupled inductively. The bottom row was rotated {{in such a way that}} it could be geometrically overlapped with 2 adjacent elements from the top row(Fig. 1). Even though our scanner is equipped with 32 -receive channels, an additional element was not added to one of the bottom 2 rows to preserve the left-right symmetry in the receive array. In addition to a protection fuse, the coil elements have 6 fixed and one variable capacitor. Low noise, small footprint preamplifiers (WanTcom Inc. USA) were installed on the coil. The coil is matched to 50 -Ohms using a tissue equivalent phantom. Cable traps were incorporated before and after the preamplifier and an additional trap was installed on each of the 8 -channel receive cable. Results: Unloaded-Q of a single isolated loop was 158. The coil is sample noise dominated and the QUL/QL was 10 or more depending on the distance to the load. Active detuning during transmit was better than - 33 dB.
