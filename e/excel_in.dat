5|$|Geneforge 2 is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player's choice of answers during conversations with non-player characters affects how the player is regarded amongst the game's four factions. The player character is an apprentice Shaper, a feared and secretive group who can create life. Players create a character {{from one of}} three character classes and explore the area surrounding Drypeak, a failing Shaper colony, solving quests and gaining experience. Each of the three character classes has a particular playing style and can approach tasks in different ways. Guardians are fighters who <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents are the game's version of rogues, and <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Players can also convince certain non-player characters to join them.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the American Kennel Club(AKC) and the Labrador's breed club {{have set}} the breed {{standard}} to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> both {{the field and the}} show ring, are becoming more unusual.|$|E
5|$|Devin Hester {{was born}} to Juanita Brown and Lenorris Hester, Sr. in Riviera Beach, Florida. His parents {{separated}} {{when he was a}} toddler. Before he became a teenager, his mother was severely injured in a car accident, while his father died of cancer two years later. His step-father, Derrick Brown, and brother, Lenorris, Jr., helped Hester escape his depression and rebuild his life by introducing him to football. He soon returned to his normal life and began to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> sports and academics.|$|E

5|$|Hawks was {{an average}} student {{at school and}} did not <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> sports, but by 1910 had {{discovered}} coaster racing, an early form of soapbox racing. In 1911, Hawks's youngest sibling Helen died suddenly of food poisoning. From 1910 to 1912, Hawks attended Pasadena High School. But in 1912, the Hawks family moved to nearby Glendora, California, where Frank Hawks owned orange groves. Hawks finished his junior {{year of high school}} at Citrus Union High School in Glendora. During this time he worked as a barnstorming pilot.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{thrives on}} change and new experiences, and many {{handlers}} find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead {{it to find}} solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick was {{overshadowed by}} Michael Vaughan during the 2002–03 Ashes series, {{averaging}} only 26.10 {{with a top}} score of 72 in comparison to Vaughan's average of 63.30 and three centuries. Trescothick averaged 31.60 across 10 matches in the VB Series, but England were outplayed by Australia throughout the tour. Trescothick failed to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> the 2003 World Cup as England failed {{to qualify for the}} knock-out stages. In his five matches, Trescothick's top score was 58 against Namibia, with a tournament average of 23.20.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Bolt {{responded to}} {{claims that he}} was a lazy athlete, saying that the {{comments}} were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential. However, he surmised that such comments stemmed from his lack of enthusiasm for the 400 metres event, and chose to not make the effort to train for distance running. Turning his efforts to the 200 m, Bolt proved that he could <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> multiple events—first setting the world-leading time in Ostrava, then breaking the national record for the second time with a 19.67 s finish in Athens, Greece. Although Mills still preferred that Bolt focus on the longer distances, the acceptance of Bolt's demand to run in the 100 m worked for both sprinter and trainer. Bolt was more focused in practice, and a training schedule to boost his top speed and his stamina, in preparation for the Olympics, had improved both his 100 m and 200 m times.|$|E
5|$|In September 1933, Bruce was {{appointed}} by Lyons to replace the ailing Sir Granville Ryrie as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, giving him ambassadorial rank. He formally resigned from parliament on 7 October 1933. Bruce would <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> the new post, becoming a trusted confidant among Conservative politicians and a familiar face in British government circles, which led to him at one point considering entering British politics formally. Bruce was particularly close to Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, with whom he frequently consulted, and was notably influential in pressing for Edward VIII's abdication in 1936. His importance and power in London was {{due in part to}} the free rein that Lyons gave him a rarity in the history of the position. Combined with the turmoil and frequent ministerial changes within the Commonwealth Department of External Affairs, Bruce was generally credited as Australia's most influential and credible international representative during his posting, often determining matters of foreign policy in his own right.|$|E
5|$|Like {{traditional}} role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts {{features an}} experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, {{gaining access to}} new abilities. Unlike other games of its type, Kingdom Hearts allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found {{at the beginning of}} the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.|$|E

5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Other than {{finishing}} as runners-up in Allsvenskan in 1996, {{the team}} did not <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s, as the club {{failed to win}} Allsvenskan and Svenska Cupen throughout the entire decade. The 1990s ended with relegation from Allsvenskan in 1999. Hans Cavalli-Björkman was succeeded as chairman by Bengt Madsen in 1999, and former player Hasse Borg was contracted as Director of Sport. These operational changes, {{as well as the}} emergence of young talent Zlatan Ibrahimović, led to the return to Allsvenskan in 2001. Ibrahimović rose to fame and became an important player in the club's campaign to return to the top league. He was later sold to Ajax in 2001, before playing for several European clubs in Italy's Serie A, FC Barcelona in Spain's La Liga, Paris Saint-Germain in France's Ligue 1, and his current club as of 2017, Manchester United F.C. in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Vrataski trains Cage to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> combat training. Frustrated by his {{continued}} failures to excel, he retreats to London to spare his own life, but discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Eventually receiving {{a vision of}} a dam in Germany, indicating that the Omega is hiding there, Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski, who lost a loved one to the Mimics, is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic struggling to bleed him out and strip off his ability to reset time. Before they can slowly bleed him to death, Cage deliberately drowns himself to avoid the process.|$|E

5|$|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were {{determined}} that their eldest son {{should have an}} education that would prepare {{him to be a}} model constitutional monarch. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister Victoria, Edward did not <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> his studies. He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—Benjamin Disraeli described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, Robert Bruce.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E

5|$|Agile, quick, creative, and powerful, Balotelli is {{credited}} with pace, flair, physical strength, technical ability, and an eye for goal; his height, elevation and physique allow him to <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> the air, and {{he is capable of}} scoring with his head or with either foot, from both inside or outside the area. Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired falconry bird, and {{has been used in}} falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, <b>excel</b> <b>in</b> the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E
