A major challenge in <b>data</b> <b>perturbation</b> is to balance privacy protection and data utility, which are normally considered {{as a pair of}} conflicting factors. We argue that selectively preserving the task/model specific information in perturbation will help achieve better privacy guarantee and better data utility. One type of such information is the multidimensional geometric information, which is implicitly utilized by many data mining models. To preserve this information in <b>data</b> <b>perturbation,</b> we propose the Geometric <b>Data</b> <b>Perturbation</b> (GDP) method. In this paper, we describe several aspects of the GDP method. First, we show that several types of well-known data mining models will deliver a comparable level of model quality over the geometrically perturbed dataset as over the original dataset. Second, we discuss the intuition behind the GDP method and compare it with other multidimensional perturbation methods such as random projection perturbation. Third, we propose a multi-column privacy evaluation framework for evaluating the effectiveness of geometric <b>data</b> <b>perturbation</b> with respect to different level of attacks. Finally, we use this evaluation framework to study a few attacks to geometrically perturbed datasets.

40|$|The {{security}} of organizational databases has received considerable {{attention in the}} literature in recent years. This {{can be attributed to}} a simultaneous increase in the amount of data being stored in databases, the analysis of such data, and the desire to protect confidential data. <b>Data</b> <b>perturbation</b> methods are often used to protect confidential, numerical data from unauthorized queries while providing maximum access and accurate information to legitimate queries. To provide accurate information, it is desirable that perturbation does not result in a change in relationships between attributes. In the presence of nonconfidential attributes, existing methods will result in such a change. This study describes a new method (General Additive <b>Data</b> <b>Perturbation)</b> that does not change relationships between attributes.

Despite the extensive attention on traditional stability of <b>data</b> <b>perturbations</b> or parameter variations, few studies include influences coming from the intrinsic randomness in generating VIMs, i. e. bagging, randomization and permutation. To address these influences, {{in this paper we}} introduce a new concept of intrinsic stability of VIMs, which is defined as the self-consistence among feature rankings in repeated runs of VIMs without <b>data</b> <b>perturbations</b> and parameter variations. Two widely used VIMs, i. e., Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) are comprehensively investigated. The motivation of this study is two-fold. First, we empirically verify the prevalence of intrinsic stability of VIMs over many real-world datasets to highlight that the instability of VIMs does not originate exclusively from <b>data</b> <b>perturbations</b> or parameter variations, but also stems from the intrinsic randomness of VIMs. Second, through Spearman and Pearson tests we comprehensively investigate how differen...|$|R

In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively by presenting such a <b>data</b> <b>perturbation</b> technique based on random substitutions.

How to efficiently mine a quality model without breaching each party’s privacy is the major challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach based on geometric <b>data</b> <b>perturbation</b> and datamining-service oriented framework. The key problem of applying geometric <b>data</b> <b>perturbation</b> in multiparty collaborative mining is to securely unify multiple geometric perturbations that are preferred by different parties, respectively. We have developed three protocols for perturbation unification. Our approach has three unique features compared to the existing approaches. (1) With geometric <b>data</b> <b>perturbation,</b> these protocols can work for many existing popular data mining algorithms, while most of other approaches are only designed for a particular mining algorithm.
