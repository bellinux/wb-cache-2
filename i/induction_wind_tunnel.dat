50|$|Stationary indoor {{vertical}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> include recirculating and non-recirculating types. Non-recirculating vertical <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> usually suck {{air through}} inlets {{near the bottom}} of the building, through the bodyflight area, and exhaust through the top of the building. Recirculating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> form an aerodynamic loop with turning vanes, similar to a scientific <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> but using a vertical loop with a bodyflight chamber within a vertical part of the loop. Recirculating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are usually built in climates that are too cold for non-recirculating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The airflow of an indoor vertical <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> is usually smoother and more controlled than that of an outdoor unit.

50|$|AGARD-B is a {{standard}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model (calibration model) {{that is used to}} verify, by comparison of test results with previously published data, the measurement chain in a wind tunnel.Together with its derivative AGARD-C it belongs to a family of AGARD standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models. Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> and Model Testing Panel in Rome, Italy, when it was decided to define two standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The idea was to establish standards of comparison between <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and improve the validity of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests. Among the standard <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular. Initially intended for the supersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> the AGARD-B configuration has since been tested in many <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> at a wide range of Mach numbers, from low subsonic (Mach 0.1), through transonic (Mach 0.7 to 1.4) to hypersonic (Mach 8 and above).

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{describe}} the end-to-end model of a plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> A plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> is an useful facility for the ground-based experiment of high enthalpy flows including hypersonic flows, because it can provides a similar flow environment which is experienced by a vehicle during hypersonic flights. For the experimental research of high enthalpy flows, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Cologne research facility has an arc heated plasma <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> L 3 K.
