40|$|It is well known, {{that under}} certain conditions, gradual {{thinning}} {{of a point}} process on R+d, accompanied by a contraction of space {{to compensate for the}} thinning, leads in the weak limit to a Cox process. In this article, we apply discretization and a result based on Stein's method to give estimates of the Barbour-Brown distance d 2 between the distribution of a thinned point process and an approximating Poisson process, and evaluate the estimates in concrete examples. We work in terms of two, somewhat different, thinning models. The main model is based on the usual thinning notion of <b>deleting</b> <b>points</b> independently according to probabilities supplied by a random field. In Section 4, however, we use an alternative thinning model, which can be more straightforward to apply if the thinning is determined by point interactions. ...|$|R

An exact lower error bound for derefinement is obtained theoretically {{in terms of the}} finite element solution, complementing the various known upper error bounds for refinement. These error bounds are used to determine where to insert and/or remove mesh elements. To implement the method, we utilize an adaptive two- and three-dimensional Delaunay tessellation that preserves the Delaunay properties while locally adding <b>points</b> to, or <b>deleting</b> <b>points</b> from, the previous Delaunay mesh.

It is the idea to use the topological dual of the Voronoi diagram that is shown to be locally stable under sufficiently small continuous motions, in opposite to the accompanying Voronoi diagram which is reconstructed from its dual only when it is needed. We present an efficient, numerically stable update algorithm for the topological structure of the Voronoi diagram in a dynamic scene, using only O(log n) time for each change (which is worst-case optimal). Furthermore, we develop fast algorithms for inserting and <b>deleting</b> <b>points</b> {{at the edge of}} the dynamic scene.

40|$|In {{everyday}} life, if {{you want}} to move an object, you just reach out and grab it, move it, and then release it. In computer graphics, you typically must move the cursor over the object, depress the mouse button, move the object using the mouse, and release the mouse button. However, things get more complicated when you have to add or <b>delete</b> <b>points.</b> Popular drawing packages such as Adobe Illustrator have states for selecting an object, selecting control points, or adding and <b>deleting</b> <b>points.</b> You access each state through a menu selection, and in some cases you must visit submenus. In fact, one of the main barriers to learning many drawing and 3 D sculpting packages might very well be the difficulty in understanding the system’s many states. Positioning objects in 3 D gets even more complicated. Typically in CAD interfaces this involves independent plan and elevation view-positioning operations. The development of 3 - and 6 -degrees-offreedom (DOF) input devices has made it possible to perform 3 D positioning in a single movement. However, with this freedom has come the realization that constraints limiting the DOF are often useful for 3 D interaction. It’s difficult to position objects accurately in 3 D; it’s easier and faster to position an object against a constraining surface. 1 Such considerations have lead researchers to add physical props to virtual environments. 2 For example, Lindeman et al. added a paddle that users physically held in their left hand and saw in the virtual environment as a computer graphics proxy. 3 Using their right hand, users could position objects on this paddle, taking advantage of the plane constraints provided. Lindeman et al. showed that the paddle improved performance for several tasks, including object docking. The availability of force feedback devices, such as the Phantom (by SensAble Technologies), 4 Haptic state-surface interaction techniques, which encode modes into force states, make interactions with 3 D objects more fluid and natural. lets you create simulated virtual surfaces supporting interaction anywhere in space. Indeed, more than a decade ago, Sellen et al. showed that user-maintained pressure feedback is an effective mechanism for switchin...|$|R

We also propose an algorithm to alleviate the artifacts when rendering a point cloud with large discrepancies in density in different areas by estimating point sizes heuristically. These estimated point sizes can be used to mimic a closed surface on the raw point cloud, also when the point cloud is composed of several raw laser scans.

40|$|International audienceShape {{description}} {{is an important}} step in image analysis. The skeleton is used as a simple, compact representation of a shape. A skeleton represents the line centered in the shape and must be homotopic and one point wide. Current skeletonization algorithms compute the skeleton over several image scans, using either thinning algorithms or distance transforms. The principle of thinning is to <b>delete</b> <b>points</b> as one goes along, preserving the topology of the shape. On the other hand, the maxima of the local distance transform identifies the skeleton and is an equivalent way to calculate the medial axis. However, with this method, the skeleton obtained is disconnected so it is required to connect all the points of the medial axis to produce the skeleton. In this study we introduce a translated distance transform and adapt an existing distance driven homotopic algorithm to perform skeletonization with a single scan and thus allow the processing of unbounded images. This method is applied, in our study, on micro scanner images of trabecular bones. We wish to characterize the bone micro architecture in order to quantify bone integrity...|$|R
