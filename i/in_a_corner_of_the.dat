5|$|Lydford Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Lydford, Devon, England. The first castle in Lydford, {{sometimes}} termed the Norman fort, was a small ringwork built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon fortified burh in the years after the Norman conquest of England. It was intended to help control Devon following the widespread revolt against Norman rule in 1068. The Norman fort had been abandoned {{by the middle of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, far from large room openings, {{and closer to the}} listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E

5|$|Parts of Kateri i Radës {{were transported}} to a {{concrete}} platform {{in the port}} of Otranto as {{a monument to the}} tragedy. The project cost €150 thousand and was entrusted to the Greek sculptor Costas Varotsos. Before the project, {{what was left of the}} ship lay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> port of Brindisi. The project was titled L'Approdo. Opera all'Umanità Migrante (The Landing. A work dedicated to Migrating Humanity). Photographers Arta Ngucaj and Arben Beqiraj published photographs of the ship on the Albanian-Italian newspaper Shqiptari i Italisë. The families of the dead requested for the relics of Kateri i Radës to be placed in Albania after Italian media reported that it was to be used as a monument.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E
5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a foreign environment (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E

5|$|The upper {{handling}} {{room was}} {{just below the}} visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support {{the weight of the}} mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In {{the center of the room}} there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.|$|E

Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield.|$|E
25|$|The mate {{is usually}} seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board, since fewer pieces {{are needed to}} {{surround}} the king there. The {{most common form of}} smothered mate is seen in the adjacent diagram. The knight on f7 delivers mate to the king on h8 which is prevented from escaping the check by the rook on g8 and the pawns on g7 and h7. Similarly, White can be mated with the white king on h1 and the knight on f2. Analogous mates on a1 and a8 are rarer, because kingside castling is the more common as it safely places the king closer to the corner than it would had the castling occurred on the queenside.|$|E

25|$|Sunni {{tradition}} has {{that the next}} day, in the Hijri year 23, whilst Umar had just begun leading the Fajr (dawn) prayer in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Pirouz had hidden the dagger in his robe, the grip of {{which was in the}} middle, and hid himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque. Shortly after Umar had begun the prayer, Pirūz leapt upon him and stabbed him six times (only three times, according to Ibn Sa'd), this was five times in the stomach and once in the navel, which proved fatal days later. After attacking Umar, Nahavandi stabbed more people, who were trying to subdue him, killing six or nine of them as he tried to flee. When cornered, Nahavandi committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Beck {{probably}} witnessed {{his first}} cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 {{while on the}} surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.

To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed his gloves {{and went to a}} telephone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the regular}} season, while the Nationals were on their final road trip of the year between September 19 and 27, a new organ was {{installed}} at Nationals Park, fulfilling the Nationals organization's long-held goal of upgrading the stadium's organ. The Viscount Sonus 60, priced at $20,000 on European Web sites, was manufactured in Mondaino, Italy, and tuned in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was installed in a former radio booth {{on the second floor}} of the stadium′s press box, replacing a less-capable portable Hammond organ that had been located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium′s sound effects control room.

25|$|In 1173 Benjamin of Tudela visited Jerusalem. He {{described}} it as a small city full of Jacobites, Armenians, Greeks, and Georgians. Two hundred Jews dwelt <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city under the Tower of David. In 1219 the walls of the city were razed by order of al-Mu'azzam, the Ayyubid sultan of Damascus. This rendered Jerusalem defenseless and dealt a heavy blow to the city's status. The Ayyubids destroyed the walls in expectation of ceding the city to the Crusaders as part of a peace treaty. In 1229, by treaty with Egypt's ruler al-Kamil, Jerusalem came into the hands of FrederickII of Germany. In 1239, after a ten-year truce expired, he began to rebuild the walls; these were again demolished by an-Nasir Da'ud, the emir of Kerak, in the same year.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{designer}} Michelotti—who {{had already}} penned the Herald—was commissioned {{for the new}} project, {{and came up with}} a traditional, swooping body. Wind-up windows were provided (in contrast to the Sprite/Midget, which still featured side screens, also called curtains, at that time), as well as a single-piece front end which tilted forwards to offer unrivalled access to the engine. At the dawn of the 1960s, however, Standard-Triumph was in deep financial trouble, and unable to put the new car into production; it was not until the company was taken over by the Leyland organization that funds became available and the car was launched. Leyland officials, taking stock of their new acquisition, found Michelotti's prototype hiding under a dust sheet <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factory and rapidly approved it for production.|$|E

Sri Lanka Cricket defended choosing the stadium saying that the decision to stage a game was to allow cricketers to acclimatize themselves to the ground ahead of the World Cup games. The Test match was staged using temporary seating for spectators <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium as only players' pavilions had permanent arrangements. Since the press box was not completed reporters and commentators facing technical difficulties used a makeshift arrangement.|$|E
