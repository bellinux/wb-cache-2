40|$|A {{high voltage}} {{isolation}} transformer is provided with primary and secondary coils separated by discrete <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shields</b> from the surfaces of insulating spools on which the coils are wound. The <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shields</b> are formed by coatings of a compound with a low electrical conductivity which completely encase the coils and adhere to the surfaces of the insulating spools adjacent to the coils.

50|$|As with loctal tubes, {{the pins}} of {{miniature}} tube are stiff wires protruding through {{the bottom of}} the glass envelope which plug directly into the socket. However, unlike all their predecessors, miniature tubes are not fitted with separate bases; the base {{is an integral part of}} the glass envelope. The pinched-off air evacuation nub is at the top of the tube, giving it its distinctive appearance. More than one functional section can be included in a single envelope; a dual triode configuration is particularly common. Seven- and nine-pin tubes were common, though miniature tubes with more pins, such as the Compactron series, were later introduced, and could fit up to three amplifying elements. Some miniature tube sockets had a skirt that mated with a cylindrical metal <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> that surrounded the tube, fitted with a spring to hold the tube in place if the equipment was subject to vibration. Sometimes the shield was also fitted with thermal contacts to transfer heat from the glass envelope to the shield and act as a heat sink, which was considered to improve tube life in higher power applications.|$|E

40|$|NASA {{is moving}} forward towards the agency's new vision for space {{exploration}} in the 21 st Century encompassing {{a broad range of}} human and robotic missions including missions to Moon, Mars and beyond. Exposure from the hazards of severe space radiation in deep space long duration missions is the show stopper. Langley has developed state-of-the-art radiation protection and shielding technology for space missions. The payload penalty demands a very stringent requirement on the design of the spacecrafts for human deep space missions. The exploration beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) to enable routine access to more interesting regions of space will require protection from the hazards of the accumulated exposures of space radiation, Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Events (SPE), and minimizing the production of secondary radiation is a great advantage. There is a need to look to new horizons for newer technologies. The present investigation explores the feasibility of using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shielding</b> in concert with innovative materials shielding and protection technologies.

40|$|The MV Distribution Network of CEB is {{frequently}} exposed to lightning {{and it is}} the main suspected reason for transformer failures. Appreciable number of transformer failures occurs due to insulation failures notably at points near line ends. The short rise time of a surge prompted by a lightning impulse can cause deterioration in the insulation and ultimately lead to a dielectric breakdown. The voltage distribution along transformer HV winding becomes non-linear under surge conditions due to the capacitive currents. This research focuses on the possibility of neutralizing this effect with the aid of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> inserted in to the HV winding. The comparison of the behavior of the winding under surge conditions with and without <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> requires appropriate transient models suitable for simulations. The necessary calculations required for this purpose were carried out and the proposed models are presented. The simulations were carried out with PSCAD software and the results are included in this report. The oscillatory nature due to the combined effect of capacitors and inductors is observed in the wavetail region and some of the peaks created have potentials exceeding the peak potential of the surge waveform as well. The simulations revealed the reduction of stresses when a shield was used. The proposed transformer model have a definite positive effect compared with the available model as the results obtained by simulations clearly reveal the reduction of the stresses on the transformer HV windings when a shield is used...|$|E
30|$|As {{is evident}} from Fig.  5, the amounts of {{adsorption}} of cesium decrease sharply {{with an increase in}} the added amount of group 1 metal chlorides, indicating that group 1 metal ions seriously obstruct cesium adsorption onto Japanese oak charcoal. It is conceivable that the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> grows with ionic strength in aqueous solution and the growth of the shield reduces the absolute value of the surface potential of the fine particles [18 – 21]. The shield by cations other than cesium ions can adequately account for the experimental data illustrated in Fig.  5. Furthermore, {{it is likely that the}} obstruction effect increases in the order of lithium < sodium < potassium. This may suggest that the ionic radius has some influence on the obstruction.|$|E

30|$|Figures  4 b and  5 {{also suggest}} that the {{timescale}} toward/from the PG positive peak is unchanged in 2011. This {{can be explained by}} the tendency that positive charges are located at higher altitude in electrified clouds (e.g., Israel 1973). If the radioactive particles from the FNPP 1 did not spread above the altitude of negative charges, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shielding</b> by ions at higher altitudes is not very effective. In other words, the different PG profiles between around the positive peaks and around the negative peaks may hint the altitude extension of the floating radioactive particles.|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} approach to energy integrating systems is photon counting which provides higher dose efficiency through efficient noise rejection and optimal energy weighting, and, moreover, is not susceptible to memory artifacts such as image lag and ghosting. The first large-area photon counting imager was Charpak's Nobel Prize winning {{invention of the}} gas-filled multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC), which revolutionized the field of radiation detection in 1968. In most applications, however, {{the use of a}} solid detection medium is preferable because solid densities are about three orders-of-magnitude greater than gas, and thus, they can yield much smaller detector dimensions with unsurpassed spatial and temporal resolution. Thus far, crystalline Cadmium Zinc Telluride is the only room-temperature solid-state detector that meets the requirements for photon counting imaging. However, the material is grown in small ingots and production costs are high for large-area imaging applications. The problem is that disordered (or non-crystalline) solids, which are easier and less expensive to develop over large-area than single crystalline solids, have been ruled out as viable photon counting detectors because of their poor temporal resolution, or more specifically, extremely low carrier mobilities and transit-time-limited photoresponse. To circumvent the problem of poor charge transport in disordered solids with a conventional planar detector structure, we propose unipolar charge sensing by establishing a strong near-field effect using an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> within the material. We introduce the concept of time-differential photoresponse in unipolar solids and show that their temporal resolution can be improved substantially to reach the intrinsic physical limit set by spatial dispersion. Inspired by Charpak's MWPC and its variants, and for the first time, we have implemented an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> inside evaporated amorphous selenium (a-Se) using the proposed lithography-based microstrip solid-state detector (MSSD). The fabricated devices are characterized with optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray impulse-like excitations. Using optical time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, we show {{for the first time a}} unipolar Gaussian TOF transient from the new MSSD structure, instead of a rectangular response with a Gaussian-integral at the tail which is a typical response of a conventional planar device. The measured optical and x-ray TOF results verify the time-differential property of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> and the practicality of the dispersion-limited photoresponse. Furthermore, we use single gamma-ray photon excitations to probe detector's temporal resolution in pulse mode for photon counting. For the MSSD, we show a depth-independent signal for photon absorption across the bulk and a reduction in signal risetime by a factor of 350, comparing performance limiting factors being hole-dispersion for the MSSD and electron-transit-time for the conventional planar device. The time-differential response obtained from the proposed unipolar detector structure enables disordered photoconductive films to become viable candidates for large-area photon counting applications...|$|E

The threshold voltages obtained on an oriented silicon substrate ranged from 1. 5 to 3 V for either channel. Integrated inverters performed satisfactorily from 3 to 15 V, limited {{at the low end}} by the threshold voltages and at the high end by the drain breakdown voltage of the n-channel transistors. The stability of the new structure with an n-doped silicon gate as measured by the shift in C-V curve under 200 C plus or minus 20 V temperature-bias conditions was better than conventional aluminum gate or p-doped silicon gate devices, presumably due to the doping of gate oxide with phosphorous...|$|E

30|$|Although {{the three}} group 2 metal {{chlorides}} probably also produce some blocking effects on cesium ion adsorption, we obtained a surprising result {{in that the}} decrease of adsorption {{by the addition of}} group 2 metal chlorides was much smaller than that by the addition of group 1 metal chlorides. In general, it is believed that the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> increases with ionic strength as described above. Thus, group 2 metal ions should show a greater shield than group 1 metal ions when the two concentrations are equivalent, since group 1 and 2 metal ions are monovalent and divalent cations, respectively, and it is commonly recognized that group 1 and 2 metal elements exist mostly as free ions unless aqueous solutions dissolving them are strongly basic [22]. However, our experimental data are completely opposite to the prediction derived from the published data [23 – 26]. The fact that considerable cesium adsorption onto Japanese oak charcoal from solutions at lower pH than the point of zero charge of Japanese oak charcoal took place is interesting, suggesting that cesium adsorption was caused by not only surface potential, namely, electrostatic attraction, but also other factors, for instance, chemical interactions of residual functional groups on the Japanese oak charcoal surface with the metal ions.|$|E
40|$|The {{shuttling}} process involving lithium polysulfides {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors responsible for the degradation in capacity of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, we demonstrate a novel and simple strategy—using a bifunctional separator, prepared by spraying poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on pristine separator—to obtain long-cycle LSBs. The negatively charged SO 3 – groups present in PSS act as an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>shield</b> for soluble lithium polysulfides through mutual coulombic repulsion, whereas PEDOT provides chemical interactions with insoluble polysulfides (Li 2 S, Li 2 S 2). The dual shielding effect can provide an efficient protection from the shuttling phenomenon by confining lithium polysulfides to the cathode side of the battery. Moreover, coating with PEDOT:PSS transforms the surface of the separator from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, thereby improving the electrochemical performance. We observed an ultralow decay of 0. 0364 % per cycle when we ran the battery for 1000 cycles at 0. 25 C—far superior to that of the pristine separator and one of the lowest recorded values reported at a low current density. We examined the versatility of our separator by preparing a flexible battery that functioned well under various stress conditions; it displayed flawless performance. Accordingly, this economical and simple strategy appears to be an ideal platform for commercialization of LSBs...|$|E

An extensive survey of the industrial users of flowmeters has been made, involving the participation of over 47 companies, which provides information about the current industrial use, attitudes and attributes of electromagnetic {{and other types of}} flowmeters. The design of the flowmeter is mainly concerned with overcoming the charge noise that is associated with the flow of dielectric liquids so as to effectively detect the weak flow signal.
