50|$|The {{debate on}} the issue of {{modularity}} in language is underpinned, in part, by different understandings of this concept. There is, however, some consensus in the literature that a module is considered committed to processing specialized representations (domain-specificity) (Bryson and Stein, 2001) in an informationally encapsulated way. A distinction should be drawn between anatomical modularity, which proposes there is one 'area' in the brain that deals with this processing, and <b>functional</b> <b>modularity</b> that obviates anatomical modularity whilst maintaining information encapsulation in distributed parts of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Cognitive Neuropsychology studies {{brain damaged}} {{patients}} {{and uses the}} patterns of selective impairment {{in order to make}} inferences on the underlying cognitive structure. Dissociation between cognitive functions is taken to be evidence that these functions are independent. Theorists have identified several key assumptions that are needed to justify these inferences:1) Functional Modularity- the mind is organized into functionally separate cognitive modules.2). Anatomical Modularity- the brain is organized into functionally separate modules. This assumption is very similar to the assumption of functional localization. These assumptions differ from the assumption of <b>functional</b> <b>modularity,</b> because it is possible to have separable cognitive modules that are implemented by diffuse patterns of brain activation.3)Universality- The basic organization of functional and anatomical modularity is the same for all normal humans. This assumption is needed if we are to make any claim about functional organization based on dissociation that extrapolates from the instance of a case study to the population.4) Transparency / Subtractivity- the mind does not undergo substantial reorganization following brain damage. It is possible to remove one functional module without significantly altering the overall structure of the system. This assumption is necessary in order to justify using brain damaged patients in order to make inferences about the cognitive architecture of healthy people.|$|E

40|$|The RDA (Remote Database Access) {{standards}} {{support the}} interworking between an application program in one open {{system and a}} DBMS in a remote open system. The Generic RDA standard defines the common aspects of a class of RDA applications, and a Specialization standard describes a specialization for {{a particular type of}} DB in the class. The RDA model describes RDA via clienVserver relationship. The services of RDA are grouped into five categories: Dialogue Management, Transaction Management, Control, Resource Handling, Database Language. The server execution rules are defined for each service. The Basic Application Context and TP Application Contexts are used to perform the necessary set of RDA services. RDA Specialization defines any required constraints on the permissible parameter values for each service. Also, it defines additional entities and their attributes on the Dialogue State Model. For each server operation, additional constraints are defined. As the basic step of constructing prototype RDA for a subset of database languages, two RDA service user interfaces were designed and necessary functions and parameters were defined. First, to fill the gap of functionalities between the RDA client and the RDA Communications Service, one RDA Client Interface model was designed. Second, an RDA Server Interface model which contains necessary library functions and parameters to send an RDA indication and receive the response for it was designed to fill the gap of functionalities between the RDA server and the RDA Communications Service. Also, a set of Generic Object Management Library functions for the RDA server as one possible implementation model was defined and the functions for the RDA server to interface with SOL Server Interface for the RDA specialization were refined and added. The internal execution of RDA operation according to the RDA server rules were explained by using the functions of Generic Object Management Library for the RDA server. All the functions were designed by the object-oriented concept. So, this model can be modified conveniently and implemented easily to accommodate other types of database languages by the object-oriented languages because of <b>functional</b> <b>modularities</b> of library functions...|$|R

In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{properties}} of <b>functional</b> <b>modularity,</b> a concept introduced in [14] for detecting and measuring modularity in problems of automatic program synthesis, in particular by means of genetic programming.

For a given subgoal and a sample of solutions decomposed into parts and contexts according to module definition, monotonicity measures the correlation of distance between semantics of solution’s part and the fitness of the solution. The central tenet {{of this approach is}} that highly monotonous subgoals can be used to decompose the task and improve search convergence.

A heme-containing transmembrane ferric reductase domain (FRD) {{is found}} in bacterial and eukaryotic protein families, including ferric reductases (FRE), and NADPH oxidases (NOX). The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the phylogeny of the FRD superfamily. Bacteria contain FRD proteins consisting only of the ferric reductase domain, such as YedZ and short bFRE proteins. Full length FRE and NOX enzymes are mostly found in eukaryotic cells and all possess a dehydrogenase domain, allowing them to catalyze electron transfer from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular metal ions (FRE) or oxygen (NOX). Metazoa possess YedZ-related STEAP proteins, possibly derived from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic analyses suggests that FRE enzymes appeared early in evolution, followed by a transition towards EF-hand containing NOX enzymes (NOX 5 - and DUOX-like). An ancestral gene of the NOX(1 - 4) family probably lost the EF-hands and new regulatory mechanisms of increasing complexity evolved in this clade.

Genetic {{algorithms}} generally use a fixed problem representation that maps {{variables of}} the search space to variables of the problem, and operators of variation that are fixed over time.

40|$|Several {{covalent}} strategies towards surface charge-reversal in nanochannels {{have been}} reported {{with the purpose of}} manipulating ion transport.

Here, we introduce a facile non-covalent approach towards charge-reversal in nanochannels (< 10 nm) using strong charge-transfer interactions between dicationic viologen (acceptor) and trianionic pyranine (donor). The polarity of ion transport was switched from anion selective to ambipolar to cation selective by controlling the extent of viologen bound to the pyranine. We could also regulate the ion transport with respect to pH by selecting a donor with pH-responsive <b>functional</b> groups.

40|$|Cichlidogyrus spp. (Monogenea, Ancyrocephalidae) {{are common}} parasites of cichlid fishes from Africa and the Levant. They display {{important}} morphological variation in their attachment apparatus and infect a broad host spectrum throughout a wide geographic range. Thus, they offer an interesting model to investigate {{to what extent}} the phenotypic variability of the attachment organ among congeners is related to host specificity, geographic/environmental components, or phylogeny. A geometric morphometric approach was carried out to analyse the shape variation of sclerotized structures of the attachment organ within 66 African species of the genus Cichlidogyrus. The interspecific shape comparison supports the presence of three main morphological configurations, each consisting of a given combination of particular sclerite shapes. Moreover, data emphasize strong coordination and integration (shape co-variation) among the different sclerites jointly forming the attachment organ. Although attachment apparatuses are usually considered {{to be the result of}} adaptive processes and must be adapted to the hosts and local environmental conditions, we found no relationship between these clusters and host specificity or geographical distribution. Nevertheless, groups are partially congruent with those obtained with the molecular phylogeny of a subset of species, suggesting a phylogenetic constraint rather than an adaptation to either hosts or environment. Because of the necessity to form a <b>functional</b> entity, <b>modularity</b> within attachment organ imposes important evolutionary constraint. This provides new insights into the evolvability of attachment organs, as well as into the morphological basis of host specificity and host-parasite co-evolutionary interaction in helminth parasites...|$|R

Among other non-intuitive outcomes, translation demonstrates {{a high degree of}} <b>functional</b> <b>modularity</b> and comprises a non-stoichiometric combination of proteins manifesting functional convergence on a shared maximal translation rate. In exponentially growing cells, polypeptide elongation (eEF 1 A, eEF 2, and eEF 3) exerts the strongest control. The two other strong control points are recruitment of mRNA and tRNA i to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (eIF 4 F and eIF 2) and termination (eRF 1; Dbp 5). In contrast, factors that are found to promote mRNA scanning efficiency on a longer than-average 5 ′untranslated region (eIF 1, eIF 1 A, Ded 1, eIF 2 B, eIF 3, and eIF 5) exceed the levels required for maximal control.

We have consequently developed modular encoding for neural networks based on attribute grammars (MENNAG), a new encoding designed to generate the structure of neural networks and parameters with evolutionary algorithms, while explicitly enabling these three above-mentioned principles. We expressed this encoding in the formalism of attribute grammars in order to facilitate understanding and future modifications. It has been tested on two preliminary benchmark problems: cart-pole control and robotic arm control, the latter being specifically designed to evaluate the repetition capabilities of an encoding.

40|$|Does {{stimulus}} awareness modulate the brain’s functional network topology? If network topologies have {{explanatory power}} beyond BOLD signal contrasts, they {{will serve as}} promising candidates for a neural account of awareness {{as suggested by the}} global workspace theory (Baars, 1988). We acquired sub-second fMRI data (TR= 0. 75 s) while participants (N= 38) had to report the perception of near-threshold electrical pulses applied at their left index finger and their confidence about this yes/no decision. Additionally there were supra-threshold and catch trials. To evaluate BOLD signal differences, we calculated general linear models with AFNI including stimulus condition specific regressors and response onset regressors. Individual whole-brain functional networks were constructed with the generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI; McLaren et al., 2012) between 264 brain-wide nodes (Power et al., 2011). The gPPI tests for context-modulated functional connectivity changes beyond local BOLD signal changes and baseline functional connectivity. The graph theoretical analysis of the connectivity matrixes was performed with the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010) to test for global changes of integration and segregation metrics. The BOLD contrast for confident misses and hits revealed several brain areas with a positive signal change across a frontal-parietal network. Interestingly confident misses compared to correct rejections (~ 97 % of catch trials) showed different patterns: (a) early sensory and frontal areas (S 1, S 2, insula, IFG, & MCC) showed a larger signal for confident misses than correct rejections while (b) parietal areas (precuneus, IPL, & cerebellum) showed a lower signal for confident misses than correct rejections. Despite these activation differences the accompanying functional network alterations showed no graph analytical differences between confident hits, misses and correct rejections. The data shows that the BOLD signal correlates with conscious somatosensory perception in early sensory as well as frontal and parietal areas. Different from Godwin et al.

Assumed reasonably that the factor of relational skill is under control in such dyadic transaction relationship, other factors that may influence the choices of transaction patterns are explored from the perspective of product architecture. By focusing on the matching of functional and structural hierarchies, which is considered to be the core of the product architecture concept, we firstly formalize the architectural attributes of auto parts into three measurable sub concepts: (1) <b>functional</b> <b>modularity,</b> (2) structural modularity, which reflect the degree of interdependence between auto parts; and (3) modularity between auto parts and the overall auto design. Then based on the data of 33 items of auto parts collected from one Japanese supplier, hypotheses on the relationship between modularity of auto parts and three transaction patterns (the drawing-supplied parts, the drawing-approved parts and the drawing-entrusted parts) are tested. The empirical results show that only <b>functional</b> <b>modularity</b> of auto parts has significant influence on transactions of the drawing-supplied parts and the drawing-approved parts, while transactions of the drawing-entrusted parts cannot be explained within the architectural framework consistently. We believe that the reflected concern of functional aspect during the decision making of outsourcing auto parts design is important for understanding the competence of supplier management in Japanese auto industry.

40|$|In lazy <b>functional</b> {{programming}} <b>modularity</b> {{is often}} achieved by using intermediate data structures to combine separate {{parts of a}} program. Each intermediate data structure is produced by one part and consumed by another one. Deforestation optimises a functional program by transformation into a program which does not produce such intermediate data structures. In this thesis we present a new method for deforestation, which combines a known method,short cut deforestation, with a new analysis {{that is based on}} type inference. Short cut deforestation eliminates an intermediate list by a single, local transformation. In return, short cut deforestation expects both producer and consumer of the intermediate list in a certain form. Whereas the required form of the consumer is generally considered desirable in a well-structured program anyway, the required form of the producer is only a crutch to enable deforestation. Hence only the list-producing functions of the standard libraries were defined in the desired form and short cut deforestation has been confined to compositions of these functions. Here, we present an algorithm which transforms an arbitrary producer into the required form. Starting from the observation that short cut deforestation is based on a parametricity theorem of the second-order typed lambda-calculus, we show how the construction of the required form can be reduced to a type inference problem. Typability for the second-order typed lambda-calculus is undecidable, but we only need to solve a partial type inference problem. For this problem we develop an algorithm based on the well-known Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. The transformation of a producer often requires inlining of some function definitions. Type inference even indicates which function definitions need to be inlined. However, only limited inlining across module boundaries is practically feasible. Therefore, we extend the previously developed algorithm to split a function definition into a worker definition and a wrapper definition. We only need to inline the small wrapper definition, which transfers all information required for deforestation. The flexibility of type inference allows us to remove intermediate lists which original short cut deforestation cannot remove, even with hand-crafted producers. In contrast to most previous work on deforestation, we give a detailed proof of completeness and semantic correctness of our transformation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that {{features}} of stimuli in the environment affect the strength of functional connectivity in the human brain. However, investigations to date have not converged in determining whether these also impact functional networks' global features, such as modularity strength, number of modules, partition structure, or degree distributions. We hypothesized that one environmental attribute that may strongly impact global features is the temporal regularity of the environment, as prior work indicates that differences in regularity impact regions involved in sensory, attentional and memory processes. We examined this with an fMRI study, in which participants passively listened to tonal series that had identical physical features and differed only in their regularity, {{as defined by the}} strength of transition structure between tones. We found that series-regularity induced systematic changes to global features of <b>functional</b> networks, including <b>modularity</b> strength, number of modules, partition structure, and degree distributions. In tandem, we used a novel node-level analysis {{to determine the extent to}} which brain regions maintained their within-module connectivity across experimental conditions. This analysis showed that primary sensory regions and those associated with default-mode processes are most likely to maintain their within-module connectivity across conditions, whereas prefrontal regions are least likely to do so. Our work documents a significant capacity for global-level brain network reorganization as a function of context. These findings suggest that modularity and other core, global features, while likely constrained by white-matter structural brain connections, are not completely determined by them...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{investigate}} {{the correlations between}} coding sequence substitutions {{as a function of}} their separation along the protein sequence. We consider both substitutions between the reference genomes of several Drosophilids as well as polymorphisms in a population sample of Zimbabwean Drosophila melanogaster. We find that amino acid substitutions are "clustered" along the protein sequence, that is, the frequency of additional substitutions is strongly enhanced within ≈ 10 residues of a first such substitution. No such clustering is observed for synonymous substitutions, supporting a "correlation length" associated with selection on proteins as the causative mechanism. Clustering is stronger between substitutions that arose in the same lineage than it is between substitutions that arose in different lineages. We consider several possible origins of clustering, concluding that epistasis (interactions between amino acids within a protein that affect function) and positional heterogeneity in the strength of purifying selection are primarily responsible. The role of epistasis is directly supported by the tendency of nearby substitutions that arose on the same lineage to preserve the total charge of the residues within the correlation length and by the preferential cosegregation of neighboring derived alleles in our population sample. We interpret the observed length scale of clustering as a statistical reflection of the <b>functional</b> locality (or <b>modularity)</b> of proteins: amino acids that are near each other on the protein backbone are more likely to contribute to, and collaborate toward, a common subfunction...|$|R
