50|$|The <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> {{model was}} {{proposed}} by volcanologist Stephen Sparks in 1976. Sparks attributed the poor sorting in ignimbrites to laminar flows {{of very high}} particle concentration. Pyroclastic flows were envisioned as being similar to debris flows, with a body undergoing laminar flow and then stopping <b>en</b> <b>masse.</b> The flow would travel as a plug flow, with an essentially non-deforming mass travelling on a thin shear zone, and the <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> freezing occurs when the driving stress falls below a certain level. This would produce a massive unit with an inversely graded base.|$|R

40|$|Incarcerated {{inguinal}} hernia is often encountered by surgeons in daily practice. Although rare, hernial reduction <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> {{is a potential}} complication of manual reduction of an incarcerated hernia. Manual reduction was performed {{in a case of}} Zollinger classification type VII (combined type) hernia in which the indirect hernia portion included an incarcerated small intestine. This procedure caused hernial reduction <b>en</b> <b>masse,</b> but this went unnoticed, and the remaining portion of the direct hernia in the inguinal region was treated surgically by the anterior approach. Because the incarcerated small bowel that had been reduced <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> was not completely obstructed, the patient’s general condition was not greatly affected, {{and he was able to}} resume eating. Twenty days after surgery, he developed sudden abdominal pain as a result of gastrointestinal perforation. When performing manual reduction of an incarcerated hernia in cases after self-reduction over a long period, the clinician should always be aware of the possibility of reduction <b>en</b> <b>masse...</b>|$|R

40|$|Reduction <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> of {{inguinal}} hernia” means reduction/migration of a hernial sac {{into the}} properitoneal space. We report the CT findings {{in a case}} of reduction <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> with strangulated obstruction. CT scan demonstrated a hernial sac with fibrous constriction band at the neck, situated in the properitoneal space superior to the inguinal region, causing closed-loop obstruction. The hernial sac contained thickened bowel loop with wall enhancement and fluid suggestive of incarceration/strangulation. We propose to call this, ‘The properitoneal hernial sac sign’, defined as “Presence of a hernial sac in the properitoneal space (and not in the inguinal/femoral canal) containing an obstructed/incarcerated bowel loop and causing small bowel obstruction” to identify “reduction <b>en</b> <b>masse</b> of inguinal hernia”...|$|R
