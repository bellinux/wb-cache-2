25|$|This {{unstable}} operation {{results from}} the development of pressure gradients {{in the opposite direction}} of the flow. Maximum pressure is observed at the discharge of the impeller blade and minimum pressure on the side opposite to the <b>discharge</b> <b>side.</b> When the impeller blades are not rotating these adverse pressure gradients pump the flow in the direction opposite to the direction of the fan. The result is the oscillation of the fan blades creating vibrations and hence noise.|$|E
25|$|Full-Flow Filtration — Full-flow {{filtration}} continuously strains particulates out of {{the entire}} system flow. For example, in a 100-ton system, the flow rate would be roughly 300 gal/min. A filter would be selected to accommodate the entire 300 gal/min flow rate. In this case, the filter typically is installed after the cooling tower on the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of the pump. While this is the ideal method of filtration, for higher flow systems it may be cost-prohibitive.|$|E
25|$|The working fluid, in its gaseous state, is {{pressurized}} and circulated {{through the}} system by a compressor. On the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger, called a condenser, until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an expansion valve, capillary tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.|$|E

5000|$|Mower {{manufacturers}} {{market their}} mowers as <b>side</b> <b>discharge,</b> 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or <b>side</b> <b>discharging</b> and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and <b>side</b> <b>discharge.</b> Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> mower manufacturers also sell separate [...] "mulching plates" [...] that {{will cover the}} opening on the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> mower and, {{in combination with the}} proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening {{on the back of the}} mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some ride-on mowers, the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected.|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{formation}} and self-organization are fascinating phenomena found widely {{in nature and}} in laboratory environment such as dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). Significant efforts {{have been made to}} explain the dynamic pattern formation. In DBD, the formation of <b>side</b> <b>discharges</b> is generally supposed to be a key factor responsible for diversity and spatial-temporal symmetry breaking of pattern formation. However, it is still not clear how such discharges are induced. Here, we present the observations of <b>side</b> <b>discharges</b> in a filamentary dielectric barrier discharge from both numerical simulations and experiments. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations with Monte Carlo collisions included have revealed formation dynamics of <b>side</b> <b>discharges,</b> suggesting that transverse plasma diffusion and ion induced secondary electron emission play critical roles.

50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or discharge sides which control the operation of the pump. For example, if the suction pressure of a centrifugal pump is too low, a device may trigger the pump to shut off to keep it from running dry; i. e. with no fluid entering.|$|E

40|$|Turbo {{compressors}} {{can generate}} tonal noise in a frequency range of 1000 to 5000 Hz, which may cause nuisance {{in the environment}} where the machine is installed. The cause of this tonal noise is {{the interaction between the}} flow and the rotating blades inside the compressor. The noise is transmitted from the compressor into the pipe system at both suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>sides.</b> Then it is radiated from the pipe walls to the environment. As this noise source can’t be avoided, if necessary a silencer can be installed between the compressor and the pipe system. The silencer blocks the transmission of the noise. The most common type of silencer for this application is the so-called absorption type. However, due to high flow velocities and vibrations, the absorption material may deteriorate and be blown away. A sturdier silencer type has been developed based on rigid acoustic resonators. In this paper the development process is described. This includes one and three dimensional acoustic modeling, scale model tests and the design for a full scale application. Compared to the absorption type silencer, the final silencer design has similar or lower pressure loss and fits in the same containment...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{present the}} results of iodine vapor {{dissociation}} measurements in a high-voltage, nanosecond pulse duration, repetitively pulsed discharge, used as an auxiliary (“side”) discharge in an electric discharge excited oxygen-iodine laser. Iodine dissociation fraction generated in the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> and measured in the laser cavity is up to 50 %. However, the experiments showed that additional iodine dissociation generated in the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> only moderately increases laser gain, by 10 - 15 %. Parametric gain optimization by varying main discharge pressure, O 2 and NO fractions in the flow, I 2 flow rate, pulsed discharge frequency, and sustainer discharge power, with the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> in operation produces gain up to 0. 08 %/cm. Two parameters that critically affect gain are the energy loading per molecule in the discharge and the NO flow rate controlling the O atom concentration in the flow. In particular, operation at the main discharge pressure of 60 torr results in significantly higher gain than at 100 torr, 0. 080 %/cm vs. 0. 043 %/cm, due to high discharge energy loading per molecule at the lower pressure. Laser output power measured at the gain optimized conditions is 1. 4 W...|$|R

The St. Johns River Power Park taps into the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of the Northside Generating Station condensers to obtain cooling tower makeup. The average surface water flow supplied to the Power Park heat rejection system is 50 Mgd (34400 gal per minute). Approximately 25% of this surface water evaporates into the atmosphere from the cooling towers. Cooling tower blowdown is routed back into Northside Generating Station's discharge collector basin. The daily average temperature of the cooling tower blowdown is limited to 96 F.|$|E
50|$|Suction {{cavitation}} {{occurs when}} the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at {{the eye of the}} pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.|$|E
