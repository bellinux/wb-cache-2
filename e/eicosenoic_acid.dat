Immunomodulators modulate and potentiate the immune system, keeping it highly prepared for any threat. The immunomodulatory effect of the traditional medicine Tinospora crispa is investigated in this work. Methods T. crispa ethanol extract was fractionated by using different solvents. The ethanol extract and effective isolated fraction were used to investigate the potential immunomodulatory effect of different T. crispa doses ranging from 25 μg/mL to 1000 μg/mL on RAW 246. 7 cells by detecting intracellular INF-γ, IL- 6, and IL- 8 expressions. The antioxidant activity of T. crispa was evaluated through FRAP and DPPH. The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were also quantified. Results Results show that T. crispa extract has higher antioxidant potential than ascorbic acid. The FRAP value of T. crispa extract is 11011. 11 [*]±[*] 1145. 42 μmol Fe+ 2 /g, and its DPPH inhibition percentage is 55. 79 [*]±[*] 7. 9, with 22 μg/mL IC 50.

Cigarette smoking accelerates the age-related forced expiratory volume in 1  s (FEV 1) decline, an {{important}} determinant for the genesis of COPD. Hispanic smokers have lower COPD prevalence and FEV 1 decline than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). Patients and methods: A nutritional epidemiological study was conducted in the Lovelace Smokers cohort (LSC; n= 1, 829) and the Veterans Smokers cohort (n= 508) to identify dietary nutrients (n= 139) associated with average FEV 1 and its decline and to assess whether nutrient intakes could explain ethnic disparity in FEV 1 decline between Hispanics and NHW smokers. Results: Nutrients discovered and replicated to be significantly associated with better average FEV 1 included magnesium, folate, niacin, vitamins A and D, <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> (20 : 1 n 9), eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n 3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22 : 5 n 3), docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n 3), and fiber. In addition, greater intakes of <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> and DPA were associated with slower FEV 1 decline in the LSC. Among omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, DPA is the most potent nutrient associated with better average FEV 1 and slower FEV 1 decline. Adverse effect of continuous current smoking on FEV 1 decline was completely negated in LSC members with high DPA intake (> 20  mg/day). Slower FEV 1 decline in Hispanics compared to NHWs {{may be due to the}} greater protection of <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> and DPA for FEV 1 decline rather than greater intake of protective nutrients in this ethnic group. Conclusion: The protective nutrients for the preservation of FEV 1 in ever smokers could lay foundation for designing individualized nutritional intervention targeting “optimal physiological levels” in human to improve lung function in ever smokers. Ethnic disparity in FEV 1 decline may be explained by difference in magnitude of protection of dietary intakes of <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> and DPA between Hispanics and NHWs.

Non-methylene-interrupted dienes (13 %) were composed of eicosadienoic and docosadienoic acids. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) included two main components, n 6 arachidonic and n 3 eicosapentaenoic acids, even with equal concentrations (15 μg/mg) and a balanced n 6 /n 3 PUFA ratio (0. 86). The UPLC-ELSD analysis showed that a great majority of the lipids (80 %) in the ethanolic extract were phosphatidylcholine (60 μg/mg) and phosphatidylethanolamine (40 μg/mg), while the proportion of neutral lipids remained lower than 20 %. In addition, alkoxyglycerol derivatives—chimyl, selachyl, and batyl alcohols—were quantified. We have assumed that the mechanism of action of body wall lipids in the present study is via the inhibition of MAPK p 38, COX- 1, and COX- 2.

The dietary treatment had no influence on lipid content of BF and subcutaneous adipose tissue but increased (P< 0. 01) the content of both isomers, more markedly in the latter tissue. CLA supplementation increased (P< 0. 01) myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic and total saturated fatty acids, and decreased oleic and <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acids</b> in both tissues. In adipose tissue, an increase (P< 0. 05) in stearic acid content was observed.

From a human nutritional standpoint, the changes occurring in fatty acid composition negatively affect the atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes, but probably these changes are of no particular concern, as they would only partly offset the progressive increase in the degree of unsaturation of heavy pig lipid:, that has occurred in recent years, as a consequence of reduced adipose depots in carcasses. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TAGs accumulating during embryo development exhibited changes in acyl composition similar to those observed in developing zygotic embryos of the same cv, {{particularly with respect to}} erucic and <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acids.</b> However, MD embryos showed a much higher rate of incorporation of 14 C-erucoyl moieties into TAGs in vitro than zygotic embryos. Homogenates of early-late cotyledonary stage MD embryos (14 - 29 days in culture) were assessed for the ability to incorporate 22 : 1 and 18 : 1 (oleoyl) moieties into glycerolipids. In the presence of [1 - 14 C] 22 : 1 -coenzyme A (CoA) and various acyl acceptors, including glycerol- 3 -phosphate (G- 3 -P), radiolabeled erucoyl moieties were rapidly incorporated into the TAG fraction, but virtually excluded from other Kennedy Pathway intermediates as well as complex polar lipids. This pattern of erucoyl incorporation was unchanged during time course experiments or upon incubation of homogenates with chemicals known to inhibit Kennedy Pathway enzymes. In marked contrast, parallel experiments conducted using [1 - 14 C] 18 : 1 -CoA and G- 3 -P indicated that 14 C oleoyl moieties were incorporated into lyso-phosphatidic acids, phosphatidic acids, diacylglycerols, and TAGs of the Kennedy Pathway, as well as other complex polar lipids, such as phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines. When supplied with l-[2 - 3 H(N) ]G- 3 -P and [1 - 14 C] 22 : 1 -CoA, the radiolabeled TAG pool contained both isotopes, indicating G- 3 -P to be a true acceptor of erucoyl moieties. Radio-high-performance liquid chromatography, argentation thin-layer chromatography/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and stereospecific analyses of radiolabeled TAGs indicated that 22 : 1 was selectively incorporated into the sn- 3 position by a highly active diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; EC 2. 3. 1. 20), while oleoyl moieties were inserted into the sn- 1 and sn- 2 positions. In the presence of sn- 1, 2 -dierucin and [1 - 14 C] 22 : 1 -CoA, homogenates and microsomal preparations were able to produce radiolabeled trierucin, a TAG not found endogenously in this species. A 105, 000 g pellet fraction contained 22 : 1 -CoA:DGAT exhibiting the highest specific activity. The rate of 22 : 1 -CoA:DGAT activity in vitro could more than account for the maximal rate of TAG biosynthesis observed in vivo during embryo development. In double label experiments, G- 3 -P was shown to stimulate the conversion of [3 H]phosphatidylcholines to [3 H]diacylglycerols, which subsequently acted as acceptors for 14 C erucoyl moieties.

This {{study had}} {{the objective of}} assessing the effect of diets containing coconut meal (CM) on broiler leg meat proximate and lipid composition, and to determine the lipid stability of the meat when packaged with and without vacuum and stored at - 20 ÂC for 45 days. Meat proximal composition and fatty acid profile were measured at the beginning (zero day) {{and at the end}} (45 days) of the storing period. Lipid stability of the leg meat (drum and thigh) was measured through the TBARS technique at 0, 15, 30 and 45 days of storage. Storage time influenced moisture, protein and fat contents of the meat. After 45 days of storage meat was higher in moisture and protein levels and lower in fat content as compared to the 0 day of store meat. The proportion of ashes in the meat was not affected (p> 0, 05) by storing time. Unsaturated fatty acid level in meat from birds fed the diet containing CM was lower than that in the meat from birds fed the diet without CM. Related to the storing time effect it was observed that after 45 of storage meat from birds fed CM had lower levels of lauric, palmitic, stearic, arachidic and <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acids</b> and higher levels od oleic and linoleic acids. Meat lipid stability measured as TBARS values varied from 0. 40 to 7. 45 mg malonaldehyde/kg meat with significant increases during the storage period. The effect of the presence of CM in the diet or the type of packaging of the meat however was less evident...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil content}} and fatty acids {{profile of a}} number of Polish wild species of rose fruits were {{examined}} by GC. The total fatty acid contents ranged from 6. 5 % to 12. 9 % of dry mass in fruits. The composition of oils was similar in the investigated species. 17 components were identified. An average composition was estimated as follows: linoleic acid (44. 4 - 55. 7 %), a-linolenic acid (18. 6 - 31. 4 %), oleic acid (13. 5 - 20. 3 %), palmitic acid (2. 3 - 3. 3 %), stearic acid (1 - 2. 5 %), octadecenoic acid (0. 38 - 0. 72 %), <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 3 - 0. 7 %), eicosadienoic acid (0 - 0. 16 %), erucic acid (0. 03 - 0. 17 %) and minor fatty acids. The results indicate that rose fruits are a rich source of unsaturated fatty acids, especially in R. rubiginosa, R. rugosa and R. dumalis. There were statistically significant (p< 0. 05) differences in fatty acid compositions of some species. Fatty acids were suggested to have a potential chemotaxonomic value in this genus...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a severe}} mental {{disorder}} that affects 0. 5 – 1 % {{of the population}} worldwide. Current diagnostic methods are based on psychiatric interviews, which are subjective in nature. The lack of disease biomarkers to support objective laboratory tests has been a long-standing bottleneck in the clinical diagnosis and evaluation of schizophrenia. Here we report a global metabolic profiling study involving 112 schizophrenic patients and 110 healthy subjects, who were divided into a training set and a test set, designed to identify metabolite markers. A panel of serum markers consisting of glycerate, <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> b-hydroxybuty-rate, pyruvate and cystine was identified as an effective diagnostic tool, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0. 945 in the training samples (62 patients and 62 controls) and 0. 895 in the test samples (50 patients and 48 controls). Furthermore, a composite panel {{by the addition of}} urine b-hydroxybutyrate to the serum panel achieved a more satisfactory accuracy, which reached an AUC of 1 in both the training set and the test set. Multiple fatty acids and ketone bodies were found significantly (P< 0. 01) elevate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} sub-chronic soybean oil (SO) treatment on the insulin secretion and fatty acid composition of islets of Langerhans obtained from Goto-Kakizaki (GK), a model of type 2 diabetes, and normal Wistar rats. We observed that soybean-treated Wistar rats present insulin resistance and defective islet insulin secretion when compared with untreated Wistar rats. The decrease in insulin secretion occurred at all concentrations of glucose and arginine tested. Furthermore we observed that soybean-treated normal islets present {{a significant decrease in}} two saturated fatty acids, myristic and heneicosanoic acids, and one monounsaturated <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the appearance of the monounsaturated erucic acid. Concerning diabetic animals, we observed that soybean-treated diabetic rats, when compared with untreated GK rats, present an increase in plasma non-fasting free fatty acids, an exacerbation of islet insulin secretion impairment in all conditions tested and a significant decrease in the monounsaturated palmitoleic acid. Altogether our results show that SO treatment results in a decrease of insulin secretion and alterations on fatty acid composition in normal and diabetic islets. Furthermore, the impairment of insulin secretion, islet erucic acid and fasting plasma insulin levels are similar in treated normal and untreated diabetic rats, suggesting that SO could have a deleterious effect on ß-cell function and insulin sensitivity.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the inclusion of up to 30 % of crude glycerin in dry matter (DM) of the total diets, and its effects on meat quality parameters of feedlot Nellore bulls. Thirty animals (227. 7 ± 23. 8 kg body weight; 18 months old) were housed in individual pens and fed 5 experimental diets, containing 0, 7. 5, 15, 22. 5 or 30 % crude glycerin (DM basis). After 103 d (21 d adaptation) animals were slaughtered and the Longissimus muscle was collected. The characteristics assessed were chemical composition, fatty acid profile, cholesterol, shear force, pH, color, water-holding capacity, cooking loss and sensory properties. The increasing inclusion of crude glycerin in the diets did not affect the chemical composition of the Longissimus muscle (P > 0. 10). A quadratic effect was observed when levels of crude glycerin were increased, on the concentration of pentadecanoic, palmitoleic and <b>eicosenoic</b> fatty <b>acids</b> in meat (P < 0. 05), and on the activity of the delta- 9 desaturase 16 and delta- 9 desaturase 18 enzymes (P < 0. 05). The addition of crude glycerin increased the gamma linolenic fatty acid concentration (P < 0. 01), and altered the monounsaturated fatty acids in Longissimus muscle of animals (Pquad. < 0. 05). Crude glycerin decreased cholesterol content in meat (P < 0. 05), and promoted higher flavor score and greasy intensity perception of the meat (P < 0. 01). The inclusion of up to 30 % crude glycerin in Nellore cattle bulls`diets (DM basis) improves meat cholesterol and sensory attributes, such as flavor, without affecting significantly the physical traits, the main fatty acid concentrations and the chemical composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} goat meat has {{recently}} {{become an important}} aspect in the marketing of goats in Serbia. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare some goat meat quality parameters of various races and to determine the differences between them. Goat breeds were Balkan goat and Serbian White goat, both female in the age of four years. Analysis of quality parameters: chemical composition (moisture, protein, total fat, ash,), pH value, fatty acids, amino acids, microelements content, tenderness, cooking loss and colour measurements were done. Statistically significant difference was found between the samples of two groups of goat meat (P < 0. 05) in relation to: live weight (kg), water (%), fat (%), protein (%), ash (%), among 11 of 15 tested fatty acids, amino acid leucin, sensory examination of fresh meat for the palpatory evaluated firmness and in the content of copper and zinc. Statistically significant differences between the groups did not existed regarding the pH value, fatty <b>acids</b> <b>eicosenoic,</b> cis-heptadecenoic, t-elaidic, t-linolelaidic and amino acids alanine, arginine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine. Also there was no statistically significant difference in instrumental testing of the meat color, sensory evaluation of surface color, visual evaluated structure, olfactory evaluated odor and iron and manganese. These results suggest that the race of animal has an impact on meat quality. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between erythrocyte membrane fatty acid (FA) levels and the severity of symptoms of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Subjects {{of the present study}} consisted of 80 neuroleptic-naïve UHR patients. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between baseline erythrocyte membrane FA levels, measured by gas chromatography, and scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) after controlling for age, sex, smoking and cannabis use. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the predominance of positive or negative symptoms based on PANSS subscale scores; membrane FA levels in the three groups were then compared. More severe negative symptoms measured by PANSS were negatively correlated with two saturated FAs (myristic and margaric acids), one ω- 9 monounsaturated FA (MUFA; nervonic acid), and one ω- 3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA; docosapentaenoic acid), and were positively correlated with two ω- 9 MUFAs (<b>eicosenoic</b> and erucic <b>acids)</b> and two ω- 6 PUFAs (γ-linolenic and docosadienoic acids). More severe positive symptoms measured by PANSS were correlated only with nervonic acid. No associations were observed between FAs and MADRS scores. In subjects with predominant negative symptoms, the sum of the ω- 9 MUFAs and the ω- 6 :ω- 3 FA ratio were both significantly higher than in those with predominant positive symptoms, whereas the sum of ω- 3 PUFAs was significantly lower. In conclusion, abnormalities in FA metabolism may contribute to the neurobiology of psychopathology in UHR individuals. In particular, membrane FA alterations {{may play a role in}} negative symptoms, which are primary psychopathological manifestations of schizophrenia-related disability...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA {{encoding}} the oleate 12 -hydroxylase from {{castor bean}} (Ricinus communis L.) {{has previously been}} shown to direct the synthesis of small amounts of ricinoleic acid (12 -hydroxyoctadec-cis- 9 -enoic acid) in seeds of transgenic tobacco plants. Expression of the cDNA under control of the Brassica napus napin promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants resulted in the accumulation of up to 17 % of seed fatty acids as ricinoleate and two novel fatty acids that have been identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as lesquerolic (14 -hydroxyeicos-cis- 11 -enoic acid) and densipolic (12 -hydroxyoctadec-cis- 9, 15 -dienoic acid) acids. Traces of auricolic acid were also observed. These results suggest that either the castor hydroxylase can utilize oleic acid and <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid</b> as substrates for ricinoleic and lesquerolic acid biosynthesis, respectively, or Arabidopsis contains an elongase that accepts ricinoleic acid as a substrate. These observations are also consistent with indirect biochemical evidence that an n- 3 desaturase is capable of converting ricinoleic acid to densipolic acid. Expression of the castor hydroxylase also caused enhanced accumulation of oleic acid and a corresponding decrease in the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Since the steady-state level of mRNA for the oleate- 12 desaturase was not affected, {{it appears that the}} presence of the hydroxylase, directly or indirectly, causes posttranscriptional inhibition of desaturation...|$|E
40|$|Near-infrared {{spectroscopy}} (NIRS) {{was used}} as a rapid and nondestructive method to determine the fatty acid composition in intact seed samples of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). A total of 349 samples (about 2 g of intact seeds) were scanned in the reflectance mode of a scanning monochro-mator, and the reference values for fatty acid composition were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Calibration equations for individual fatty acids were developed using the regression method of modified partial least-squares with internal cross validation (n = 249). The equations had low SECV (standard errors of cross-validation), and high R 2 (coefficient of determination in calibration) values (> 0. 8) except for palmitic and <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Prediction of an external validation set (n = 100) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS esti-mated values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), r 2 (coefficient of determination in prediction), and the ratio of standard deviation (SD) of reference data to SEP. The models developed in this study had relatively higher values (> 3. 0 and 0. 9, respectively) of SD/SEP(C) and r 2 for oleic, linoleic, and erucic acid, characterizing those equations as having good quantitative information. The results indicated that NIRS could be used to rapidly determine the fatty acid composition in rapeseed seeds in the breeding programs for high quality rapeseed oil.

40|$|International audienceACETATE NON-UTILIZING 1 (ACN 1) is a short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, which {{activates}} acetate to acetyl-CoA in peroxisomes of Arabidopsis. Pulse-chase [2 - 13 C]acetate {{feeding of}} the mutant acn 1 - 2 revealed that acetate accumulation and assimilation were no different {{to that of}} wild-type, Col- 7. However, the lack of acn 1 - 2 led to a decrease of nearly 50 % in 13 C-labelling of glutamine, a major carbon sink in seedlings, and large decreases in primary metabolite levels. In contrast, acetyl-CoA levels were higher in acn 1 - 2 compared to Col- 7. The disappearance of <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid</b> was slightly delayed in acn 1 - 2 indicating only a small effect on the rate of lipid breakdown. A comparison of transcript levels in acn 1 - 2 and col- 7 showed that induced genes included a number of metabolic genes and also {{a large number of}} signaling-related genes. Genes repressed in the mutant were represented primarily by embryogenesis related genes. Transcript levels of glyoxylate cycle genes also were lower in acn 1 - 2 than in Col- 7. We conclude that deficiency in peroxisomal acetate assimilation comprises only a small proportion of total acetate use, but this affects both primary metabolism and gene expression. We discuss the possibility that ACN 1 safeguards against the loss of carbon as acetate from peroxisomes during lipid mobilization...|$|E
40|$|Groundnut is a {{rich source}} of edible oil. The fatty acid {{composition}} of the endogenous fats {{plays an important role in}} determining the shelf life, nutrition and flavor of groundnut. Gene action involved in the fatty acid composition (palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidic acid, <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> behenic acid and lignoceric acid) and quality parameters (Oleic/linoleic fatty acid ratio (0 /L ratio), iodine value (IV), total saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated / saturated fatty acid ratio (P/S)) and total long chain saturated fatty acids (TLCSFA)) were studied in three crosses in groundnut. Generation means analysis for all the traits indicated that additive and additive x additive gene actions played predominant role in controlling the fatty acid content and quality parameters. In addition to additive and additive x additive gene actions, dominance and additive x dominance gene action were also important in explaining variation for IV and P/S ratio. The choice of a suitable breeding procedure depends upon the relative magnitude of different gene effects and an understanding of the mode of inheritance of some complex quantitative characters. The additive and additive x additive components of genetic variation are fixable in groundnut. Oleic acid content, 0 /L ratio and IVare predominantly under the control of additive gene action; hence selection for these traits can be practiced in early generations...|$|E

Average oil content (47. 83 %) of dry seeds from all ten new cultivars was almost {{the same as that}} of wild common C. oleifera seeds (47. 06 %). New C. oleifera cultivars contained similar FA compositions which included palmitic acid (C 16 : 0, PA), palmitoleic acid (C 16 : 1), stearic acid (C 18 : 0, SA), oleic acid (C 18 : 1, OA), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2, LA), linolenic acid (C 18 : 3), <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 20 : 1), and tetracosenoic acid (C 24 : 1).

40|$|The complex surface {{structure}} of adult Schistosoma mansoni, the tegument, {{is essential for}} survival of the parasite. This tegument is syncytial and is covered by two closely-apposed lipid bilayers that form the interactive surface with the host. In order to identify parasite-specific phospholipids present in the tegument, the species compositions of the major glycerophospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol, including lysophospholipid species, were analysed in adult S. mansoni worms, isolated tegumental membranes and hamster blood cells. It was shown that there are large differences in species composition in all four phospholipid classes between the membranes of S. mansoni {{and those of the}} host blood cells. The species compositions of PS and PC were strikingly different in the tegument compared with the whole worm. The tegumental membranes are especially enriched in lysophospholipids, predominantly <b>eicosenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (20 : 1) -containing lyso-phosphatidylserine and lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine species. Furthermore, the tegument was strongly enriched in phosphatidylcholine that contained 5 -octadecenoic acid, an unusual fatty acid that is not present in the host. As we have shown previously that lysophospholipids from schistosomes affect the parasite-host interaction, excretion of these tegument-specific phospholipid species was examined in vitro and in vivo. Our experiments demonstrated that these lysophospholipids are not significantly secreted during in vitro incubations and are not detectable in peripheral blood of infected hosts. However, these analyses demonstrated a substantial decrease in PI content of blood plasma from schistosome-infected hamsters, which might indicate that schistosomes influence exosome formation by the host...|$|E
