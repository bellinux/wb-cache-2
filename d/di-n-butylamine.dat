40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods for}} air sampling and determination of isocyanates, amines, aminoisocyanates and anhydrides. These organic compounds are generated during thermal {{degradation of polymers}} such as polyurethane (PUR) or epoxy. Isocyanates, amines and anhydrides are airway irritants known to cause occupational asthma. Some of the compounds are listed as human carcinogens. Many workers are exposed. Isocyanates and anhydrides are reactive {{and needs to be}} immediately derivatized during sampling. Methods have been developed for determination of airborne isocyanates, aminoisocyanates and anhydrides using <b>di-n-butylamine</b> (DBA) as reagent to form stabile urea derivatives or amide derivatives. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) enabled detection limits as low as 10 attomoles. A nitrogen-selective LC-detector enabled quantification of DBA-derivatives in reference solutions. A novel sampler is presented. The sampler consists of a denuder in series with a three-stage cascade impactor and an end filter. The sampler made it possible to reveal the distribution of isocyanates between gas and different particle size fractions. During thermal degradation of PUR, isocyanates were associated to particle size fractions (< 1 µm) that may penetrate to the lower airways. The distribution during 8 minutes changes noticeably. Aromatic isocyanates become associated to small particles (< 1 µm). As a reference method, air-sampling was performed using an impinger filled with <b>di-n-butylamine</b> (DBA) in toluene, connected in series with a glass fiber filter. There was a good agreement between the denuder-impactor sampler and the reference method...|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{isocyanate}} sampler {{has been used to}} investigate aging aerosols generated during thermal degradation of polyurethane (PUR). The sampler consists of a denuder connected in series with a three-stage cascade impactor and a filter. The denuder collects gas-phase isocya-nates. The three impactor stages had cut-off diameters (d 50) of 2. 5, 1. 0 and 0. 5 mm, respectively. The end filter collects particles < 0. 5 mm. For derivatization of isocyanates in the sampler, <b>di-n-butylamine</b> mixed with an equimolar amount of acetic acid was used for impregnation of the sampler stages.

The sampler consists of a channel-plate de-nuder for collection of gaseous isocyanates, in series with three-cascade impactor stages with cut-off diameters (d 50) of 2. 5, 1. 0 and 0. 5 mm.

To check wether and to what degree the no observed (adverse) effect level (NO(A) EL) decreases with increasing study duration, serial sacrifices were performed after 3 and 28 days, respectively.

40|$|Isocyanates {{are used}} in the {{production}} of polyurethane (PUR). Exposure to isocyanates is associated with respiratory disorders and may occur during production or processing of PUR. During thermal degradation of PUR, amines and aminoisocyanates are formed in addition to isocyanates. Some isocyanates and several aromatic amines are sensitizers and listed as carcinogens. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for simultaneous determination of isocyanates, aminoisocyanates and amines in gas and particle phase was developed. Air samples were collected in midget impinger flasks, containing <b>di-n-butylamine</b> (DBA) in toluene, and glass fibre filters in series to form specific DBA-isocyanate derivatives. Amines were derivatized with ethyl chloroformate. Derivatives were characterized using both LC-MS and LC-chemiluminescent nitrogen detection.

40|$|Isocyanates, aromatic-, aliphatic- and alkanolamines are {{commonly}} used in the industry today. Millions of workers in Europe are exposed. The most frequent health symptoms are respiratory and dermal disorder. Due to the health risk most of the compounds in this thesis are regulated by authorities and have occupational exposure limits (OELs). Consequently, reliable and robust air sampling methods are urgently needed. In this thesis dry samplers for isocyanates, aliphatic- and alkanolamines have been developed and evaluated. The isocyanate sampler is now a commercial product (ASSET EZ 4 -NCP Dry Sampler, Supelco). The samplers {{were based on a}} denuder with a filter in series. The denuder and filter were impregnated with <b>di-n-butylamine</b> for the isocyanate sampler and with sulphuric acid for the aliphatic- and alkanolamine sampler. The robustness of the dry samplers was extensively evaluated. This was performed in a climate chamber containing a controlled atmosphere of the studied compounds. New methods based on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) were developed for determination of aromatic-, aliphatic- and alkanolamines in aqueous solutions. Isocyanates were determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography MSMS. HILIC in combination with MS is a most powerful system, and highly sensitive determinations, several orders of magnitude below the OELs, of polar compounds present in the work environment can be accomplished. The selected samplers enable sampling during short sampling times and for whole work shifts. The samplers can be stored for months before and after sampling. The performance of the samplers was unaffected by variation in temperature, humidity, flow-rate and pre- and post-sampling of ambient air. Sampling for the compounds studied is now greatly simplified, and assessment of the work environment is facilitated.

Isocyanates are derivatized with DBA to urea derivatives, and amines are derivatized in a subsequent work-up procedure with ethyl chloroformate (ET) to carbamate esters.

The instrumental detection limits for amines, aminoisocyanates and isocyanates were in the ranges 30 - 40. 2 - 3 and 3 - 70 fmol. respectively. Thermal degradation products of PUR were observed in high concentrations during welding in district heating pipes and PUR-coated metal sheets. Eleven isocyanates, three amines and five aminoisocyanates were identified.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} them, {{isocyanates}} can induce serious {{injuries in the}} respiratory tract and irritation on the skin and in the eyes. They are therefore interesting {{from the point of}} view of occupational health. The purpose of this thesis was to collect isocyanates in air with impinger-filter samplers and solvent free samplers. Furthermore the isocyanates were to be analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The solvent free sampler consists of a polypropylene tube and filter holder fitted with glass fiber filters impregnated with derivatization reagent, coupled with a pump. The impinger-filter sampler was made out of an impinger flask, containing a derivatization solution, coupled in series with a filter holder and a pump. <b>Di-n-butylamine</b> was used as derivatization reagent in both samplers to stabilize the reactive isocyanates and to enable mass spectrometric detection. The solvent free sampler is highly advantageous because of its user friendliness during field measurements, as opposed to the impinger-filter method. An exposure chamber, equipped with two interior fans to ensure good circulation, was used to generate an atmosphere containing isocyanates. Analyzing the isocyanate-DBA derivates with LC-MS/MS worked very well and the method made it possible to detect isocyanate levels below 1 ng/mL. During quantification of isocyanates a standard curve with concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/mL was used. Detection of isocyanate levels as low as one fifth of the limit value of some isocyanates was found to be possible, which would indicate that the methods are sensitive. Even though the solvent free sampler worked, the impinger-filter sampler was found to be more effective in collecting isocyanates. The coefficient of variation calculated from concentrations of isocyanates from the solvent free sampler varied between 0 - 35 %. The reason for this might be due to the fact that an optimized extraction method had not been tried out within the time limit of this project. Questions, identified during this thesis work, need to be answered before being able to obtain reliable results from field measurements with the solvent free sampler...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To study {{inhalation}} and {{dermal exposure}} to hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its oligomers {{as well as}} personal protection equipment (PPE) use during task performance in conjunction with urinary hexamethylene diamine (HDA) in car body repair shop workers and industrial spray painters. Methods: Personal task based inhalation samples (n = 95) were collected from six car body repair shops and five industrial painting companies using impingers with <b>di-n-butylamine</b> (DBA) in toluene. In parallel, dermal exposure was assessed using nitril rubber gloves. Gloves were submerged into DBA in toluene after sampling. Analysis for HDI and its oligomers was performed by LC-MS/MS. Urine samples were collected from 55 workers (n = 291) and analysed for HDA by GC-MS. Results: Inhalation exposure was strongly associated with tasks during which aerosolisation occurs. Dermal exposure occurred during tasks that involve direct handling of paint. In car body repair shops associations were found between detectable dermal exposure and glove use (odds ratio (OR) 0. 22, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 09 to 0. 57) and inhalation exposure level (OR 1. 34, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 1. 84 for a 10 -fold increase). HDA in urine could be demonstrated in 36 % and 10 % of car body repair shop workers and industrial painting company workers respectively. In car body repair shops, the frequency of detectable HDA was significantly elevated {{at the end of}} the working day (OR 2. 13, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 4. 22 for 3 - 6 pm v 0 - 8 am). In both branches HDA was detected in urine of ∼ 25 % of the spray painters. In addition HDA was detected in urine of a large proportion of non-spray painters in car body repair shops. Conclusion: Although (spray) painting with lacquers containing isocyanate hardeners results in the highest external exposures to HDI and oligomers, workers that do not perform paint related tasks may also receive a considerable internal dose...|$|E
40|$|This thesis covers {{sampling}} and analytical procedures for isocyanates (R-NCO) and amines (R-NH 2), {{two kinds of}} chemicals frequently used {{in association with the}} polymeric material polyurethane (PUR). Exposure to isocyanates may result in respiratory disorders and dermal sensitisation, and they are one of the main causes of occupational asthma. Several of the aromatic diamines associated with PUR production are classified as suspected carcinogens. Hence, the presence of these chemicals in different exposure situations must be monitored. In the context of determining isocyanates in air, the methodologies included derivatisation with the reagent <b>di-n-butylamine</b> (DBA) upon collection and subsequent determination using liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometric detection (MS). A user-friendly solvent-free sampler for collection of airborne isocyanates was developed as an alternative to a more cumbersome impinger-filter sampling technique. The combination of the DBA reagent together with MS detection techniques revealed several new exposure situations for isocyanates, such as isocyanic acid during thermal degradation of PUR and urea-based resins. Further, a method for characterising isocyanates in technical products used in the production of PUR was developed. This enabled determination of isocyanates in air for which pure analytical standards are missing. Tandem MS (MS/MS) determination of isocyanates in air below 10 - 6 of the threshold limit values was achieved. As for the determination of amines, the analytical methods included derivatisation into pentafluoropropionic amide or ethyl carbamate ester derivatives and subsequent MS analysis. Several amines in biological fluids, as markers of exposure for either the amines themselves or the corresponding isocyanates, were determined by LC-MS/MS at amol level. In aqueous extraction solutions of flexible PUR foam products, toluene diamine and related compounds were found. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of well characterised analytical procedures and techniques for determination of hazardous compounds. Without reliable and robust methodologies there is a risk that exposure levels will be underestimated or, even worse, that relevant compounds will be completely missed...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a dry sampler, with an impregnated denuder in series with a glass fibre filter, using <b>di-n-butylamine</b> (DBA) for airborne isocyanates (200 ml min- 1) is investigated and compared with an impinger flask with a glass fibre filter in series (1 l min- 1). An exposure chamber containing 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), and 2, 4 - and 2, 6 -toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in the concentration range of 5 - 205 μg m- 3 [0. 7 - 33 p. p. b.; relative humidity (RH) 50 %], generated by gas- and liquid-phase permeation, {{was used for the}} investigation. The precision for the dry sampling for five series with eight samplers were in the range of 2. 0 - 6. 1 % with an average of 3. 8 %. During 120 -min sampling (n = 4), no breakthrough was observed when analysing samplers in series. Sixty-four exposed samplers were analysed after storage for 0, 7, 14, and 21 days. No breakdown of isocyanate derivatives was observed. Twenty-eight samplers in groups of eight were collecting isocyanates during 0. 5 - 32 h. Virtually linear relationships were obtained with regard to sampling time and collected isocyanates with correlation coefficients in the range of 0. 998 - 0. 999 with the intercept close to the origin. Pre- or post-exposure to ambient air did not affect the result. Dry sampling (n = 48) with impinger-filter sampling (n = 48) of thermal decomposition product of polyurethane polymers, at RH 20, 40, 60, and 90 %, was compared for 11 isocyanate compounds. The ratio between the different isocyanates collected with dry samplers and impinger-filter samplers was in the range of 0. 80 - 1. 14 for RH = 20 %, 0. 8 - 1. 25 for RH = 40 %, 0. 76 - 1. 4 for RH = 60 %, and 0. 72 - 3. 7 for RH = 90 %. Taking into account experimental errors, it seems clear that isocyanic acid DBA derivatives are found at higher levels in the dry samples compared with impinger-filter samplers at elevated humidity. The dry sampling using DBA as the reagent enables easy and robust sampling without the need of field extraction...|$|E
40|$|Many {{sources of}} {{airborne}} contaminants {{have always been}} present in various work environments. With the development of thermosetting plastic systems, the use of reactive chemical compounds was greatly increased and thus also the risk of exposure to reactive and potentially hazardous compounds. Exposure can occur in many situations, {{not only at the}} workplace where the raw materials are handled. The finished products may emit unreacted or excess compounds, like in furniture made of particleboard with phenol-formaldehyde resin that may emit formaldehyde for a long time. Another emission source can arise when some thermosetting plastics like polyurethane and phenol-formaldehyde-urea resins are heated, intentionally or by accident. Many different types of isocyanates in a complex mixture are released at such occasions. In an effort to characterise those emissions in more detail, a new analytical method for the derivatisation and analysis of isocyanates was developed. The new derivatisation reagent, <b>di-n-butylamine,</b> was found to be suitable for the determination of many types of isocyanates even when complicated mixtures of air pollutants were present in the work environment. However, {{it was found that the}} used standard sampler, the midget impinger, had almost negligible collection efficiency for particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 1. 5 µm. In the work operations where polyurethane products were heated and decomposed, leading to the emission of isocyanate-containing aerosols, the particles were found to be mainly in the sub-micron range and thus not collected by the impinger sampler. In car repair shops, very high concentrations of airborne isocyanates found to be emitted at common work operations as welding and cutting in polyurethane painted vehicles. As an initial solution, a glass-fibre filter was connected in series after the impinger to collect the particles that otherwise would have escaped sampling. The relatively volatile reagent dibutylamine proved to be well suited for this sampling technique as the reagent evaporates from the sampling liquid and impregnates particles collected on the filter. In air samples taken with this method in car repair shops, very high concentrations of isocyanates were found to be emitted during operations such as welding and cutting in vehicles. In order to avoid undesirable reactions that can take place between the studied compound and other compounds present in the work environment, it is desirable to supply the reagent at the earliest possible moment in the sampling process. The ideal might be to supply the reagent to the sample even before collection. Using the aerosol particles as condensation nuclei for a condensing reagent vapour, this can be done. A new method to supply a large excess of liquid reagent to particles in an aerosol before collection of the particles was presented. This new type of sampler may become useful in the investigation of the actual chemical composition of reactive air contaminants at workplaces...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} paint {{products}} {{are used for}} their aesthetic and anti-corrosive properties. Isocyanates are consistently found in automobile paint products, particularly in clear coat polyurethane products. Clear coat is typically sprayed via pressurized air {{by means of an}} auto-spray robot. In clear coat repair situations, manual, air-powered spray guns are used, and manual spray Operators administer the clear coat material. The isocyanates are a primary anti-corrosive agent in polyurethane products. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not established a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have set Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) and Threshold Limit Value (TLV), respectively. NIOSH recommends a 0. 005 parts per million (ppm), 10 -hour Time Weighted Average (TWA), and a ceiling exposure of 0. 020 ppm in a 10 minute period. Similarly, ACGIH recommends a 0. 005 ppm, 8 hour TWA. Automobile manufacturers use clear coats in a variety of ways. Some may use clear coats with blocked isocyanates, or isocyanates that are completely reacted, and others may use clear coat products that allow isocyanates to be liberated during an application, baking, and curing process. The research objective {{of this study was to}} characterize exposure, focusing on a single manufacturer’s use of isocyanate-containing clear coats in their Paint Department. A newly evaluated medium (ISO 17734) using <b>di-n-butylamine</b> as a derivative agent, in a denuder tube, was selected instead of NIOSH methods 5521, 5522, and 5525. The ISO evaluated medium was selected to reduce secondary hazard exposure to toluene in impingers. Second, a medium developed by SKC, Inc., called ISO-CHEK®, was not selected because of the short collection time, sensitivity of the medium after collection, and storage and shipping requirements for analysis. Sampling took place over two days, one day for manual spray operations with 2 personal samples from Operators, and 4 area samples collected, and the second day for auto-sprayer Inspectors with 4 personal samples collected. The samples were then analyzed for hexamethylene diisocyanates (HDI) monomer and homopolymer species. The 0. 005 ppm, 10 hour TWA; the 0. 020 ppm ceiling limit (10 minutes); and the 0. 005 ppm 8 -hour TWA TLV were not exceeded on either day of sampling. Neither the area nor the personal samples exceeded the 10 hour TWA, ceiling limit, or TLV. In fact, the results had to be recalculated in to parts per billion (ppb). The average exposure for manual spray Operators was 0. 052 ppb for the homopolymer, and 0. 024 ppb for the monomer species. For auto-spray Inspectors, the average was 0. 053 ppb for the homopolymer component and 0. 021 ppb for the monomer species. Though the average isocyanate concentration was similar for both Operators and Inspectors, the averages are still below REL and TLV recommendations. These data provided preliminary information regarding the exposure to isocyanates from clear coat use, and also provide context for future evaluation of isocyanate use at this automobile manufacturer. The low concentration of isocyanates could indicate working ventilation systems, liberation of isocyanate species to non-hazardous forms, or low volatilization of isocyanates from the clear coat...|$|E
