5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, drawer fronts, or face frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its veneer core, often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or <b>high-pressure</b> <b>laminate</b> {{but only if the}} edge profile is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with <b>high-pressure</b> <b>laminate.</b> Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore pattern, variable absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or wood fillers that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and sanding through the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the use of modal testing for {{establishing}} elastic constants of engineering materials and for indicating material variability in terms of stiffness and damping properties. The methodology using modal testing techniques, is applied to timber beams, high strength concrete prisms, wood-based panels (oriented strand board and chipboard), an aluminium alloy panel and plastic laminate panels (<b>high-pressure</b> <b>laminate).</b> Experimental modal information, weighed masses and geometrical measures of the test objects are used together with the appropriate theories and models to determine elastic constants. Theories used are related to the following: free longitudinal, torsional and bending vibrations of beams and bars; free plate bending and in-plane vibrations of panels; and the free vibrations of confined solids. Where closed form solutions do not exist, solutions from finite element analyses (FEA, from available software) are used. Accuracy aspects of the modal test methodology for material characterisation are discussed. For most of the objects, static test results are compared with the dynamically established ones. It is concluded that the Rayleigh-Timoshenko-St. Venant beam theories apply well to the beam-formed materials tested. The results from an approximate solution, presented by Goens in 1931, for the free bending vibrations of free-free Timoshenko beams agree with the results obtained from FEAs. The use of modal testing to evaluate material variability is discussed in conjunction with the curing of concrete and the differences in elastic properties and bending strength of lumber. Two different methods for establishing the four independent elastic constants of thin orthotropic plates are presented. The first method uses plate bending modes and an in-plane mode, while the second method uses only in-plane modes. Values of the elastic moduli are first estimated by using expressions valid for beams after which the values are updated by matching experimental and FEA results. The in-plane Poisson ratio is determined by using specific mode shape values of an in-plane mode. For the in-plane method, the Goens solution was used and reformulated to obtain an initial estimate of the shear modulus. In addition, the Mindlin plate theory was applied to two relatively thin panels to establish the transverse shear moduli. Suggestions for characterizing confined solids are discussed. The results for the concrete prisms when using beam theories are compared with the results from using FEAs of solid models. A discussion of accuracy includes some suggestions for estimating the tolerances in established elastic constants when using modal tests. The divergence between theory and practice for realised boundary conditions is a source of error. A general guide is presented for choosing what theory should be used for a given test object in a rectangular parallelepipedic form. It is then assumed that the direction of the major E modulus coincides with the direction of the length of the object (L > B, L > H) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is {{an ideal}} tool {{material}} for machining <b>high-pressure</b> <b>laminated</b> (HPL) flooring with ceramics overlay. In this paper, the finite element (FE) model of PCD cutter was built firstly, then stress distribution of PCD cutter for machining wear resistance layer embedded with Al 2 O 3 particles was analyzed. The analysis {{results showed that the}} stress distribution was variable in rake and flank face of tool, which leads to the final uneven wear profile. Moreover, the test of cutting load was carried out. From the analysis and test, it was shown that PCD cutter was suffering from the fatigue loading of high cycling while machining. At last, a series machining experiments was conducted and the wear characteristics were examined. The analysis results were verified by the wear characteristics of PCD tool.

40|$|<b>High-pressure</b> <b>laminates</b> (HPLs) are durable, {{resistant}} to environmental effects and good cost-benefit decorative surface composite materials with special properties tailored to meet market demand. In the present work, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) was incorporated {{for the first}} time into melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) matrix on the outer layer of HPLs to provide them antimicrobial properties. Chemical binding of PHMB to resin matrix was detected on the surface of produced HPLs by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Antimicrobial evaluation tests were carried out on the ensuing HPLs doped with PHMB against gram-positive Listeria innocua and gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria. The results revealed that laminates prepared with 1. 0 wt % PHMB in MF resin were bacteriostatic (i. e., inhibited the growth of microorganisms), whereas those prepared with 2. 4 wt % PHMB in MF resin exhibited bactericidal activity (i. e., inactivated the inoculated microorganisms).

500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a <b>high-pressure</b> acrylic <b>laminate</b> finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|R
