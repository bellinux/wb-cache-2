40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> trading {{earnings}} of large U. S commercial banks {{over the past}} several years. In particular, we use several approaches to try to determine to what extent these profits can be attributed either to position-taking by banks or to the provision of intermediation services to bank customers. The results can be summarized as follows. First, banks appear to generate a substantial portion of their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> earnings from making markets in conventional spot and <b>forward</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>contracts.</b> In addition, some indirect evidence supports anecdotal reports that intermediation in volatility-related products (e. g., options contracts) has been a significantly profitable activity. Finally, on average, positions in currencies do not appear to contribute to profits. Tests applied to monthly and daily data on banks' portfolio positions suggest that banks cannot accurately forecast changes in exchange rates, and that these currency positions account for only a small fraction (if any) of the banks' <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> earnings.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} hedging {{activities}} of oil. More particularly, I investigate {{the case study}} example of British Airways (BA). The issues that examined in this paper include what types of risk BA is facing, the types of financial derivative instruments BA's using to hedge against its risks, effectiveness of BA's hedging, the extent of its derivatives usage, and a numerical example showing derivative instruments {{can be used to}} hedge against the movement of oil price risk and which derivative is more effective. I found out that the use of financial derivatives by BA is for hedging purpose, but not for speculative or trading purposes. BA is facing financing and interest rate risk, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, fuel price risk, credit risk and other risks. Therefore, BA employs a mixture of swaps, options, forward and futures to hedge against these risks. The Group uses <b>forward</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>contracts</b> to hedge against near-term <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, uses interest rate swaps to hedge against financing and interest rate risks, and uses a number of derivatives that are available the over the counter markets (such as options and forward contracts). During the financial year of 2006, the derivatives used by BA were generally found to be effective. Moreover, a numerical example is used to show how forward/futures and options can protect BA against the movement of fuel price risk. More importantly, using this example, I found out that BA is better off by using option market hedge...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} macroeconomic {{determinants of}} the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk premium in two Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that peg their currencies to the U.

The analysis {{is based on}} the stochastic discount factor methodology, which imposes a no arbitrage condition on the relationship between the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk premium and its macroeconomic determinants. Estimation results suggest that U. S. inflation and consumption growth are important factors driving the risk premium, which is in line with the standard C-CAPM model. In addition, growth in international oil prices influences the risk premium, reflecting the important role played by the hydrocarbon sector in GCC economies. The methodology employed in this paper can be used for forecasting the risk premium on a monthly basis, which has important practical implications for policymakers interested in the timely monitoring of risks in the GCC.

In the {{background}} where the domestic enterprises commonly have a weak protection consciousness against {{the exchange rate}} risk, this article makes a deep analysis based on the definition of exchange rate risk and its cause. By comparison of the traditional management method of exchange rate risk with another one based on financial engineering tools, it also deeply analyzes the method to use the financial engineering technology {{in the management of}} exchange rate risk, and concludes the primary purpose of exchange rate risk management is for hedging. This article proposes an optimal analysis method in two aspects, namely the minimum risk and maximum efficiency, for the forward-based optimal hedging, and proposes an optimal analysis method of dynamic hedging for the optimal hedging of option-based tools.
