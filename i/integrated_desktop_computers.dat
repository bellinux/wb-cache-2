25|$|Touchpads are {{primarily}} used in self-contained portable laptop computers {{and do not}} require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad {{is close to the}} keyboard, and only very short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes it possible for a user's palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Touchpads also exist for <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. Touchpads are sometimes <b>integrated</b> in some <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> keyboards, particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the life cycle}} engineering of an <b>integrated</b> <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> system {{from the perspective of}} a small to medium enterprise (SME). Using a novel approach which considers the motivations of actors at various stages during the life cycle of the PC it attempts to engineer the lifecycle through design features which have been chosen to influence these critical decision points leading to more desirable pathways from an environmental perspective. Using these motivations it extracts design principles and ultimately design and service features to (1) promote long lifetime with the original user (2) facilitate refurbishment and reuse (3) be easy to disassemble and (4) contain minimal valueless fractions at end of life. This has been achieved largely through two specific design features and supported by post-sale services to the consumer. The first of these features is a high quality finish using a solid hardwood chassis to create an emotionally durable product that is easy to refurbish and eliminates negative value plastic fractions at end of life. The second feature is a strong focus on ease of disassembly to facilitate upgrade, refurbishment and deep disassembly at end of life. The service offering is also crucial and upgrade services and buy back are available...|$|R
40|$|In {{existing}} multicomputers, software overhead {{dominates the}} messagepassing latency cost. Our {{research on the}} SHRIMP project at Princeton indicates that appropriate network interface support can significantly reduce this software overhead. We have designed two network interfaces for the SHRIMP multicomputer. Both support virtual memory mapped communication allowing user processes to communicate without doing expensive buffer management, and without using system calls to cross the protection boundary separating user processes from the operating system kernel. This paper describes and compares the two network interfaces, and discusses performance tradeoffs between them. 1 Introduction The SHRIMP (Scalable High-performance Really Inexpensive MultiProcessor) project at Princeton studies how to provide high-performance communication mechanisms in order to <b>integrate</b> commodity <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> such as PCs and workstations into inexpensive, high-performance multicomputers.

40|$|<b>Desktop</b> <b>computers</b> are {{increasingly}} used as communications devices. Advances in digital media {{are making the}} integration of video into <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> practical, both technically and economically. At the convergence of these technologies is computer-integrated desktop video conferencing. This paper discusses the requirements of <b>integrated</b> <b>desktop</b> video conferencing on a networked set of multimediacapable workstations. Among these requirements are the following: Media-intensive parts of applications should be distributed; a multimedia software platform should provide support for this. Audio and video conferencing require network transparent location and reference of people, media devices, and conferences. The name and remote access reference for a conference must be exportable to client applications. All group support applications that provide remote access require security services. True in any network application, this is more important with live communication streams, such as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Desktop</b> <b>computers</b> {{are often}} {{compromised}} by the inter-action of untrusted data and buggy software. To address this problem, we present Apiary, {{a system that}} provides transparent application fault containment while retaining the ease of use of a traditional <b>integrated</b> <b>desktop</b> envi-ronment. Apiary accomplishes this with three key mech-anisms. It isolates applications in containers that inte-grate {{in a controlled manner}} at the display and file sys-tem. It introduces ephemeral containers that are quickly instantiated for single application execution and then re-moved, to prevent any exploit that occurs from persisting and to protect user privacy. It introduces the virtual lay-ered file system to make instantiating containers fast and space efficient, and to make managing many containers no more complex than having a single traditional desk-top. We have implemented Apiary on Linux without any application or operating system kernel changes. Our re-sults from running real applications, known exploits, and a 24 -person user study show that Apiary has modest per-formance overhead, is effective in limiting the damage from real vulnerabilities to enable quick recovery, and is as easy to use as a traditional desktop while improving <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> security and privacy. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} is {{developed}} for simulating the injection of short-duration optical pulses into semiconductor lasers. The optical gain of the semiconductor {{is described by}} an empirical model which fixes all parameters following a fit to gain curves at two different densities of population inversion. The two-curve fit enforces the correct behaviour with respect to changes in carrier density and is intermediate between a rate equation model and a full microscopic approach. The electromagnetic field is integrated by the finite-difference time-domain method. The model incorporates an accurate complex susceptibility, material and gain dispersion and full phase information, and may be <b>integrated</b> on a <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> to simulate time evolution {{over a period of}} nanoseconds in a matter of hours. An appropriate choice of the grid resolution may be used to incorporate a realistic frequency dependent refractive index and simultaneously reduce the time for computation. The model is applied to the experimentally observed phenomena of dark pulse formation following injection of optical pulses into semiconductor lasers and furnishes an explanation for their formation, subsequent evolution and stability. The stability of dark pulses is explained as a re-distribution of the steady-state electric field. These investigations led to a hypothesis, and subsequent demonstration by numerical simulation, for generating stable streams of customisable pulse trains by coherent control of the phase of the injected pulse...|$|R

The data handling, storage, processing power, and communication capabilities of some modern PLCs are approximately equivalent to <b>desktop</b> <b>computers.</b> PLC-like programming combined with remote I/O hardware, allow a general-purpose <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> to overlap some PLCs in certain applications. <b>Desktop</b> <b>computer</b> controllers have not been generally accepted in heavy industry because the <b>desktop</b> <b>computers</b> run on less stable operating systems than do PLCs, and because the <b>desktop</b> <b>computer</b> hardware is typically not designed to the same levels of tolerance to temperature, humidity, vibration, and longevity as the processors used in PLCs. Operating systems such as Windows do not lend themselves to deterministic logic execution, with the result that the controller may not always respond to changes of input status with the consistency in timing expected from PLCs. Desktop logic applications find use in less critical situations, such as laboratory automation and use in small facilities where the application is less demanding and critical, because they are generally much less expensive than PLCs.|$|R
