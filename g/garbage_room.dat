50|$|Sam {{looks for}} a way to escape and realizes one wall leads to the garbage area. When Jimmy returns, she lies and says that she is hurt and needs medicine. When Jimmy brings her the medicine, she opens the {{capsules}} and starts creating a mix to try and blow out the wall to get into the <b>garbage</b> <b>room.</b> Sam's attempt fails, and Jimmy is upset that she tried to escape.|$|E

Bert also happens to see Åke throwing grass into the lower part Louise's bikini. Bert's family's neighbour soon learn how calm it has been without the Heman Hunters n the basement, and when practicing begins again, the band is kicked out. The band soon find a new practice place, inside an air-raid shelter next to a <b>garbage</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{no point}} in Carolina's life did she accept the class of society she was born into. The {{activities}} that Carolina used to occupy her free time, her decision to avoid the many vices present in everyday favela life, {{as well as her}} choice of sexual partners, all indicate that while she was physically in the favela her mind was elsewhere. For instance, [...] "what set Carolina apart in Canindé was her penchant for spending several hours a day writing". Within a highly illiterate neighborhood writing was a particularly rare accomplishment. She wrote poems, novels and stories. In the early 1940s, Carolina began taking her work to editors in an attempt to get it published. She persevered until 1960, when Brazilian journalist Audalio Dantas published her diary, Quarto de Despejo (<b>Garbage</b> <b>Room).</b>|$|E

5|$|Decades {{of efforts}} to {{eradicate}} or simply thin the rat population in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including new poison formulas and experimental trap designs. In October 2011, the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with their <b>garbage</b> <b>rooms,</b> of rat infestations. Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations. As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage cans removed due {{to the success of}} the program.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} to the building is through a porch, where the boxes were located. In addition to the inputs of a <b>garbage</b> <b>room</b> has been arranged. The ground floor is - as with all prefabricated buildings in the GDR - by half a floor raised above street level and accessible via the internal staircase. In contrast to the common type P2 were the M10 next to the stairwell always lifts {{to open up the}} levels from the basement up to the 9th Floor installed. The dwellings of the 10th Projectile are only accessible via the stairwell. A barrier-free access is available by separate ramps to the basement to the balcony of the building. On each floor there are 4 apartments. A small storage room located on each stairway landing between the gap between the elevator shaft and the outer wall. In some buildings of this type that gap has been previously used for waste disposal unit, before there was land confiscated.|$|E
40|$|The {{fire risks}} in urban {{underground}} transport systems or metros are amplified by {{the problems associated}} with mass evacuation of people in case of emergency. The primary danger is that posed by smoke, as this is difficult to vent in a controlled way from an underground space. Although most metro systems now operate no-smoking policies, a small minority of people disregard the rules and a casually dropped cigarette butt is the biggest fire danger. There is a particular danger if this occurs on an escalator where there is also the risk of fire from major mechanical failure. Fires can also occur due to overheating of electric cables or equipment in transformer & switchgear <b>rooms,</b> control <b>rooms,</b> <b>garbage</b> <b>rooms,</b> store rooms and retail shops. Fires can also result from accidents involving refurbishment work. They may also be deliberately started by an arsonist. Because of the dangers of smoke underground, the primary objective of fixed fire protection systems must be to rapidly extinguish or suppress a fire so that smoke is minimised and surrounding areas are cooled so that re-ignition cannot occur. Systems must be extremely reliable and ideally capable of frequent testing to ensure operational readiness. They should also not be people harmful or a danger to, equipment or the environment, whether set off in a fire or accidentally discharged. Current state of the ar...|$|R
50|$|In the assembly, prefects {{are searching}} every student when the prefect led the janitor to the hall, telling the school's staff the stolen school funds has been found. A student {{mentions}} seeing Kiwi sneaking to the <b>garbage</b> disposal <b>room</b> earlier with {{the bag of}} money. With all evidence pointing at Kiwi as the thief, courtesy of the prefect who made up a story on how she could've gotten away with the money, poor Kiwi had to be sent back home, while the school decides whether to expel her.|$|R
50|$|Dildo Run Provincial Park is {{a provincial}} park located on New World Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It was {{opened to the}} public in 1967. The nearest major town is Twillingate. There are 55 campsites, each with a picnic table, fireplace, <b>garbage</b> can, and <b>room</b> for a vehicle. Fifteen picnic sites offer a view of the ocean. There is also a 1.3 km hiking trail through the forest.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{homes are}} often sited in land lease {{communities}} known as trailer parks (also 'trailer courts', 'mobile home parks', 'mobile home communities', 'manufactured home communities', 'factory-built home communities' etc.), these communities allow homeowners to rent space {{on which to}} place a home. In addition to providing space, the site often provides basic utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, or natural gas and other amenities such as mowing, <b>garbage</b> removal, community <b>rooms,</b> pools, and playgrounds.|$|R

50|$|Housekeepers are an {{important}} part of up keeping nursing homes. Housekeepers play a huge part in ensuring that nursing homes are kept clean and free of disease causing agents. Housekeepers have a long list of duties which include cleaning floors, changing linens, disinfecting bathrooms, changing towels, washing clothes, emptying <b>garbage</b> cans, sanitizing <b>rooms,</b> replenishing supplies, dusting and polishing furniture, vacuuming, and keeping windows and woodwork clean. These duties can be different from facility to facility but will overall include basic cleaning. Housekeeping does not require any licensure or schooling, but some housekeeping jobs may prefer prior job experience.|$|R
50|$|The Credit Recovery Program that Barton Secondary School offers is {{primarily}} {{for students with}} learning disabilities and/or a disability that affects the student in a way that he or she can not complete a required program, such as physical education. The Credit Recovery Program, although offering a student with the chance to gain a credit, does not in fact have anything to do with academic advancement. The program is actually the recycling program and students are equipped with a blue bin, garbage bag and gloves and expected to empty the recycling and <b>garbage</b> from each <b>room</b> in the school.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was: a) to examine the public health {{importance}} of vector species onboard passenger ships, b) to survey ferries for the presence of rodents and arthropods of public health importance, b) to identify ship locations which facilitate pest infestations, and c) to evaluate the implemented pest control programmes. A detailed standardized questionnaire was developed to record information about ship characteristics and pest control practices, which were used to evaluate risk factors possibly associated with pest infestations. In addition, the archives of the Piraeus Port Health Authority and the Department of Hygiene of the Ministry of Mercantile Marine were reviewed to identify complaints related to the presence of pests aboard ships from 1994 to 2004. Only complaints which were investigated and confirmed by the Public Health Officers were included in our study results. Trapped cockroaches were investigated for Salmonella spp. A total of 486 traps for insects and rodents were placed in 21 ferries. Archives of Public Health Authorities were reviewed to identify complaints regarding the presence of pest species on board ferries from 1994 to 2004. A detail questionnaire was used to collect data on ship characteristics and pest control practices. Eighteen ferries were infested with flies (85. 7 %), 11 with cockroaches (52. 3 %), three with bedbugs, and one with fleas. Other species had been found on board were ants, spiders, butterflies, beetles, and a lizard. A total of 431 Blattella germanica species were captured in 28 (9. 96 %) traps, and 84. 2 % of them were nymphs. Ship locations with infestations were galleys (refrigerators), where cockroaches were captured in 22, 73 % of the traps were placed, while 78, 19 % {{of the total number of}} cockroaches were found there, food storage rooms with 16, 67 % trap success and 1, 62 % of the captured insect population, appliances in the ship galley with 10 % trap success and 1, 39 % of the total cockroach population and pantries. Other infested places were bars, <b>garbage</b> <b>rooms</b> and dining rooms. Cockroach infestation was negatively associated with ferries in which Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point system was applied to ensure food safety on board (Relative Risk, RR= 0. 23, p= 0. 03), and positively associated with ferries in which cockroaches were observed by crew (RR= 4. 09, p= 0. 007), no cockroach monitoring log was kept (RR= 5. 00, p= 0. 02), and pesticide sprays for domestic use were applied by crew (RR= 4. 00, p= 0. 05). Cockroach infested ships had higher age (p= 0. 03). A total of 205 rat traps were placed, but neither rats nor mice were found on any ship, but three ferries had been infested with a rodent in the past. Design and construction control measures, as well as application of an integrated pest control programme are necessary for the prevention of infestations. Different pests of public health importance can be found on board ferries. Integrated pest control programs should involve control measures for a variety of pest species including flies, cockroaches, fleas, bedbugs, ants, and rodents. Early identification of their presence is important to avoid large infestations. Measures for cockroach control should be more persistent in older ships, while different ship locations should be monitored and treated depending on the pest species. HACCP system aids in the prevention of cockroach infestations on board. ...|$|R
