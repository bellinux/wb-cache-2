5|$|Another {{departure}} from the gameplay of Final Fantasy X is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> transported via the airship Celsius. This is a deviation from the overall Final Fantasy series, where the most efficient means of transportation is typically not obtained {{until late in the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> alerts Harry {{to the presence of}} nearby creatures with bursts of static.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} choose from five skills to {{overcome}} situations: Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival. As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. This helps the player collect information about how to attack them effectively. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> the protagonist will take over a stronghold, which acts as the party's fortress. This can be upgraded.|$|E

25|$|The king {{may have}} been <b>in</b> check <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> (provided <b>the</b> king did not move when resolving the check).|$|R
5|$|A {{crowd of}} 79,500 watched as Jens Lehmann was sent off <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Despite this setback, Arsenal {{took the lead}} through Sol Campbell {{towards the end of}} the first half. The game turned with the 61st minute {{introduction}} of Henrik Larsson as a Barcelona substitute. Larsson provided two assists, one each for Samuel Eto'o and Juliano Belletti. The 2–1 victory was Barcelona's second triumph in the competition 14 years after they won the European Cup in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Banished is a city-building {{strategy}} {{video game}} developed by Shining Rock Software. It was released for Microsoft Windows on February 18, 2014. The game focuses on careful resource management and survival as an isolated and growing society. Its gameplay {{can be compared}} with economic theory on sustainability and optimization. Banished received mixed reviews on release, with reviewers praising graphics and difficulty <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> but criticizing a lack of feedback for player actions and lower emphasis on survival as the city grows.|$|E
5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be heard that resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
50|$|The Kings {{overcame the}} second largest deficit in NBA history, beating the Chicago Bulls after being down by thirty-five points <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R

50|$|Espionage: Now {{available}} much <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> this expanded feature offers players {{many new}} ways to spy on opponents, stir citizen unrest and defend their government’s secrets.|$|R
5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the teams}} on Texas regular season schedule, Colorado {{had the best}} {{historical}} record against Texas up {{to the start of}} the season. The all-time record was tied at 7–7, and the record since the formation of the Big 12 conference was tied at 3–3. Texas established a lead <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and never lost it; they led 35–10 at halftime and defeated the 2005 Colorado team by a final score of 42–17.|$|E
5|$|Revelation {{features}} several gameplay enhancements {{that aid}} puzzle solving and plot progression. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> players receive a camera, {{which can be}} used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous Myst games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu {{on the bottom of the}} game screen.|$|E
50|$|On January 14, 2015, William & Mary {{recorded}} the largest comeback win in program history against UNC Wilmington, winning 76-72, after trailing by 22 points <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R

50|$|Round 1 {{featured}} all 3 players playing Blackjack. Jerry busts out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final hand, {{and thanks}} to several Double Down 21s <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> David has a slim lead going to Round 2.|$|R
5|$|The East led 20–10 <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> before West coach, Phil Jackson {{decided to}} send O'Neal to the court. With O'Neal and Bryant on the court {{for the first time}} since 2004 NBA Finals, the West {{embarked}} on a 19–0 run to take the lead. The West continued to extend the lead in the second half and finally won the game by 27 points. Bryant finished with 27 points while Chris Paul added a game high 14 assists. Previous year's All-Star Game MVP LeBron James led the East with 20 points, but was unable to prevent the loss.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, the player character's {{parachute}} fails to open. Awakening hours later, the character finds almost all his equipment inoperable. Reaching the pyramid on foot {{hours after the}} rest of the team entered the structure, the player must complete the team's mission before the god awakens in five days. In the pyramid, the player finds bodies of squad-mates, the remains of Spanish-speaking treasure hunters, and fallen members of a Nazi expedition from the 1930s who were looking for a secret weapon but never returned. Additional plot elements can be revealed by speaking to these dead, enabled by an item attainable <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> the yellow crystal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA {{can be used to}} read e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up any of the other PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of the game will miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of weapons to fight enemies. The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top of them or hide in front of them while they are moving and hijack enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use a beacon to access the market.|$|E
5|$|Raziel {{returns as}} {{the protagonist of}} Soul Reaver 2. In Soul Reaver, Raziel {{discovered}} that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood, and his epiphanies drive {{the conflict in the}} story. Kain, the antagonist of Soul Reaver, appears as a non-player character in cutscenes, urging Raziel to unearth his destiny. Moebius the Time Streamer, a sorcerer who was a villain in Blood Omen, attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain—it is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God, Raziel's ally and guide in Soul Reaver, who is slowly established as a more sinister entity. Ariel, a specter bound to the Pillars who featured in Blood Omen and Soul Reaver, returns, and the vampire Vorador, also from Blood Omen, assists Raziel <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The ancient vampire Janos Audron, a new character who was previously only mentioned in Blood Omen, acts as Raziel's mentor {{towards the end of the}} story.|$|E
50|$|Aspas' first league {{goal for}} Sevilla came on 1 February 2015, <b>the</b> winner <b>in</b> a 3-2 victory over RCD Espanyol. <b>Earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> {{he had taken}} a shot which was handled by Kiko Casilla outside of the penalty area, {{resulting}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper's dismissal.|$|R
50|$|In {{an event}} in which four pairs had been disqualified <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games,</b> China won gold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> women's doubles with Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei {{defeating}} Japan's Mizuki Fujii and Reika Kakiiwa. Russia's Valeria Sorokina and Nina Vislova claimed the bronze medal.|$|R
50|$|Unofficial servers {{became a}} common scene within <b>the</b> MIR {{community}} <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> history.

Today, many servers are in operation.|$|R
5|$|Syracuse played {{its first}} intercollegiate {{lacrosse}} game in 1916, and captured its first USILA championship in 1920. It won USILA championships in 1922, 1924, and 1925. In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse {{is the first}} school to capture 11 National Championships, {{the most of any}} team in college lacrosse history. Most recently, Syracuse reached the men's Division I championship game in 2013 after winning two championships in 2008 & 2009 seasons and reaching the quarterfinals in 2011. However, the Orange lost 16-10 to Duke University after leading 5-0 <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The women's lacrosse team reached the NCAA Division I National Championship game {{for the first time in}} school history in 2012, which they lost to Northwestern.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers 49–3 in their opening playoff game. Favored by only three points, the Giants caught a break when 49ers WR Jerry Rice fumbled an apparent touchdown catch-and-carry off his knee <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> then dominated the Niners {{the rest of}} the way. Their defense held the 49ers to 29yards rushing, 184yards in total offense, and 2 of 14 on third-down conversions. The Giants did not commit a turnover and totalled 216 rushing yards. Jim Burt knocked 49ers quarterback Joe Montana out of the game in the second quarter, hitting him as he threw a pass which Lawrence Taylor intercepted and returned 34yards for a touchdown. The Giants defense also held the 49ers to only nine first downs, and 15 of 37 passing for zero touchdowns and three interceptions.|$|E
5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack {{into any of}} Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Pipe Mania where the player must connect two points {{on opposite sides of}} a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E
50|$|In {{a thrilling}} game, {{defensive}} lineman Jarvis Moss blocked an extra point and a field goal, including a potential game winning 48-yard {{field goal with}} only eight seconds remaining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> to ensure a Gator victory. Ray McDonald also notably blocked a field goal <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R
50|$|On January 3, 2015, Stewart intercepted Ben Roethlisberger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th quarter {{during the}} Ravens' 30-17 win <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AFC Wild Card Round. <b>Earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> Stewart defended a {{touchdown}} pass by pushing Steelers' receiver Antonio Brown {{out of bounds}} before he could complete the catch.|$|R
