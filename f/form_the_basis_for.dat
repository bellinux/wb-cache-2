5|$|Burke {{was arrested}} and tried for {{manslaughter}} but was acquitted. Following the death in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, also known as Brighton Bill, the London Prize Ring Rules were introduced to more clearly define the rules of prize fighting and to introduce certain safety measures, rules that still <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} {{of quantum mechanics}} to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as quantum field theory. In particle physics, quantum field theories <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields. Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called quasiparticles.|$|E

Thereafter, throughout the school year, the houses compete against each other in a variety of academic, artistic, and sporting events. An extensive range of almost 100 after-school activities are offered throughout the year, such as The Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme up to Gold level.|$|E
5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley {{would be able to}} learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight with its emphasis on Coleridge's private life.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{traditional}} Daoist {{ideas were}} retained in Lingbao cosmology, {{such as the}} idea that the world originated from a type of primordial qi known as yuanqi, and then was divided into heaven and earth. Furthermore, the yuanqi is subdivided into three types of qi that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the Dongzhen (Perfect Grotto), the Dongxuan (Mysterious Grotto), and of the Dongshen (Divine Grotto). These three teachings <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the later classification of texts in the Daozang.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 {{two local}} men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships {{looking for the}} mythical island of Hy-Brasil. There {{was no mention of}} the island being {{discovered}} but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he should not have engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> a variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.|$|E
5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> use of lead as {{a barrier}} that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead {{is used as a}} sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the RS-25 traces back to the 1960s when NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and Rocketdyne were {{conducting}} {{a series of studies}} on high-pressure engines, developed from the successful J-2 engine used on the S-II and S-IVB upper stages of the Saturn V rocket during the Apollo program. The studies were conducted under a program to upgrade the Saturn V engines, which produced a design for a 350,000lbf upper-stage engine known as the HG-3. As funding levels for Apollo wound down the HG-3 was cancelled as well as the upgraded F-1 engines already being tested. It was the design for the HG-3 that would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the RS-25.|$|E

Royal Navy commander George Vancouver sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed {{a change in}} the water's color, but he accepted Meares' report and continued on his journey northward. Later that month, Vancouver encountered the American captain Robert Gray at the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Gray reported that he had seen the entrance to the Columbia and had spent nine days trying but failing to enter.|$|E

Verlyn Klinkenborg's book, Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile (2006) is based wholly on that reptile, as is Sylvia Townsend Warner's The Portrait of a Tortoise (1946). The tortoise also finds its way into science, as its species, Testudo whitei (Bennett 1836), long {{thought to be a}} synonym of Testudo graeca, has been rediscovered in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|In December 1787 and January 1788, five states—Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut—ratified the Constitution with {{relative}} ease, though the bitter minority {{report of the}} Pennsylvania opposition was widely circulated. In contrast to its predecessors, the Massachusetts convention was angry and contentious, at one point erupting into a fistfight between Federalist delegate Francis Dana and Anti-Federalist Elbridge Gerry when the latter {{was not allowed to}} speak. The impasse was resolved only when revolutionary heroes and leading Anti-Federalists Samuel Adams and John Hancock agreed to ratification on the condition that the convention also propose amendments. The convention's proposed amendments included a requirement for grand jury indictment in capital cases, which would form part of the Fifth Amendment, and an amendment reserving powers to the states not expressly given to the federal government, which would later <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the Tenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|E

5|$|Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{not only}} {{launched}} the wider Fire Emblem series, {{but is also}} seen as the reason tactical role-playing genre became popular in Japan. It has thus been credited with indirectly influencing the creation of other notable games within the genre, including , Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series. The basic mechanics within Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the gameplay of nearly all subsequent Fire Emblem titles. In addition to helping popularize the genre, it is also credited with pioneering multimedia advertising through its use of a live-action television commercial in addition to magazine previews, which would later be used for series such as The Legend of Zelda. Its combination of battle and story segments also provided inspiration for the gameplay of the Sakura Wars series.|$|E
5|$|The Terminator and the T-1000 {{converge}} on John {{in a shopping}} mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah {{in order to get}} to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity. Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a Cyberdyne Systems engineer working on a revolutionary new neural net processor that will <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Skynet.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} now became {{how to provide}} this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six twelve-battalion infantry divisions with supporting arms. They {{would need to be}} organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent. Because the Army was now geared to a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role, and any elements which did not support it could be discarded. These reforms anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Armythe Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militiashould be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations. The Volunteers and Yeomanry would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the Territorial Force, whilst the Militia would be used as a reserve for the all-Regular Expeditionary Force, fully liable for service overseas.|$|E
