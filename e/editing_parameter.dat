50|$|The SWMS_2D and CHAIN_2D models {{formed the}} bases of {{versions}} 1.0 (for 16-bit Windows 3.1) and 2.0 (for 32-bit Windows 95) of HYDRUS-2D (Šimůnek et al., 1999). A unique feature of HYDRUS-2D was that it used a Microsoft Windows based Graphics User Interface (GUI) to manage the input data required to run the program, {{as well as for}} nodal discretization and <b>editing,</b> <b>parameter</b> allocation, problem execution, and visualization of results. It could handle flow regions delineated by irregular boundaries, as well as three-dimensional regions exhibiting radial symmetry about the vertical axis. The code includes the MeshGen2D mesh generator, which was specifically designed for variably-saturated subsurface flow and transport problems. The mesh generator may be used for defining very general domain geometries, and for discretizing the transport domain into an unstructured finite element mesh. HYDRUS-2D has been recently fully replaced with HYDRUS (2D/3D) as described below.|$|E

All spatially distributed parameters, such as those for various soil horizons, the root water uptake distribution, and the initial conditions for water, heat and solute movement, are specified in a graphical environment. The program offers graphs of the distributions of the pressure head, water content, water and solute fluxes, root water uptake, temperature and solute concentrations in the subsurface at pre-selected times. Also included is a small catalog of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties, as well as pedotransfer functions based on neural networks. Both HYDRUS models also consider various provisions for simulating non-equilibrium flow and transport. The flow equation for the latter purpose can consider dual-porosity-type flow with a fraction of the water content being mobile, and a fraction immobile. The transport equations additionally were modified to allow consideration of kinetic attachment/detachment processes of solutes to the solid phase, and hence of solutes having a finite size. This attachment/detachment feature has been used by many recently to simulate the transport of viruses, colloids, and bacteria.|$|E

The interface design is motivated {{to allow the}} user to intuitively and efficiently audition and evaluate parameter sets. This is particularly important with granular delay effects, since many parameter combinations will be undesirable to most listeners. The interface uses a minimalist 3 -value evaluation scheme, which lets the user protect, use, or delete candidate parameter combinations. This permits parameters to be auditioned {{in a matter of}} a few seconds or less. The interface also lets the user directly <b>edit</b> <b>parameters,</b> for further use in evolutionary exploration, or for final music production.

40|$|In {{the post}} {{production}} of a stereoscopic visual media production, high-quality depth or disparity maps are essential {{for a number of}} workflow components, from initial layer separation, over editing transfers, to the final depth compositing. With automatic depth estimation not being perfect, errors lead to increased manual efforts for the artist, e. g. by requiring additional rotoscoping on the footage. We propose to fix errors in the depth maps instead of in image space, since multiple workflow steps can benefit from improved depth information. Building upon recent advances in discrete real-time stereo estimation algorithms, we guide the artist by integrating the cost volume of a stereo matching estimation into the <b>editing</b> <b>parameters.</b> Our results improve on the good results of automated algorithms and provide an opportunity for user corrections in regions that have only partially correct estimates...|$|R

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} {{version of a}} (base) problem X {{it is assumed that}} some {{solution}} to an instance of X is no longer feasible due to changes made to the original instance, and it is required that a new feasible solution be obtained from what “remained” from the original solution at a minimal cost. In the parameterized version of such a problem, the changes made to an instance are bounded by an edit-parameter, while the cost of reconstructing a solution is bounded by some increment-parameter. Capitalizing on the recent initial work of Downey et al. on the Dynamic Dominating Set problem, we launch a study of the dynamic versions of a number of problems including Vertex Cover, Maximum Clique, Connected Vertex Cover and Connected Dominating Set. In particular, we show that Dynamic Vertex Cover is W[1]W[1]-hard, and the connected versions of both Dynamic Vertex Cover and Dynamic Dominating Set become fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the edit-parameter while they remain W[2]W[2]-hard with respect to the increment-parameter. Moreover, we show that Dynamic Independent Dominating Set is W[2]W[2]-hard with respect to the edit-parameter. We introduce the reoptimization parameter, which bounds the difference between the cardinalities of initial and target solutions. We prove that, while Dynamic Maximum Clique is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the edit-parameter, it becomes W[1]W[1]-hard if the increment-parameter is replaced with the reoptimization parameter. Finally, we establish that Dynamic Dominating Set becomes W[2]W[2]-hard when the target solution is required not to be larger than the initial one, even if the <b>edit</b> <b>parameter</b> is exactly one...|$|R

Their procedures, incorporating internal (to the measured gamma-ray spectrum) or {open_quotes}intrinsic{close_quotes} self-determination of the relative efficiency function of the sample-detector measurement system, are widely applied today. The PC/FRAM code is the most recent and most highly-developed Los Alamos code developed specifically for the nuclear safeguards applications of this technique. We will describe the measurement principles that allow accurate measurements to be taken on samples of arbitrary size, shape, and measurement geometry- and of arbitrary physical and chemical composition-through the use of known nuclear decay data (half-lives and branching intensities). Subsequently, we will describe the analysis methodology, which is driven by an easily <b>edited</b> <b>parameter</b> file that frees the user from dependence on a dedicated programmer for analyses of special cases. This methodology relies on internal gamma-ray peaks from the spectrum under analysis to self-calibrate the unknown spectrum for energy and peak shape (energy dependence of full width at half maximum (FWHM) and tailing parameters).
