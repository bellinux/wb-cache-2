25|$|Several {{mechanical}} techniques {{are used to}} dislodge sputum and encourage its <b>expectoration.</b> In the hospital setting, chest physiotherapy is used; a respiratory therapist percusses an individual's chest by hand several times a day, to loosen up secretions. Chest physiotherapy is beneficial for short-term airway clearance. Devices that recreate this percussive therapy include the ThAIRapy Vest and the intrapulmonary percussive ventilator. Other methods such as biphasic cuirass ventilation, and associated clearance mode available in such devices, integrate a cough assistance phase, {{as well as a}} vibration phase for dislodging secretions. These are portable and adapted for home use.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms usually {{began to}} appear six to 11 days after initial infection, {{beginning}} with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to <b>expectoration</b> and sometimes hemoptysis. Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by the worms. These symptoms, along with a low-grade fever, can last several months if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if the worms are attached in the larynx. Weight loss and pneumonitis have been reported as possible long-term consequences, but not anemia.|$|E
25|$|Spitting is {{the act of}} {{forcibly}} ejecting saliva {{or other}} substances from the mouth. It is often considered rude and a social taboo {{in many parts of}} the world, including Western countries, where it is frequently forbidden by local laws (as it was thought to facilitate the spread of disease). These laws are generally not strictly enforced. In Singapore, the fine for spitting may be as high as SGD$2,000 for multiple offenses, and one can even be arrested. In some other parts of the world, <b>expectoration</b> is more socially acceptable (even if officially disapproved of or illegal), and spittoons are still a common appearance in some cultures. Some animals, including humans in some cases, use spitting as an automatic defensive move. Camels are well known for doing this, though most domestic camels are trained not to.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} of chest roentgenographic findings and <b>expectorations</b> of tubercle bacilli in their sputa were studied in 455 cases with minimal pulmonary tuberculosis. 1) The patients with culturable tubercle bacilli in their sputa had pathological findings in their chest roentgenograms {{more than a}} half of one intercostal space in exudative lesions or than 1. 5 cm diameter in productive lesions. 2) As the clusters of small flecks in apex had the great posibility of conglutination and solution, the patients with apical lesions showed greater positive bacterial findings than others without apical lesions. 3) Under the chemotherapy, the cavities from which the large numbers of tubercle bacilli had been continuously eliminated were contracted and drainage bronchi had disappeared; then the <b>expectorations</b> of tubercle bacilli occured intermittently. When the size of cavity became lesser than 0. 5 cm diameter, only a few of tubercle bacilli were found in sputum intermittently. 4) The patients with minimal pulmonary tuberculosis under the chemotherapy showed very seldom or never the progression of lesions, but the patients with exudative lesions spreading more then a half of one intercostal space or productive nodular lesions more than 1. 5 cm diameter, when the chemotherapy was discontinued, showed frequently the progressions of their pulmonary lesions, without concern to bacterial findings...|$|R
30|$|Significance of {{our results}} is limited {{due to the}} small sample size which was related to the high rate of expectorated stents within the first months after stent {{placement}} {{at the beginning of the}} experiments. Obviously, an undersized balloon diameter chosen for implantation of the stents in non-stenotic airways was the cause for this issue. <b>Expectorations</b> occurred less frequent after modification of the implantation procedure by employing a larger balloon size in relation to the airway diameter at the site of implantation. Furthermore, results were obtained in a rabbit animal model. No systematic data exist on transferability of results to human tissue reactions.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The aim was {{to measure}} {{flagellin}} concentrations in the <b>expectorations</b> of CF patients and to examine whether there are correlations {{with the level of}} respiratory insufficiency and inflammation. METHODS: Sputum samples from 31 adult patients chronically colonized with P. aeruginosa were collected and analysed for their content of flagellin and IL- 8. Clinical data were extracted from patient files. RESULTS: Regardless of whether patients are colonized with mucoid strains or not, they carry clones of P. aeruginosa that express flagellin. While flagellin was present in airways of all of our CF patients, it is difficult to ascertain its contribution to inflammation (IL- 8) and lung function deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration that flagellin is present in the sputum of patients. Thus, attempts to down regulate inflammation by the use of TLR 5 (flagellin receptor) antagonists remain a possibility. However, this result needs to be extended to a larger number of patients to validate it for future research on this subject...|$|R

40|$|Cysteine cathepsins {{have emerged}} as new players in {{inflammatory}} lung disorders. Their activities are dramatically increased in the sputum of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, suggesting that {{they are involved in}} the pathophysiology of CF. We have characterized the cathepsins in CF <b>expectorations</b> and evaluated their use as markers of colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The concentrations of active cathepsins B, H, K, L and S were the same in P. aeruginosa-positive (19 Ps+) and P. aeruginosa-negative (6 Ps 2) samples, unlike those of human neutrophil elastase. Also the cathepsin inhibitory potential and the cathepsins/cathepsin inhibitors imbalance remained unchanged and similar (, 2 -fold) in the Ps+ and Ps 2 groups (p, 0. 001), which correlated with the breakdown of their circulating cystatin-like inhibitors (kininogens). Procathepsins, which may be activated autocatalytically, are a potential proteolytic reservoir. Immunoblotting and active-site labeling identified the double-chain cathepsin B, the major cathepsin in CF sputum, as the main molecular form in both Ps+ and Ps 2 samples, despite the possible release of the, 31 kDa single-chain form from procathepsin B by sputum elastase. Thus, the hydrolytic activity of cysteine cathepsins was not correlated with bacterial colonization, indicating that cathepsins, unlik...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{culture from}} the lower airway {{secretions}} is the optimal sample to guide antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The authors therefore examined whether sputum induction is an efficient, safe and acceptable procedure in CF children without spontaneous <b>expectorations.</b> Nineteen patients were studied. Their mean age (range) was 8. 6 yrs (4. 3 ± 15. 2 yrs). Their mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was 88 % predicted (46 ± 122 %). NaCl solutions from 0. 9 ± 6 % were inhaled, after baseline lung function tests before and after salbutamol. All patients did produce secretions. Alveolar macrophages were present in 16 / 19 induced samples. The procedure induced minor but significant bronchoconstriction: the mean change (range) in postsalbutamol FEV 1 (% pred) was- 7 (- 24 ± 16). Percuta-neous oxygen saturation remained above 90 % in all children. The test had to be discontinued in one child because of cough and wheeze. Acceptability of the procedure evaluated using a visual analogue scale from- 7 ± 7 showed a mean value (range) at the final concentration of- 1. 23 (- 6. 16 ± 5. 88).

40|$|The {{aspiration}} of tracheobronchial secretions {{with the}} aid of a fine catheter introduced by transtracheal puncture makes it possible to obtain, when using adequate microbiological techniques, highly reliable information on the organisms truly responsible for a bronchopulmonary infection. The authors have compared the flora obtained by tracheal puncture with that obtained in the simultaneous <b>expectorations</b> at the time of the withdrawal of the catheter. This comparison confirms the unreliability of the sputa and their frequent contamination by saprophytic rhino pharyngeal organisms, theoretically pathogenic, like Staphylococcus aureus and certain entero bacteria, the luxuriant development of which inhibits, among others, sensitive germs such as Hemophilus influenzae and the pneumococcus. The authors likewise report the results obtained in various pathologic conditions (acute pulmonary infections on a virgin terrain and on a terrain of chronic bronchitis, as well as in superinfected bronchiectases, progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary neoplasms, pulmonary complications in the immuno depressed). In particular they compare the organisms recovered shortly after the patients' admission to hospital with those obtained later in their stay in hospital. This study confirms the permanence of the classic organisms (pneumococcus and Hemophilus influenzae) the rarity in adults, apart from influenza epidemics, of the Staphylococcus aureus, and the frequency of the Pseudomonas as an organism of hospital superinfection, especially in patients with bronchiectasis.

We reported a case of 72 -year-old man admitted to hospital because of atypical chest pain related to body motions in horizontal position, especially to the left side. Pain was followed by dispnea, palpitations, fatigue, cough, yellow sputum <b>expectorations,</b> as well as elevated temperature. He had had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with saphenous vein grafts (SVGs) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) 27 years earlier. Chest X-ray revealed a poor-defined shadow {{in the region of}} the right atrium. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an atypical tumorous mediastinal mass near the right atrium and right ventricle that seemed partially calcified on transesophaeal echocardiography (TEE). CT scan confirmed an atypical mediastinal mass in contact with the right ventricle that might be a right ventricle aneurysm, pericardial cyst or SVG aneurysm. Coronary angiography was performed subsequently and it revealed a big saphenous venous graft aneurysm originating from the previous venous graft to the RCA. The aneurysm was resected and a new bypass graft was placed. Histopathology confirmed a true aneurysm of the venous graft. Conclusion. Although SVG aneurysm {{is a very}} rare complication of CABG surgery, patients presenting with atypical hilar or mediastinal mass following CABG should always be evaluated firstly for existence of this cardiosurgical complication...|$|R

We studied the extent of contamination in the environment of hospitalised children with cystic fibrosis (CF) associated with specific activities. We assessed the levels of bacterial contamination in 432 air and surface samples collected from various locations in our CF centre over a three-month period: the bedrooms, corridor, communal showers, school, leisure centre and the respiratory functional explorations (RFE) unit. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains found in bedrooms and the RFE were compared with those found in patient <b>expectorations</b> using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. In all sampling locations, there were high levels of airborne contamination just after the presence of patients or nursing staff. In the bedrooms, the amount of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa in the air, at wake-up and after physiotherapy, were significantly higher than that after the bedroom had been cleaned. For P. aeruginosa, 33 % of isolates were multiresistant to antibiotics; 50 % of the colonised patients had the same P. aeruginosa strain in their sputum as in air taken from their bedroom. P. aeruginosa was detected in 23 % of samples taken from the surfaces in the showers after patient washing. Very low levels of pathogenic bacteria were found in samples from the other locations. Overall, activities with the highest risk of contamination in the CF ward are physiotherapy and washing in the communal shower room.

The number of dives per subject varied according to the availability of the investigators and the weather conditions. In the case of several examinations for the same diver, the recordings were performed before and after each dive. The post-dive investigations, which included chest ultrasonography, were recorded between 5 and 60  min {{after the end of the}} dive. This delay was considered appropriate because Ljubkovic et al.

The diving parameters were also recorded (depth, duration at the bottom, duration of immersion, breathing apparatus, decompression stop duration, gas at depth and during decompression stops, diving suit type, and water temperature). The dive profile was recorded using a dive computer (Galileo Sol, Scubapro-Uwatec, Antibes, France).
