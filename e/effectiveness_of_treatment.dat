25|$|PPCM is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion, wherein patients have no prior {{history of heart disease}} and there are no other known possible causes of heart failure. Echocardiogram is used to both diagnose and monitor the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for PPCM.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} common {{limitations}} to studies of treatment effectiveness. Most categorize their participants by behavior rather than erotic age preference, {{which makes it}} difficult to know the specific treatment outcome for pedophiles. Many do not select their treatment and control groups randomly. Offenders who refuse or quit treatment are at higher risk of offending, so excluding them from the treated group, while not excluding those who would have refused or quit from the control group, can bias the treated group in favor of those with lower recidivism. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for non-offending pedophiles has not been studied.|$|E
25|$|Remaining {{challenges}} However, in {{the rush}} to construct planning mistakes were made. Demand was overestimated, the construction of sewerage lagged behind the construction of treatment plants, designs were sometimes inappropriate, there was no requirement for pre-treatment of industrial effluents thus affecting the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> processes, and the sites chosen for the first priority investments within a river basin were not always those where the highest impact could have been achieved in terms of improving river water quality. As a result, many plants are underutilized or poorly functioning. According to the Ministry of Construction, more than 50 wastewater treatment plants in more than 30 cities operated at only 30 percent of their capacity or did not even come into operation. Consequently, the impact of the investment program on the water quality in rivers and coastal waters has been limited.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: when {{a health}} problem is {{perceived}} as having a genetic cause, this appears to increase the perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> pharmacological <b>treatments</b> and reduce perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> non-pharmacological <b>treatments.</b> Potential mediators <b>of</b> this effect include causal attributions, perceived severity, and perceived control over the health problem. This study aimed to use experimental methods to establish which beliefs mediate the effect of genetic causal information on perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatments.</b> Design: a 4 (cause: environmental, family history, genetic test, family history & genetic test) × 2 (severity: higher or low) between-subjects design using vignettes about heart disease risk, obesity or depression. Methods: a total of 647 adults, randomly assigned to read one of the experimental vignettes, were interviewed. Key outcomes were perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> medication and <b>of</b> non-pharmacological <b>treatments.</b> Potential mediators <b>of</b> perceived severity, perceived controllability, and causal attributions were also assessed. Results: for heart disease risk, genetic causes reduced perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> non-pharmacological <b>treatments</b> (an effect mediated by causal attributions and perceived control) but did not influence perceived medication effectiveness. For obesity, neither severity nor cause influenced the perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> either <b>treatment.</b> For depression, genetic causes only increased perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> medication for more severe depression, an effect mediated by perceived control. Conclusions: the impact of genetic causal information on perceived <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatments</b> varies with type of health problem. When genetic causal information influences perceived treatment effectiveness, it does so by altering causal attributions and perceived controllability. However, these effects are small and unlikely to translate into clinically meaningful differences in health-enhancing behaviour...|$|R
25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> options. Concerns about outcome measures, such as their inconsistent use, most greatly affect how the results of scientific studies are interpreted. A 2009 Minnesota study found that parents follow behavioral treatment recommendations significantly less often than they follow medical recommendations, and that they adhere more often to reinforcement than to punishment recommendations. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have some methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the systematic reviews have reported that the quality of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children with ASD acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often can improve functioning, and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy. Educational interventions have some effectiveness in children: intensive ABA treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children, and is well established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. The limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results.|$|E
500|$|Benefits of {{treatment}} include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death. In {{the developing world}} treatment also improves physical and mental health. With treatment there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis. Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners {{and a decrease in}} mother-to-child transmission. The <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> depends to a large part on compliance. Reasons for non-adherence include poor access to medical care, inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse. The complexity {{of treatment}} regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may [...] reduce adherence. Even though cost is an important issue with some medications, 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010 and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of medications including specific indications, <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> regimens, safety of medications (i.e., drug interactions) and patient compliance issues (in the hospital and at home) many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice residency and sometimes followed by another residency in a specific area. Those pharmacists are often referred to as clinical pharmacists and they often specialize in various disciplines of pharmacy. [...] For example, there are pharmacists who specialize in hematology/oncology, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, critical care, emergency medicine, toxicology, nuclear pharmacy, pain [...] management, psychiatry, anti-coagulation clinics, herbal medicine, neurology/epilepsy management, pediatrics, neonatal pharmacists and more.|$|E
2500|$|Clients’ {{religious}} beliefs {{are increasingly being}} considered in psychotherapy {{with the goal of}} improving service and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> A resulting development was theistic psychotherapy. Conceptually, it consists of theological principles, a theistic view of personality, and a theistic view of psychotherapy. Following an explicit minimizing strategy, therapists attempt to minimize conflict by acknowledging their religious views while being respectful of client’s religious views. This is argued to up the potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. [...] In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious. [...] Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that [...] "our biases can only be suspended in {{the extent to which they}} are no longer our biases".|$|E

2500|$|Pawlenty {{made two}} large efforts to expand {{penalties}} for sexual offenders. In {{response to his}} first proposal in 2005, the state legislature passed a large package of sentencing reforms. One new instrument was {{the possibility of a}} life sentence without parole for serious offenders, although Pawlenty expressed disapproval at the courts' reluctance to use this option: only seven individuals received such a sentence {{in the first two years}} of implementation. Pawlenty made a push for even harsher sentences in 2010, which increased the presumptive sentence for first-degree sex offenses from 12 years to 25 years and increased it further for repeat offenders. At the same time he advocated for a $90-million expansion of the state's civil commitment program for sexual offenders, maintaining that the increased criminal sentences would keep the commitment program's cost under control. According to a single report in the Star Tribune, [...] "A report on Minnesota's sex-offender program delivered to legislators in the final days of the Pawlenty administration was heavily edited by a top political appointee to reflect the former governor's skepticism about the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and to delete arguments for expanded community resources for offenders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scientific {{investigation}} has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese {{concepts such as}} qi, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (qi) flowing through meridians, which was {{a major part of}} early belief systems. Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100BC in China, around the time The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huangdi Neijing) was published, though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier. Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, yin and yang energies, and a body's [...] "rhythm" [...] on the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly, depending on the country's political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine. Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries, and then to Europe, starting with France. In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves.|$|E
