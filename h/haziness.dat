5|$|WALL-E was {{the most}} complex Pixar {{production}} since Monsters, Inc. because {{of the world and}} the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, WALL-E required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the Axiom to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the Axiom environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the <b>haziness,</b> the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.|$|E
25|$|The {{sweep of}} the vision in every {{direction}} is unlimited, except by the curvature of the earth or the <b>haziness</b> of the atmosphere. The first idea suggested {{is that you are}} looking over a vast blue ocean, whose monstrous billows, once heaving and pitching in wild disorder, have been suddenly arrested by some overruling power.|$|E
25|$|If atheroma, or clots, are {{protruding}} {{into the}} lumen, producing narrowing, the narrowing {{may be seen}} instead as increased <b>haziness</b> within the X-ray shadow images of the blood/dye column within {{that portion of the}} artery; this is as compared to adjacent, presumed healthier, less stenotic areas. See the single frame illustration of a coronary angiogram image on the angioplasty page.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} of Harrison's {{compositions}} from this period, [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] incorporates aspects of Indian classical music, although the Beatles used only Western instrumentation on the track, including a drone-like Hammond organ part played by Harrison. Created during the group's psychedelic period, the track makes extensive use of studio techniques such as flanging, Leslie rotary effect, and reversed tape sounds. The song appeared in the Beatles' 1967 television film Magical Mystery Tour, in a sequence that visually re-creates the sense of <b>haziness</b> and dislocation evident on the recording.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} negative {{reviews in}} trade publications {{and it was}} deemed a distinct departure from the nature of other Thanhouser releases. The film's plot was criticized by reviewers for being concerned main character's misery. In response to the illogical plot, the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "Why the cripple should go West {{as soon as he}} is able to hobble isn't clear; perhaps the West is such a delightfully vague term that it induces <b>haziness</b> of reasoning." [...] The reviewer also noted the inexplicable reason why Allen, who originally fled, would suddenly consent to be willingly murdered by John. The reviewer opined that the story was almost maudlin in places and the acting was not sincere because the actors knew the plot was absurd. The Moving Picture World also reviewed the film quite negatively, [...] "Possibly the dramatic qualities of this picture are sufficient reason for its existence; but it has no other reason. It is not entertaining. It is not instructive. It cannot amuse. The shadow of death pervades it and the horror tragedy is the principal factor. It is such a departure from the usual Thanhouser that it seems as though the regular producer was absent when it flipped past the company's censor." [...] Advertisers for the film listed it {{in a variety of ways}} from a strong drama to having real mining activities. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear {{sclerosis}} is {{a consistent}} finding in dogs greater {{than seven years}} old. Nuclear sclerosis appears as a bilateral bluish-grey <b>haziness</b> at the nucleus, or center of the lens, and has little effect on vision. This is may be confused with cataracts.|$|E
2500|$|Oriented {{polystyrene}} (OPS) {{is produced}} by stretching extruded PS film, improving visibility through the material by reducing <b>haziness</b> and increasing stiffness. [...] This is often used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer to see the enclosed product. [...] Some benefits to OPS are that it is less expensive to produce than other clear plastics such as PP, PET, and HIPS, and it is less hazy than HIPS or PP. The main disadvantage to OPS {{is that it is}} brittle, and will crack or tear easily.|$|E
2500|$|... "Incipient crizzling" [...] {{has similar}} {{characteristic}} symptoms as stage one, however, the <b>haziness</b> {{seen on the}} glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks, which appear as tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible. A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks. [...] These cracks are {{the first sign of}} deterioration in the glass. The cracks are caused by a combination of the cycling of the glass through humid and dry environments and the loss of alkali, leaving microscopic voids in the glass.: ...|$|E
2500|$|In Two Nudes, Metzinger {{has treated}} the human body, trees and rocks {{in exactly the}} same manner. They are {{differentiated}} only by size, or by emphasising planes, from which the Russian term, plos'kost, plane surface, comes directly from the French, surface plane (in distinction to the curved plane). Metzinger sees everything as cubic multiples with which he [...] "builds", as it were, stacking them, interlocking them, and bonding them together. Thus he creates a total environment where figures and setting make up a pictorial unit. [...] Although not particularly apparent due to the <b>haziness</b> of the contemporary photograph of Metzinger’s Two Nudes, such a linear framework was the fundamental ordering principle of his painting and it can be seen clearly in his 1911 canvas, Tea Time / Le Goûter.|$|E
2500|$|In winemaking, fining is {{the process}} where a {{substance}} (fining agent) {{is added to the}} wine to create an adsorbent, enzymatic or ionic bond with the suspended particles, producing larger molecules and larger particles that will precipitate out of the wine more readily and rapidly. Unlike filtration, which can only remove particulates (such as dead yeast cells and grape fragments), fining can remove soluble substances such as polymerized tannins, coloring phenols and proteins; some of these proteins can cause <b>haziness</b> in wines exposed to high temperatures after bottling. The reduction of tannin can reduce astringency in red wines intended for early drinking. Many substances have historically been used as fining agents, including dried blood powder, but today there are two general types of fining agents [...] organic compounds and solid/mineral materials.|$|E
2500|$|Publishers Weekly wrote a {{book review}} for Why We Want You to be Rich, commenting, [...] "if it's not exactly Kierkegaardian in scope or language, this {{collaboration}} of real estate magnate and rags-to-riches financial guru manages to entertain and to inform." [...] Publishers wrote, [...] "Trump and Kiyosaki ... together are a strangely winning combination". The review concluded, [...] "Bottom line: these Messrs. Money-bags know their business. We're talking billionaires here, and really, how can you argue with success?" [...] Kiplinger's Personal Finance gave the work a critical book review writing, [...] "unimpressive book. Why We Want You to Be Rich is a thinly veiled infomercial for more financial-advice products from Kiyosaki, Trump and their minions." [...] The review noted, [...] "They sell positive thinking and can-do <b>haziness</b> -- specific details cost extra." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 1988, the Long Pool and the Missouri River in {{and around}} the city of Great Falls have been listed as an [...] "impaired" [...] {{waterway}} under the 1972 Clean Water Act. This area was first listed as impaired due to sedimentation, siltation, and suspended solids in 1988. High levels of chromium, mercury, and selenium were listed as impairing factors in 1992. High turbidity (<b>haziness</b> of water due to suspended particles) was added as an impairing factor in 2000. Sources of these impairments include Black Eagle Dam, upstream abandoned mines, irrigation runoff, industrial sources, and stormwater runoff. The MDEQ has given the area a quality ranking of B-2 (fourth out of 18), declaring it suitable for human consumption and recreation (after treatment) but only marginal for salmonid fish, other aquatic animals, waterfowl and fur-bearing animals. MDEQ has scheduled the Long Pool and Missouri River watershed in this area for future improvement.|$|E

60|$|The {{afternoon}} sunbeams at {{this moment}} are painting the gambrel-roof with a golden brown. It is September again, as it was {{three years ago when}} our story commenced, and the sea and sky are purple and amethystine with its Italian <b>haziness</b> of atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} a warmth at his heart and a slight <b>haziness</b> in his eyes that Wyllard turned away at length, but when {{he put on his}} fur cap again he was more {{determined}} than ever to carry out the search.

60|$|Fischer {{threw himself}} into the client's easy-chair. The {{furniture}} in the office seemed less distinct than usual. He was conscious of a certain <b>haziness</b> of outline in everything. Van Teyl's face, even, was shrouded in a little mist. Then he suddenly found himself fighting fiercely, fighting for his consciousness, fighting against a wave of giddiness, a deadly sinking of the heart, a strange slackening of all his nerve power. The young stockbroker rose hastily to his feet.|$|E
60|$|Raising {{himself a}} little, he looked slowly round. Beyond the hedge the white highroad climbed a bold ridge of moor that blazed {{in the strong}} {{sunshine}} with regal purple; farther back, smooth-topped hills faded into an ethereal <b>haziness</b> through varying shades of gray. The head of the deep valley near the house was steeped in blue shadow, but lower down oatfields gleamed with ocher and cadmium among broad squares of green. There were flowers in the borders about the tiny lawn, and creepers draped {{the front of the}} house. The still air was filled with the drone of bees; all was eminently peaceful.|$|E
6000|$|The sudden {{retreat of}} the army gave Washington surprise, chagrin and mortification. [...] "Every account," [...] said he subsequently, {{in a letter to}} the President of Congress, [...] "confirms the opinion I at first entertained, that our troops retreated at the instant when victory was declaring herself in our favor. The tumult, disorder, and even despair which it seems had taken place in the British army, were {{scarcely}} to be paralleled; and it is said, so strongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Chester was fixed on for their rendezvous. I can discover no other cause for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme <b>haziness</b> of the weather." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he thought}} they had gone deep enough Festing got up and looked about. White peaks glittered against a vivid blue sky. The pines sparkled with frost and the snow in their shadow was a soft gray. The river looked as black as ink, except where it foamed among the rocks, and the gorge echoed with the crash of {{drifting}} ice that shocked and splintered on the ledges. The light was strong, and rocks and trees far up the slopes stood out, harshly distinct. As {{he turned to the}} West, however, he noted a faint <b>haziness</b> and shading off in the outline of the hills.|$|E
60|$|Now it chanced there {{lived in}} the same boarding-house a fellow-clerk of his, an honest fellow, with what is called a {{weakness}} for drink--though it might, in this case, have been called a strength, for the victim had been drunk for weeks together without the briefest intermission. To this unfortunate John intrusted a letter with an inclosure of bonds, addressed to the bank manager. Even as he did so he thought he perceived a certain <b>haziness</b> of eye and speech in his trustee; but he was too hopeful to be stayed, silenced the voice of warning in his bosom, and with one and the same gesture committed the money to the clerk, and himself into the hands of destiny.|$|E
60|$|Our afternoon's {{drive was}} through scenery less {{striking}} than some {{which we had}} traversed, but still picturesque and beautiful. We saw deep valleys and ravines, with streams at the bottom; long, wooded hillsides, rising far and high, and dotted with white dwellings, well towards the summits. By and by, we had a distant glimpse of Florence, showing its great dome {{and some of its}} towers out of a sidelong valley, as if we were between two great waves of the tumultuous sea of hills; while, far beyond, rose in the distance the blue peaks of three or four of the Apennines, just on the remote horizon. There being a <b>haziness</b> in the atmosphere, however, Florence was little more distinct to us than the Celestial City was to Christian and Hopeful, when they spied at it from the Delectable Mountains.|$|E
60|$|This cliff was {{apparently}} bare of vegetation save at its base, and with buttresses and terraces and platforms {{that did not}} very greatly attract our attention at the time. It was many miles away from us in every direction; we seemed to be almost at {{the centre of the}} crater, and we saw it through a certain <b>haziness</b> that drove before the wind. For there was even a wind now in the thin air, a swift yet weak wind that chilled exceedingly but exerted little pressure. It was blowing round the crater, as it seemed, to the hot illuminated side from the foggy darkness under the sunward wall. It was difficult to look into this eastward fog; we had to peer with half-closed eyes beneath the shade of our hands, because of the fierce intensity of the motionless sun.|$|E
60|$|Sunday {{came with}} the soft <b>haziness</b> of a June morning, and the dew sucked a fresh {{fragrance}} from the blossoms and the grass. I looked out of our window at the orchard, all pink and white in the early sun, and across a patch of clover to the stone kitchen. A pearly, feathery smoke was wafted from the chimney, a delicious aroma of Creole coffee pervaded the odor of the blossoms, and a cotton-clad negro a pieds nus came down the path with two steaming cups and knocked at our door. He who has tasted Creole coffee will never forget it. The effect of it was lost upon Nick, for he laid down the cup, sighed, and promptly went to sleep again, while I dressed and went forth to make his excuses to the family. I found Monsieur and Madame with their children walking among the flowers. Madame laughed.|$|E
60|$|They {{said nothing}} more and soon {{afterwards}} went to bed. Next morning {{there was a}} marked <b>haziness</b> in the west, but the frost was keener. It {{looked as if they}} must be beaten, although they meant to fight until defeat was sure, and Festing was surprised when he glanced at his comrade. This was not the careless lounger he had known. Charnock's face was grim and somewhat pinched; his hands were torn and bruised. He picked the heaviest stones to lift and was the first to take hold of ponderous beams. Festing owned that he had misjudged Charnock, but not more than he had misjudged himself. His farming had been a rash experiment and the contract a reckless gamble; the one threatened to end as badly as the other. Then Bob had somehow kept his wife's love, and he, with senseless obstinacy, had estranged Helen.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had removed}} {{his coat and}} boots, and {{was sitting on the}} bed with {{his hands in his pockets}} repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth time, [...] "I didn't want the confounded thing to upset," [...] when it {{occurred}} to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said, and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be done. He had not a particularly complex mind, or he might have stuck for a time at that [...] "inadvertently willed," [...] embracing, as it does, the abstrusest problems of voluntary action; but as it was, the idea came to him with a quite acceptable <b>haziness.</b> And from that, following, as I must admit, no clear logical path, he came to the test of experiment.|$|E
60|$|And the colours of Murillo's palette are {{the typical}} colours of Andalusia, rich, hot, and deep--again {{contrasting}} with the enamelled {{brilliance of the}} Umbrians. He seems to have charged his brush with the very light and atmosphere of Seville; the country bathed in the splendour of an August sun has just the luminous character, the <b>haziness</b> of contour, which characterise the paintings of Murillo's latest manner. They say he adopted the style termed vaporoso for greater rapidity of execution, but he cannot have lived all his life in that radiant atmosphere without being impregnated with it. In Andalusia there is a quality of the air which gives all things a limpid, brilliant softness, the sea of gold poured out upon them voluptuously rounds away their outlines; and one can well imagine that the master deemed it the culmination of his art when he painted with the same aureate effulgence, when he put on canvas those gorgeous tints and that exquisite mellowness.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is a light}} {{within her}} eyes, [...] Like gleams of {{wandering}} fire-flies; [...] From light to shade it leaps and moves [...] Whenever in her soul arise [...] The holy shapes of things she loves; [...] Fitful it shines and changes ever, [...] Like star-lit ripples on a river, [...] Or summer sunshine on the eaves [...] Of silver-trembling poplar leaves, [...] Where the lingering dew-drops quiver. [...] I may not tell the blessedness [...] Her mild eyes send to mine, [...] The sunset-tinted <b>haziness</b> [...] Of their mysterious shine, [...] The dim and holy mournfulness [...] Of their mellow light divine; [...] The shadow of the lashes lie [...] Over them so lovingly, [...] That they seem to melt away [...] In a doubtful twilight-gray, [...] While I watch the stars arise [...] In the evening of her eyes, [...] I love it, yet I almost dread [...] To think what it foreshadoweth; [...] And, when I muse how I have read [...] That such strange light betokened death-- [...] Instead of fire-fly gleams, I see [...] Wild corpse-lights gliding waveringly.|$|E
6000|$|To be sure, if {{you came}} down to harsh facts [...] . which, it must be confessed, Anne seldom did until she had to [...] . {{it did not seem}} likely that there was much {{promising}} material for celebrities in Avonlea school; but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used her influence for good.

This pleasant vision was shattered by a most unpleasant interruption.|$|E
60|$|Boom {{is not a}} nice place, and is only {{remarkable}} for one thing: {{that the majority of}} the inhabitants have a private opinion that they can speak English, which is not justified by fact. This gave a kind of <b>haziness</b> to our intercourse. As for the Hotel de la Navigation, I think it is the worst feature of the place. It boasts of a sanded parlour, with a bar at one end, looking on the street; and another sanded parlour, darker and colder, with an empty bird-cage and a tricolour subscription box by way of sole adornment, where we made shift to dine in the company of three uncommunicative engineer apprentices and a silent bagman. The food, as usual in Belgium, was of a nondescript occasional character; indeed I have never been able to detect anything in the nature of a meal among this pleasing people; they seem to peck and trifle with viands all day long in an amateur spirit: tentatively French, truly German, and somehow falling between the two.|$|E
60|$|Not immediately, {{not for a}} long time, could Pierre fully, or by any approximation, {{realize the}} scene which he had just departed. But the vague revelation was now in him, that the visible world, some of which before had seemed but too common and prosaic to him; and but too intelligible; he now vaguely felt, that all the world, and every misconceivedly common and prosaic thing in it, was steeped a million fathoms in a mysteriousness wholly hopeless of solution. First, the enigmatical story of the girl, and the {{profound}} sincerity of it, and yet the ever accompanying <b>haziness,</b> obscurity, and almost miraculousness of it;--first, this wonderful story of the girl had displaced all commonness and prosaicness from his soul; and then, the inexplicable spell of the guitar, and the subtleness of the melodious appealings of the few brief words from Isabel sung in {{the conclusion of the}} melody--all this had bewitched him, and enchanted him, till he had sat motionless and bending over, as a tree-transformed and mystery-laden visitant, caught and fast bound in some necromancer's garden.|$|E
6000|$|In the {{vignette}} of the Lake of Como, in Rogers's Italy, {{the space}} is so small that the details have been partially lost by the engraver; but enough remain to illustrate the great principles of cloud from which we have endeavored to explain. Observe first the general angular outline of the volumes on {{the left of the}} sun. If you mark the points where the direction of their outline changes, and connect those points by right lines, the cloud will touch, but will not cut, those lines throughout. Yet its contour is as graceful as it is full of character--toppling, ready to change--fragile as enormous--evanescent as colossal. Observe how, where it crosses the line of the sun, it becomes luminous, illustrating what has been observed of the visibility of mist in sunlight. Observe, above all, the multiplicity of its solid form, the depth of its shadows in perpetual transition: it is not round and swelled, half light and half dark, but full of breaking irregular shadow and transparency--variable as the wind, and melting imperceptibly above into the <b>haziness</b> of the sunlighted atmosphere, contrasted in all its vast forms with the delicacy and the multitude of the brightly touched cirri. Nothing can surpass the truth of this; the cloud is as gigantic in its simplicity as the Alp which it opposes; but how various, how transparent, how infinite in its organization! ...|$|E
60|$|The Englishman took a {{train from}} Ajmir to Marwar Junction, {{which is on}} the road to Mount Abu, westward from Ajmir, and at five in the morning, under pale moonlight, was uncarted at the {{beginning}} of the Jodhpur State Railway--one of the quaintest little lines that ever ran a locomotive. It is the Maharaja's very own, and pays about ten per cent; but its quaintness does not lie in these things. It is worked with rude economy, and started life by singularly and completely falsifying the Government estimates for its construction. An intelligent bureau asserted that it could not be laid down for less than--but the error shall be glossed over. It was laid down for a little more than seventeen thousand rupees a mile, with the help of second-hand rails and sleepers; and it is currently asserted that the Station-masters are flagmen, pointsmen, ticket-collectors, and everything else, except platforms, and lamp-rooms. As only two trains are run in the twenty-four hours, this economy of staff does not matter. The State line, with the comparatively new branch to the Pachpadra salt-pits, pays handsomely and is exactly suited to the needs of its users. True, there is a certain <b>haziness</b> as to the hour of starting, but this allows laggards more time, and fills the packed carriages to overflowing.|$|E
60|$|Words cannot {{convey to}} you, dear reader, an {{adequate}} {{conception of the}} peculiar fascination, the exhilarating splendour of the scene by which our hunters were surrounded. Its beauty lay not in variety of feature in the landscape, for there was none. One vast sheet of white alone met the view, bounded all round by the blue circle of the sky, and broken {{in one or two}} places by a patch or two of willows, which, rising on the plain, appeared like little islands in a frozen sea. It was the glittering sparkle of the snow in the bright sunshine; the dreamy <b>haziness</b> of the atmosphere, mingling earth and sky as in a halo of gold; the first taste, the first smell of spring after a long winter, bursting suddenly upon the senses, like the unexpected visit of a long-absent, much-loved, and almost forgotten friend; the soft, warm feeling of the south wind, bearing on its wings the balmy influences of sunny climes, and recalling vividly the scenes, the pleasures, the bustling occupations of summer. It was this that caused the hunters' hearts to leap within them as they rode along--that induced old Mr Kennedy to forget his years, and shout as he had been wont to do in days gone by, when he used to follow the track of the elk or hunt the wild buffalo; and it was this that made the otherwise monotonous prairies on this particular day so charming.|$|E
