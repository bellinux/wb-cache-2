40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{characteristics}} of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>trucks</b> in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, which is located in Northern China. The multiyear emissions of GHG (CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O) from <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>trucks</b> fueled by diesel and natural gas {{during the period of}} 2006 – 2015 were compared and analyzed. The results show that the GHG emissions from <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>trucks</b> increase with time, which is consistent with the trend of the population growth. The total amount of carbon dioxide equivalence (CO 2 e) emissions in the BTH region was about 5. 12 × 106 t in 2015. Among the three sub-regions, Hebei possesses the largest number of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>trucks</b> due to the size of its heavy-duty industries. As a consequence, the GHG emissions are about 10 times compared to Beijing and Tianjin. Tractor trailers account for the major proportion of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>trucks</b> and hence contribute to about 74 % of GHG emissions. Diesel- and liquefied natural gas (LNG) -powered <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>trucks</b> can reduce GHG emissions more effectively under current national standard IV than can the previous standard. The widespread utilization of the alternative fuel of LNG to mitigate emissions must be accompanied with engine technology development in China. This study has provided new insight on management methods and the policy-making as regards trucks in terms of environmental demand...|$|R
