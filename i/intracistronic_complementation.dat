We have adapted <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene {{for use in}} mammalian cells. Enzymatic activity detectable by quantitative biochemical assay, flow cytometry, or microscopy is produced upon convergent expression of two distinct mutant lacZ peptides within single cells, or upon fusion of cells expressing such mutants. A novel fluorescent substrate for beta-galactosidase (Fluor-X-Gal) increases detection and permits simultaneous microscopic visualization of other fluorescent markers. The enzymatic complementation described here should facilitate studies of cell fusion, cell lineage, and signal transduction, by producing activity only when two proteins are expressed {{at the same time}} and place in intact cells...|$|E

Some of the Ddc-deficient alleles exhibit <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation.</b> Most of the complementing pairs of alleles are much reduced in viability, e. g. < 5 % of expected, and express a common syndrome of mutant phenes which can reasonably be inferred to derive from inadequately sclerotinized cuticle.

40|$|A {{genetic map}} of the cysB region of the Salmonella typhimurium {{chromosome}} was constructed using bacteriophage P 22 -mediated transduction. Strains bearing delta (supX cysB) mutations were employed to divide this regulatory locus into 12 segments containing a total of 39 single-site mutations. Twenty-five of these single-site mutations were further ordered by reciprocal three-point crosses. The results {{do not support the}} concept of multiple cistrons at cysB and suggest that the abortive transductants previously observed in crosses between certain cysB mutants were due to <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation.</b> The prototrophic cys- 1352 mutation, which causes the constitutive expression of the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes, was found to lie within the cysB region itself.

The pellet fractions contained the virion RNA-polypeptide N complexes, while the NS and L fractions were essentially pure preparations of these polypeptides. The synthesis of RNA by the reconstituted pellet and L fractions was inhibited at 39 °C only when the L fractions of tsB 1 or tsFl were used. Addition of the NS fractions to the reconstituted pellet and L fractions did not alter the rates of RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that polypeptide L is the temperature-sensitive polypeptide of both mutants tsB 1 and tsFl and support previous observations that polypeptide L is the transcriptase itself. The fact that a second mutant of complementation group F, tsF 2, is transcriptase-positive but replicase-negative suggests that polypeptide L is involved both in transcription and replication. <b>Intracistronic</b> <b>complementations</b> {{may account for the}} observation that the temperature-sensitive mutations affect polypeptide L in complementation groups B and F...|$|R
40|$|The only {{demonstrated}} {{mechanism for}} intracistronic genetic complementation requires physical interaction of protein subunits {{to create a}} functional molecule. We demonstrate another and perhaps quite general mechanism utilizing proteins with unique and shared domains. The Drosophila neural mutant Passover (Pas) disrupts specific synaptic connections. Alleles of a lethal complementation group exhibit a complex pattern of complementation with Pas alleles. Whereas all heterozygotes between these lethal alleles and Pas are viable, only some alleles complement the neural defect of Pas. Lethal and neural functions are separately encoded by two proteins that have distinct N-terminal domains and a common C-terminal portion. Neural-specific and lethal-specific mutations map to unique exons, while neural-lethal mutations map to shared exons. Combinations of lethal and neural alleles result in production of both proteins and demonstrate <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Further {{evidence}} {{is presented to}} confirm the previous conclusion that the enzyme from Escherichia coli catalysing the two sequential reactions in tryptophan biosynthesis, N-(5 ′-phosphoribosyl) anthranilic acid (PRA) → 1 -(o-carboxyphenyl-amino) - 1 -deoxyribulose 5 -phosphate (CdRP) → indol- 3 -ylglycerol phosphate (InGP) +CO 2 +H 2 O, consists of a single polypeptide chain. The kinetic properties of the enzyme demonstrate that intermediate CdRP formed from PRA must dissociate from the enzyme {{before it can be}} converted into InGP. It is concluded that there are two distinct and non-overlapping catalytic sites on the enzyme for the two reactions. The expected complementation between a mutationally altered form of the enzyme lacking the first reaction and a mutationally altered form lacking the second reaction has been demonstrated in vitro by InGP formation from PRA.

The three components of the SD system, the Sd locus, the Ac locus, and the modifiers in 2 R, were examined separately, and it appears that the complementation is a phenomenon associated with the Sd locus. A hypothesis of the molecular events involved in segregation distortion is formulated in the light of these observations.

40|$|The kdp genes {{code for}} a high-affinity and repressible K+ {{transport}} system. The regulation {{and organization of}} the kdp genes were analyzed by studies of constitutive mutants and of strains in which bacteriophage lambda is integrated into the kdp genes. The polar effects of lambda integration demonstrate {{that three of the}} kdp genes form an operon, kdpABC, read from A to C. The kdpD gene is a separate transcription unit and is the site of mutations making expression of the kdp genes partially constitutive. The constitutive mutants are dominant to kdpD+ in diploids. These findings, the fact that kdpD mutations identified previously are Kdp-, and the existence of <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> between some kdpD mutations indicate that the kdpD gene product is an oligomeric positive regulator of the kdp genes.

40|$|Myoblast fusion is {{essential}} to muscle tissue development yet remains poorly understood. N-cadherin, like other cell surface adhesion molecules, has been implicated by others in muscle formation based on its pattern of expression and on inhibition of myoblast aggregation and fusion by antibodies or peptide mimics. Mice rendered homozygous null for N-cadherin revealed the general importance of the molecule in early development, but did not test a role in skeletal myogenesis, since the embryos died before muscle formation. To test genetically the proposed role of N-cadherin in myoblast fusion, we successfully obtained N-cadherin null primary myoblasts in culture. Fusion of myoblasts expressing or lacking N-cadherin {{was found to be}} equivalent, both in vitro by <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> of lacZ and in vivo by injection into the muscles of adult mice. An essential role for N-cadherin in mediating the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor was also excluded. These methods for obtaining genetically homozygous null somatic cells from adult tissues should have broad applications. Here, they demonstrate clearly that the putative fusion molecule, N-cadherin, is not essential for myoblast fusion...|$|E
40|$|Most {{mutations}} rendering E. coli K 12 {{resistant to}} phage λ, map in two genetic regions malA and malB. —The malB region contains a gene lamB specifically {{involved in the}} λ receptor synthesis. Twenty-one independent lamB mutations studied by complementation belonged to a single cistron. This makes it very likely that lamB is monocistronic. Among the lamB mutants some are still sensitive to a host range mutant of phage λ. Mutations mapping in a proximal gene essential for maltose metabolism inactivate gene lamB by polarity confirming that both genes {{are part of the}} same operon. Because cases of <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> have been found, the active lamB product may be an oligomeric protein. —Previously all λ resistant mutations in the malA region have been shown to map in the malT cistron. malT is believed to be a positive regulatory gene necessary for the induction of the "maltose operons" in the malA region and in the malB region of the E. coli K 12 genetic map. No trans dominant malT mutation have been found. Therefore if they exist, they occur at a frequency of less than 10 - 8, or strongly reduce the growth rate of the mutants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> of N-terminally {{truncated}} beta-galactosidase mutants such as M 15 by coexpressed alpha-peptide {{was originally}} discovered in Escherichia coli and exploited for plasmid cloning as the well-known blue-white screening method. We show here that alpha-complementation also {{works in the}} budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and {{that it can be}} used as a simple nonselective enzymatic marker for a variety of in vivo studies, for example, on the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding and assembly. To be able to induce alpha-complementation post-translationally, we have constructed a hormone-inducible alpha-peptide by fusion of the DNA encoding the alpha-peptide to that of to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor. The accumulation of both subunits, the alpha-peptide and M 15, is severely compromised when they are expressed separately, presumably because their hydrophobic surfaces remain exposed. Moreover, alpha-complementation is defective in a strain of S. cerevisiae carrying a point mutant of the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90. Heat-shock protein 90, which coprecipitates with M 15, might be required in vivo to prevent the degradation of unassembled M 15 and to hold it in an interaction-competent conformation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConsiderable {{evidence}} {{points to}} an involvement of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in myoblast fusion. Changes {{in the level of}} NCAM expression, isoform specificity, and localization in muscle cells and tissues correspond to key morphogenetic events during muscle differentiation and repair. Furthermore, anti-NCAM antibodies have been shown by others to reduce the rate of myoblast fusion, whereas overexpression of NCAM cDNAs increases the rate of myoblast fusion compared to controls. In this study we have used a novel fusion assay based on <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> of lacZ, in combination with fluorescent X-gal histochemistry and immunocytochemistry to assess levels of NCAM expression in individual muscle cells. Our results indicate that a substantial proportion of newly fused myoblasts have NCAM expression levels unchanged from the levels of the surrounding unfused population suggesting that increased expression of NCAM is not required for wild-type myoblasts to fuse. Moreover, pure populations of primary myoblasts isolated from mice homozygous null for NCAM and therefore lacking the molecule, when placed in differentiation medium, consistently fused to form contractile myotubes with kinetics equivalent to wild-type primary myoblasts. We conclude that the increase in expression of NCAM, although typically observed during myogenesis, is not essential to myoblast fusion to form myotubes...|$|E

If this assumption is correct, the polypeptide fragment that builds up a domain {{should be able to}} spontaneously fold into its native conformation even when isolated. In an attempt to isolate and study such a fragment, the beta 2 subunit of tryptophan synthetase [tryptophan synthase, L-serine hydro-lyase (adding indoleglycerol-phosphate), EC 4. 2. 1. 20] has been subjected to controlled proteolysis. The resulting protein is shown to be a dimer, the protomer of which contains two nonoverlapping polypeptide chains of molecular weights 12, 000 and 29, 000. Though inactive, the nicked protein is shown to be in a conformation that closely resembles that of the original enzyme, since it still can form an enzyme-bound intermediate of the catalytic reactions. The fluorescence of this intermediate is used to characterize the binding sites for the cofactor (pyridoxal-P) and substrates, which are shown to exist on the nicked protein. The possibility is discussed of using the fragments isolated from the nicked protein to study individual steps of the enzymatic reaction, <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation,</b> and the folding process in the normal beta 2 subunit...|$|E
40|$|Mutants lacking NADP-linked {{glutamate}} dehydrogenase (NADP-GDH) activity have been isolated by several procedures. Complementation tests in diploids {{as well as}} tetrad analysis show that they map within a short chromosome segment, the gdhA locus, which is allelic to the ure 1 locus described previously. That the gdhA locus is a structural gene for NADP-GDH is supported by two kinds of evidence. First, <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation,</b> as well as negative complementation were observed between some of the gdhA- mutants. This is {{in agreement with the}} multimeric structure of the NADP-GDH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae shown by Venard and Fourcade (1972). Secondly, some of the mutants at the gdhA locus have a NADP-GDH with modified properties, including: five-fold higher Km for 2 -oxoglutarate, hundred-fold higher Km for NH 4 +, loss of inhibition by excess of substrate (2 -oxoglutarate), and lower thermostability. Mutants with derepressed NAD-GDH activity have been isolated from gdhA- strains {{on the basis of their}} faster growth on ammonia as sole nitrogen source. They define the gdhCR locus, which is allelic to ure 2 and usu described previously. This is a strong indication that residual growth of the gdhA- mutants on ammonia as sole nitrogen source is due to the NAD-GDH activity. © 1974 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for monitoring protein–protein interactions within intact eukaryotic cells, which should increase {{our understanding of}} the regulatory circuitry that controls the proliferation and differentiation of cells and how these processes go awry in disease states such as cancer. Chimeric proteins composed of proteins of interest fused to complementing β-galactosidase (β-gal) deletion mutants permit a novel analysis of protein complexes within cells. In this approach, the β-gal activity resulting from the forced interaction of nonfunctional weakly complementing β-gal peptides (Δα and Δω) serves as a measure of the extent of interaction of the non-β-gal portions of the chimeras. To test this application of lacZ <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation,</b> proteins that form a complex in the presence of rapamycin were used. These proteins, FRAP and FKBP 12, were synthesized as fusion proteins with Δα and Δω, respectively. Enzymatic β-gal activity served to monitor the formation of the rapamycin-induced chimeric FRAP/FKBP 12 protein complex in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as assessed by histochemical, biochemical, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting assays. This approach may prove to be a valuable adjunct to in vitro immunoprecipitation and crosslinking methods and in vivo yeast two-hybrid and fluorescence energy transfer systems. It may also allow a direct assessment of specific protein dimerization interactions in a biologically relevant context, localized in the cell compartments in which they occur, and in the milieu of competing proteins...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{transcription}} of ribosomal protein (RP) and glycolytic genes {{requires the}} Rap 1 p/Gcr 1 p regulatory complex. A third factor, Gcr 2 p, {{is required for}} only the glycolytic (specialized) mode of transcriptional activation. It is recruited to the complex by Gcr 1 p and likely mediates {{a change in the}} phosphorylation state and/or conformation of the latter. We show here that leucine zipper motifs in Gcr 1 p and Gcr 2 p (1 LZ and 2 LZ) are each specific to one of the two activation mechanisms-mutations in 1 LZ and 2 LZ impair transcription of RP and glycolytic genes, respectively. Although neither class of mutations causes more than a mild growth defect, simultaneous impairment of 1 LZ and 2 LZ results in a severe synthetic defect and a reduction in the expression of both sets of genes. <b>Intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> by point mutations in the charged e and g positions confirmed that Gcr 1 p/Gcr 1 p and Gcr 2 p/Gcr 2 p homodimers are the forms required for the different roles of the activator complex.

Dichotomous Rap 1 p activation and its striking requirement for distinct homodimeric subunits give cells the capacity to switch between coordinated and uncoupled RP and glycolytic gene regulation...|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants, termed ts B and ts C, have {{mutations}} {{in the major}} capsid protein of SV 40, Vp 1. These mutants have virion assembly defects at the nonpermissive temperature, but can complement one another when two mutants, one from each group, coinfect a cell. A third group of mutants, termed ts BC, have related phenotypes, but do not complement other mutants. We found that the mutations fall into two structural and functional classes. All ts C and one ts BC mutations map to the region close to the Ca 2 + binding sites, and are predicted to disrupt the insertion of the distal part of the C-terminal invading arm (C-arm) into the receiving clamp. They share a severe defect in assembly at the nonpermissive temperature, with few capsid proteins attached to the viral minichromosome. By contrast, all ts B and most ts BC mutations map to a contiguous region including acceptor sites for the proximal part of the C-arm and intrapentamer contacts. These mutants form assembly intermediates that carry substantial capsid proteins on the minichromosome. Thus, accurate virion assembly is prevented by mutations that disrupt interactions between the receiving pentamer and both the proximal and distal parts of the C-arms, with the latter having a greater effect. The distinct spatial localization and assembly defects of the two classes of mutants provide a rationale for their <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation</b> and suggest models of capsid assembly...|$|E
40|$|The phenotypes of five {{different}} lethal mutants of Drosophila melanogaster that have small imaginal discs were analyzed in detail. From these results, we inferred {{whether or not}} the observed imaginal disc phenotype resulted exclusively from a primary imaginal disc defect in each mutant. To examine the validity of these inferences, we employed a multiple-allele method. Lethal alleles of the five third-chromosome mutations were identified by screening EMS-treated chromosomes for those which fail to complement with a chromosome containing all five reference mutations. Twenty-four mutants were isolated from 13, 197 treated chromosomes. Each of the 24 was then tested for complementation with each of the five reference mutants. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mutation frequencies at these five loci. The stage of lethality and the imaginal disc morphology of each mutant allele were compared to those of its reference allele in order to examine the range of defects to be found among lethal alleles of each locus. In addition, hybrids of the alleles were examined for <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation.</b> For two of the five loci, we detected no significant phenotypic variation among lethal alleles. We infer that each of the mutant alleles at these two loci cause expression of the null activity phenotype. However, for the three other loci, we did detect significant phenotypic variation among lethal alleles. In fact, one of the mutant alleles at each of these three loci causes no detectable imaginal disc defect. This demonstrates that attempting to assess the developmental role of a gene by studying a single mutant allele may lead to erroneous conclusions.

Bacteriol. 90 : 1696 – 1702. 1965. —A slow motile mutant, SJ 399, was {{isolated}} from a wild-type strain of Salmonella typhimurium TM 2. The mutant was as motile as the wild type in broth culture at 37 C. However, on semisolid medium it produced a much narrower swarming band than TM 2. The motility of this mutant was hindered by the viscosity of semisolid medium. H antigenicity and morphological characters of flagella of the mutant {{were the same}} as those of the wild type. The motility phage, chi, responded differently to SJ 399 and the wild type. Plaques of SJ 399 were small and cloudy, whereas on the wild type they were large and clear. The efficiency of plating on SJ 399 was 0. 36 as compared with 1 with the wild type. Stained preparations revealed that the mutant had about one-third the number of flagella of the wild type. The reduction of the number of flagella also was ascertained by biochemical measurement of flagellar protein which was purified after deflagellation from cells. The content of flagellin in SJ 399 was about 32 % of that of the wild type. Phage P 22 -mediated transductions from SJ 399 to nonflagellated (fla−) and paralyzed (mot−) mutants showed that the mutant SJ 399 complements seven fla− and three mot− strains which are representative mutants of flagellation and motility cistrons, respectively. The mutation site of SJ 399 was cotransduced with both motA and B cistrons. The two point cross tests between SJ 399 and mot mutants revealed that the mutation site of SJ 399 is located in the motB cistron.

Transfer of the P 1 and P 3 genes to two viruses within the H 3 N 2 subtype of influenza A virus (i. e., the A/Victoria/ 3 / 75 and A/Alaska/ 6 / 77 viruses) conferred on each variant the following properties: (i) 37 °C shutoff temperature for plaque formation, (ii) almost complete restriction of viral replication in the lungs, (iii) a 100 -fold restriction of viral replication in the nasal turbinates, and (iv) genetic stability after replication in hamsters. This study was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} transfer of the two ts- 1 A 2 temperature-sensitive genes into a virus belonging to the H 1 N 1 subtype (i. e., the A/Hong Kong/ 123 / 77 virus) would result in a restriction of replication in vitro and in vivo comparable to that observed with the previously studied H 3 N 2 recombinant viruses in hamsters. This was found to be the case. In addition, infection of hamsters with the A/Hong Kong/ 77 -ts- 1 A 2 virus induced significant resistance to infection with wild-type A/Hong Kong/ 77 virus. Thus, the two ts- 1 A 2 temperature-sensitive genes attenuated influenza A viruses belonging to two distinct subtypes to a specific and predictable level. An unexpected genetic interaction was observed between several A/Hong Kong/ 77 -ts- 1 A 2 segregants bearing the group 5 (P 1) temperature-sensitive lesion.

40|$|A temperature-sensitive, fiber-minus mutant of type 5 adenovirus, H 5 ts 142, was biochemically and genetically characterized. Genetic studies {{revealed}} that H 5 ts 142 {{was a member}} of one of the three apparent fiber complementation groups which were detected owing to <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation.</b> Recombination analyses showed that it occupied a unique locus at the right end of the adenovirus genetic map. At the nonpermissive temperature, the mutant made stable polypeptides, but they were not glycosylated like wild-type fiber polypeptides. Sedimentation studies of extracts of H 5 ts 142 -infected cells cultured and labeled at 39. 5 °C indicated that a limited number of the fiber polypeptides made at the nonpermissive temperature could assemble into a form having a sedimentation value of 6 S (i. e., similar to the trimeric wild-type fiber), but that this 6 S structure was not immunologically reactive. When H 5 ts 142 -infected cells were shifted to the permissive temperature, 32 °C, fiber polypeptides synthesized at 39. 5 °C were as capable of being assembled into virions as fibers synthesized in wild type-infected cells; de novo protein synthesis was not required to allow this virion assembly. In H 5 ts 142 -infected cells incubated at 39. 5 °C, viral proteins accumulated and aggregated into particles having physical characteristics of empty capsids. These particles did not contain DNA or its associated core proteins. However, when the infected culture was shifted to 32 °C, DNA appeared to enter the empty particles and complete virions developed. The intermediate particles obtained had the morphology of adenoviruses, but they contained less than unit-length viral genomes as measured by their buoyant density in a CsCl density gradient and the size of their DNA as determined in both neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{characterize}} genetically a positive eukaryotic regulatory gene: the uaY gene of the ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. Several {{steps in the}} uptake and degradation of purines are {{under the control of}} the uaY gene (summarized in Scazzocchio and Gorton 1977). In the present paper 12 uaY- mutations are characterized with respect to their inducibility for adenine deaminase, xanthine dehydrogenase (purine hydroxylase I) and urate oxidase and by the absence of the uric acid-xanthine permease scored in vivo by resistance to 2 -thiouric acid. While 10 mutations are uniformly unleaky, two others are almost wild type for the induction of urate oxidase. A fine structure map of the uaY gene shows that the two "leaky" mutations are not clustered. The fine structure mapping unambiguously positions six uaY alleles and provides preliminary but interesting trends regarding the pattern of gene conversion in the uaY gene. The enzyme levels in all uaY-/uaY+ heterozygous diploids are intermediate between the corresponding uaY-/uaY- and uaY+/uaY+ homozygous diploids, suggesting that one functional copy of the uaY gene is able to mediate the complete induction of only one set of structural genes. No complementation was found between any two uaY- alleles. This establishes that the mutations showing either of the phenotypes are alleles in the same gene; it fails to provide evidence for <b>intracistronic</b> <b>complementation.</b> A mutation, oxpA 5, causes resistance to the xanthine analogue oxypurinol (4, 6 -dihydroxypyrazolo-(3, 4 -d) -pyrimidine) and partial constitutivity of adenine deaminase, xanthine dehydrogenase (purine hydroxylase I) and urate oxidase. The constitutive phenotype is suppressed by mutations blocking the synthesis of intracellular inducers. The mutation is recessive and complements fully with the 11 uaY- mutations tested. It maps to the left of all 12 uaY mutations to which it has been crossed. The data indicate that both the resistance and constitutivity arise from one mutational event in a gene, oxpA, different from uaY and possibly adjacent to it. We propose that the oxpA gene codes for a protein involved in limiting the flow of inducers into the cell nucleus. Thus oxpA and uaY constitute a regulatory gene cluster, indicating that uaY is the regulatory gene...|$|E

Mutant large T antigens containing only the first 138 to 140 amino acids were unable to bind to the SV 40 origin of DNA replication as were large T antigens containing at their COOH termini 96 or 97 amino acids encoded by the long open reading frame located between 0. 22 and 0. 165 map units (m. u.). All other mutant large T antigens were able to bind to the SV 40 origin of replication. Mutants with in-phase deletions at 0. 288 and 0. 243 m. u. lacked ATPase activity, but ATPase activity was normal in mutants lacking origin-binding activity. The 627 -amino acid large T antigen encoded by dlA 2465, with a deletion at 0. 219 m. u., was the smallest large T antigen displaying ATPase activity. Mutant large T antigens with the alternate 96 - or 97 -amino acid COOH terminus also lacked ATPase activity.
