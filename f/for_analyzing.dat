According to a review in Pharmaceutical Statistics, JMP is often used as a graphical front-end for a SAS system, which performs the statistical analysis and tabulations. JMP Genomics, used <b>for</b> <b>analyzing</b> and visualizing genomics data, requires a SAS component to operate and can access SAS/Genetics and SAS/STAT procedures or invoke SAS macros. JMP Clinical, used <b>for</b> <b>analyzing</b> clinical trial data, can package SAS code within the JSL scripting language and convert SAS code to JMP.|$|E

5|$|In {{the uniform}} cost model (suitable <b>for</b> <b>analyzing</b> the {{complexity}} of gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), {{each step of the}} algorithm takes constant time, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also O(h). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as O(h2). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a telescoping series, showing that it is also O(h2). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to quasilinear algorithms for the GCD.|$|E
