60|$|The apparatus, {{so far as}} it {{has been}} {{described}} with any detail, and ignoring what was said about an eye-hole, is little else than a modified copying-camera, by which an image of the transparency could be thrown on the ordinary focusing-screen, and be altered in scale and position until it was adjusted to fiducial lines drawn on the screen. It is conceivable that this should be done, and that the screen should be replaced by the <b>dark</b> <b>slide,</b> and a brief exposure given to the plate; then, that a fresh transparency should be inserted, a fresh focusing adjustment made, and a second exposure given, and so on. This, I say, is conceivable, but it would be very inconvenient. The adjusting screws would be out of reach; the head of the operator would be in an awkward position; and though these two difficulties might be overcome in some degree, a serious risk of an occasional shift of the plate during the frequent replacement of the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> would remain. I avoid all this by making my adjustments while the plate continues in position with its front open. I do so through the help of a reflector temporarily interposed between it and the lens. I do not use the ordinary focusing-screen at all in making my adjustments, but one that is flush, or nearly so, with the roof of the camera. When the reflector is interposed, the image is wholly cut off from the sensitised plate, and is thrown upwards against this focusing-screen, g. When the reflector is withdrawn, the image falls on the plate. It is upon this focusing-screen in the roof that I see the fiducial lines by which I make all the adjustments. Nothing can be more convenient than the position of this focusing-screen for working purposes. I look down on the image as I do upon a book resting on a sloping desk, and all the parts of the apparatus are within an easy arm's length.|$|E
60|$|The {{apparatus}} {{consists of}} three parts, A, B, and C. A is rigidly fixed; it contains the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> and the contrivances by which {{the position of the}} image can be viewed; the eye-hole, e, already mentioned, being part of A. B is a travelling carriage that holds the lens, and is connected by bellows-work with A. In my apparatus it is pushed out and in, and clamped where desired, but it ought to be moved altogether by pinion and rack-work.[24] The lens I use is a I B Dallmeyer. Its focal length is appropriate {{to the size of the}} instrument, and I find great convenience in a lens of wide aperture when making the adjustments, as I then require plenty of light; but, as to the photography, the smaller the aperture the better. The hole in my stop is only two-tenths of an inch in diameter, and I believe one-tenth would be more suitable.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{night we}} were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the UnDead can move. I waited here all night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most {{probable}} {{that it was because}} I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which the UnDead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last night there was no exodus, so tonight before the sundown I took away my garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be. So," [...] here he shut the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> of his lantern, [...] "now to the outside." [...] He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the door behind him.|$|E
60|$|Shoeblossom {{felt that}} the time was not yet ripe for his departure. Half an hour later he tried again. There was no rebuke. To make certain he emitted a second chuckle, replete with {{sinister}} meaning. A slight snore came {{from the direction of}} Mill's bed. Shoeblossom crept out of the room, and hurried to his study. The door was not locked, for Mr Seymour had relied on his commands being sufficient to keep the owner out of it. He slipped in, found and lit the dark lantern, and settled down to read. He read with feverish excitement. The thing was, you see, that though Claud Trevelyan (that was the hero) knew jolly well that it was Jasper who had done the murder, the police didn't, and, as he (Claud) was too noble to tell them, he had himself been arrested on suspicion. Shoeblossom was skimming through the pages with starting eyes, when suddenly his attention was taken from his book by a sound. It was a footstep. Somebody was coming down the passage, and under the door filtered a thin stream of light. To snap the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> over the lantern and dart to the door, so that if it opened he would be behind it, was with him, as Mr Claud Trevelyan might have remarked, the work of a moment. He heard the door of study number five flung open, and then the footsteps passed on, and stopped opposite his own den. The handle turned, and the light of a candle flashed into the room, to be extinguished instantly as the draught of the moving door caught it.|$|E
60|$|My {{reflector}} in {{my present}} instrument is, I {{am a little}} ashamed to confess, nothing better than a piece of looking-glass fixed to an axle within the camera, near its top left-hand edge. One end of the axle protrudes, and has a short arm; when I push the arm back, the mirror is raised; when I push it forward it drops down. I used a swing-glass because the swing action is very true, and as my apparatus was merely a provisional working model made of soft wood, I {{did not like to}} use sliding arrangements which might not have acted truly, or I should certainly have employed a slide with a rectangular glass prism, on account of the perfect reflection it affords. And let me say, that a prism of 2 inches square in the side is quite large enough for adjustment purposes, for it is only the face of the portrait that is wanted to be seen. I chose my looking-glass carefully, and selected a piece that was plane and parallel. It has not too high a polish, and therefore does not give troublesome double reflections. In fact, it answers very respectably, especially when we consider that perfection of definition is thrown away on composites. I thought of a mirror silvered {{on the front of the}} glass, but this would soon tarnish in the gaslight, so I did not try it. For safety against the admission of light unintentionally, I have a cap to the focusing-screen in the roof, and a slide in the fixed body of the instrument immediately behind the reflector and before the <b>dark</b> <b>slide.</b> Neither of these would be wanted if the reflector was replaced by a prism, set into one end of a sliding block that had a large horizontal hole at the other end, and a sufficient length of solid wood between the two to block out the passage of light both upwards and downwards whenever the block is passing through the half-way position.|$|E

5000|$|Once in {{the camera}} with a light tight back and light tight bellows, the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> may be pulled out for the {{exposure}} to be made from a lens. After the exposure, the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is put back in place and the array is put away, usually in a light tight cloth bag or box until it can be taken into a darkroom for development. The term [...] "dark slide" [...] refers to the fact the slide is pulled or slid out of the frame either plastic or wooden. On sliding it back in, the same channels for holding the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> are used to cover the film. Ordinarily, in modern film holders, the opening to permit the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> to be removed is protected by a strip of black velour or other black baffling that permits the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> to {{move in and out}} of the holder while restraining the amount of light used by the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> while either in place or removed.|$|E
50|$|To use sheet film, the {{photographer}} places {{a sheet of}} film, emulsion side out, into a film holder in the dark, and closes the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> over the loaded film. Next, the holder is inserted into a large-format camera, and the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> {{is removed from the}} holder. The exposure is made, the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is replaced, and the film holder is removed from the camera.|$|E
50|$|In photography, a <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is {{a wooden}} or metal plate {{that covers the}} {{sensitized}} emulsion side of a photographic plate. In use, a pair of plates joined back to back were used with both plates covered with a <b>dark</b> <b>slide.</b> When used, the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is removed {{for the period of}} the exposure and then replaced. Modern dark slides are used in conjunction with a film holder, that either holds in place pieces of cut sheet film or, if modified, some piece of light sensitive material such as glass.|$|E

50|$|When using a {{sheet film}} holder, {{the device is}} {{inserted}} into the camera, often a view camera, and the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is withdrawn, making the film available for exposure. After the exposure has been made, the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is reinserted into the film holder, and the device {{is removed from the}} camera for later processing of the exposed film.|$|E
50|$|Focussing {{of these}} plate cameras {{was by the}} use of a ground glass screen at the point of focus. Because lens design only allowed rather small {{aperture}} lenses, the image on the ground glass screen was faint and most photographers had a dark cloth to cover their heads to allow focussing and composition to be carried out more easily. When focus and composition were satisfactory, the ground glass screen was removed and a sensitised plate put in its place protected by a <b>dark</b> <b>slide.</b> To make the exposure, the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> was carefully slid out and the shutter opened and then closed and the <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> replaced.|$|E

5000|$|The {{panoramic}} cameras, {{which were}} used {{for most of the}} early lenticular prints, were French-made and weighed about 300 lb. In the 1930s they were known as [...] "auto-stereo cameras". These wood-and-brass cameras had a motorized lens that moved in a semicircle around the lens' nodal point. Sheet transparency film, with the lenticular lens overlay, was loaded into special <b>dark</b> <b>slides</b> (about 10×15 inches or [...] ), and these were then inserted into the camera. The exposure time was several seconds long, giving time for the motor drive to power the lens around in an arc.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{instance}} of film holder is the sheet film holder. Also {{referred to as}} a <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> or double <b>dark</b> <b>slide,</b> they are flat devices, slightly larger than the films they hold, which commonly hold one sheet of film on each side. The plate holder, which is a very similar device, holds glass plates instead of sheet film. A <b>dark</b> <b>slide,</b> from which the device derives its alternate name, is simply a dark cover that slides into a recess in the holder to protect the film (or plate) from exposure to light. Many dark slides have differently colored bands or handles on each side, one usually light and the other dark, so the photographer can distinguish between exposed and unexposed film.|$|E

30|$|Slides {{with brain}} {{sections}} {{were taken out}} of − 20 °C and dried {{at room temperature for}} at least 30 min. Reaction buffers were made fresh: for COX staining, 5 mmol/L DAB and 100 μmol/L cytochrome C were added into 0.1 mL PBS (pH 7.0), mixed quickly, before 2 μg of bovine catalase was added; for SDH staining, 1.5 mmol/L NBT, 130 mmol/L sodium succinate, 0.2 mmol/L PMS, and 1 mmol/L sodium azide were added into 0.1 mL PBS (pH 7.0), and mixed quickly in the <b>dark.</b> <b>Slides</b> were incubated with the buffers for 40 min at 37 °C, washed, dehydrated with gradient ethanol, mounted with Hardset Mounting Medium, and scanned with Zeiss Axio Z 1 Slide scanner.|$|R

50|$|A <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is {{used for}} {{magazine}} backs on medium format cameras such as Hasselblad and Mamiya, and plate or sheet film holders on view cameras, like the earlier Reisekamera.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the large}} size and very manual {{single-use}} nature of sheet films, it's possible to use a single sheet {{for more than one}} exposure. Using a <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> which has been cut in half, turning a standard format into a long, skinny panoramic format is simple and very cost effective. While the holder is in the camera, the photographer removes the complete <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> and inserts the half slide, then makes an exposure on half the sheet. The half <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> is flipped over, and {{the other half of the}} film is available for a second shot. The practice originated with photographers taking pictures of groups of banquet attendees, giving these [...] "banquet" [...] formats their name. 4×10, 7×17, 8×20, and 12×20 inches are the most commonly used of these formats.However, specialized large format banquet cameras were often used for this purpose. They rotated on a stand while exposing the film in a pass from one edge to the other. Jokesters often took advantage of this by getting on the end of the line of people being photographed and then running behind the group of people and standing on the other end of the line so that they show up on both ends of the resulting picture.|$|E
50|$|In a {{darkroom}} {{a single}} film may be inserted into a <b>dark</b> <b>slide</b> or the camera may be {{fitted with a}} roll film holder which after an exposure advances the film into a box and cuts the frame off the roll for processing as a single film.|$|E

The significantly smaller SW380M had a magazine capacity of 6 rounds.|$|R
5000|$|Arcadiana {{has been}} praised by music critics. Reviewing a 1999 {{performance}} by the Borromeo String Quartet, Allan Kozinn of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Ades's Arcadiana, written in 1994, {{is meant to be}} an evocation of paradise in seven short movements. Paradise for Mr. Ades is a place of complexity rather than simplistic loveliness; in fact, the idyllic and the terrifying are closely intertwined here. One moment <b>dark,</b> <b>sliding</b> string figures evoke a dance of death; the next is a serene paean to England in slow, gracefully consonant chordal passages." [...] He continued, [...] "Mr. Ades evokes a pantheon of sorts in fleeting, subtle, half-submerged references to Mozart, Schubert, Elgar and Wagner. He provides scenery in stretches of descriptive scoring inspired by pastoral paintings of Poussin and Watteau." [...] Reviewing a later recording of the piece, Richard Fairman of the Financial Times called it [...] "a spellbinding early Adès classic" [...] and said the piece [...] "offers a series of ingenious and alluring snapshots." [...] The music was also praised by Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times, who remarked, [...] "The accomplishment here ... is that the music feels modern, the old world as contemporary dream." ...|$|R
