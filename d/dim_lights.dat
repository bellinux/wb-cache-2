2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 July, IDF Northern Command {{contemplated}} sending paratroopers to Ayta ash-Sha'b [...] "to conduct arrests". This was postponed {{because of a lack}} of intelligence, but during the first week fighting was limited to exchanges of fire over the border. The original plan deemed it unnecessary to occupy Lebanese territory to rid the border of Hizbullah. Israel used the air force, both aircraft and attack helicopters, and artillery fire. The Lebanese fighters fired rockets, guided missiles, mortars, Katyusha rockets and heavy machine guns at Israeli towns and positions. According to Yedioth Ahronoth more than 300 rockets were fired from the area during the war. The headquarters of the 91st Division at Biranit just across the border from Ayta ash-Sha'b was subjected to a [...] "hard and extremely accurate" [...] attack by Katyusha rockets. The Command bunker received a direct hit destroying the generator and cutting off light and air supply to the facility. Only the <b>dim</b> <b>lights</b> of cell phones could be seen when terrified Israeli soldiers called home. According to Islamic Resistance commanders the fighters suffered no casualties during this period.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{addition}} of two 3 -h periods of very <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> one before and one after a normal 8 -h photope-riod, advances sexual maturity in pullets {{by about a}} week. This trial tested the hypothesis that <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> given before a short day of normal intensity is linked to form a more stimulatory day length and that <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> given after it is photosexually ignored. Pullets were reared from 2 d of age on 8 -h photoperiods. From 10 wk, they were contin-ued on 8 -h photoperiods, transferred to 16 h, or given an 8 -h period of <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> (0. 09 lx) immediately {{before or after the}} main 8 -h photoperiod. The bright/dim and dim/ bright groups matured at the same age, thus disproving the hypothesis tested. Both groups matured 1 wk earlier (Key words: sexual maturity, oviposition time, melatonin, <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> phase setting...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to our own}} {{preference}} for bright light, we tend to forget that many insects are active in very <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> Nocturnal insects possess in general superposition compound eyes. This eye design is truly optimized for <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> as photons can be gathered through large apertures comprised of hundreds of lenses. In apposition eyes, on the other hand, the aperture consists of a single lens resulting in a poor photon catch and unreliable vision in <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> Apposition eyes are therefore typically found in day-active insects. Some nocturnal insects have nevertheless managed {{the transition to a}} strictly nocturnal lifestyle while retaining their highly unsuitable apposition eye design. Large lenses and wide photoreceptors enhance the sensitivity of nocturnal apposition eyes. However, as the gain of these optical adaptations is limited and not sufficient for vision in <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> additional neural adaptations in the form of spatial and temporal summation are necessary...|$|R

40|$|The sweat bee Megalopta (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), {{unlike most}} bees, flies in {{extremely}} <b>dim</b> <b>light.</b> And although nocturnal insects are often equipped with superposition eyes, which greatly enhance light capture, Megalopta performs visually guided flight with apposition eyes. We examined how light limits Megalopta's flight behavior by measuring flight times and corresponding light levels and comparing them with flight trajectories upon {{return to the}} nest. We found the average time to land increased in <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> an effect due not to slow approaches, but to circuitous approaches. Some landings, however, were quite fast even in the dark. To explain this, we examined the flight trajectories and found that in <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> landings became increasingly error prone and erratic, consistent with repeated landing attempts. These data agree well with the premise that Megalopta uses visual summation, sacrificing acuity {{in order to see}} and fly at the very <b>dimmest</b> <b>light</b> intensities that its visual system allows...|$|R
