5|$|After {{returning}} from Italy, No. 3 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat.

40|$|Political {{justification}} figures {{prominently in}} contemporary political theory, notably in models of deliberative democracy. This article articulates and defends the essential role of partisanship in this process. Four dimensions of justification are examined in detail: the constituency to which political justifications are offered, the circumstances <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> developed, the ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> made inclusive, {{and the ways}} <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> made persuasive. <b>In</b> each case, the role of partisanship is probed and affirmed. Partisanship, we conclude, is indispensable {{to the kind of}} political justification needed to make the exercise of collective authority responsive to normative concerns...|$|R

The placement of No. 3 in this sequence is problematic because he worked on it for over a decade, starting sketches for it soon after beginning work on No. 5, but completing it after both Nos. 5 and 4.|$|E
