40|$|Incrementally {{maintaining}} a qualitative understanding of physical system behavior based on observations {{is crucial to}} real-time process monitoring, control, and diagnosis. This paper de-scribes the DATMI theory for dynamically {{maintaining a}} pinterp-space, a concise representation of local and global interpretations consistent with the observations over time. Each interpreta-tion signifies alternative paths of states in a qualitative envisionment. Representing a space of interpretations, instead of just a "current best " one, avoids the need for extensive backtracking to handle incomplete or faulty data. Domain-specific knowledge about state and transition probabilities {{can be used to}} maintain the best working interpretation as well. Domain-specific knowledge about durations of states and paths of states {{can also be used to}} further constrain the interpretation space. When all these constraints lead to inconsistencies, faulty-data hy-potheses are generated and then tested by adjusting the pinterp-space. The time and space complexity of maintaining the pinterp-space is polynomial in the number of measurements and envisionment states.

Some, like radioisotopes of po tassium (1), rubidium (1), cesium (2), and radio iodinated fatty acids (3), localize in the normal muscle and show the ischemic muscle as a â€œcoldâ€• area.

40|$|ABSTRACT Currently {{available}} dietary {{assessment tools}} have limited ability to obtain valid data within the resource con stnaints of large-scale studies. Many obstacles to gathering {{data can be}} overcome with computer-assisted self-interviewing (CASI). Computers can conduct personalized, in-depth interviews without interviewers; provide standardized data collection with appropriate levels of probing; automate data entry; encourage subjects to review and correct inconsistent data; and ensure that responses are complete. Interactive multimedia tools can motivate subjects and improve participation. Visual and aural cues may stimulate recall and improve data quality. CASI is appropriate for use in popula tions in which literacy is low and in multiple ethnic groups. A prototype CASI diet-history program was developed {{for use in the}} United States. The diet-history approach was selected to improve cognitive support and capture information on usual diet. Scripts were based on recorded interviews with dietitians and interviewers from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. At the end of the interview, participants are given information on how their reported nutrient intakes compare with current recommenda tions for their age and sex. The prototype was tested in focus groups of mixed age, sex, ethnicity, and education, with <b>encour</b> aging results.

40|$|The {{practical}} {{organization of}} oral anticoagulant therapy with pediatric patients is often difficult. As an <b>encouring</b> alternative portable coagulation time monitors {{were developed in}} the last years to measure the prothrombin time with capillary blood. To evaluate the reliability of this method during childhood we examined in a prospective study 334 blood samples (175 capillary, 149 venous, 10 arterial blood) of 94 children (age: 1 - 18; median: 6, 11 years) with and without phenprocoumon treatment with the CoaguChek-system, Roche diagnostics. The measurements were compared to a standard laboratory coagulation test (KC 10 / KC 40). In the group of children with phenprocoumon we found a linear correlation of the two methods (r = 0, 96; y = 1, 12 x - 0, 28). The measurements were not dependent on laboratory parameters like leucocyte or platelet count, hematocrit and bilirubin. The capillary, venous and arterial samples were comparable. Simultaneous treatment with heparin leads to overestimation of the prothrombin time (INR) by the CoaguChek system. Though we think with an appropiate, responsible regime of oral anticoagulation there is no further risk for thrombembolism. The measurements of CoaguChek on children without oral anticoagulation with normal prothrombin times in the range from 0, 9 to 1, 4 INR were inexact. Conclusion: The capillary prothrombin time (CoaguChek) is a sufficient method for children with phenprocoumon therapy and facilitates self-determination under medical control...|$|R

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{activity in}} science curricu-lum development {{during the last}} ten years has been accompanied by productive research in the general area of the class-room behavior of teachers. Curriculum developers and research psychologists have joined forces in many instances to study how the classroom teacher has uti-lized the new material and which tech-niques have proved the most valuable. In 1964, Simon (13) and her colleagues at Temple University conducted a survey of the use of observational systems in classroom teacher-pupil interaction. Ap-proximately fifteen hundred question-naires were sent to educators who might have used an observational system in their work. The replies indicated that there were over twenty-five different sys-tems, plus modifications of systems, be-ing used. Amidon and Simon (i) established three main divisions to classify systems used to collect and categorize observa-tional data involving teacher-pupil inter-action-cognitive, affective, and multidi-mensional. The affective category, and more specifically the Flanders System of Interaction Analysis, will be dealt with in this paper. In regard to the Flanders System of In-teraction Analysis, Hough and Ober (7) stated the assumption that &dquo;all other things being equal, teachers (a) who are more accepting, unconditional and less re-jecting in their relationships with stu-dents and (b) who are aware of and are able to use a variety of appropriate teach-ing behaviors will be able to facilitate more learning in their classrooms. &dquo; Most experienced teachers would accept this assumption as self-evident.

40|$|A {{well-known}} empirical regularity {{in international}} economics is that purchasing power parity {{does not hold}} {{in the short run}} and the real costs of living in poor countries tend to be lower than in rich ones. This paper argues that the asymmetric purchasing power of di¤erent currencies can induce migration from poor to rich countries {{even in the absence of}} a positive real wage premium. By earning a wage in the rich host country and spending part or all of it in the source country, where the real costs of living are lower, migrants can gain in terms of utility, if not in terms of real wages in the conventional sense. This in turn suggests that migrant workers may be more willing to work for low-paying jobs in the host country to the extent that the currency of the host country is overvalued. This paper presents a micro-founded model of international migration and remittances, and tests its key implications on the basis of the Mexican Migration Project (MMP) dataset, which documents the U. S. -bound migration experiences of Mexican workers. By exploiting the exogenous variation in the U. S. -Mexico real exchange rate and the characteristics of migrant workers, it 8 ̆ 5 nds that as the purchasing power of the U.

40|$|Abstract. I {{consider}} a two-candidate election {{in which there}} is aggre-gate uncertainty about the popularity of each candidate, where voting is costly, and where participants are instrumentally motivated. The unique equilibrium predicts substantial turnout under reasonable pa-rameter configurations, and greater turnout for the apparent underdog offsets the expected advantage of the perceived leader. I also present clear predictions about the response of turnout and the election outcome to various parameters, including the importance of the election; the cost of voting; the perceived popularity of each candidate; and the accuracy of pre-election information sources, such as opinion polls. THE TURNOUT PARADOX Why do people vote? Across the supporters of different competing candidates, how is turnout likely to vary? Is the election result likely to reflect accurately the pattern of preferences throughout the electorate? These questions are central to the study of democratic systems; they are questions which have attracted the attention of the most insightful theorists and the most careful empirical researchers. Nevertheless, the turnout question (why do people vote?) has proved problematic for theories based on instrumental actors. In an oft-quoted question based on a statement made by Fiorina (1989), Grofman (1993) provocatively asked: is turnout the paradox that ate rational choice theory? The paradox is this: people do vote and yet it is alleged that any “reasonable ” rational-choice theory suggests that they should not. 1 Although this is a recent paper, I have spoken with many colleagues about the research upon which it is based over a lengthy period of time.

40|$|Watching school-aged {{children}} at recess {{provides an excellent}} opportunity to observe the effects of sudden and severe pain caused by minor injuries. The difference between the healthy child, playing vigorously, and the injured child, motionless on the ground, is striking. The healthy child is constantly in mo tion. The games that children play always involve running or skipping, jumping or tumbling. Yet let a child injure himself or herself, and this motion is obliterated in an instant. In {{the time it takes}} to fall to the ground the injured child becomes paralyzed in pain. There is no movement possible for the one who has just sprained an ankle or skinned a knee. For the injured child there is only pain—pain which can be seen in the way the child lies still; pain which can be seen in the way the child slowly moves to inspect the injured area; pain which can be seen in the tear-stained, contorted face of the youngster. The child in pain has been removed from the happy, playful world in which he or she responded quickly and readily to the adult’s words of <b>encour</b> agement and friendship. It is a private world, the world of pain. Following an injury, the adult stands by helpless, not knowing what to say, unable to comfort the sobbing child. What does it mean to hurt? What does hurt do to the world of a child? How does a hurt child live out the world of pain? The answers to these questions can be found in a careful description of the child at play. This description includes the happy, light, laughing child who runs and skips over the earth, as well as the despondent, heavy, tearful child who lies broken and still on the ground. The child in pain has suddenly been removed to a distant world, a world that is foreign to the one not suffering that pain. A pedagogy of pain will introduce the adult to the terrain of the child’s painful world. A careful contrast between the child’s world of action and world of pain provides an intro duction to the language of pain. It allows us access, no matter for now how tentative, how faltering, to the child’s painful world. With this first access comes understanding, and with understanding the possibility for comfort...|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} draws great attention {{today from}} {{many people and}} businesses. Some companies are beginning to play off these concerns in their marketing approach, while others dodge the topic at all turns. While many people feel we have serious environmental problems, others do not. It is a subject with which everyone is, perhaps, too hasty in their judgment. This thesis project encourages behavioral awareness and provides information from a multitude of sources so that a practical, rather than radical, view may develop. Information surrounding issues about the environment appear in many diverse publications. The sources of information, {{as well as the}} information itself, are very broad. This thesis project, Design, Graphic Arts, and the Environ ment, brings a great number of these sources together. The proposed publication discusses many different topics. More detailed information, if desired by the reader, may be found by consulting the extensive list of references supplied. This project focuses on environmental issues from the standpoint of a designer, graphic artist, or printer. These people, while often restricted by a client, make many decisions affecting the environment. They must realize their pivotal position between industry and customers, and between technical and marketing people. They must use their knowledge and position of influence for the benefit of all, including the environment. This project covers six main topics. Part One addresses paper, focusing on recycled papers and environmental labeling organizations. Part Two, Bleaching, looks at the needs, methods and effects of this paper unit operation. Part Three discusses printing inks and the concern of pigments and oils used in their com position. Part Four then investigates de-inking methods and the problems associated with them. Packaging, Part Five, describes the function of this indus try and analyzes some packaging materials being used. Lastly, Standards 2 ̆ 6 Regulations, Part Six, looks at the government 2 ̆ 7 s role in environmental issues. An appendix follows with organizations to contact for further information. An addi tional appendix includes two sample issues of the proposed publication. The thesis project presents information about varied, yet related topics, in the hopes of generating environmental interest in readers. People are <b>encour</b> aged to read further about a specific subject; this thesis is not meant to provide solutions, but rather information. The condition of the environment is an enormous and critical topic that has the potential to affect everyone. When people sense that their behavior can have an impact, albeit small, on a large problem, they can and often do change their behavior. Ideally, everyone should consider their environment in their daily decision mak ing. For persons working in the design, graphic arts and printing industries, this thesis project provides the type of information, or access to it, needed to make those decisions...|$|R

It aimed at pa ving the way for possible future investment, and at strengthening technical cooperation betwe en the seven countries involvedThe project reviewed fisheries products currently offered on the int ernational retail and institutional markets, particularly those usually processed in develo ped countries using raw materials from developing countries. A series of fish species and pro ducts of common interest to a number of the participating countries were selected, and ar rangements made for pilot production by three private companies in Thailand, Indonesia and India. The project supplied the assistance of processing experts for this phaseAt the same time, market studies of the Netherlands, representing th e European market, Japan, and the United States of America were undertaken. Quality requir ements and consumer preferences were investigated; it became particularly clear that packa ging was of vital importance in marketability, and a comprehensive report on the packaging o f the selected products was therefore prepared and distributed by INFOFISH to all participating countriesMarket response and consumer acceptance were tested by participation in an important food trade fair in Cologne, Federal Republic of Germany, in October 19 87. A stand was made available by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GTZ), and the display of the products drew considerable attention. Seventy companies made direct inquiries concerning specific products; there were 150 requests for general inf ormation on the project, and on the availability of value-added products from Asia and the P acific. The three participating companies could have concluded substantial bulk sales if the y had had products available in volumeThe project was extended by a month so that a seminar on the product ion and export of value-added fisheries products might be held in Bangkok between 20 and 22 January 1988. About 70 persons from the participating countries attended, and a panel o f experts provided information on product development, quality control, packaging, process ing and marketing.
