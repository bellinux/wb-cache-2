40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} era zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} attracted the researchers {{due to their}} unique properties and applications in optoelectronic devices. Zinc oxide nanoparticles are the semiconductor materials having band gap energy 3. 37 eV and very large excitation binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature. Also it is non-toxic, environmental friendly and transparent to visible range of spectrum. In the present investigation Zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by sol gel method using zinc acetate and sodium hydroxide as precursors and <b>de</b> <b>ionized</b> (DI) water as solvent. The structure and morphology of prepared zinc oxide nanoparticles was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). UV visible spectrum shows the transparency of nanoparticles over entire visible range. The FTIR analysis confirms the formation of zinc oxide nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} the design, construction and initial {{operation of the}} NSTX bakeout, water cooling and vacuum systems. The bakeout system is designed for two modes of operation. The first mode allows heating of the first wall components to 350 degrees C while the external vessel is cooled to 150 degrees C. The second mode cools the first wall to 150 degrees C and the external vessel to 50 degrees C. The system uses a low viscosity heat transfer oil which is capable of high temperature low pressure operation. The NSTX Torus Vacuum Pumping System (TVPS) is designed to achieve a base pressure of approximately 1 x 10 (superscript - 8) Torr and to evacuate the plasma fuel gas loads in less than 5 minutes between discharges. The vacuum pumping system is capable of a pumping speed of approximately 3400 l/s for deuterium. The hardware consists of two turbo molecular pumps (TMPs) and a mechanical pump set consisting of a mechanical and a Roots blower pump. A PLC is used as the control system to provide remote monitoring, control and software interlock capability. The NSTX cooling water provides chilled, <b>de</b> <b>ionized</b> water for heat removal in the TF, OH and PF, power supplies, bus bar systems, and various diagnostics. The system provides flow monitoring via a PLC to prevent damage due to loss of flow...|$|E
