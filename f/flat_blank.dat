5000|$|Modern cans are {{generally}} produced through a mechanical cold forming process {{that starts with}} punching a <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> from very stiff cold-rolled sheet. This sheet is typically alloy 3104-H19 or 3004-H19, which is aluminum with about 1% manganese and 1% magnesium to give it strength and formability. The <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> is first formed into a cup about three inches in diameter. This cup is then pushed through a different forming process called [...] "ironing" [...] which forms the can. The bottom of the can is also shaped at this time. The malleable metal deforms {{into the shape of}} an open-top can. With the sophisticated technology of the dies and the forming machines, the side of the can is significantly thinner than either the top and bottom areas, where stiffness is required.|$|E
50|$|Inverse One-step methods {{compute the}} {{deformation}} {{potential of a}} finished part geometry to the flattened blank. Mesh initially with the shape and material characteristics of the finished geometry is deformed to the flat pattern blank. The strain computed in this inverse forming operation is then inverted to predict the deformation potential of the <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> being deformed into the final part shape. All the deformation is assumed to happen in one increment or step and is the inverse of the process which the simulation is meant to represent, thus the name Inverse One-Step.|$|E

As the main production facility, Grand Rapids runs over 70 presses ranging from 40 tons to 1500 tons with customized steel feed systems that accommodate rolled coils or <b>flat</b> <b>blanks.</b> The 74,000 sq ft manufacturing plant in Franklin, Indiana specializes in lighter gauge stamping up to 400 tons, plus MIG and resistance welding, tube cut-off, sizing, and forming.|$|R
5000|$|Incremental Analysis methods {{start with}} the mesh of the <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> and {{simulate}} the deformation of the blank inside of tools modeled to represent a proposed manufacturing process. This incremental forming is computed [...] "forward" [...] from initial shape to final, and is calculated {{over a number of}} time increments for start to finish. The time increments can be either explicitly or implicitly defined depending on the finite element software being applied. As the incremental methods include the model of the tooling and allow for the definition of boundary conditions which more fully replicate the manufacturing proposal, incremental methods are more commonly used for process validation. Inverse One-step with its lack of tooling and therefore poor representation of process is limited to geometry based feasibility checks.|$|E
50|$|After cooling several months, the {{finished}} mirror blank was transported by rail to Pasadena, California. Once in Pasadena the mirror was {{transferred from the}} rail flat car to a specially designed semi-trailer for road transport to {{where it would be}} polished. In the optical shop in Pasadena (now the Synchrotron building at Caltech) standard telescope mirror making techniques were used to turn the <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> into a precise concave parabolic shape, although they had to be executed on a grand scale. A special 240-inch 25,000 lb mirror cell jig was constructed which could employ five different motions when the mirror was ground and polished. Over 13 years almost 10,000 pounds of glass was ground and polished away reducing the weight of the mirror to 14.5 tons. The mirror was coated (and still is re-coated every 18-24 months) with a reflective aluminum surface using the same aluminum vacuum-deposition process invented in 1930 by Caltech physicist and astronomer John Strong.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, it mainly {{focuses on}} the blank design for the {{precision}} stretch forming process of aircraft skin. According to the industry survey and literature review, in the current aerospace industry, the most popular manufacture method for aircraft skin is that the gripper jaws of stretch forming machine hold two ends of the <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> sheet, stretch and wrap it onto the die to form the desired shape. In this process, the <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> to be deformed is usually an intact blank sheet with identical thickness. After the deformation, milling process is performed on the curved panel. However, {{the quality of the}} curved sheet metal is relatively difficult to be guaranteed since the process of stretch forming would introduce the machining accuracy problem in the milling process. To improve the quality of the formed part, a new approach is proposed in this thesis for the aircraft skin manufacture. By employing the designed <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> with pockets pre-machined, the stretch forming process is conducted to form the designed aircraft skin. Comparing with the traditional method that the pockets are machined after the blank deformed, this approach relatively increased the accuracy of pockets positions and shapes and it eliminated the machining difficulty on the curved surface. To study the feasibility and reliability of this method, the commercial tools of CAD software CATIA and FEA simulation software were utilized for research, in which the CAD data of the FEA simulation output was analysed by the CAD software and then input the modified data to FEA again. To precisely determine whether the shape and position of the pocket features have met the requirement, the major clue is to evaluate the deformed features in X, Y and Z three directions respectively. Once the formed part is coincidence with the correspondence designed features in these three directions, it means that the designed <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> could be adopted for stretch forming. To consider the deviation in Z direction, it could be converted to the problem of springback value minimization in Z direction. Due to the large number of factors that influence the springback, optimization method is employed to integrate those possible factors and find the optimal solution. For the deviation in X and Y directions, they are studied through the projection of the profiles on the XY plane. By using shape sensitivity method that judging the influence of two designed blanks offset on the formed pockets profiles, the previous designed <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> is updated. Comparing the results of different methods, the shape sensitivity method showed a result of efficiently decreasing in the iteration numbers of <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> design modification and reduction in the shapes deviation between the formed pocket profiles and the target pocket profiles...|$|E

In this paper, a computationally efficient direct design method, which effectively improves the design procedure, was introduced. The direct design method based on ideal forming theory, which was successfully {{applied for the}} design of <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> for stamping processes, was extended {{for the design of}} non-flat preform for tube hydroforming processes. A preform optimization methodology for non-flat blank solutions was proposed based on the penalty constraint method for the cross-sectional shape and length of a tube. The hybrid membrane/shell method was employed to capture thickness effect while maintaining membrane formulation in the ideal forming theory. Several classes of examples were analyzed to verify the current formulation...|$|R

The process analysis is based on finite element method under ANSYS/LS-DYNA platform to get better understanding of the process. The whole process consists of the pressing forming of a blade from a <b>flat</b> <b>blank,</b> the springback after the forming and the cooling of the blade from hot temperature to room temperature.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a new {{modified}} processing route {{has been proposed}} for producing long cylindrical cups from 12 mm thick circular blanks of AISI 1020 steel (Aluminium (Al) -killed). In this route, <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> were made to preformed shape by stamping operation, followed by multistage deep drawing processes(without blank-holder and with inter-stage stress relief annealing) to increase cup depth. Wall ironing was also purposefully included in each draw step to reduce wall thickness and earing tendency on cup edges. Thus, evolution of wall thickness distribution, Drawability and Ironability, punch force history, and strain distribution profiles on outer cup surfaces were obtained as the effects of interaction between processes, tools and material. The overall draw stages showed: LDR 2. 06; overall draw reduction > 50 % with a drawing efficiency ~ 72 %; LIR 3. 55; overall ironing reduction > 70 % with an ironing efficiency ~ 68 %, which were achieved in the experimental works...|$|R
40|$|Stamp forming is a rapid {{manufacturing}} technology used to shape <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> of thermoplastic composite material into three-dimensional components. Currently, expensive autoclave and press consolidation {{are used to}} preconsolidate blanks. This study investigates the influence of preconsolidation on final consolidation quality after stamp forming and explores the potential of alternative blank manufacturing methods that could reduce part costs. Blanks were manufactured using various blank manufacturing methods and subsequently were stamp formed. The consolidation quality {{both before and after}} stamp forming was compared, where the focus was on void content as the main measure for consolidation quality. The void content was characterized through thickness and density measurements, as well as by microscopy analysis. Results indicate that preconsolidation quality does have an influence on the final consolidation quality. This is due to the severe deconsolidation and limited reconsolidation during stamp forming. Nevertheless, the potential of automated fiber placement and ultrasonic spot welding as alternative blank manufacturing methods was demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Most {{packaging}} for {{the transport}} of pizzas is made of cardboard, because this material is cheap and has many useful properties. Both solid fibre board and single wall corrugated board are used. The corrugated cardboard in use is often of the E flute size (micro or fine waves with a flute pitch of 1.0 to 1.8 mm), but thicker B flute cardboard with a flute pitch of 2.2 to 3.0 mm are also used. Not only the geometric construction of the cardboard determines {{the stability of the}} box, but also especially the type of paper and its grammage.

This does not only make the box stable, it becomes more resistant against humidity and oil as well.To reduce the space needed to store the packaging to a minimum, the pizza boxes are folded just before use out of <b>flat</b> <b>blanks.</b> The required storage space depends very much on the different thickness of the material.|$|R
40|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a cold forming process in which a tool forces a sheet metal <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> into a die cavity. By definition, {{the depth of the}} drawn part is greater than the tool diameter. This {{technology}} has been extensively used {{in a wide range of}} production processes, such as, for only representative examples, those dedicated to the production of automotive fuel tanks and other parts or steel kitchen sinks. The image analysis may represent a suitable approach for the mathematical implementation of images. Such a treatment is based on the manipulation of the Gray Level image, which is firstly converted into another simplified image with a lower number of grey levels. Then, the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is created and finally analyzed. In the GLCM all the elements represent a correlation index among the image pixels. Given an image, the textures analysis relies on the possibility of quantifying image characteristics. Among them we have considered, as possible indicator candidates, first order parameters, such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, and second order ones, such as dissimilarity, contrast, homogeneity, angular second moment, energy, entropy, correlation...|$|E
40|$|In hot stamping, the {{determination}} of the thermal contact conductance values between the blank and tool surface during the process is crucial for the purpose of simulating the blank rapid cooling inside the tool using finite element analysis (FEA). The thermal contact conductance value represents the coefficient of the heat transfer at the surface of two solid bodies in contact and is known to be influenced greatly by the applied pressure. In order to estimate the value and its dependency on applied pressure, the process of hot stamping was replicated and simplified into a process of compression of heated <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> in between the tool at different applied pressure. The temperature of the blank and tool surface were measured by means of thermocouples installed inside the tool. Based on the measured temperature, the thermal contact conductance between the surfaces was calculated using Newton’s cooling law equation. The calculated value was then used to simulate the blank cooling inside the tool using FEA commercial software. This paper describes an experimental approach to estimate the thermal contact conductance between a blank made of Boron Steel (USIBOR 1500) and tool made of Tool Steel (STAVAX). Its dependency on applied pressure is also studied and the experimental results were then compared with FEA simulations...|$|E

40|$|Achievement {{of complex}} shapes with high {{dimensional}} {{accuracy and precision}} by forming process is a demanding challenge for scientists and practitioners. Available technologies are numerous, with laser forming being progressively emerging because of limited springback, lack of molds and sophisticated auxiliary equipments. However, laser forming finds limited applications, especially when forming of tridimensional (3 d) complex shapes is required. In this case, cost savings are often counterbalanced by the need for troublesome forming strategies. Therefore, traditional alternatives based on mechanical devices are usually preferred to laser systems. In the present work, 3 d laser forming of stainless steel sheets by high power diode laser is investigated. In particular, the set of scanning patterns to form domes from <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> by simple and easy-to-manage radial paths alone was found. Numerous 3 d items were also processed by diode laser to manufacture a number of complex shapes with high flexibility and limited efforts to modify the auxiliary forming equipment.

40|$|Stamp forming is a rapid {{manufacturing}} technology used to shape <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> of thermoplastic composite material into three-dimensional components. The development of automated lay-up technologies further extends {{the applicability of}} stamp forming by allowing rapid lay-up of tailored blanks and partial preconsolidation. This partial preconsolidation makes the influence of prepreg more critical compared to conventional preconsolidation methods which provide full preconsolidation. This paper aims to highlight consolidation challenges that can appear when stamp forming blanks manufactured by automated lay-up. Important prepreg characteristics were identified based on an experimental study where a comparison was made between various prepreg in their as-received, deconsolidated and stamp consolidated state. It was found that adding up small thickness variations across {{the width of a}} prepreg when stacking plies into a blank by automated lay-up can cause non-uniform consolidation. Additionally, deconsolidation of the prepreg does not seem to obstruct interlaminar bonding, while intralaminar voids initially present in a prepreg cannot be removed during stamp forming. An additional preconsolidation step after automated lay-up seems necessary to remove blank thickness variations and intralaminar voids for the current prepregs. Eliminating this process step and the successful combination of rapid automated lay-up and stamp forming requires prepregs which are void-free and have less thickness variation...|$|R
40|$|Most {{sheet metal}} {{components}} {{are made by}} deep drawing, which requires expensive tooling. Although many new flexible forming processes have been invented, they have largely not had industrial application, {{so it would be}} valuable if intelligent means to design new processes existed. This has not previously been attempted, although there has been work to classify both products and processes and to define optimal forming processes. A body of work in garment production examines the optimal flattening of garments, starting from their final form on a human body, to deduce the best cutting pattern from flat fabric. This paper develops a related approach for the first time, “un-forming” sheet metal from its finished geometry to a <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> without prior specification of a process. An algorithm is developed that allows specification of process constraints and great freedom in implementing un-forming strategies, leading to a prediction of the strain history of the un-forming process. Reversing the direction of this history, allows prediction of the stresses in the workpiece required to form the target part, by use of an appropriate material model. The external forces (boundary conditions) required to maintain equilibrium with this stress state can then be calculated, allowing an iterative refinement of the constraints on un-forming until a physically achievable process has been designed. The approach is validated against a known process, and used to demonstrate how several previously untried forming strategies could lead to specification of new process designs. In future work, the method could be extended to allow an iterative specification of tooling to create the required boundary conditions, and hence to complete automatic process designs...|$|E
40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{system has been}} designed to survive spaceflight and to function autonomously on the Martian surface. It manipulates microscopic quantities of liquid water and performs chemical analyses on these samples to assay for the presence of molecules associated with past or present living processes. This technology lies {{at the core of the}} Urey Instrument, which is scheduled for inclusion on the Pasteur Payload of the ESA ExoMars rover mission in 2013. Fabrication processes have been developed to make the microfabricated Teflon-AF microfluidic diaphragm pumps capable of surviving extreme temperature excursions before and after exposure to liquid water. Two glass wafers are etched with features and a continuous Teflon membrane is sandwiched between them (see figure). Single valves are constructed using this geometry. The microfabricated devices are then post processed by heating the assembled device while applying pneumatic pressure to force the Teflon diaphragm against the valve seat while it is softened. After cooling the device, the embossed membrane retains this new shape. This solves previous problems with bubble introduction into the fluid flow where deformations of the membrane at the valve seat occurred during device bonding at elevated temperatures (100 - 150 C). The use of laminated membranes containing commercial Teflon AF 2400 sheet sandwiched between spun Teflon AF 1600 layers performed best, and were less gas permeable than Teflon AF 1600 membranes on their own. Spinning Teflon AF 1600 solution (6 percent in FLOURINERT(Registered TradeMark) FC 40 solvent, 3 M Company) at 500 rpm for 1. 5 seconds, followed by 1, 000 rpm for 3 seconds onto Borofloat glass wafers, results in a 10 -micron-thick film of extremely smooth Teflon AF. This spinning process is repeated several times on <b>flat,</b> <b>blank,</b> glass wafers in order to gradually build a thick, smooth membrane. After running this process at least five times, the wafer and Teflon coating are heated under vacuum at 220 C for one hour in order to drive off any residual solvent present in the composite film. After this, a second blank, glass wafer is brought down from above and the stack is held under vacuum at 3 atm mechanical pressure for ten 10 hours...|$|E
40|$|The {{escalating}} {{issues on}} sustainable environment {{such as the}} necessity to reduce CO 2 emission and fuel consumption including new regulations to improve the safety of passengers car had brought up the application of new innovative materials and manufacturing process in the automotive industry called hot press forming operation. By using this new technique, the manufacturers can produce more lightweight and high strength car parts such as the B-pillars with tensile strength ranging from 1200 MPa to 1600 MPa. Hot press forming is done by rapidly heating up Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) made of boron steel material in a furnace to austenization temperature of about 950 °C for 5 minutes, then transferred it quickly to the hot press die where rapid quenching occurred during the die closed {{with the aid of}} cooling channel. This experiment investigates the effects of varying combination of hot press forming parameters to final tensile strength of boron steel and had been carried out without use of cooling channel. The studied parameters are the air cooling time, cooling rate, cooling time in die and stamping pressure. The type of boron steel material with trade name of Usibor® 1500 was used as the test specimens while for punch and die material, High Thermal Conductivity Tool Steel (HTCS- 150) made by Rovalma was used. Both are common materials used in the automotive industry for hot press forming operation. A preliminary experiment had been conducted where ten flat tensile strength specimens of Usibor 1500 were heated to the austenization temperature of 950 °C and immediately quenched in a tank of water to confirm the material ability to achieve the minimum tensile strength of 1500 Mpa. All specimens achieved average tensile strength of 1550 Mpa in this most ideal cooling rate condition. In the experimental hot press forming operation, result shows that the <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> specimens of Usibor 1500 able to obtain ultimate tensile strength of 1400 Mpa after quenching in die without use of cooling channels when suitable process parameters were used during. Overall,faster air cooling time, higher stamping pressure applied to the blank, and longer cooling time in die improve the cooling rate.

40|$|The {{deep drawing}} process is {{commonly}} used to manufacture sheet metal products. During the process initially curved or <b>flat</b> <b>blank</b> material is clamped between the die and the blankholder. When the punch is pushed into the die cavity, the blank is plastically deformed and the specific shape of the punch and the die is transferred to it. After the tools are removed, the elastically-driven change of the product shape, or so-called springback, occurs. This phenomenon results into the deviation of the obtained product shape from the design specification and can be the major cause of assembly problems. In sheet metal forming {{the quality of the}} final product depends on the proper tools’ design, choice of the blank material, blankholder force, lubrication and some other process parameters. To manufacture a product with the desired shape and performance an extensive knowledge about the influence of various parameters is needed. In order to establish this knowledge base, experimental try-outs or numerical simulations are used. Finite element simulation of sheet metal forming is a powerful tool, which allows to test any modifications of the {{deep drawing process}} parameters, prior to the actual tools manufacturing. calculations can be made to predict and compensate for springback and the numerical simulations can be repeated as often as necessary until the product with the desired shape is produced. Currently the numerical analysis is not able to accurately predict the springback of a formed product. There is always a discrepancy between the level of springback obtained in simulations and reality, especially for the products with complicated geometry. The objective of this literature study is to understand the springback phenomenon and to ascertain the reasons of its inaccurate numerical prediction. Development of algorithms for improved numerical prediction of springback after trimming operation is a subject of a separate research [1] and is not dealt with in this study. One of the reasons for poor springback prediction is that this phenomenon is not accurately represented in finite element formulations. Various assumptions of material behaviour - constant elastic properties during forming, simplified elastic-plastic anisotropy and workhardening - introduce the large modelling error. In addition, the accuracy of the springback prediction is affected significantly by the quality of simulation of the forming operation. Chosen contact algorithms, the method of unloading, the time integration scheme, the element types and the level of discretization can be other reasons for significant deviation of the numerically predicted springback from that observed in real practice. Furthermore, an analyst plays an important role and substantial discrepancy of the springback results may be caused by unexperienced users...|$|E
40|$|Shaping of 3 D items by {{external}} force-assisted LaserOrigami (LO) bending of flat metal sheets is hereby studied. In particular, shaping of 3 D stainless steel cubes starting from <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> is tested. In addition, edge design {{of stainless steel}} chairs by hybrid bending is experimented, too. First, Origami's design of the laser scanning patterns on the starting material was developed. On this basis, the auxiliary device to impress the external force during LO bending was implemented. Then, shaping trials of the blanks were performed by varying the process parameters, that is, laser power, number of passes and external force, in wide operational ranges. Last, the resulting bending angles were collected and analyzed by Analysis of Mean (ANOM), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Interaction Plots (IP). 3 D maps of the bending angles according to the operational parameters were also plotted (Response Surface Methodology, RSM). Bending angles were found to approach the target of 90 ° by {{increasing the number of}} passes and the external force. An increase in laser power caused an additional shift of the RS towards higher bending angles. Indeed, too much high laser power should be carefully avoided to prevent overheating and excessive thermal alteration of the metal, which would compromise the visual appearance of the resulting workpiece. Based on the experimental findings, external force-assisted LaserOrigami (LO) bending of stainless steel cubes and edge design chairs was successfully experimented, with the manufactured items showing good precision, accuracy and valuable appearance. © 2015 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

40|$|Flat and {{piercing}} tips made {{of polished}} rock and bone {{are typical of}} the Late Neolithic in the Western Alps. Most of them, realised in tenaceous rocks (serpentinite and amphibolite), come from the internal valleys of the Alps in Switzerland (Valais), Italy (Val D’Aosta, Western Piedmont) and France (Savoy). Production sites have been identified at Bessans (Savoie) and Roreto (Piedmont), whereas unfinished tips are known on several sites of the Western Alps. Contextual examination allows it to be demonstrated that production occurred on the outcrops, or in their immediate neighbourhood. According to the archaeological facts, the operative process is simple: <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> (thin plates) were shaped out by retouching, then polished. The obtaining of the blanks and the manufacturing process are difficult to understand on the archaeological artefacts, so an experimental approach was necessary; this was done in 2003. The results allow us to argue that only one «chaîne opératoire» was used. In summary: the blanks are obtained from small massive blocks; these blocks offer a small but discernible schistosity; the use of heat is not required; obtaining blanks is the decisive step of the «chaîne opératoire»: their regular thinness conditions the regularity of the tip and the working time required for shaping; shaping is quite quick (half an hour to one hour), executed by retouching with a stone hammer, followed by more or less covering polishing. All the shapes and the dimensions known in archaeological contexts can be reproduced with no real variation in the difficulties. The levels of know-how appear in the symmetry of the tip and the straightness of the lateral edges. Manufacturing of the tips in polished rock does not require highly developed know-how {{for people who are}} familiar with working tenaceous rocks for axeheads. However, obtaining the best results calls obligatorily for the use of rocks from autochthonous or sub-autochthonous outcrops. Thirault Eric. Les pointes polies alpines des IVe et IIIe millénaires av.

Yet the producers opted for the added expense of filming in color at a time when black-and-white was still being used for many major-studio productions and was readily accepted by audiences, and they obtained the services of two top-tier behind-the-camera talents, albeit in the twilights of their careers.|$|R
40|$|Results of a {{study of}} the {{production}} of hollow-ware by deep-drawing and bulge forming are presented. Axisyrnrnetrical and asymmetrical shapes were successfully produced from soft aluminium <b>flat</b> <b>blanks</b> in one stroke of a punch. The process consists of drawing, ironing and bulging inside a closed die cavity. The constituent operations are studied individually. In deep drawing without a blank-holder, an approach to convex type die design is presented. The investigation evaluates the effect of die profile geometry on the drawing performance. Three dies of the second degree spiral type,one near to the tractrix shape and the other two with larger radius of curvature, are considered. The materials tested include mild steel, stainless steel, soft aluminium and brass. The drawing process through tractrix, exponential spiral, second degree spiral and conical type dies is analysed using a numerical solution formulated earlier and the theoretical results on the punch load and the strain development are compared with the experimental results. Good correlation is obtained on the development of strains. The theoretical prediction of the punch load is reasonably good except for mild steel which is highly anisotropic. It is shown that by modifying the die profile, the 'punch load can be significantly reduced. The reductions predicted by theory are in good agreement with experiment which means that optimum die design for minimum load is possible. In ironing of cups, using soft aluminium blanks, it was found that punch speeds in the range 7 - 45 rom/sec have negligible effect on the drawing load. The ironing load decreases slightly as the speed increases in this range. The reduction is more significant with higher degrees of ironing. Measurement of ironed cup wall thickness showed that thickness variations are attributed to planar anisotropy of the blank and geometrical errors in tooling. Free bulge forming is used as a simplified approach to closed die forming. The bulge profile modes under different loading conditions of internal pressure and axial force, the effect of the unsupported cup length and the effect of the cup wall thickness on the bulge ratio were investigated using a specially designed test rig. For bulging of as deep-drawn cups, the bulge ratio increases with increase of cup wall thickness, and it decreases with increase of length. For bulging of annealed cups the length effect is negligible and the bulge ratio increases slightly with increase of cup wall thickness. The procedure used in producing different hollow-ware. shapes is described together with typical failure examples. The thickness reduction and bulge ratio distributions are shown and comparison is made between annealed and as deep-drawn cups...|$|R
