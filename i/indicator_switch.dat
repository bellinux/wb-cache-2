2500|$|Although the Chevette was {{essentially}} a rebranded Opel Kadett C with revised front-end (detailed below), it used the 1,256cc overhead valve (OHV) engine from the Viva HC instead of the Kadett's 1,196 cc engines, which were produced by Opel. The Kadett's double wishbone front suspension, rear-wheel drive and rear suspension with Panhard rod, torque tube and coil sprung live axle were carried over unaltered. Inside, the two cars differed {{only in terms of}} their dashboard and switchgear: the Chevette stuck to the British and Japanese right-hand drive tradition of having the <b>indicator</b> <b>switch</b> on the right-hand side of the steering column, while the Kadett had the mainland European left-hand drive custom of the flasher stalk being on the left. [...] The Chevette also had a much more angular instrument binnacle, although the instruments themselves were from the Kadett (though with imperial rather than metric scales).|$|E

50|$|The {{rear light}} units each had an all-red cover and {{contained}} only two bulbs. One of the bulbs operated as a conventional brake light. The other rear light bulb contained two filaments, {{one of which}} came one with the light switch and the second of which flashed when the turn <b>indicator</b> <b>switch</b> was used, so following traffic saw just a single light becoming successively and rhythmically brighter and less bright when the car was about to turn. The effect will have been unremarkable to North American drivers, but triggered comment in Europe. Here, even where single piece rear light units are fitted, rear indicator lights were and are normally included in their own separate {{part of the overall}} light cluster units.|$|E
5000|$|The Series IIA Lightweight was {{replaced}} by the Series III Lightweight in 1972, soon after the replacement of the civilian Series IIA with the Series III. The vehicle remained in essence the same, with a few relatively minor changes - there are detail differences to the chassis; and a revised gearbox had syncromesh on second through fourth gears instead of just third and fourth. In the electrical department the Series III was fitted with an alternator in place of the dynamo of the Series IIa; the new <b>indicator</b> <b>switch</b> incorporates a headlamp flasher and horn; and the ignition switch was now fitted in a new steering column cowl instead of on the dashboard. The Lightweight did retain the earlier Series IIa metal dashboard even after the upgrade. Around 1980, in line with civilian models, the engine had five main bearings instead of three.|$|E

5000|$|Compared to the BMW R1100S {{which it}} succeeded, the R1200S was 13 kg lighter, and (with a {{compression}} ratio raised from 11.3:1 to 12.5:1) it was 25% more powerful with a [...] "hexhead" [...] motor rated at [...] Much {{of the weight}} saving was down to a new trellis-type frame which replaced the massive alloy frame of the R1100S. The R1200S thus had superior handling, improved braking, higher power output, greater ground clearance, and sport ergonomics. Although the instrumentation was updated, the bike retained the unconventional BMW-system <b>indicator</b> <b>switches</b> (one on either side). Factory options included front and rear Ohlins shock absorbers, expandable locking luggage, heated grips, a solo tail piece, and a wider 6" [...] rear wheel to accommodate a size 190 tire.|$|R
5000|$|In theory, {{the motor}} failure {{on the plane}} could not present a problem because the locking lever {{would not be able}} to close. However, during the {{investigation}} a McDonnell Douglas test rig demonstrated that the entire locking pin operating system was too weak, allowing the handle to be forced closed even with the pins out of the locking holes. This occurred on Flight 96, when the handler forced the handle closed with his knee. In spite of the vent not closing completely, neither the handler nor the engineer considered this to be serious. Although the vent door remained partially open, it closed enough to cause it to [...] "blow shut", and thereby allow pressurization of the cargo hold. Although the handle did not seat the pins entirely, the small amount of motion it managed to cause was enough to press on the warning <b>indicator</b> <b>switch,</b> deactivating the cockpit warning light. It was only the combination of all of these failures that allowed the accident to happen. Yet all of these indicators had a single common point of failure: the mechanical weakness of the locking system that allowed the handle to be moved.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1968, the '69 Torana' was released, {{sometimes}} called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan which was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new <b>indicator</b> <b>switch,</b> and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was {{the loss of the}} stalk-operated headlight dip switch and horn. The dip switch ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard [...] engine. The Brabham Torana was still available, in two-door form only. It now included a sports steering wheel similar to the contemporary Holden Monaro GTS, full instrumentation, different badging, and different black accenting. The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.|$|E
5000|$|Progressive {{improvement}} was {{a feature of}} most cars in this period, but the number {{and nature of the}} changes affecting {{the early years of the}} Austin 1800 looked to some as though the car had been introduced without sufficient development work. A month after its launch, in December 1964, reclining front seats and the option of an arm rest in the middle of the back seat were added to the specification schedule. [...] A month later, in January 1965, the final drive ratio reverted to the 3.88:1 value used in the prototype, from the 4.2:1 ratio applied at launch: this was described as a response to [...] "oil-consumption problems": January 1965 also saw the <b>indicator</b> <b>switch</b> modified. [...] At the same time, higher gearing and reduced valve clearances cut the published power output by 2 bhp but cured the [...] "valve-crash" [...] reported by some buyers when approaching top speed on one of Britain's recently constructed motorways. [...] The manufacturer quietly replaced the [...] "flexible, flat-section dipstick" [...] which, it was said, had caused inattentive owners to overfill the sump after inserting the dipstick back to front so that the word [...] "Oil" [...] could not be seen on it. [...] Subsequent modifications included changing, repositioning and re-angling, the handbrake in October 1965, [...] removing the rear anti-roll bar and rearranging the rear suspension at the end of 1965, at the same time adjusting the steering to address a problem of tyre scuffing, [...] and fitting stronger engine side covers in January 1966 along with modified engine-mounting rubbers which now were [...] "resistant to de-bonding". [...] February 1965 saw water shields fitted to the rear hubs [...] and the car's steering rattle cured by the judicious fitting of a spacer, [...] while the propensity of early cars to jump out of first and second gears was addressed by the fitting of a [...] "synchroniser". [...] Further improvements followed the launch of the Morris 1800 early in 1966. Gear cables were revamped to deal with [...] "difficult engagement" [...] of first and third gears in cold weather, [...] and the seat mountings were adapted to increase rake in May 1966.|$|E

40|$|A {{growing body}} of evidences shows that {{bacterial}} biofilm lifestyle is comparatively more common than the planktonic one and that biofilm {{plays a crucial role}} in human health. The enumeration of the actual number of bacteria in biofilm is still a great challenge for microbiologist. The standardized method of colony forming unit (CFU) count is not reliable to quantify bacteria in biofilm. In the absence of a validated method to count bacteria in biofilm, BioTimer Assay (BTA) is presented here. BTA allows to count bacterial biofilm adherent on surfaces and employs an appropriate reagent containing an indicator able to switch as a consequence of bacterial metabolism in biofilm. The time required for <b>indicator</b> <b>switch,</b> induced by microbial metabolism, is correlated to the initial number of bacteria (N 0) through a genus-specific correlation line described by the following equation t = log(1 +a=N 0) =k where k is growth rate and a {{is a function of the}} metabolic product responsible for the reagent switching. Moreover, BTA does not require any manipulation of samples and has been applied to count bacteria in biofilm adherent to several polymers, to verify microbiological quality of foods and to detect the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm. BTA, providing a reliable, sensitive, rapid and easy-to perform method, could be considered a useful tool in counting bacteria in biofilm also adherent on nano-structured particles to be in vivo administere...|$|E

50|$|When {{selecting}} a magnetic level gauge {{it is important}} {{to take into account the}} strength of the magnetic field. The magnetic field is the heart of the magnetic level gauge - the stronger the field, the more reliable the instrument will function. Some manufacturers rely on a single magnet for their magnetic level gauges which causes the strength of the north field to be identical to, and as weak as, the south field. It is apparent that at the location of the <b>indicators,</b> <b>switches</b> and transmitters, the field would not be as intense. Some manufacturers use a single annular ring magnet, others use a series of single bar magnets in a circular array in their float design. In this design the relative field strength of the north and south poles will be equal to one another and less than that of a dual magnet design. Moreover, the field strength as you travel around the circumference will have high and low spots as you pass between the individual bar magnets.|$|R
