40|$|We report {{densities of}} spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf (Canis anthus) in Enderta {{district}} in northern Ethiopia with high human and low natural prey densities. We estimated spotted hyaena and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf abundance and characterized their spatial distribution with three methods: we surveyed four road-transects for 66 nights during dry (n= 41) and wet (n= 25) seasons, we used 34 calling stations and we mapped all active spotted hyaena dens {{at the time}} of the survey. The density of spotted hyaena and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf increased with proximity to towns where human density was higher. A total of 562 spotted hyaena and 63 <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf responded to calling stations, leading to estimates of 1, 145 spotted hyaena and 166 <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf in Enderta district. This method also found a significantly higher spotted hyaena and <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf abundance in high human density areas. Maximum response radius was 2. 8 km for spotted hyaena and 2. 5 km for <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf, and response probability was 0. 83 for spotted hyaena and 0. 8 for <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf, respectively. We found 40 active spotted hyaena dens with 1, 507 remnants of prey, and the majority of the dens were located close to rivers and villages. Our findings show a positive relationship between spotted hyaena, <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf and human concentrations that might demonstrate a case of exceptional coexistence of humans and carnivores, both at high densities. We suggest further investigations into co-adaptations between humans and predators in the study area...|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} and phylogenetic {{relationships of}} the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat has remained in dispute. It {{has historically been}} placed under Catopuma, Felis or Profelis. However, studies in 2006 and 2009 have showed that the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat has a particularly {{close relationship with the}} caracal (Caracal caracal). These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of Felidae. This lineage evolved nearly 8.5 Mya. More recently, the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat has been considered a species of Caracal. The <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat resembles the Asian golden cat, but are not closely related.|$|R
25|$|In 2017 a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA and other DNA sequences found that the Himalayan wolf formed a basal distinct monophyletic clade relative to the holarctic gray wolf. Its degree of divergence to the holarctic gray wolf {{is similar to the}} degree of divergence of the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf from the holarctic gray wolf. The Himalayan wolf shares an X-chromosome haplotype with the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf. It possesses a unique Y-chromosome haplotype that falls phylogenetically between the holarctic gray wolf and the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf.|$|R

5|$|Fish are {{plentiful}} {{in the waters}} surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or <b>African</b> red <b>snappers</b> (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> red <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus agennes, is {{a species}} of snapper native to the coastal Atlantic waters of Africa from Senegal to Angola. They inhabit coral reefs and areas with rocky {{substrates}} and are also known to enter brackish waters of lagoons and rivers. This species can reach 139 cm in total length, though most only reach 50 cm. The greatest recorded weight for this species is 60 kg. It is of minor importance to local commercial fisheries, but is sought-after as a game fish.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} caracal, <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat and serval are genetically closely related and diverged from a common ancestor about 5.4 million years ago. Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} to subordinate all of them to the genus Caracal. This taxonomic classification is used in the IUCN Red List for the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> cat. It is used as a synonym for the serval.|$|R

5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} golden jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (<b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf), {{reducing the number of}} golden jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the golden jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the golden jackal and the <b>African</b> <b>golden</b> wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|R
