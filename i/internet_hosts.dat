25|$|Kurzweil {{calls this}} {{exponential}} growth {{the law of}} accelerating returns, and he believes it applies to many human-created technologies such as computer memory, transistors, microprocessors, DNA sequencing, magnetic storage, the number of <b>Internet</b> <b>hosts,</b> Internet traffic, decrease in device size, and nanotech citations and patents. Kurzweil cites two historical examples of exponential growth: the Human Genome Project {{and the growth of}} the Internet. Kurzweil claims the whole world economy is in fact growing exponentially, although short term booms and busts tend to hide this trend.|$|E

40|$|The master {{thesis is}} dealing with <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> {{localization}} methods, more exactly with determining geographical position of the unknown <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> connected to the network using RTT delay measuring. The first part {{is dealing with}} description of RTT delays that may occur in the network and tools for their measurement. The next is part of thesis is devoted to description of two kinds of localization methods. Ones that are using existing data to determine the position of <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> also called passive methods, and others that are using RTT delay measurement, also called active methods. The main part is focused on GeoWeight method {{which is based on}} geographical localization estimation of <b>Internet</b> <b>host.</b> It is based on RTT delay measurement using the principles of CBG method, enhanced by introduction of the theory of weights according to the probability of the target <b>Internet</b> <b>host.</b> The last part is describing the application that was made to determine the geographic localization of the target <b>Internet</b> <b>host</b> using GeoWeight method. The application was afterwards tested by measuring RTT delay in PlanetLab experimental network. At the end the final measured results were compared with other localization methods (CBG, Octant, SOI, GeoIP) ...|$|R
