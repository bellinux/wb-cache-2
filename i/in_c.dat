5|$|The pigeye shark can be most {{reliably}} {{distinguished from}} the bull shark {{by the number of}} precaudal (before the caudal fin) vertebrae (89–95 <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> amboinensis versus 101–123 <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> leucas). Externally, it has a greater size difference between its dorsal fins (first-to-second height ratio >3.1:1 versus ≤3.1:1 <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> leucas) and the notch in its anal fin margin forms an acute angle (versus a right angle <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> leucas). This species also usually has fewer tooth rows in the lower jaw (10–12 on each side versus 12–13 <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> leucas).|$|E

Alongside new combinations of Linnaeus' original name in different genera (Ephemera, Chloeon, Cloe and Cloeopsis), true synonyms include three introduced by Otto Friedrich Müller in 1776 (E. annulatum, E. rufulum and E. dimidiatum), one by William Elford Leach <b>in</b> 1815 (<b>C.</b> pallidum), two by John Curtis <b>in</b> 1834 (<b>C.</b> marmoratum and C. obscurum), three by James Francis Stephens <b>in</b> 1835 (<b>C.</b> cognatum, C. consobrinum and C. virgo), and one each by Jules Pierre Rambur <b>in</b> 1842 (<b>C.</b> affinis), Costa <b>in</b> 1882 (<b>C.</b> apicalis), Bengtsson <b>in</b> 1940 (<b>C.</b> inscriptum) and Jacob <b>in</b> 1969 (<b>C.</b> szegedi).|$|R

5|$|Physically, the Australian blacktip shark {{can only}} {{reliably}} {{be distinguished from}} the common blacktip shark {{by the number of}} vertebrae (174–182 total, 84–91 before the tail <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> tilstoni, 182–203 total, 94–102 before the tail <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> limbatus). It has a moderately robust, spindle-shaped body and a long, pointed snout. The anterior rims of the nostrils are slightly enlarged into low triangular flaps. The large, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The furrows at the corners of the mouth are barely evident. There are 32–35 upper and 29–31 lower tooth rows; each upper tooth has a slender, upright cusp and fine serrations that become coarser near the base, while the lower teeth are narrower and more finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E

5|$|Christoph Wolff notes a {{similarity}} between the fugue theme and one by Johann Hugo von Wilderer, whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a {{heavy metal}} toxic to humans and its {{occurrence}} in soils represents a significant environmental problem. Poplar trees may provide one possible option to help remove Cd contamination from soil. However, before this is practicable, the ability of poplar to accumulate Cd needs to be enhanced. A {{better understanding of the}} genes involved <b>in</b> <b>Cd</b> accumulation <b>in</b> poplar would help to achieve this goal. Here, we monitored the expression of genes known to be involved <b>in</b> <b>Cd</b> uptake, accumulation and translocation from other species, in order to provide information on their potential role <b>in</b> <b>Cd</b> accumulation <b>in</b> poplar. <b>Cd</b> concentration <b>in</b> poplar was significantly higher in roots than in stem and leaves <b>in</b> <b>Cd</b> treated plants. Expression of the poplar homologues of IRT 1, NRAMP and OPT 3 was initially increased after exposure to Cd but reduced after longer term Cd exposure. Exposure to Cd also influenced the accumulation of Fe, Ca, Cu, Mg and Mn in poplar. <b>In</b> particular, <b>Cd</b> treated plants had a higher concentration of Fe, Ca, Cu, and Mg in leaves and stem compared to control plants after one day and one week of experiment; while in roots after one month Cd treated plants had a lower concentration of Mn, Fe, Cu, Co, and Mg...|$|R
