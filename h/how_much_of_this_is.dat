5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open question, but it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide {{has been}} found in roasted barley tea, called mugicha in Japanese. The barley is roasted so it is dark brown prior to being steeped in hot water. The {{roasting}} process revealed 200–600 micrograms/kg of acrylamide in mugicha. This is less than the >1000 micrograms/kg found in potato crisps and other fried whole potato snack foods cited in the same study and it is unclear <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> ingested after the drink is prepared. Rice cracker and sweet potato levels were lower than in potatoes. Potatoes cooked whole were found to have significantly lower acrylamide levels than the others, suggesting a link between food preparation method and acrylamide levels.|$|E

2500|$|While Joplin {{never made}} an audio recording, his playing is {{preserved}} on seven piano rolls {{for use in}} mechanical player pianos. All seven were made in 1916. Of these, the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing to correct the performance to strict rhythm and add embellishments, probably by the staff musicians at Connorized. Berlin theorizes {{that by the time}} Joplin reached St. Louis, he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers, tremors, and an inability to speak clearly—all symptoms of the syphilis that took his life in 1917. Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of [...] "Maple Leaf Rag" [...] on the UniRecord label from June 1916 as [...] "...shocking... disorganized and completely distressing to hear." [...] While there is disagreement among piano-roll experts as to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to the relatively primitive recording and production techniques of the time, Berlin notes that the [...] "Maple Leaf Rag" [...] roll was likely to be the truest record of Joplin's playing at the time. The roll, however, may not reflect his abilities earlier in life.|$|E

60|$|Chester.--I {{like this}} place much; but somehow I feel glad when I get among the quiet eighteenth century buildings, in cosy places with some elbow room about them, after the older architecture.

I don't know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> legitimately {{the effect of the}} architecture; little enough {{possibly}}; possibly far the most part of it comes from bad historical novels and the disquieting statuary that garnishes some façades.|$|E

6000|$|Now, [...] "measurably acquainted" [...] {{meant that}} he lived within twenty or thirty miles {{of those who did}} know {{something}} of the concerns of the house in question, and was in the way of catching scraps of the gossip that fell from disappointed creditors. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> there in this good country of ours! Men who live just near enough to one another to feel the influence of all that rivalry, envy, personal strifes and personal malignancies, can generate, fancy they are acquainted, from this circumstance, with those to whom they have never even spoken. One-half the idle tales that circulate up and-down the land, come from authority not one tittle better than this. How much would men learn, could they only acquire the healthful lesson of understanding that nothing, which is much out of the ordinary way, and which, circulates as received truths illustrative of character, is true in all its material parts, and very little in any. But, to return to my passengers, and that portion of their conversation which most affected myself. They continued commenting on persons and families by name, seemingly more to keep their hands in, than for any other discoverable reason, as each appeared to be perfectly conversant with all the gossip that was started; when Sarah casually mentioned the name of Mrs. Bradfort, with some of whose supposed friends, it now came out, they had all a general visiting acquaintance.|$|E
60|$|To take up {{the story}} from {{the point where we}} left it: by the aid of the American's revelations, some light is thrown upon points of family history, which induce the English {{possessor}} of the estate to suppose {{that the time has come}} for asserting his claim to a title which has long been in abeyance. He therefore sets about it, and engages in great expenses, besides contracting the enmity of many persons, with whose interests he interferes. A further complication is brought about by the secret interference of the old Hospitaller, and Alice goes singing and dancing through the whole, in a way that makes her seem like a beautiful devil, though finally it will be recognized that she is an angel of light. Middleton, half bewildered, can scarcely tell <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to his own agency; how much is independent of him and would have happened had he stayed on his own side of the water. By and by a further and unexpected development presents the singular fact that he himself is the heir to whatever claims there are, whether of property or rank,--all centring in him as the representative of the eldest brother. On this discovery there ensues a tragedy in the death of the present possessor of the estate, who has staked everything upon the issue; and Middleton, standing amid the ruin and desolation of which he has been the innocent cause, resigns all the claims which he might now assert, and retires, arm in arm with Alice, who has encouraged him to take this course, and to act up to his character. The estate takes a passage into the female line, and the old name becomes extinct, nor does Middleton seek to continue it by resuming it in place of the one long ago assumed by his ancestor. Thus he and his wife become the Adam and Eve of a new epoch, and the fitting missionaries of a new social faith, of which there must be continual hints through the book.|$|E
