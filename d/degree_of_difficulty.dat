5|$|The game {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Critics praised its aesthetics, puzzle design, and {{fidelity to}} the series, but criticized its short length and disputed its <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> It was selected for a 2016 Apple Design Award, Apple's 2015 iPhone game of the year, and best mobile/handheld game at the 2015 The Game Awards.|$|E
5|$|The V-scale, which {{originated}} in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b> The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} introduce a new talent agency that would be separate from 765 Pro to better suit {{the details of the}} story, such as how the idols at 876 Pro are just starting out while the idols at 765 Pro already have an establish fanbase. Tanaka would go on to say that the scenario in Dearly Stars would not have worked without having a different company president—in this case, the president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story. However, Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge, such as the introduction of the choreography panel to make adjustments to an idol's dance sequence or the positioning and manipulation of in-game cameras. The staff also altered how the lessons and auditions operate in Dearly Stars compared to previous games in the series, which also modified the game's <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or compacted snow. Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

25|$|Each dive is {{assigned}} a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (DD), which is determined {{from a combination}} of the moves undertaken, position used, and height. The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.|$|E

25|$|The Donets is {{regarded}} as one of the most scenic rivers of East European Plain and contains many hiking and biking routes along its banks.

25|$|In {{synchronized}} trampolining, two athletes perform {{exactly the}} same routine of ten skills {{at the same time}} on two adjacent trampolines. Each athlete is scored separately by a pair of judges for their form {{in the same manner as}} for individual competitions. Additional judges score the pair for synchronization. Fewer points are deducted for lack of synchronization if the pair are bouncing at the same height at the same time. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> of the routine is determined in the same way as for individual trampoline routines and the points added to the score to determine the winner.|$|E
25|$|The {{routine is}} marked out of 10 by five judges with {{deductions}} for incomplete moves or poor form. Usually {{the highest and}} lowest scores are discarded. Additional points can be added depending on {{the difficulty of the}} skills being performed. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> (DD or tariff) is calculated by adding a factor for each half turn (or twist) or quarter somersault. Difficulty is important in a routine, however, there are differences in opinion between various coaches whether it is better to focus on increasing the difficulty of routines given that this usually results in a reduced form score or to focus on improving execution scores by displaying better form in an easier routine.|$|E
25|$|The unorthodox play of Higgins was {{encapsulated}} in his {{break of}} 69, made under unusual pressure, against Jimmy White in the penultimate frame of their World Professional Snooker Championship semi-final in 1982. Higgins was 0–59 {{down in that}} frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball pot on a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, {{not only for its}} extreme <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at that moment. In potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went a little too far for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.|$|E
