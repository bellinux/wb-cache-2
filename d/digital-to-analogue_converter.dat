5000|$|The {{fourth and}} current [...] "phase", the [...] "digital" [...] era, {{has seen the}} most rapid, {{dramatic}} and far-reaching series {{of changes in the}} history of audio recording. In a period of less than 20 years, all previous recording technologies were rapidly superseded by digital sound encoding, which was perfected by the Japanese electronics corporation Sony in the 1970s. Unlike all previous technologies, which captured a continuous analogue of the sounds being recorded, digital recording captured sound by means of a very dense and rapid series of discrete samples of the sound. When played back through a <b>digital-to-analogue</b> <b>converter,</b> these audio samples are recombined to form a continuous flow of sound. The first all-digitally-recorded popular music album, Ry Cooder's Bop 'Til You Drop, was released in 1979, and from that point, digital sound recording and reproduction quickly became the new standard at every level, from the professional recording studio to the home hi-fi.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} factors affect how precise a signal is, mainly the noise present in the {{original}} signal and the noise added by processing (see signal-to-noise ratio). Fundamental physical limits such as the shot noise in components limits the resolution of analogue signals. In digital electronics additional precision is obtained by using additional digits to represent the signal. The practical limit {{in the number of}} digits is determined by the performance of the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), since digital operations can usually be performed without loss of precision. The ADC takes an analogue signal and changes it into a series of binary numbers. The ADC may be used in simple digital display devices, e. g., thermometers or light meters but it may also be used in digital sound recording and in data acquisition. However, a <b>digital-to-analogue</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC) is used to change a digital signal to an analogue signal. A DAC takes a series of binary numbers and converts it to an analogue signal. It is common to find a DAC in the gain-control system of an op-amp which in turn may be used to control digital amplifiers and filters.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a super-precision programmable current source that can deliver up to about Â± 100 rnA to an inductive load. The load is intended typically to be a coil in a coil/magnet actuator that provides a force which {{is proportional to the}} current, and results in a linear and well defined movement of an elastic flexure mechanism. The particularly demanding application of long-range x-ray interferometry required two tracking current sources that offered a resolution to better than 1 part in 500, 000 and this could not be satisfied by commercially available instruments. Consequently it was necessary to design, construct and test two identical supplies (or drives); a non-trivial and very demanding task since exceptionally slow drives scans needed to be accommodated. Temporal stability is therefore critical. Although the operational bandwidth can be kept small, noise up to over 1 kHz must be rigorously suppressed to avoid exciting resonances in the system being driven. Commercial 20 -bit <b>digital-to-analogue</b> <b>converters</b> could not be utilised to provide a resolution of 1 part per million, because they are invariably designed for audio applications and have unacceptable drifts with temperature and time.

Ideally a single coil-magnet actuator placed in line with the main axis of movement would ensure translation but no rotation. However, a number of factors produce parasitic twist which reduces the contrast of x-ray fringes. Two coil-magnet actuators have been placed symmetrically off the main axis of the monolith and by independent control of the currents it has been possible to compensate for asymmetries and obtain linear translation with negligible rotation. The measurement of x-ray fringes demonstrates a controlled movement of about 0. 6 nm over a period of 30 min.

40|$|Abstract Digital delta-sigma {{modulators}} {{are used}} in {{a broad range of}} modern electronic sub-systems, including oversampled <b>digital-to-analogue</b> <b>converters,</b> class-D amplifiers and fractional-N frequency synthesizers. This work addresses a well known problem of unwanted spurious tones in the modulatorâs output spectrum. When a delta-sigma modulator works with a constant input, the output signal can be periodic, where short periods lead to strong deterministic tones. In this work we propose means for guaranteeing that the output period will never be shorter than a prescribed minimum value for all constant inputs. This allows a relationship to be formulated between the modulatorâs bus width and the spurious-free range, thereby making it possible to trade output spectrum quality for hardware consumption. The second problem addressed in this thesis is related to the finite accuracy of frequencies generated in delta-sigma fractional-N frequency synthesis. The synthesized frequencies are usually approximated with an accuracy that is dependent on the modulatorâs bus width. We propose a solution which allows frequencies to be generated exactly and removes the problem of a constant phase drift. This solution, which is applicable to a broad range of digital delta-sigma modulator architectures, replaces the traditionally used truncation quantizer with a variable modulus quantizer. The modulus, provided by a separate input, defines the denominator of the rational output mean. The thesis concludes with a practical example of a delta-sigma modulator used in a fractional-N frequency synthesizer designed to meet the strict accuracy requirements of a GSM base station transceiver. Here we optimize and compare a traditional modulator and a variable modulus design in order to minimize hardware consumption. The example illustrates the use made {{of the relationship between the}} spurious-free range and the modulatorâs bus width, and the practical use of the variable modulus functionality...|$|R
40|$|Data {{conversion}} is {{the crucial}} interface between {{the real world}} and digital processing systems. Analogue-to-digital <b>converters</b> and <b>digital-to-analogue</b> <b>converters</b> are two key conversion devices and used as the interface. Up to now, the conventional ADCs based on Nyquist sampling theorem are facing a critical challenge: the resolution and the sampling rate must be radically increased when some applications such as radar detection and ultra-wideband communication emerge. The offset of comparators and the setup time of sample-and-hold circuits, however, limit the resulution and clock rate of ADCs. Alternatively, in some applications such as speech, temperature sensor, etc. signals remain possibly unchanged for prolonged periods with brief bursts of significant activity. If trational ADCs are employed in such circumstances a higher bandwidth is required for transmitting the converted samples. On the other hand, sampling signals with an extremely high clock rate are also required for converting the signals with the feature of sparsity in time domain. The level-crossing sampling scheme (LCSS) is one of the data conversions suitable for converting signals with the sparsity feature and brief bursts of signigicant activity. due to the traditional LCSS with a fixed clock rate being limited in applications a novel irregular data conversion scheme called analogue-to-information system (AIS) is proposed in this thesis. The AIS is typically based upon LCSS, but an adjustable clock generator and a real time data compression scheme are applied to it. As the system-level simulations results of AIS show {{it can be seen that}} a data transmission saving rate nearly 30 % is achieved for different signals. PLLs with fast pull-in and locking schemes are very important when they are applied in TDMA systems and fequency hopping wireless systems. So a novel triple path nonlinear phase frequency detector (TPNPFD) is also proposed in this thesis. Compared to otherPFDs, the pll-in and locking time in TPNPFD is much shorter. A proper transmission data format can make the recreation of the skipped samples and the reconstruction of the original signal more efficient, i. e. they can be achieved in a minimum number of the received data without increasing much more hardware complexity. So the preliminary data format used for transmitting the converted data from AIS is also given in the final chapter of this thesis for future works...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{sensitivity}} of an optical receiver, the gain and the collection area of the photo-detectors within the receiver should be increased. Detectors with internal gain such as avalanche photodiodes (APD) are usually used to increase {{the sensitivity of the}} receiver. One problem with APDs is the sensitivity of their gain to their bias voltage, which makes them challenging to be fabricated in a standard CMOS process due to variations in their gain. However, when an APD is biased over its breakdown voltage, it is sensitive to a single photon, hence, referred to as a single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD). The SPADs are photon-counting detectors, which are less sensitive to their bias voltage, and can be integrated with rest of the electronic circuitry that form an optical receiver. An avalanche diode requires dedicated circuits to be operated in the SPAD mode. These circuits make the diode insensitive to an incident photon for a duration that is known as deadtime. Unfortunately, The collection area of the PD, APD, and SPADs are limited to their capacitance. Hence, a large photo-detector leads to a larger capacitance, which reduces the bandwidth of the receiver. In this thesis, a photon counting optical receiver based on an array of SPADs is proposed which increases the collection area with a low output capacitance. The avalanche diode and peripheral circuits which operate and readout-out the SPAD array are fabricated in the commercially available UMC 0. 18 Î¼m CMOS process. Initially, the avalanche diode is tested and characterised. A high performance circuit is then designed and tested which is able to achieve short deadtimes up to 4 ns. Once the photon counting operation of the SPAD is verified, a numerical model is developed to investigate the influence of several factors, including the deadtime, on the performance of the photon-counting detector in a communication link. Based on the simulation results, which show the advantages of an array over a single detector, a prototype detector array of 64 asynchronous SPADs is designed and tested. This array uses a high-speed readout mechanism which is inspired by the current steering <b>digital-to-analogue</b> <b>converters.</b> Bit error ratio tests (BERT) verify the photon counting capability of the proposed detector, and a bit error rate of 1 E- 3 has been achieved at data rate of 100 Mbps. In addition, the array of SPAD is compatible with a front-end of conventional optical receiver which uses a photodiode as a photo detector. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
