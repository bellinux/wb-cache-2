5000|$|The Hyper Pak was a parts package made {{available}} from 1960 through 1962 at Chrysler Corporation dealer parts counters. The parts were {{made available}} {{to comply with the}} regulations of sanctioning bodies for racing events in which Valiants had been entered by factory-backed teams: All parts used had to be [...] "stock" [...] parts, the definition of which meant that they were available through normal factory parts channels. The Hyper Pak consisted of a very-long-ram intake manifold meant to accept a Carter AFB 4-barrel carburetor, the AFB carburetor itself and an appropriate air cleaner, dual (front-3 and rear-3) cast-iron exhaust headers, a large-diameter exhaust Y-pipe to connect to these dual cast-iron headers, a larger muffler, a 276°-duration camshaft with appropriate valve springs and pushrods, a heavier-duty clutch, a manual choke control, a starter motor modification template and, in the full-race version of the package, high-compression pistons designed to increase the engine's compression ratio to 10.5 from the stock 8.5. The Hyper Pak was recommended for installation only on vehicles equipped with manual transmissions, for the camshaft was of such characteristics that a <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> was required to prevent engine stall-out. The Hyper Pak was primarily intended for competition driving, its road manners involving rough idling and poor cold-engine driveability, a high power band and poor fuel economy. But, in competition events, it proved unbeatable. Eight factory-backed Valiants entered the 1960 NASCAR compact car race at Daytona Beach, and humbled the competition; the Valiants came in first through eighth. After a similar performance the following year, the race was dropped. A high-fidelity reproduction of the Hyper Pak intake manifold was created by noted Slant-6 builder Doug Dutra in the late 1990s; subsequently the tooling was sold to a marketer of performance equipment for inline six-cylinder engines.|$|E

Fuel adulteration has been practiced in Nepal due to financial incentives arising from differential taxes that are imposed by the government. Fuels (petrol, diesel, kerosene) mixed in different proportion were used to run the engine at low <b>idling</b> and <b>high</b> <b>idling</b> <b>speed</b> and the tailpipe emissions were recorded for each sample mixture and compare with the existing emission standard for in use vehicles.

40|$|Abstract: The present paper {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} chemical treatment of used catalysts {{for the purpose of}} improving catalytic efficiency. The proposed method inserts the catalyst in a bath of a strong organic solvent that dissolves oil, soot and fuel residues, cleaning the active surface of the catalyst. The tests were conducted at low (750 r/min) and <b>high</b> (3100 r/min) <b>idle</b> <b>speeds.</b> The experimental results based on CO, HC and catalyst inlet–outlet temperature difference measure-ments indicate that after treatment the catalytic efficiency improves considerably (25 per cent) at low idle (750 r/min). The improvement is even <b>higher</b> at <b>high</b> <b>idle</b> (3100 r/min), exceeding 40 per cent. Therefore, there are strong indications that, if car catalysts underwent a similar treatment at regular service intervals, e. g. every 20 000 km, engine emissions could be considerably reduced and catalyst operational life extended...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} conform to {{stringent}} emissions legislation, three-way catalysts have been routinely fitted to gasoline-powered vehicles {{in order to reduce}} the emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. In Europe the majority of all personal car journeys are less than 4 km in length, with the emissions produced in the first kilometre accounting for 80 % of the total emissions produced in that journey. This is due to the time taken for the catalyst to attain 'light-off' signified by the point at which a catalyst reaches a sufficiently high temperature to allow chemical reactions to occur. There are a number of methods used to reduce the light-off time such as retarded spark timing, <b>higher</b> <b>idle</b> <b>speeds,</b> artificial loading of the engine, secondary air injection and λ control. While numerous studies have investigated light-off strategies in isolation, or in limited combinations, this study is the first in the open literature to examine all the above factors simultaneously and to assess how their impacts on the exhaust gas temperatures varies with the distance away from the exhaust ports. Experimental work was undertaken in order to generate empirical models to predict the effects of the catalyst heating strategies of gasoline engines on the light-off times of the production three-way catalyst and the exhaust gas temperatures at various distances along the exhaust system up to, and including, the inlet to the catalyst. The empirical model demonstrated good accuracy with errors in the temperature predictions, when compared with experimental data, found to be, on average, less than - 0. 6 % at the pre-catalyst location...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Idle</b> <b>speed</b> (<b>idling,</b> or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion engine). The idle differs in two ways engine idle and vehicle <b>idle.</b> At <b>idle</b> <b>speed,</b> the engine generates enough [...] power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile.

There are three methods of PID tuning applied: heuristic tuning, self-tuning by pole placement, and also iterative learning algorithm (ILA).

40|$|Abstract—A circuit {{technique}} is presented {{for reducing the}} subthreshold leakage energy consumption of domino logic circuits. Sleep switch transistors are proposed to place an idle dual threshold voltage domino logic circuit into a low leakage state. The circuit technique enhances {{the effectiveness of a}} dual threshold voltage CMOS technology to reduce the subthreshold leakage current by strongly turning off all of the high threshold voltage transistors. The sleep switch circuit technique significantly reduces the subthreshold leakage energy as compared to both standard low-threshold voltage and dual threshold voltage domino logic circuits.

This paper applies a recently proposed linear time varying model predictive approach for the <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control of ultra-lean burn internal combustion engines. Unlike conventional gasoline engines, the approach uses fuel flow as the primary control variable to compensate for sudden fluctuations in engine load resulting in a fuel assisted <b>idle</b> <b>speed</b> control strategy. Simultaneously, the spark angle is maintained at a value so as to yield maximum brake torque while the emissions are reduced to negligibly low levels by constraining the engine operation to ultra-lean burn mode.
