When his parents, Rosendo and María {{enrolled}} him in school, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from the first grade again because he did not know enough English. Santos joined his high school's choir, but he {{dropped out of high school}} in his second year and moved out of his parents' apartment. When he was fifteen years old he began looking for work in Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and {{his failure to}} defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider in the final part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, Foyt {{seemed to}} have earned a career best start for an IndyCar Series race at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the 2008 GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300 with the third best {{qualifying}} time. His Vision Racing teammate, Ed Carpenter also earned a career best start with the 2nd best qualifying time. However, both cars failed technical inspection, meaning they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> {{at the rear of}} the field. Foyt drove his No. 2 entry from the last position (25th) to a ninth-place finish in the race.|$|E

Felipe Massa's Williams did not get off the line {{at the start of the}} formation lap, so he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from pit lane. The start lights went on after a long delay, due to Pastor Maldonado being in the wrong grid position.|$|E
5|$|The Glass Spider Tour was {{the first}} Bowie tour to reach Austria, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Wales. Some of the outdoor {{performances}} in Britain <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> early due to curfew laws (a problem typically avoided in other European shows), which reduced {{the impact of the}} lighting of the stage and set dressing, and bothered Bowie considerably.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, {{and because}} of the fire, the airport <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going}} to get someone else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{experimented with}} {{numerous}} robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers {{to form the}} final cast. Bay acknowledged {{that most of the}} Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E

5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, {{as they had}} renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since {{he was not the}} family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, {{though the}} sister company Braathens Helikopter, for {{concessions}} for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement {{was used to}} connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the cabin crew had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It {{was caused by the}} company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed overbooking. This gave increased revenue, but the company <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight. On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu. The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985. It was a cooperation with Inter Nor Hotels, and gave special privileges to travelers that made 25 full-price trips per year with Braathens.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and written by Masato Kato. Ishii had previously produced or directed all of the previous Mana games, while Kato also wrote the stories for Children of Mana (2006) and Dawn of Mana (2006). The game was developed by Brownie Brown, who previously helped develop Sword of Mana (2003). Ishii created the overall design, and Brownie Brown worked directly with him to implement it. As the series creator, Ishii {{felt it was important}} to be directly involved in all stages of development. Heroes of Mana was created as an RTS game to complement the other titles in the World of Mana project, which all offer a spin on the original Seiken Densetsu formula. Ishii stated that it was also to help expose Japanese gamers to real-time strategy games, a genre that is relatively obscure in Japan, while simultaneously satisfying players abroad with an RTS for an unconventional console, as most real-time strategy games are released for personal computers. To match this mission, the game was designed for more casual players than the typical fan of the traditionally role-playing game series. The Nintendo DS was chosen as the platform partially due to the system's multiplayer potential as well as giving the sensation of touching the game. The team found developing an RTS for the Nintendo DS to be difficult, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> development over at one point. Although prior to the World of Mana project Ishii has said that the games in the series are only thematically connected, Heroes is explicitly set as a prequel to Seiken Densetsu 3 (1995), depicting battles between the nations present in that game. It is set one generation prior to Seiken Densetsu 3, with some characters noted as the parents of characters in the other game.|$|E
