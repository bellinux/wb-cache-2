5|$|Yuuki Ashikaga is a {{high school}} {{freshman}} in his second semester at the fictional Sakakino Academy, who from his regular visits to the library, grows enamored by Kotonoha Katsura, a classmate who also comes to read. Despite being in a relationship, she genuinely reciprocates his interest. However, things become complicated when his sister, Chie, introduces him to Roka Kitsuregawa, a friend of hers. In {{an attempt to make}} herself seem <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> Roka claims that she is equally interested in Makoto Itou, another schoolmate. Her lie is unsuccessful, as Yuuki, aware that Makoto is Kotonoha's boyfriend, decides to ask her about the affair.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at {{a conference}} {{organised}} by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added: The book {{is second only to}} the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E
25|$|Sargent's early enthusiasm was for landscapes, not portraiture, as {{evidenced}} by his voluminous sketches full of mountains, seascapes, and buildings. Carolus-Duran's expertise in portraiture finally influenced Sargent in that direction. Commissions for history paintings were still considered more prestigious, but were much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> Portrait painting, on the other hand, {{was the best way}} of promoting an art career, getting exhibited in the Salon, and gaining commissions to earn a livelihood.|$|E

40|$|Folk wisdom {{suggests}} playing <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> is {{an effective}} strategy in romantic attraction. However, prior research has yielded little support for this belief. This article seeks to reconcile these contrasting views by investigating how 2 hitherto unconsidered factors, (a) the asymmetry between wanting (motivational) and liking (affective) responses and (b) the degree of psychological commitment, can determine the efficacy of playing <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> We propose that person B playing <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> with person A will simultaneously increase A’s wanting but decrease A’s liking of B. However, such a result will only occur if A is psychologically committed to pursuing further relations with B; otherwise, playing <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> will decrease both wanting and liking. Two studies confirm these propositions. We discuss implications for interpersonal attraction and the interplay between emotion and motivation in determining preferences...|$|R
25|$|In 1938 Celan {{traveled}} to Tours, France, to study medicine. The Anschluss precluded his study in Vienna, and Romanian schools were <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into {{due to the}} newly imposed Jewish quota. His journey to France took him through Berlin as the events of Kristallnacht unfolded, and also introduced him to his uncle, Bruno Schrager, who was later among the French detainees who died at Birkenau. Celan returned to Cernăuţi in 1939 to study literature and Romance languages.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year, 400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46,000 across the country, far outnumbering the {{combined}} total of long-established taverns, pubs, inns and hotels. Because {{it was so}} easy to obtain permission and the profits could be huge compared to the low cost of gaining permission, the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house. Finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced. Only then was it made <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a licence, and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

25|$|The events {{begin the}} same way. Something provokes anxiety in a person, who then tries to reduce anxiety by seeking {{physical}} or psychological closeness to their attachment. The attachment rebuffs {{the request for}} greater closeness. The lack of responsiveness increases feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person then gets locked into a cycle with the attachment: the person tries to get closer, the attachment rejects the request for greater closeness, which leads the person to try even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> closer, followed by another rejection from the attachment, and so on. The cycle ends only when the situation shifts to a security-based strategy (because the attachment finally responds positively) or when the person switches to an attachment avoidant strategy (because the person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment).|$|E

There is minimal support for the game at schools, with the national federation not responding to requests from the national team coach to work <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> girls to play the sport in school. A national women's league was created in 2004 after a 26-year effort. [...] Five teams competed in the inaugural season: Women Fighters, Nyuki FC, Koani Sisters, Bungi Sisters and Policewomen FC.

His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. [...] "Burn" [...] earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — I come in, do my job and head out. I like to leave all the glory and shine to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me.

500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts.

We've done the PC and 360 versions here and EA has a team doing the PS3 version– and they'll make the PS3 version a good product; EA got the job done in putting {{a lot of people with}} PS3 experience on the project. But I think it's <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it to the same standard as the 360 and PC versions".

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on September 24, 2009, [...] "The Stakeout" [...] {{was seen by}} 4.22 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. It constituted a nearly 800,000-household drop from the previous week's season premiere, [...] "Pawnee Zoo". The episode received a 1.8 rating/5 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49, the lowest rating for Season Two so far. The Star-Ledger television columnist Alan Sepinwall said although the quality of Parks and Recreations was improving, season two was struggling in the ratings based on the lower quality of the season one episodes. Sepinwall said, [...] "There's a school of thought in the TV business that it's <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back viewers who watched and left {{than it is to}} start small and attract new viewers over time." [...] "The Stakeout" [...] received generally positive reviews. Sepinwall said the episode was funny, but also notable because it developed a stronger personal connection between Leslie and Tom, and because it featured more references to topical events like the Henry Gates controversy.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right and {{she worked with}} the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
