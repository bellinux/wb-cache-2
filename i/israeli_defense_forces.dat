5|$|Sadat's {{strategy}} {{was designed to}} achieve political success without needing a comprehensive military victory, and hence, and {{in view of the}} Egyptian military's marked inferiority to the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Forces,</b> this required only a limited war.|$|E

During the counteroffensive, the IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted for 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the wanted militants to various foreign countries.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Ismailia {{took place}} between the Egyptian Army and the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Forces</b> (IDF) during the last stages of the Yom Kippur War during October 18–22, 1973, {{south of the city}} of Ismailia, on {{the west bank of the}} Suez Canal in Egypt.

5|$|A Storm Mark III {{was set to}} be {{produced}} for the <b>Israeli</b> <b>defense</b> <b>forces</b> starting in June 2008, when the IDF was to purchase around 600 vehicles beginning in early 2011. Based on the then new four-door Jeep Wrangler JK design, the Mark III is meant {{to address some of}} the shortfalls of the earlier Mark II. Whereas the previous vehicle was an update of the original TK Storm, the Storm III was designed from the outset with a five-door configuration. Unlike the TJ-L, the new JK Storm has a much higher maximum load capacity in part due to heavier-duty shock absorbers, springs and axles, necessary for an armored version. It includes a standard 2.8L VM Motori turbodiesel and automatic transmission.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of a {{coalition}} of Arab states in the 1967 Six-Day War, major Palestinian guerrilla organizations that participated in the war or were sponsored {{by any of the}} involved Arab states, such as the Arab Nationalist Movement led by George Habash and the Palestine Liberation Army of Ahmad Shukeiri, lost considerable influence among the Palestinian population. This made Fatah the dominant faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). They gained 33 of 105 seats in the Palestinian National Council (PNC) (the most seats allocated to any guerrilla group), thus strengthening al-Wazir's position. During the Battle of Karameh, in March 1968, he and Salah Khalaf held important command positions among Fatah fighters against the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Forces</b> (IDF), which developed his credentials as a military strategist. This eventually led to him staking command of al-Assifa, holding major positions in the PNC, and the Supreme Military Council of the PLO. He was also put in charge of guerrilla warfare operations in both the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel proper.|$|E
