5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of Belgium was overwhelmingly Catholic. Jews made up the largest non-Christian population in the country, numbering between 70–75,000 out of a population of 8 million. Most lived in large towns and cities in Belgium, such as Antwerp and Brussels. The vast majority were recent <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> Belgium fleeing persecution in Germany and Eastern Europe and, as a result, only a small minority actually possessed Belgian citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{evolved from}} older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, {{baseball}} was {{widely recognized as}} the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Chinese <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> the Indonesian {{archipelago}} {{almost entirely}} originated from ethnic Han groups {{of what are}} now the Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China, areas known for their regional diversity. Large numbers of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, live in Southeast Asia. Nearly all Chinese Indonesians are either patrilineal descendants of these early immigrants, or new immigrants born in mainland China.|$|E

5|$|<b>Immigrants</b> <b>to</b> Israel have {{incorporated}} {{elements of the}} cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came. During approximately fifty years before 1948, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration, which brought with them {{a whole range of}} foods and cooking styles. Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels, while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes, such as schmaltz herring and vorschmack (gehakte herring).|$|E

5|$|The prospectors {{came from}} many nations, {{although}} an estimated majority of 60 to 80 percent were Americans or recent <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> America.

In Seattle, this included the mayor, twelve policemen, and {{a significant percentage of}} the city's streetcar drivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} {{history of}} the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The majority of <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now {{the majority of the}} United States population are monolingual English speakers, although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.|$|E
5|$|With {{the public}} {{suspicious}} of immigrants, {{especially those who}} might be socialists or communists, Congress passed the Per Centum Act of 1921, signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, as a quick means of restricting immigration. The act reduced the numbers of <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> 3% of those from a given country living in the U.S., based on the 1910 census. This would, in practice, not restrict immigration from Ireland and Germany, but would bar many Italians and eastern European Jews. Harding and Secretary of Labor James Davis believed that enforcement had to be humane, and at the secretary's recommendation, Harding allowed almost a thousand deportable <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> remain. Coolidge signed a bill permanently restricting immigration to the U.S. in 1924.|$|E

5|$|According to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, {{there are}} three main classifications for immigrants: Family class (persons closely related to Canadian residents), Economic class (admitted {{on the basis of}} a point system that {{accounts}} for age, health and labour-market skills required for cost effectively inducting the immigrants into Canada's labour market) and Refugee class (those seeking protection by applying to remain in the country by way of the Canadian immigration and refugee law). In 2008, there were 65,567 immigrants in the family class, 21,860 refugees, and 149,072 economic immigrants amongst the 247,243 total <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> the country. Canada resettles over one in 10 of the world's refugees and has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E

5|$|Day-Lewis {{was born}} in Kensington, London, the son of poet Cecil Day-Lewis and English actress Jill Balcon. His father, who {{was born in}} Ballintubbert, County Laois, Ireland, was of Protestant Anglo-Irish and English background, lived in England from the age of two, and later became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom. Day-Lewis's mother was Jewish; her {{ancestors}} were Jewish <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> England from Latvia and Poland. His maternal grandfather, Sir Michael Balcon, was the head of Ealing Studios. Two years after his birth, his family moved to Croom's Hill, Greenwich, south-east London, where Day-Lewis grew up along with his older sister, Tamasin, who became a documentary filmmaker and television chef.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab {{resistance}} and violence to this influx of immigrants {{came to a head}} in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{plays an}} iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely {{considered}} to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish <b>immigrants</b> <b>to</b> Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals. According to Jonathan Kis-Lev, falafel and hummus are often used as symbols for peace, as well as tools for bridging Israelis and Palestinians.|$|E
