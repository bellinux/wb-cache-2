25|$|In 1984/85 Marshall {{had another}} {{successful}} series {{at home against}} New Zealand, although there were calls for his bouncers to be ruled as intimidatory beyond what was acceptable, and that Marshall should have been admonished by the umpires. A rising delivery broke the nose of Mike Gatting, England's captain, in a one-day match in February 1986; Marshall later found bone fragments embedded in the leather of the ball. As well as the bouncer, however, Marshall succeeded in swinging the ball in both directions. He also used an in-swinging yorker as well as developing an effective leg-cutter, and {{with the exception of}} the 1986/87 New Zealanders, against whom he could only manage nine wickets at 32.11, no side seemed to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{said of the}} CityYear program: [...] "Who’s {{the next}} {{generation}} {{that is going to}} lead us and inspire us and build an America we can all be proud of? When I look out at all of the City Year corps members who have been giving so much of themselves for a cause that is so much larger than themselves, I think I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that question.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, then-Representative Nathan Deal {{replied to}} a {{question}} about whether he believed that Obama [...] "is a native-born American citizen who is eligible to serve as president" [...] with a statement that [...] "I am joining several of my colleagues in the House in writing a letter to the President asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this question." [...] Contrasting the differing fates of Deal, who won the 2010 gubernatorial election in Georgia, and former Democratic Representative Cynthia McKinney, who lost her primary after endorsing 9/11 conspiracy theories, David Weigel of Slate noted: [...] "Dipping a toe into the birtherism fever swamp didn't stop Deal from winning a statewide primary." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{his friend}} <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this. [...] "My natural interest, Mr. Crimble--considering what I do for it--is in {{the claim of}} ours. But I wish you were on my side!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The plan {{moved forward}} after {{confirmation}} that O'Brien's contract did not guarantee a strict 11:35 start time (a loophole included primarily to accommodate sports preemptions and specials {{such as the}} network's New Year coverage). Gaspin planned to disclose the news to Leno first, and then, if all went well, report it to O'Brien the next week. When Gaspin met with Leno and Vickers and laid out the proposal, the response was positive, although they questioned how such a plan would work. Gaspin reasoned {{that the company was}} in a desperate position, and he indicated his confidence that O'Brien would too go along with the changes. While Leno embraced the plan, Vickers was unnerved; without a guest or music act she might have no studio audience, which could have disastrous consequences for Leno. In order to meet with O'Brien the following Monday, Gaspin was forced to cancel a meeting with the affiliate board, but promised them that by doing so, he would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the 10pm problem that [...] "will likely be something they're happy with". Following his Wednesday, January 6 show, O'Brien met with manager Gavin Polone and lamented his anxiety with the ratings: [...] "I just think [...] is going to hurt me in some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that question," [...] affirmed Mr. Sympson, {{assuming}} vast {{courage and}} consequence {{on the strength}} of this symptom of confusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drink a {{glass of}} wine, Mr. Titmarsh," [...] says Smithers, [...] "and read this letter. A pretty note was that which you sent to your aunt this morning, and here you <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E
40|$|Michael Graetz {{assesses the}} two {{proposals}} of the Presidents Advisory Panel and finds them lacking and politically infeasible. He proposes {{moving to a}} VAT, the Panel's plan C, and using the VAT to eliminate the income tax for 150 million Americans. Graetz <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> maintain progressivity as well. ...|$|R
60|$|Valencia went out. Certain {{as she was}} of her sister's innocence, {{there was}} one terrible {{question}} in her heart which must be answered, or her belief in all truth, goodness, religion, would reel and rock to its very foundations. And till she <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that, she could not sit still by Lucia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then do {{this for}} me. Allow {{me to think that}} I have not yet <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> my proposal; give me to this day month, to Christmas; till any time that you like to name, so that I may think that it is not yet settled, and may tell Uncle Christopher that such is the case." ...|$|R
6000|$|INCRED. Then said old Incredulity: 'Sir, If I live I will do your errand to Diabolus, {{and there}} you shall <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> your words. Meanwhile we will seek {{the good of the}} town, and not ask counsel of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I must <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> {{this one}} question,' said Miss Assher, a little softened: 'Has there been, or is there, any love {{on your side}} towards Miss Sarti? I {{have nothing to do}} with her feelings, but I have a right to know yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, sir," [...] {{said the}} Duke; [...] "I suspend the {{movements}} of attack for one hour, and for one hour only. If you <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> return within that space of time, I will receive it here, and earnestly entreat it may be such as to save the effusion of blood." ...|$|E
25|$|According to Fromm, humans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{need for}} a stable frame of reference. Religion {{apparently}} fills this need. In effect, humans crave <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> questions that no other source of knowledge <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to,</b> which only religion may seem <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> However, <b>a</b> sense of free will must be given in order for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Though it {{properly}} means {{anything but a}} horseman,' said Elizabeth; 'we ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> word <b>answering</b> <b>to</b> the German Ritter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is there {{anything}} {{between you and}} Mr Maguire?" [...] said Mrs Stumfold again. [...] "I particularly wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> plain <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> that question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, I think, {{much more}} likely that Henry Baker is an {{absolutely}} innocent man, who {{had no idea that}} the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> our advertisement." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Prong, however, still {{shook his}} head in silence; and it was {{difficult}} for a lady in Mrs. Prime's position to read accurately the meaning of such shakings under such circumstances. But Mrs. Prime was a woman sufficiently versed in the world's business to be able to resolve that she would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> her question when she required an answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, neighbor!" [...] cried Robin, flourishing his cudgel, {{and then}} {{thrusting}} its larger end {{close to the}} man's muffled face. [...] "No, no, I'm not the fool you take me for, nor do you pass till I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> my question. Whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux?" [...] The stranger, instead of attempting to force his passage, {{stepped back into the}} moonlight, unmuffled his face, and stared full into that of Robin.|$|E
50|$|Muriella {{had betrayed}} Ehb {{and her father}} largely by accident: {{she fell in love}} with Gallian, who {{proceeded}} to deceive and train her, stealing her power. After she realized his dark nature, she breaks off their romance, and confesses to her father Merick, who finally <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> another problem of his: a growing imbalance of the magical power in Gallian's favour. To offset this, the normally reclusive nymphs of Sedgwick Forest, led by Elora (Kristanna Loken) side with Ehb against Gallian.|$|R

50|$|Olivier Roy {{explains}} Islamist {{attacks on}} Christians and other non-Muslims as {{a need for}} a scapegoat for failure.Since Islam <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> everything, the troubles from which Muslim society is suffering are due to nonbelievers and to plots, whether Zionist or Christian. Attacks against Jews and Christians appear regularly in neofundamentalist articles. In Egypt, Copts are physically attacked. In Afghanistan, the presence of western humanitarians, who are associated with Christian missionaries the fact that many if not most have secular often leftist backgrounds is denounced.|$|R
60|$|Prof. Things go {{as well as}} we can expect. The {{letter that}} I carried thither was highly approved, and well liked by all my lords, and I am {{returning}} to tell our Diabolonians so. I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> it here in my bosom, that I am sure will make our masters that sent me glad; for the contents thereof are to encourage them to pursue their design to the utmost, and to be ready also to fall on within, when they shall see my Lord Diabolus beleaguering the town of Mansoul.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a fine fellow," [...] said Holmes, as we {{came out}} into Whitehall. [...] "But he has a {{struggle}} to keep up his position. He is far from rich and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots had been resoled. Now, Watson, I won't detain you from your legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more to-day, unless I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> my cab advertisement. But I should be extremely obliged {{to you if you}} would come down with me to Woking to-morrow, by the same train which we took yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{does one}} bird know another {{of its own}} kind? Why does the water here remain pure, when all other water turns to blood? Why do not the frogs croak in Seti's halls, and why do the flies avoid his meat? Why, also, did the statue of Amon melt before her glance, while all my magic fell back from her breast like arrows from a shirt of mail? Those are the {{questions}} that Egypt asks, and I would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> them from the beloved of Seti, or of the god Set, she who is named Moon of Israel." ...|$|E
5000|$|From a Catholic viewpoint, Université de Paris D. ès L. Marie-France James, who has {{extensively}} studied esotericism and {{the origins}} of the New Age movement, describes Bernard de Montréal’s interviews on Richard Glenn’s TV show Ésotérisme expérimental as follows: [...] "The character is clever, evasive, <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> everything, and <b>has</b> perfect mastery of a certain type of esoteric-occultist jargon in which the words 'higher beings,' 'supracosmic evolution,' 'vibrations,' 'supramental,' 'denial of affectivity and of any emotionalism' (he is also ice-cold...impersonal and, paradoxically, seems full of himself) keep coming up on his lips." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, {{an interactive}} proof system is an abstract machine that models computation as {{the exchange of}} messages between two parties. The parties, the verifier and the prover, interact by exchanging messages in order to ascertain whether a given string belongs to a language or not. The prover is all-powerful and possesses unlimited computational resources, but cannot be trusted, while the verifier has bounded computation power. Messages are sent between the verifier and prover until the verifier <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> the problem and has [...] "convinced" [...] itself that it is correct.|$|R
50|$|The play's plot centres on the {{complicated}} and disputacious {{family of a}} successful London merchant named Matchill. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> sister, the widowed Lady Nestlecock, the doting mother of a simpleton son, Nehemiah Nestlecock; and a half-brother, the ne'er-do-well Strigood. Strigood has spent his way through his own patrimony; Matchill refuses financial help to the spendthrift. Strigood <b>has</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this rejection: he has drawn Matchill's apprentice Cash into the fashionable gallants' world of gambling and drinking. To afford this style of life, Cash spends his master's money, some of which finds its way into Strigood's pockets.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{the light}} chat {{scarcely}} interested old Madame Walravens {{more than it}} did me; she appeared restless, turning her head now to this side, now that, looking through the trees, and among the crowd, as if expectant of an arrival and impatient of delay. [...] "Où sont-ils? Pourquoi ne viennent-ils?" [...] I heard her mutter more than once; and at last, as if determined to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> her question--which hitherto none seemed to mind, she spoke aloud this phrase--a phrase brief enough, simple enough, but it sent a shock through me--"Messieurs et mesdames," [...] said she, [...] "où donc est Justine Marie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mrs. Bold, I'll {{tell you}} why. There are wheels within wheels, {{all of which}} I would explain to you, only I fear {{that there is not}} time. It is {{essentially}} necessary that I should <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this question, otherwise I cannot know how to advance your father's wishes; and it is quite impossible that I should ask himself. No one can esteem your father more than I do, but I doubt if this feeling is reciprocal." [...] It certainly was not. [...] "I must be candid with you as the only means of avoiding ultimate consequences, which may be most injurious to Mr. Harding. I fear there is a feeling--I will not even call it a prejudice--with regard to myself in Barchester, which is not in my favour. You remember that sermon--" ...|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{wonder at}} papa being annoyed {{about the loss}} of the [...] money. It must be a very great sum when it will prevent your [...] having a house in London,--as you agreed. It does make a great [...] difference, because, of course, as you have no regular place in [...] the country, one could only see one's friends in London. Fulham [...] is all very well now and then, but I don't think I should like [...] to live at Fulham all the year through. You talk of three years, [...] which would be dreadful.

5000|$|Haynes {{described}} {{the secret to}} his legal advocacy as <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> any question from a judge or prosecutor, or being prepared to change the subject. At an American Bar Association seminar in New York in the late 1970s, Haynes explained how to plead in the alternative: “Say you sue me because you claim my dog bit you. Well now, this is my defense: My dog doesn’t bite. And second, in the alternative, my dog was tied up that night. And third, I don’t believe you really got bit. And fourth, I don’t <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dog.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{mentioned}} {{the film in}} his book Your Movie Sucks, terming it [...] "a perfectly good idea for a comedy, but it just plain doesn't work."

50|$|After {{five years}} as an {{independent}} artisan, in 1870, Bonifacia met a newly arrived priest from Catalunya, Francesc Butinyà, S.J.. Butinyà was {{from a family of}} factory owners, but he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vision of responding {{to the needs of the}} growing working class which had arisen from the Industrial Revolution, one which was far ahead of the Church leaders of the day. He preached that work was a way for all to become more free equal in society, and also to give witness to the teachings of the Gospel. Rodríguez frequently attended the Masses at which Butinyà preached and decided that he <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> her spiritual searching.|$|R
