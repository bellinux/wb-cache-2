40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The work {{is aimed at}} {{studying}} the repeated consequences in the Drosophila genome. For the first time isolated, determined and localized has been the new simple satellite AACAC D. melanogaster on metaphase chromosomes, which is the specific for <b>heterochromatine</b> of the right shoulder of the 2 nd chromosome. The cluster of this satellite is limited with the moderately repeated consequence, homologic Stalker retrotransposon, which shown the alternation of the high and moderate repeated consequences in the pre-centredimensional <b>heterochromatine.</b> The analysis of the nearest <b>heterochromatine</b> environment of 9 lines-revertants by {{the effect of the}} mosaic type position has shown, that the neighourhoods with satDNA is not sufficient of the chromatine compactization. The model of the chromatine inactivation has been offered with the effect of position. The results of the work can be used in studying the structure-functional organisation of the pre-centredimensional <b>heterochromatine</b> of Drosophila. The found satellite can be used as the chromosome markerAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{studying}} the repeated consequences of the genome DNA of the voles, kin Microtus. For the first time isolated and characterized have been LINE 1 elements of the voles M. subarvalis (L 1 Ms 1) and M. kirgisorum (L 1 Mk 1). From the genome DNA of the vole M. subarvalis, the repeated consequence Ms 2, having no analogs among the known consequences DNA and containing the B 1 -similar SINE element, has been isolated and characterized. The unique cluster localization of the repeater Ms 2 in the <b>heterochromatine</b> of the sexual chromosomes, and the primary localization of L 1 Ms 1 and L 1 Mk 1 -elements on sexual chromosomes of the voles of this kin, has been shown. The {{results of the investigation}} shall be used in studying the molecular structures of the <b>heterochromatine</b> and not accidental inactivation of X-chromosomes of the voles, kin MicrotusAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: to examine the Drosophila genome region not earlier characterized. The methods of cytogenetics, genetic {{analysis}} ans blot-hybridization by Sauzern {{have been used in}} the work. For the first time, characterized in details has been the genome region, not studied eariler. 18 genes have been identified and mapped. The indications of the genes position effect have been studied. The distant influence of the <b>heterochromatine</b> on the position effect induction has been shown. The gene of the radiosensitivity of Drosophila has been mapped, which creates the premises for its cloning and molecular analysisAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Described {{have been}} 2 new species, the {{detailed}} cytophotomaps of the politene chromosomes {{of the new}} species and 9 species with the unknown or not sufficiently studied earlier caryotypes have been created. It has been revealed, that such types of the chromosome reconstructions, as the paracentric inversions, the local increase of the centre-dimensional <b>heterochromatine,</b> {{the confluence of the}} separate shoulders of chromosomes play a great role {{in the evolution of the}} chironomids caryotype. A wide spreading of groups of the species-twins in the Chironomus kin has been established. The parallelism of the chromosome evolution in the groups of the close-affined species has been revealed. The obtained results have been used in the chironomids cytotaxonomy, at the ecological biomonitoring of the water reservoirsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructural {{characteristics}} of muscle fibers and neuromuscular contacts were investigated during {{two stages of}} embryogenesis of the pulmonate snail Lymnaeastagnalis. The first muscle cells {{appear as early as}} during metamorphosis (50 – 55 % of embryonic development), whereas previously, in the trochophore/veliger stages (25 – 45 %), muscular elements cannot be detected at all. The first muscle fibers contain large amounts of free numbers, a well-developed rER system and only a few irregularly arranged contractile elements. The nucleus is densely packed with <b>heterochromatine</b> material. At 75 % adult-like postmetamorphic stage, the frequency of muscle fibers increases significantly, but, bundles of muscle fibers cannot yet be observed. Furthermore the muscle cells are characterized by large numbers of free ribosomes and numerous rER elements. Fine axon bundles and single axon processes, both accompanied by glial elements, can already be found at this time. Axon varicosities with different vesicle and/or granule contents form membrane contacts with muscle fibers, but without revealing membrane specialization on the pre- or postsynaptic side. The late development of the muscle system and neuromuscular contacts during Lymnaea embryogenesis correlates well with the maturation of different forms of behavior of adult, free-living life, and also with the peripheral appearance of chemically identified components of the embryonic nervous system of central origin...|$|E
40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acids are 18 carbones {{fatty acids}} members comprising a consecutive (conjugated) double bonds {{system with a}} various cis/trans geometry sequence, giving rise to at least 16 different isomers. Among those, the t 10,c 12 isomer {{has been reported to}} have anti-obesity properties. We evaluated the biological response of human primary adipose tissue cultured adipocytes to that CLA isomer, alone or present in a commercial mixture, using system biology approaches (primarily transcriptomics and metabolomics). We found that CLA changed the biological activity of at least 45 metabolic pathways at the genomic level, which transcriptional activities was associated to a parallelle metabolome adipocyte change (lipidome upmost) (r 2 value transcriptome/ metabolome of 0. 89). In pairwise analysis, it appeared that 6 of these pathways at the genomic level were tightly associated to the metabolomic response, such as apoptosis, interleukine- 6, proteasome, reticulum endoplasmic stress, transcription role of <b>heterochromatine,</b> cell proliferation through EGFR dependent tyrosine kinase, gamma-aminobutyrate receptor. This latter exhibited the most tightly relationship with the metabolome variations in multivariated analysis. One may infer that this pathway is the most targeted by CLA treatment. In conclusion, the implementation of a multi-omic global approach allowed the identification of a set of biological pathways at the genomic level associated to the metabolic balance of CLA-treated adipocytes. All of these pathways are related to insulin-resistance, metabolic syndrome and adipogenesis...|$|E
