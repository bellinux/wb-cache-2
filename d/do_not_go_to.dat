500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E
500|$|Branded to Kill was {{released}} to Japanese theatres on June 15, 1967, {{in a double}} bill with Nishimura Shōgorō's Burning Nature. The films were financially unsuccessful and the former fared likewise among critics. Kinema Junpo magazine reported that the films [...] "resulted in less than [...] viewers at Asakusa and Shinjuku and about 500 at Yurakucho on the second day." [...] Both Joe Shishido and Yamatoya Atsushi later recounted having seen Branded to Kill in practically empty theatres, the latter on its opening night. Iijima Kōichi, a critic for the film journal Eiga Geijutsu, wrote that [...] "the woman buys a mink coat and thinks only about having sex. The man wants to kill and feels nostalgic about the smell of boiling rice. We cannot help being confused. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> theaters to be puzzled." [...] Nikkatsu Studios had been criticized for catering to rebellious youth audiences, a specialty of contract director Seijun Suzuki, whose films had grown increasingly anarchic through the 1960s. This had earned him a large following but it had also drawn the ire of studio head Kyūsaku Hori. On April 25, 1968, Suzuki received {{a telephone call from}} a company secretary informing him {{that he would not be}} receiving his salary that month. Two of Suzuki's friends met with Hori the next day and were told, [...] "Suzuki's films were incomprehensible, that they did not make any money and that Suzuki might as well give up his career as a director as he would not be making films for any other companies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harvard University {{international}} relations professor Stephen Walt wrote an [...] to his congressman outlining reasons he {{urged him to}} vote against intervention in Syria. [...] Walt's first argument against intervention was that the United States lacks any vital strategic interests in Syria. [...] After acknowledging that Assad government is a [...] "brutal dictatorship," [...] {{he points out that}} this has not bothered previous presidents in the past. [...] Indeed, intervening in Syria could make matters worse and harm US interests by creating a failed state and [...] "igniting a struggle for power among competing sectarian factions," [...] some of which [...] "are deeply hostile to America and sympathetic to al Qaeda... U.S. intervention could help bring some of our worst enemies to power." [...] Walt's second reason is that moral case for intervening in Syria fails to be compelling. [...] Although Syrians are suffering, air strikes would not alter that, but could make things worse. [...] Walt argues that [...] "recent scholarly research on civil wars shows that outside intervention tends to increase civilian killings and doesn't shorten the length of wars." [...] He suggests focusing on helping refugees instead. [...] Third, Walt rebuts the argument {{that it is necessary to}} go to war over Assad's use of chemical weapons, particularly when other regimes that used chemical weapons in the past were not then punished by the United States. [...] Walt argues that [...] "chemical weapons have only been used a handful of times over the past 80 years, mostly because they are less effective than conventional arms in most battlefield situations." [...] Fourth, Walt argues that intervention is not necessary to maintain US credibility because [...] "if we refrain from using force when vital interests are not involved or when doing so would only make things worse, it says nothing about our willingness to use force when it is truly necessary and when it can achieve clear and well-defined objectives." [...] Finally, Walt argues that [...] "wise leaders <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war without robust international and domestic support," [...] which President Obama does not have.|$|E
2500|$|Second, because §206(a)(1)(C) {{says the}} minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, courts have grappled with which hours count as [...] "working". Early cases {{established}} that time traveling to work did not count as work, unless it was controlled by, required by, and {{for the benefit of}} an employer, like traveling through a coal mine. For example, in, Anderson v Mount Clemens Pottery Co a majority of five to two justices held that employees had to be paid for the long walk to work through an employer's Mount Clemens Pottery Co facility. According to Murphy J this time, and time setting up workstations, involved [...] "exertion of a physical nature, controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the employer's benefit." [...] In Armour & Co v Wantock firefighters claimed they should be fully paid while on call at their station for fires. The Supreme Court held that, even though the firefighters could sleep or play cards, because [...] "eadiness to serve may be hired quite as much as service itself" [...] and time waiting on call was [...] "a benefit to the employer". By contrast, in 1992 the Sixth Circuit controversially held that needing to be infrequently available by phone or pager, where movement was not restricted, was not working time. Time spent doing unusual cleaning, for instance showering off toxic substances, does count as working time, and so does time putting on special protective gear. Under §207(e) pay for overtime should be one and a half times the regular pay. In Walling v Helmerich and Payne Inc, the Supreme Court held that an employer's scheme of paying lower wages in the morning, and higher wages in the afternoon, to argue that overtime only needed to be calculated on top of (lower) morning wages was unlawful. Overtime has to be calculated based on the average regular pay. However, in Christensen v Harris County six Supreme Court judges held that police in Harris County, Texas could be forced to use up their accumulated [...] "compensatory time" [...] (allowing time off with full pay) before claiming overtime. Writing for the dissent, Stevens J said the majority had misconstrued §207(o)(2), which requires an [...] "agreement" [...] between employers, unions or employees on the applicable rules, and the Texas police had not agreed. Third, §203(m) allows employers to deduct sums from wages for food or housing that is [...] "customarily furnished" [...] for employees. The Secretary of Labor may determine what counts as fair value. Most problematically, outside states that have banned the practice, they may deduct money from a [...] "tipped employee" [...] for money over the [...] "cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996" [...] – and this was $2.13 per hour. If an employee does not earn enough in tips, the employer must still pay the $7.25 minimum wage. But this means in many states tips <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> workers: tips are taken by employers to subsidize low pay. Under FLSA 1938 §216(b)-(c) the Secretary of State can enforce the law, or individuals can claim on their own behalf. Federal enforcement is rare, so most employees are successful if they are in a labor union. The Consumer Credit Protection Act of 1968 limits deductions or [...] "garnishments" [...] by employers to 25 per cent of wages, though many states are considerably more protective. Finally, under the Portal to Portal Act of 1947, where Congress limited {{the minimum wage}} laws in a range of ways, §254 puts a two-year time limit on enforcing claims, or three years if an employing entity is guilty of a willful violation.|$|E
