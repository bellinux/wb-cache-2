5|$|The first {{documented}} {{trip through}} Chaco Canyon was an 1823 expedition led by New Mexican governor José Antonio Vizcarra when {{the area was}} under Mexican rule. He noted several large ruins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b>|$|E
5|$|High water {{volume in}} wet seasons {{does most of}} the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ecologists {{suspect that}} owls select {{specific}} areas based on prey availability. My {{objective was to}} determine and compare distributions and abundances of Mexican spotted owl prey species' within different vegetation types <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> and mesas of the Manti-LaSal National Forest in Utah. I conducted live-trapping during summer and fall, 1994 - 95. Woodrat species (Neotoma spp.) are the Mexican spotted owls primary prey species as determined by percent biomass. Peromyscus spp. are also {{important in terms of}} frequency. Woodrats were only captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> and were primarily captured within the pinyon (Pinus spp.) - juniper (Juniperus spp.) vegetation type. The Mexican spotted owls in southeastern Utah spend > 75 % of their time within <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> and forage within pinyon-juniper stands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> Maintaining <b>the</b> present state of pinyon-juniper stands within <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> may benefit Mexican spotted owl populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Manti-LaSal National Forest...|$|R

5|$|State Route 16 {{begins in}} Colusa County near Wilbur Springs at the {{junction}} with State Route 20. SR 16 goes south alongside Bear Creek, which enters a narrow canyon and joins with Cache Creek near the Yolo County line. SR 16 continues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> running close to the river, passing Cache Creek Canyon Regional Park, and emerging from the canyon north of Rumsey. This section is so prone to rock slides that there are permanent gates at each end.|$|E
5|$|The black-on-white painted pottery {{found at}} Chaco Canyon {{originated}} from various places throughout the Four Corners region, including the Red Mesa Valley, northeastern Arizona, the San Juan River, and the Chuska Valley, forty miles distant. Whereas {{most of the}} gray ware, non-decorative or utility, pottery uncovered at Puebloan sites was produced locally, {{more than half of}} the vessels found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> were imported from places like the Chuska Valley, which supplied the majority of utility pottery found in the region.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; this results in two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{dendrochronology}} of wood {{samples from}} Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, {{as well as}} an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b> Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{sediment}} transport and deposition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lisbon-Setubal and Cascais submarine canyons, Portuguese continental margin, were investigated {{on the basis}} of water column profiles of suspended particulate matter, records of near-bottom currents and settling fluxes of particulate matter obtained with benthic landers, and analysis of surface sediments. The results show that fine-grained predominantly lithogenic sediment derived from adjacent shelf areas accumulates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper reaches of <b>the</b> <b>canyons.</b> Sediment deposited further down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle and lower reaches of <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> is essentially similar to the hemipelagic sediment found on the adjacent continental slope, indicating that down-canyon transport of sediment from the upper to <b>the</b> lower <b>canyon</b> is limited. Tidal currents measured at various depths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lisbon-Setubal <b>Canyon</b> appear sufficiently strong to resuspend and transport sediment, but net up-canyon flow of the bottom water may retain shelf-derived lithogenic sediment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>canyon.</b> Sediment gravity flows, which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby Nazare <b>Canyon</b> are an effective mechanism for down-canyon {{sediment transport}}, appear rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lisbon-Setubal <b>Canyon</b> and probably also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cascais <b>Canyon.</b> Turbidity current events recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sedimentary record of <b>the</b> <b>canyons</b> may correspond to seismic events of 1969 and 1755 AD...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Titus <b>Canyon</b> Formation is an Eocene {{geologic}} formation in California. H. Donald Curry collected the type specimens {{of the three}} teleosts Fundulus curryi, Fundulus euepis, and Cyprinodon breviradius <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Titus <b>Canyon</b> Formation. Both of these genera are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Titus <b>Canyon</b> Formation sediments of Death Valley National Park.|$|R
5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division to slow down flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> from storm and landslide damage.|$|E
5|$|Red wares were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery was fired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> but was instead produced in outlying communities {{with access to}} {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{continue}} to debate whether Chacoan organization {{was based on}} primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its function as the region's ceremonial center. Because there has been little to no modern excavation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> the question remains largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both.|$|E

5|$|The McElmo Phase was {{a period}} in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, when major changes in {{ceramics}} and masonry techniques appeared in Chaco Canyon. Chacoans started using painted black-on-white pottery, and the masonry and layout of great houses built during the period, which was the last major construction era <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon,</b> differs significantly from those built during the Bonito Phase (850 to 1140). Archeologists initially believed that the McElmo style was brought to Chaco Canyon by immigrants from Mesa Verde, but subsequent research suggests the developments were of local origin. McElmo black-on-white pottery was abundant in later contexts at Chetro Ketl, and the problematic McElmo style masonry was used in several later additions to the building, including very characteristic Chaco-style kivas.|$|E
5|$|The meticulously {{designed}} buildings composing {{the larger}} Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers {{have concluded that}} the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies. Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the great houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this allowed alignment with several other key structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The region's {{precipitation}} pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. The climate is semi-arid. Water for farming and consumption {{was provided by}} summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5°C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced {{the amount of water}} needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>canyon</b> alcoves than {{on the top of the}} mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings.|$|E
