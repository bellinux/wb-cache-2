5000|$|The {{paper is}} based on {{research}} of wall hangings and posters on purity in the period from 1900 to 2015 in {{the territory of the}} Republic of Croatia, tracking the figure of woman as a symbol, bearer of promotion and implementer of purity in the house, in institutions and in the country. Along with the research of wall hangings and posters, the doctoral thesis encompasses a review of research of other artists whose works offer a diversity of approaches and concepts on the subject of purity. They are ordered by proximity of the subject and display to the artwork of the Clean & Wrong doctorate. The Clean & Wrong artwork is explained through a description of the conception of the exhibition and the technical description that questions the meaning of purity and human touch in everyday life.The basic questions asked within this research are the ways purity <b>is</b> <b>promoted,</b> <b>under</b> what circumstances and in what circles, who is addressed, and what knowledge and meaning of the concept of clean an individual receives. The study follows the visualization of purity on house walls through wall hangings found within, and in institutions and the country through posters. The author is interested in the role of such a wall as a transmitter of promotion, and what static media such as wall hangings and posters transmit regarding the privacy and purity that accompanies the role of a woman. Both on the wall hangings and posters the female character shows her skills to the observer - convincing him. In artwork, on the other hand, the female figure exists independently of the observer, not offering the necessary solution to the problem in which she is found. The female character is absent within a messy enclosed private space, which visitors discover through their presence - touch, in the Clean & Wrong artwork.|$|E

Through this analysis, the study results in that U-City focuses practical implementation in domestic cities while Smart City focuses technological development and provision of single service.

40|$|Theories and {{empirical}} evidence suggest that random dispersal of organisms promotes species coexistence in spatially structured environments. However, directed dispersal, where movement is adjusted with fitness-related cues, is less explored {{in studies of}} dispersal-mediated coexistence. Here, we present a metacommunity model of two consumers exhibiting directed dispersal and competing for a single resource. Our results indicated that directed dispersal promotes coexistence through two distinct mechanisms, depending on the adaptiveness of dispersal. Maladaptive directed dispersal may promote coexistence similar to random dispersal. More importantly, directed dispersal is adaptive when dispersers track patches of increased resources in fluctuating environments. Coexistence <b>is</b> <b>promoted</b> <b>under</b> increased adaptive dispersal ability of the inferior competitor relative to the superior competitor. This newly described dispersal-mediated coexistence mechanism is likely favored by natural selection under the trade-off between competitive and adaptive dispersal abilities...|$|E
