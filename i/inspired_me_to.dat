5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day {{and told me he}} was going to build a studio," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with the Daily Mail. [...] "The title is a tribute to his vision. He had a plan and he saw it through. That was a real eye-opener for me. It <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> dig out my old Marvin Gaye albums and start writing songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Cuomo remarked, [...] "I {{came out}} of it pretty angry. But ironically, it <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write another song." [...] Jacknife Lee {{produced}} the track with the band in early 2008 in what was the third and final recording session for the album. The many references to popular culture in the song are said to be a [...] "statement of defiance" [...] according to Internet reviewer David Ritter, who later describes it to be an [...] "anti-anthem anthem" [...] that opens up a [...] "broad space for critical exploration {{of what it means to}} be an [...] aging band in the major label system".|$|E

500|$|In 2005 Black {{released}} Drinkin' Songs and Other Logic. [...] Black {{chose the}} title of the album to limit himself to simple topics in his past. He explained: [...] "I went out and bought all the music I grew up on that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Lupo the Butcher was a {{successful}} short and has earned itself a cult following. Eric Fogel, co-creator of Glenn Martin, DDS, stated that Lupo the Butcher inspired him {{to pursue a career}} in animation, saying: [...] "That film opened my eyes to a world of animation that was strictly for grownups and <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pursue a career path that was a bit more…twisted." [...] In an interview with Take One, Linda Simensky called the short [...] "the South Park of its time" [...] and stated that she remembers tapes containing the short being passed around her office in 1988. It was featured in Spike and Mike's book Outlaw Animation, written by Jerry Beck, and in the Spike and Mike DVD.|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E
5000|$|I am {{sure that}} it will give rise to {{valuable}} critical observations which will both <b>inspire</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> future creative work and provide insights enabling <b>me</b> <b>to</b> review that which I have created in the past.

500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] I like it though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and things like that.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{she opened}} a Spa which {{exclusively}} employs the visually challenged. It is called Shree Spa, and is located in Mumbai. Saran has said [...] "When I studied in DPS Mathura Road in Delhi, there was a school for blind exactly opposite to our school. I used to go there every week and spend time seeing how these students played cricket and did other things normally. That is what <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do something for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's {{important to understand that}} you are not doing a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E
500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just hope you do your best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

From a fashion perspective, Rowland credits her grandmother, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Oprah as her style icons. Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, and Brandy as vocal inspirations for her second solo album Ms. Kelly, [...] "I love how different they are. I love how they take themselves to the next level". Her third solo album Here I Am was inspired by Donna Summer and Diana Ross, as well as dance producers David Guetta and will.i.am. Rowland's fourth solo album Talk a Good Game was also inspired by Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder.|$|E

500|$|Miličević is a classically trained {{musician}} {{who began his}} musical education {{at a very early}} age, playing the violin. During his youth, he had been influenced by jazz and classical music, listening to performers such as Stéphane Grappelli, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucía, and Al Di Meola. His own ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around Detroit, were crucial in the formation of Miličević as a musician. He developed his interest in guitar from the moment he was introduced to heavy metal music, becoming a devoted fan of bands such as Pantera, Metallica, and Slayer. When he started writing his own music, Miličević regarded Pantera's album Vulgar Display of Power as a particularly influential record. He was further drawn into guitar when he realized the [...] "genius" [...] of emotions and passions which characterizes the common songwriting of rock music. Miličević explained, [...] "All of the music that I have ever listened to, in some shape or form, has <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do music". He grew up listening to progressive rock and blues artists, citing Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. His major influences also include alternative rock bands such as Nirvana and The Smashing Pumpkins. He is inspired by electronic music, including The Cure and Depeche Mode.|$|E

500|$|Frusciante {{developed}} serious drug habits while touring {{with the}} band during the previous four years. He {{said that when he}} [...] "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a pothead". Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, but he began to use heroin and {{was on the verge of}} full-scale addiction. Upon returning to California in the summer of 1992, Frusciante entered a deep depression, feeling that his life was over and that he could no longer write music or play guitar. For a long time, he focused on painting, producing 4-track recordings he had made while working on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and writing short stories and screenplays. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante increased his heroin use and spiraled into a life-threatening dependency. His use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: [...] "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty—I was always really proud to be an addict." [...] Frusciante openly admitted to being a [...] "junkie", believing that drugs were the only way of [...] "making sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script <b>inspired</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. Simon said, [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

Bill Paxton, {{the director of the}} former film, said, [...] "I was excited when Bill Butler who was the cinematographer on such classic films as Jaws and The Conversation came aboard as my director of photography for Frailty. And I really picked his brain, always asking 'how did you do this shot?' and 'how did you figure that out?'"
