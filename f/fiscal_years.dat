At this point, it was clear that nurses could not be trained quickly enough to keep abreast of both civilian and military needs.

5|$|The {{swearing}} in of Romney as the 70th {{governor of}} Massachusetts {{took place on}} January 2, 2003. He faced a Massachusetts state legislature with large Democratic majorities in both houses, and had picked his cabinet and advisors based more on managerial abilities than partisan affiliation. He declined a governor's salary of $135,000 during his term. Upon entering office {{in the middle of}} a fiscal year, he faced an immediate $650million shortfall and a projected $3billion deficit for the next year. Unexpected revenue of $1.0–1.3billion from a previously enacted capital gains tax increase and $500million in new federal grants decreased the deficit to $1.2–1.5billion. Through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and removal of corporate tax loopholes, the state achieved surpluses of around $600–700million during Romney's last two full <b>fiscal</b> <b>years</b> in office, although it began running deficits again after that.|$|E
