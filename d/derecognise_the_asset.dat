40|$|The {{issuance}} of Brazilian Law 11. 638 / 2007 {{is a critical}} step in the convergence of the Brazilian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs) towards International Financial Reporting Standards. After the law was implemented and later modified by Provisional Executive Order 449 / 2008 (converted into Law 11. 941 / 2009), certain accounting choices were allowed during the transition period. The Brazilian GAAPs allowed for restructuring costs and costs related to opening a new facility to be recognised as assets. As a transitional provision, companies were allowed to choose between maintaining or eliminating these values. In this paper, we attempted to identify which company characteristics were associated with this accounting choice. The final sample consisted of Brazilian companies listed on the BM & FBOVESPA, and a logistic regression identified two characteristics. Participation {{in one of the}} three different corporate governance levels of the BM & FBOVESPA was associated with <b>the</b> choice to <b>derecognise</b> <b>the</b> deferred <b>assets,</b> while companies decided to maintain <b>the</b> deferred <b>asset</b> if it was relatively large. The empirical evidence reported here contributes to the literature by explaining the manner in which a set of firm characteristics is related to a firm's accounting choices...|$|R

He continued to maintain an official status as the Rajpramukh ("ruling head") of Hyderabad State until the position was abolished in 1956. At his death in 1967, he was succeeded by his grandson as the last officially recognised Nizam of Hyderabad. In 1971, the Indian government officially <b>derecognised</b> <b>the</b> dynasty, revoking its official status.|$|R

Just prior to Indian independence in 1947, the Persian Gulf Residency was likewise transferred to Foreign Office control, remaining in existence until the Trucial States became fully independent in December 1971, forming the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in early 1972.|$|R

50|$|After the Second World War, {{in light}} of the mass murder of Belgian Jews during The Holocaust, the anti-semitic {{elements}} of the cult were de-emphasised. In 1968, in the wake of Nostra aetate issued by the Second Vatican Council, the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels officially <b>derecognised</b> <b>the</b> cult. In 1977 Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens installed a plaque in the cathedral to highlight this. On November 16, 2006 at the inauguration of the exhibit Menorah in the Cathedral by Jean Paul Leon presented by the Jewish Museum of Belgium, Monsignor De Kesel addressed the attendees and Albert Guigui as Chief Rabbi of the Great Synagogue of Europe and apologised for the commemoration of the Brussels massacre on the windows of the Cathedral.

50|$|As per {{the terms}} of accession, the {{erstwhile}} Indian princes received privy purses (government allowances), and initially retained their statuses, privileges, and autonomy in internal matters during a transitional period which lasted until 1956. During this time, the former princely states were merged into unions, each of which was headed by a former ruling prince with the title of Rajpramukh (ruling chief), equivalent to a state governor. In 1956, the position of Rajpramukh was abolished and the federations dissolved, the former principalities becoming part of Indian states. The states which acceded to Pakistan retained their status until the promulgation of a new constitution in 1956, when most {{became part of the}} province of West Pakistan; a few of the former states retained their autonomy until 1969 when they were fully integrated into Pakistan. The Indian Government formally <b>derecognised</b> <b>the</b> princely families in 1971, followed by the Government of Pakistan in 1972.|$|R

Although the Union later agreed to hold elections, the Union members felt that their religious beliefs prevented them from being able to make any more concessions. The Guild stated that they believed the law prevented them from accommodating the society, as student unions are required to make all of their activities available to all students.

[...] Other members {{of the extended family}} also filed their own claims to various properties in Bhopal, resulting in several ongoing disputes. In 2000, the Bhopal district court issued a ruling which affirmed the Government of India's previous recognition of Sajida Sultan as Nawab Begum of Bhopal over her elder sister Abida Sultan. Abida Sultan herself died in Pakistan two years later, but her son and heir Shahryar Khan declined to assert any claims to the family headship or to any properties in Bhopal.|$|R

Contrary to this standard result, I find that when the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> owner and <b>the</b> encroacher is infinitely repeated and the encroacher has some bargaining power over {{the size of the}} transfer from <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> owner to him, then there is a cooperative equilibrium in which <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> owner finds it optimal to over-invest in <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> when property rights are incomplete relative to the first-best level of investment when property rights are complete.

5000|$|Assuming {{that the}} CAPM is correct, an asset is {{correctly}} priced when its estimated price {{is the same}} as the present value of future cash flows of <b>the</b> <b>asset,</b> discounted at <b>the</b> rate suggested by CAPM.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model where the {{coexistence}} {{of money and}} a higher yielding asset is endogenously obtained when no restriction {{is placed on the}} use of either object as a medium of exchange. Due to the presence of uninsurable risks, agents have, in equilibrium, di⁄erent relative valuations of <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> to money, and hence, the use of money as a means of payment is strictly preferred. This endogenous di⁄erence in the willingness of agents to use money over <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> implies that money carries a greater liquidity premium than <b>the</b> <b>asset.</b> We obtain that <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> strictly dominates money in terms of the expected rate of return, except at the Friedman rule. Since buyers are risk neutral with respect to the dividend payment of <b>the</b> <b>asset,</b> they hold both <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> and money despite the rate of return dominance of asset to money. We obtain that for low levels of ination the price of <b>the</b> <b>asset,</b> and therefore its real rate of return, is not a⁄ected by the rate of ination. This is because <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is not used as a means of payment, only money is, and the price of <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is given by its fundamental value. But when the ination rate becomes large enough, real balances are so low that buyers will then start using <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> as a means of payment in addition to money, and here, <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> will carry a liquidity premium as well, although it is smaller than that of money. The price of <b>the</b> <b>asset</b> is then increasing in the ination rate, and its real rate of return is therefore negatively correlated with the ination rate...|$|R
