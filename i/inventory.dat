5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an <b>inventory</b> system. There are several {{components of the}} <b>inventory,</b> including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the <b>inventory,</b> spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the <b>inventory</b> once they have been acquired. The player can access the <b>inventory</b> by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the <b>inventory,</b> and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each <b>inventory</b> item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main <b>inventory</b> screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the <b>inventory</b> management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new <b>inventory</b> system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the <b>inventory</b> needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various <b>inventory</b> systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment. To advance through the game, the player must explore a mansion and its surrounding areas while avoiding, outsmarting and defeating monsters like zombies, undead dogs, and giant spiders. The player can open doors, push certain objects, climb obstacles, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an <b>inventory</b> that the player can access at any time. Items in the <b>inventory</b> can be used, examined, and combined to solve puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The <b>inventory</b> is limited to a certain number of slots, and the player must often move items from the <b>inventory</b> to storage boxes located in certain areas to manage space.|$|E

This paper outlines the development and validation of guided <b>inventories</b> called the Newcastle Reflective <b>Inventories</b> and the validation of the Newcastle Reflective Analysis Tool as an effective tool for assessing short-form guided reflective writing. Method: The Newcastle Reflective <b>Inventories</b> consist of a series of questions that guides the user through the reflective writing process. Validation of the Newcastle Reflective <b>Inventories</b> involved comparing the evidence of reflection in 14 freeform journals to that of 14 <b>inventories</b> completed on the same topic. Validation of the Newcastle Reflective Analysis Tool included the assessment of 30 Newcastle Reflective <b>Inventories.</b> Results: There was a highly statistically significant difference (p < 0. 001) in the high levels of reflection evident in the <b>inventories</b> when compared to the lower levels of reflection in the freeform journals. Good levels of agreement were achieved between the coders. Discussion: These results show that the Newcastle Reflective <b>Inventories</b> are effective tools in promoting reflective writing when compared with freeform journaling...|$|R
