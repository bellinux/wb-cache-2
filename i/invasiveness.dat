5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, <b>invasiveness,</b> availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{gentamicin}} protection assay {{is commonly}} used in pathogen research. The contribution of specific genes or proteins to the bacteria's ability to invade cells can be easily assayed using this method. The gene in question can be knocked out, and the bacteria's <b>invasiveness</b> {{compared with that of}} normal, wild type bacteria. Environmental conditions, such as pH level and temperature, can also be assayed for their effect on <b>invasiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{procedures}} are commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of <b>invasiveness,</b> and special instrumentation.|$|E

25|$|Appearance and {{location}} of the tumor is enough to identify it as a mammary tumor. Biopsy will give type and <b>invasiveness</b> of the tumor. In addition, newer studies showed that certain gene expression patterns are associated with malignant behaviour of canine mammary tumors.|$|E
25|$|By {{degree of}} <b>invasiveness</b> of {{surgical}} procedures: Minimally-invasive surgery involves smaller outer incision(s) to insert miniaturized instruments within a body cavity or structure, as in laparoscopic surgery or angioplasty. By contrast, an open surgical procedure {{such as a}} laparotomy requires a large incision to access the area of interest.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic or genetically {{modified}} organisms, be they bacteria, viruses or fungi, serve {{all kinds of}} research purposes. Transgenic plants, insects, fish and mammals have been bred. Transgenic plants such as corn and soybean have replaced wild strains in agriculture in some countries (e.g. the United States). Transgene escape has been documented for GMO crops since 2001 with persistence and <b>invasiveness.</b> Transgenetic organisms pose ethical questions and may cause biosafety problems.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of existing randomized controlled trials {{came to the}} result {{that there is no}} evidence of a beneficial effect of PGP as measured by live birth rate. On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGP significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the <b>invasiveness</b> of the biopsy, and chromosomal mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGP.|$|E
25|$|Budding is a {{major factor}} {{underlying}} the <b>invasiveness</b> of pharaoh ants. A single seed colony can populate a large office block, almost to the exclusion of all other insect pests, in less than six months. Elimination and control are difficult because multiple colonies can consolidate into smaller colonies during extermination programs only to repopulate later. Pharaoh ants are a major hazard in hospitals, where their small size means they can access wounds and medical instruments, causing the spread of infection and electrical interference.|$|E
25|$|Electrocorticography (ECoG) {{measures}} the electrical {{activity of the}} brain taken from beneath the skull {{in a similar way}} to non-invasive electroencephalography (see below), but the electrodes are embedded in a thin plastic pad that is placed above the cortex, beneath the dura mater. ECoG technologies were first trialled in humans in 2004 by Eric Leuthardt and Daniel Moran from Washington University in St Louis. In a later trial, the researchers enabled a teenage boy to play Space Invaders using his ECoG implant. This research indicates that control is rapid, requires minimal training, and may be an ideal tradeoff with regards to signal fidelity and level of <b>invasiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Preimplantation genetic {{screening}} (PGS) or {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} (PGD) has been suggested {{to be able to}} be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomised controlled trials came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by live birth rate. On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the <b>invasiveness</b> of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.|$|E
25|$|The {{stage of}} the breast cancer is the most {{important}} component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the <b>invasiveness</b> of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10-year disease free survival of about 98%.|$|E
25|$|When Japan started slowly {{opening up}} {{to the rest of}} the world in the mid 19th century, Satsuma was one of the first domains to embrace Western culture and methods. However, tension quickly grew between the {{increasing}} <b>invasiveness</b> of Westerners in southern Japan. When the Namamugi Incident of September 14, 1862 occurred, political and ideological differences between the United Kingdom and Satsuma Province sparked outrage and quickly boiled into the Anglo-Satsuma War. Satsuma would ultimately lose, leaving way to increasing dissatisfaction with the Tokugawan government. The Meiji government would then take its place after the Tokugawan government was overthrown in the Boshin War. However, corruption in the Meiji government, in which it originally helped establish, would then give birth to the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. Despite their numbers, the Satsuma Domain was rapidly overpowered, and its defeat eventually resulted in the end of its dominance in Japan's southern sphere. The Satsugū dialect, which had a predominant role in samurai affairs and equally the police hierarchy system throughout Japan, steadily declined in influence following this defeat.|$|E

500|$|Citing {{from both}} {{pornography}} and literature—including The Kreutzer Sonata, Madame Bovary, and Dracula—Dworkin argued that depictions of intercourse in mainstream {{art and culture}} consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as {{the only kind of}} [...] "real" [...] sex, portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms, portrayed the violence or <b>invasiveness</b> as central to its eroticism, and often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the [...] "carnal" [...] woman. She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of [...] "occupation" [...] that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women.|$|E
500|$|Sociocultural {{changes in}} post-September 11 America, {{including}} a resurgent tribalism and the [...] "infantilization of society", first {{appeared as a}} prominent motif in Gibson's thought with Pattern Recognition. Gibson interpreted the attacks as a nodal point, [...] "an experience out of culture" [...] which irrevocably {{changed the course of}} history and marked [...] "the true beginning of the 21st century." [...] After crafting 100 pages of that novel, he was compelled to re-write the main character's backstory, which the attacks had suddenly rendered implausible; this he called [...] "the strangest experience I've ever had with a piece of fiction." [...] The result saw Gibson noted {{as one of the first}} novelists to use the attacks to inform their writing. Nathan Lee in The Village Voice advanced the notion that while Pattern Recognition [...] focused to an extent on [...] "specifying the ambient sense of <b>invasiveness</b> in all aspects of life after the collapse of the towers", Spook Country accepted that anxiety as a premise, and was thus [...] "the more reflective, less unnerving of the two novels".|$|E

5000|$|One {{particular}} {{study conducted}} by Robert I. Colautti et al. (2006), proposes that propagule pressure should act as a null model for studies that consider/compare processes of invasions to patterns of invasions. This study was a meta-analysis studying the characteristics of <b>invasiveness</b> and invasibility. The group researched the impact of thirteen <b>invasiveness</b> characteristics, and seven invasibility characteristics. Of the <b>invasiveness</b> characteristics studied, most did not significantly correlate to establishment, spread, abundance or impact of nonindigenous species. Propagule pressure, however, was {{shown to be a}} key contributor to both <b>invasiveness</b> and invasibility. This study found there was a positive association between establishment and propagule pressure. In regards to predicting invasions, it was found that propagule pressure was significantly associated with invasion successes and of the inclination of a habitat to be invaded. Of the thirteen other <b>invasiveness</b> characteristics studied, only three were significantly (positively or negatively) associated with <b>invasiveness.</b> Likewise, only two of the other six invasibility characteristics were shown to be significant. The communities that experienced more disturbances and resource availability achieved higher establishment and abundance of invaders.|$|E
