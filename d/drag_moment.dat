The signature of the large-scale motion is elongated local maximum of streamwise velocity. It is also found that these structures contribute substantially to both of the Reynolds Stress (RS) and the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE). The entrainment of bed gravels is investigated by the three-dimensional analysis of the relationship between near-wall coherent structures and the force moments exerted on the particles.

40|$|This paper applies a {{reinforcement}} learning methodology {{to the problem}} of airfoil morph-ing. Reinforcement learning, as it is applied to morphing, is integrated with a computational model of an airfoil. The computational model uses a doublet panel method, the end yield of which is airfoil lift, <b>drag,</b> and <b>moment</b> coefficients. An episodic unsupervised learning simulation using the Q-learning method is developed to learn the optimal shape and shape change policy. Optimality is addressed by reward functions based on airfoil properties such as lift coefficient, <b>drag</b> coefficient, and <b>moment</b> coefficient about the leading edge represent-ing optimal shapes for specified flight conditions. The methodology is demonstrated with numerical examples of a NACA type airfoil that autonomously morphs in two degrees of freedom, thickness and camber, to a shape that corresponds to specified goal requirements. Given the nature of the problem and the possibility of there being many shapes that satisfy the lift, <b>drag,</b> or <b>moment</b> coefficient requirements, the results presented in this paper show that this methodology is capable of learning the range of acceptable shapes for a given set of requirementes and morphing into one.

The lift, <b>drag</b> and <b>moments</b> about the span axis are so greatly altered by the rapid rotation in a flat spin, that they can no longer be regarded as independent of rotation.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{gives an}} unified {{formalism}} that encompasses {{the two most}} common mesh adaptation strategies: Hessian-based and goal-oriented. The first one {{is based on the}} control of the interpolation error of a solution field. The second one relies on the control of the approximation error of a scalar-output functional. Both of them have been widely used in aeronautics and derived in an anisotropic context by using a metric-based approach. If Hessian-based mesh adaptation is completely generic, it does not account for discretization error of the PDE at hand, contrary to the goal-oriented approach. The scope {{of this paper is to}} extend metric-based mesh adaptation to control a norm of the approximation error. This allows us to control simultaneously multiple functionals of interest as lift, <b>drag,</b> <b>moment,</b> without the need to solve multiple adjoint states. The procedure is based on the derivation of a corrector term that is then used as a functional for adjoint based-mesh adaptation. The estimate is derived within the continuous mesh framework, yielding naturally a fully anisotropic estimate...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} the {{equations}} of motion for a spinning ballistic projectile. The goal of such an examination {{is to determine the}} possible mechanisms by which a directed energy weapon may induce sufficient instability as to significantly alter the projectile's flight path. A ballistic projectile is generally launched with a "fire and forget" philosophy. The desired impact point is determined before firing. It may be possible to alter the projectile {{in such a way that}} it fails to follow the desired trajectory thereby missing the intended target. Several variables appear to be worthy of investigation to assess their contribution to a required instability or range reduction. Skin friction drag may be increased from surface roughness generated by a pulsed energy source. The results that this thesis will examine include: impulse generated by the laser interaction, additional Magnus effects and aerodynamic <b>drag.</b> <b>Moment</b> induced instability may also result from these in the form of a Magnus moment or drag torque. Increasing the drag force appears to be the most promising theoretical solution to defeating an incoming spinning ballistic projectile. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} and resuspension of nanoparticles {{is important}} in applications ranging from semiconductor manufacturing to pollution management. The objective of this work is to understand the effect of particle size on re-entrainment of nanometer scale particles. One of the major contributions {{is to reduce the}} randomness introduced in past measurements on resuspension by controlling humidity, temperature, material and the distribution of shape and particle sizes. In the process of studying particle size, the effect of surface roughness was also found. Measurements of the detachment fraction of carbon particles as a function of flow rate show three distinct regimes that we attribute to the dominance of drag, energy accumulation by particles, and collision and agglomeration respectively. Experiments with silica nanoparticles on silica microspheres show the detachment fraction to increase non-linearly with particle diameter and to decrease with the substrate diameter. We attribute the former to the dominance of the <b>drag</b> <b>moment</b> over the adhesive moment. We attribute the influence of the substrates to the surface roughness being comparable {{to the size of the}} nanoparticles.

Faithful reproductions {{of the ice}} shapes were cast in silicone rubber from which wind tunnel models were made. They were tested using a specifically designed wind tunnel rig which measured the aerodynamic lift, drag and pitching moment of the models. From the aerodynamic data the gradients of lift, drag and pitching moment of each ice shape were calculated. The aerodynamic data were consequently used in a two-dimensional two degree of freedom theoretical aerodynamic model which included aerodynamic lift, <b>drag,</b> <b>moment,</b> ice eccentricity, conductor wake effects and the mechanical properties of the conductor. Wind tunnel tests were carried out on a specifically designed wind tunnel dynamic rig. Instabilities of the coupled vertical/torsional galloping were established. Regions of instability were also predicted using a two-dimensional theoretical conductor model. The initial theoretical analysis formed the basis upon which a more sophisticated three-dimensional finite element aeroelastic model was developed. The effects of ice and wind on the natural frequencies and {{the stability of the}} conductor were investigated. The use of galloping control devices, the pendulum detuners was also examined. Results showed that the pendulums had a stabilising effect in controlling the vertical/torsional frequency ratio of twin bundles. The vibration characteristics and the stability of quad bundles were investigated using finite elements. In this case, the pendulums shifted the torsional frequencies of the bundle to higher values close to the corresponding vertical frequencies, thus enhancing coupling and having an adverse effect on stability. Finally, limitations in the performance of the pendulum detuners were predicted...|$|E
40|$|The Micro Air Vehicle has a {{very small}} {{wingspan}} and low aspect ratio wing which operates at low Reynolds numbers. It flies in an environment which provides random turbulent gusts which exceed the size and energy of the MAV regularly, especially in built-up areas and forests, as discussed by Roth [1]. This means that stability and gust resistance is a key design point for the vehicle and should be maximised where possible to aid controllability and increase flight envelope. In this paper, comparisons between lift, <b>drag,</b> <b>moment</b> and angle of attack are {{used to determine the}} overall performance and static stability of the aircraft. The dynamic stability and controllability of the aircraft is investigated through flight testing, which is filmed for post-analysis. The 3 D flow structure and aerodynamic forces are analysed using computational fluid dynamics, utilising Komega SST modelling to solve the RANS equations on a finite-volume multi-block mesh. In an attempt to improve the stability performance of the vehicle, vortex generating vanes are added to the upper wing surface near the leading edge. The effect of these is analysed using the above method to determine their effect on the performance of the MAV, specifically whether they increase Cl and high-α stability. It was found that vortex generators greatly increase the max Cl and stall-α of the MAV with negligible increase in cruise drag, and also increase the static stability at high-α. It is found that for the MAV, the largest contributing factor to instability is inaccurate centre of gravity (CG) placement, in particular having the CG too far aft...|$|E
