5|$|Because the Columbia was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> connecting the Columbia with the Missouri. When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in {{preprocessing}} is conventionally slice timing correction. The MR scanner acquires different slices within a single brain volume at different times, and hence the slices represent brain activity at different timepoints. Since this complicates later analysis, a timing correction is applied to bring all slices to the same timepoint reference. This is done by assuming the timecourse of a voxel is smooth when plotted as a <b>dotted</b> <b>line.</b> Hence the voxel's intensity value at other times not in the sampled frames can be calculated by filling in the dots to create a continuous curve.|$|E

25|$|Toyota is a Japanese {{brand of}} {{automobiles}} that was exclusively distributed by Delta Motor Corporation, owned by former Bulacan congressman and Marcos crony Ricardo Silverio, Sr. The team was first {{known as the}} Komatsu Komets in the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA), {{one of the more}} successful teams of the amateur commercial league prior to the inception of the PBA. Sometime in January 1975, five MICAA teams met together at the old Elizalde canteen to sign a pre-organizational agreement for the formation of what is now known as the Philippine Basketball Association. Dante Silverio, Ricardo Silverio’s nephew, was the official representative of Toyota who signed on the <b>dotted</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the Ptolemaic system, each {{planet is}} moved {{by a system}} of two spheres: one called its deferent; the other, its epicycle. The deferent is a circle whose center point, called the {{eccentric}} and marked in the diagram with an X, {{is removed from the}} Earth. The original purpose of the eccentric was to account for the differences of the lengths of the seasons (autumn is the shortest by a week or so), by placing the Earth away from the center of rotation {{of the rest of the}} universe. Another sphere, the epicycle, is embedded inside the deferent sphere and is represented by the smaller <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> to the right. A given planet then moves around the epicycle at the same time the epicycle moves along the path marked by the deferent. These combined movements cause the given planet to move closer to and further away from the Earth at different points in its orbit, and explained the observation that planets slowed down, stopped, and moved backward in retrograde motion, and then again reversed to resume normal, or prograde, motion.|$|E
500|$|After {{the closure}} of Looking Glass, certain {{employees}} of that company moved to developer Mad Doc Software, and they hoped to complete Jane's Attack Squadron. The game's original lead designer and lead programmer were among those hired by Mad Doc. <b>Dotted</b> <b>Line</b> Entertainment, Mad Doc's agent company, secured {{the rights to the}} game's code for the team in 2001. Development commenced shortly afterward. In August of that year, it was reported that the Jane's Information Group license had been obtained by Xicat Interactive, and that the company planned to publish Mad Doc's revival of Jane's Attack Squadron. The full details of the agreement were announced at that year's European Computer Trade Show, where it was revealed that Jane's Attack Squadron would focus heavily on air-to-ground combat. According to Mad Doc's Tim Farrar, [...] "Our goal wasn't to create a completely new game, it was to complete the game that was started at LG." [...] Farrar noted that, although the company [...] "trimmed some of the more ambitious features", Jane's Attack Squadron was effectively [...] "the same game" [...] created by Looking Glass. As with Flight Combat, the game features one million square miles of terrain, planes with individually modelled moving parts and a physics-based damage system.|$|E

500|$|Proposals for the South Beltline Freeway {{were nearly}} 25years old {{by the time}} initial {{construction}} was started in 1997. The Michigan State Legislature named the South Beltline {{around the same time}} for the Congressman Paul B. Henry, who died in office in 1993, serving in Gerald Ford's old US House seat. The cost of the construction of new roads like the South Beltline was a campaign issue when Engler ran for re-election against Geoffrey Feiger in 1998. The entire freeway was projected to open by 2008, with the first phase opening in 2002. MDOT gave the South Beltline its numerical designation on the July 1999 edition of the state map, marking M-6 {{for the first time as}} a <b>dotted</b> <b>line,</b> to denote it was [...] "under construction". The legislature approved Engler's [...] "Build Michigan III" [...] program in 2000; the plan accelerated road projects in the state. The capital outlay for the year was $82 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ). [...] Condemnation proceedings were initiated in the Kent County Circuit Court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions. Land that contained homes, farms, trailer parks, and businesses was purchased by MDOT to acquire the right-of-way needed for the freeway. The land needed measured [...] wide and [...] long. Land acquisitions for the South Beltline Freeway were completed in July 2001. Construction started later in the fall of 2001 on the second and third phases of the project.|$|E

2500|$|Figure 6 shows a graph of the alpha-type Stirling engine data, where 'Q' denotes heat energy, and 'W' denotes work energy. [...] The blue <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> {{shows the}} work {{output of the}} {{compression}} space. As the trace dips down, work is done on the gas as it is compressed. [...] During the expansion process of the cycle, some work is actually done on the compression piston, as reflected by the upward movement of the trace. At {{the end of the}} cycle, this value is negative, indicating that compression piston requires a net input of work. The blue solid line shows the heat flowing out of the cooler heat exchanger. The heat from the cooler and the work from the compression piston have the same cycle energy. This is consistent with the zero-net heat transfer of the regenerator (solid green line). As would be expected, the heater and the expansion space both have positive energy flow. The black <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> shows the net work output of the cycle. On this trace, the cycle ends higher than it started, indicating that the heat engine converts energy from heat into work.|$|E
2500|$|Aged 16 Low {{entered the}} Central Technical College, an {{institution}} {{far more to}} his liking, here his abilities really started to show. [...] Under the guidance of his mentor Professor Ashcroft, Low's mercurial mind was given free rein over many of the scientific disciplines. [...] During his time at the CTC Low designed a drawing device which he called [...] "The Low flexible and adjustable curve". [...] This device along with a <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> pen and a self filling draughtsman's pen were marketed by Thornton's, a renowned instrument maker based in Manchester. [...] He also spent a year devising and making a selector mechanism which allowed a lever when moved to fall into a pre-selected slot.
