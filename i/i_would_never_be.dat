500|$|As a teenager, Jolie {{found it}} {{difficult}} to emotionally connect with other people, and as a result she self-harmed, later commenting, [...] "For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me." [...] She also struggled with insomnia and an eating disorder, and began experimenting with drugs; by age 20, she had used [...] "just about every drug possible," [...] particularly heroin. Jolie suffered episodes of depression and twice planned to commit suicide—at age 19 and again at 22, when she attempted to hire a hitman to kill her. When she was 24, she experienced a nervous breakdown and was admitted for 72 hours to UCLA Medical Center's psychiatric ward. Two years later, after adopting her first child, Jolie found stability in her life, later stating, [...] "I knew once I committed to Maddox, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> self-destructive again." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{death of}} Carmichael's three-year-old sister in 1918 {{affected}} him deeply. He later wrote [...] "My sister Joanne—the victim of poverty. We couldn’t afford a good doctor or good attention, and that’s when I vowed <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> broke again in my lifetime." [...] Joanne may {{have died from}} influenza, which had swept the world that year.|$|E
2500|$|At age nine, Jorge Luis Borges {{translated}} Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince into Spanish. It {{was published}} in a local journal, but Borges' friends thought the real author was his father. Borges Haslam was a lawyer and psychology teacher who harboured literary aspirations. Borges said his father [...] "tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt", despite the 1921 opus El caudillo. Jorge Luis Borges wrote, [...] "as most of my people had been soldiers and I knew <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be,</b> I felt ashamed, quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reflecting on the {{importance}} of Morath's linguistic gifts, Miller wrote that [...] "travel with her was a privilege because [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> able to penetrate that way." [...] In their travels Morath translated for Miller, while his literary work was the entrée for Morath to encounter an international artistic elite. The Austrian photographer Kurt Kaindl, her long-time colleague, noted that [...] "their cooperation develop without outward pressure and is solely motivated by their common interest in the people and the respective cultural sphere, a situation that corresponds to Inge Morath's working style, since she generally feels inhibited by assignments." ...|$|R

2500|$|Lloyd's {{career was}} not all laughs, however. [...] In August 1919, while posing for some promotional still {{photographs}} in the Los Angeles Witzel Photography Studio, he was seriously injured holding a prop bomb thought merely to be a smoke pot. It exploded and mangled his hand, causing him to lose a thumb and forefinger. [...] The blast was severe enough that the cameraman and prop director nearby were also seriously injured. Lloyd was {{in the act of}} lighting a cigarette from the fuse of the bomb when it exploded, also badly burning his face and chest and injuring his eye. [...] Despite the proximity of the blast to his face, he retained his sight. As he recalled in 1930, [...] "I thought I would surely be so disabled that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to work again. I didn't suppose that I would have one five-hundredth of what I have now. Still I thought, 'Life is worth while. Just to be alive. I still think so." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
2500|$|Abandoning {{his office}} job, {{he decided to}} instead take up both writing and {{illustrating}} his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as Anon E. Mouse for the local paper Anon, and St. Pancras Panda, a parody of Paddington Bear, for the Oxford-based Back Street Bugle. His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in NME music magazine, and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as Roscoe Moscow published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer Kurt Weill) in the weekly music magazine Sounds, earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter Leah, began claiming unemployment benefit to supplement this income. Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as Maxwell the Magic Cat in the Northants Post, under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child-murderer Gilles de Rais, something he {{found to be a}} [...] "sardonic joke"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing Maxwell the Magic Cat until 1986. Moore has stated that he would have been happy to continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community. Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them, stating that [...] "After I'd been doing [...] for a couple of years, I realised that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist." ...|$|E
