Learning that Lakes had corresponded with Cope, Marsh sent his field collector Benjamin Mudge to Morrison to secure Lakes' services. Marsh published a description of Lakes' discoveries in the American Journal of Science on July 1, and before Cope could publish his own interpretation of the finds, Lakes wrote {{to him that the}} bones should be shipped to Marsh, a severe insult to Cope.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bevin {{took over}} {{management}} of the struggling Bevin Brothers Manufacturing Company of East Hampton, Connecticut. Founded in 1832 by Bevin's great-great-great grandfather and remaining in the family continuously since, Bevin Bros. is the last American company that exclusively manufactures bells. By 2011, the company owed $116,000 in delinquent taxes and was named the number one delinquent tax firm in East Hampton. Collectively, the Bevins decided that Matt was the only family member with the business acumen and financial wherewithal to keep the company solvent. In 2011, Bevin became the company's president. Within a year, <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> company's delinquent taxes; he subsequently made the company profitable and raised his employees' pay.|$|E

5|$|During the 2008 election, New York state {{officials}} asserted that Al Franken Inc. {{had failed to}} carry required workers' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005. Franken paid a $25,000 fine {{to the state of}} New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state's workers' compensation laws. At the same time, the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $4,743.40 in taxes, fines, and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007, because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years. A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required. Subsequently, Franken paid $70,000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003, mostly from his speeches and other paid appearances. Franken said <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> income tax in his state of residence, and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states.|$|E

500|$|In <b>the</b> 1850s <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> for <b>the</b> {{restoration}} of his local parish church of StMary and AllSaints at Great Budworth, where he encouraged a more Anglo-Catholic style of worship. <b>He</b> <b>paid</b> for <b>the</b> building of new churches in two villages on his estates. [...] In {{the village of}} Warburton <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> for <b>the</b> new church of StWerburgh. [...] This was built in 1883–85 to a design by John Douglas of Chester, at which time Egerton-Warburton's nephew, Rev.Geoffrey Egerton-Warburton, was the incumbent. This church replaced the old church in Warburton, also dedicated to StWerburgh, as the parish church. The old church still exists on another site in the village.

25|$|Lanfranc, {{during a}} visit which <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> pope {{for the purpose of}} {{receiving}} his pallium, obtained an order from Alexander that the disputed points should be settled by a council of the English Church.

At this council Lanfranc obtained the confirmation of his primacy that he sought; nonetheless he was never able to secure its formal confirmation by the papacy, possibly {{as a result of the}} succession of Pope Gregory VII to the papal throne in 1073.|$|E

The military system of Ranjit Singh combined {{the best of both}} old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery. <b>He</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.|$|E

25|$|The 1792 {{campaign}} {{was a failure}} for Tipu. The allied army was well-supplied, and Tipu was unable to prevent the junction of forces from Bangalore and Bombay before Srirangapatna. After about two weeks of siege, Tipu opened negotiations for terms of surrender. In the ensuing treaty, {{he was forced to}} cede half his territories to the allies, and deliver two of his sons as hostages until he paid in full three crores and thirty lakhs rupees fixed as war indemnity to the British for the campaign against him. <b>He</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> amount in two instalments and got back his sons from Madras.|$|E
25|$|In January 1972, Flynt {{created the}} Hustler Newsletter, a two-page, {{black-and-white}} publication about his clubs. This item became so popular with his customers that by May 1972, he expanded the Hustler Newsletter to 16 pages, then to 32 pages in August 1973. As {{a result of}} the 1973 oil crisis, the American economy went into recession. Revenues of Hustler Clubs declined, and Flynt had to either refinance his debts or declare bankruptcy. He decided to turn the Hustler Newsletter into a sexually explicit magazine with national distribution. <b>He</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> start-up costs of the new magazine by deferring payment of sales taxes his clubs owed on their activities.|$|E

He continued (without paying), forced his way through the locks at Harpers Ferry and Lock 5, until Georgetown, where he was served notice for $120 in fees plus $4.08 for the waybill. When he got back to Cumberland, his boat was confiscated until <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> whole $124.08.|$|E

25|$|At around 1:10p.m., Bryant got {{in line at}} {{the toll}} booth at the {{entrance}} to the historic site. Upon getting close to the toll booth, he left the line and moved to the back again. Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. <b>He</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café. The security manager saw him go up to the café carrying a large bag and a video camera, but ignored him.|$|E

In late 1899, the Chicago Tribune described one of the hospital's innovations, the first portable incubator.

500|$|Lydford {{remained}} {{the centre of}} the forest administration through the 14th and 15th centuries. Despite complaints from non-miners {{at the start of the}} 14th century that the prison regime at Lydford Castle was overly lax, by the end of the century the prison had a reputation for poor, grim conditions. The first known rhymes complaining about [...] "Lydford Law" [...] date from 1399, and continued to be popular for several centuries. In 1510, Richard Strode, a Member of Parliament campaigning for reform of the Stannary laws, was infamously arrested by Stannary officials and imprisoned in Lydford Castle. He later described how he was kept in an underground room in the keep, fed only bread and water, and encumbered with legcuffs until <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> keeper to release him from the irons.|$|E
500|$|After {{two years}} in office, Hopkins was {{defeated}} by William Greene for the governorship, but Greene died in office in February 1758, and Hopkins once again became governor.

[...] Another issue was Newport interests versus Providence interests. [...] For several years, Hopkins was locked in a bitter rivalry with Samuel Ward of Westerly, a strong supporter of hard currency and also a champion of Newport, his town of origin. [...] So bitter was the animosity between these two men that Hopkins commenced an action for slander against Ward, putting damages at £40,000. [...] The case was moved to Massachusetts for a fair trial, and the judgment went against Hopkins by default in 1759, and <b>he</b> <b>paid</b> <b>the</b> costs.|$|E
