50|$|Little {{is known}} about Irish apparel before the twelfth century. Historians believe that the early {{inhabitants}} of Ireland dressed in <b>wool</b> <b>cloth,</b> although some argue that garments made of animal skins were more prevalent. By the thirteenth century, the Irish were bundling themselves in mantles, which are coats made of <b>wool</b> <b>cloth.</b> Most mantles were composed of small scraps of cloth sewn together, although the wealthy were able to afford mantles made from a single but very large piece of cloth.|$|R
50|$|The {{trading and}} {{shipping}} disparity between England and the Dutch United Provinces was growing: first, because the English shipping and trading system {{was based on}} duties and tariffs; while the Dutch trading system was based on free trade without tariffs and duties. Thus Dutch products would be less expensive and more competitive {{on the world market}} than English products. For example, an English wool trader, who dealt largely with ports in English-speaking America, complained in 1651 that although his English ships would take <b>wool</b> <b>cloth</b> to America to be sold, they could expect to leave American ports with 4000 to 5000 bags of <b>wool</b> <b>cloth</b> unsold. Dutch ships, on the other hand, would leave American ports with barely 1000 bags of <b>wool</b> <b>cloth</b> unsold. Because of this disparity, English trade with her traditional markets in the Baltic, Germany, Russia and Scandinavia withered.|$|R

40|$|In XV and XVI centuries Szadek {{was one of}} {{important}} towns of {{the eastern part of}} Greater Poland and a major centre of <b>wool</b> <b>cloth</b> production of the country, second only to Brzeziny in the Sieradz and Łęczyca district. Such intensive growth of this type of manufacturing activity in Szadek {{would not have been possible}} without favourable locational conditions, i. e. local availability of both raw material and labour, which is what for two centuries was supplied to Szadek by the surrounding agricultural areas. This factor certainly contributed to the growth of the town in XV and XVI centuries, but reliance of <b>wool</b> <b>cloth</b> manufacture on local supply of raw material and unqualified labour force also had its negative aspect. Wool supplied by local sheep-farmers was of poor quality, which affected the type of cloth manufactured in Szadek - it mainly produced cheap, low quality coarse cloth, which was mainly absorbed by local rural market. Economic crisis and worsening of the material situation of peasants, and consequent decreased demand for <b>wool</b> <b>cloth</b> was among the factors which led to the decline of cloth manufacture in Szadek...|$|R
