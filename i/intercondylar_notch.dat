5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

40|$|Anterior Cruciate {{ligament}} (ACL) injuries: Are siblings at risk? Background: Over 10, 000 ACL reconstructions {{are performed}} annually in Australia. The {{need to focus}} on preventing injury and Identifying at-risk groups, is growing. It is scarcely documented that siblings may be at risk, even though ACL injuries in siblings are seen in physiotherapy and medical clinics. Aims: To 1. assess the incidence of ACL injuries in siblings 2. compare the frequency of four risk factors in siblings with and without ACL injuries: Narrow femoral intercondylar notches; generalized joint laxity (GJL); faulty lower limb posture; excessive sports at an early age 3. compare the difference in these factors in sibling pairs with and without ACL injuries. Methods: ACL- injured individuals from a study cohort of 72 and their ACL- injured siblings were recruited. These 24 siblings were matched for age, activity and family composition with uninjured control siblings. Le Prade-view radiographs assessed notch width size, Beighton’s criteria assessed GJL, knee valgus and subtalar pronation were measured and sporting history was recorded. Chi-square analysis assessed differences between sibling groups. Results: Thirteen of 72 (almost one in five) individuals had a sibling with a rupture ACL. GJL occurred in 58 % of injured and 17 % of uninjured siblings. The incidence of knee hyperextension, knee valgus and pronation was 80 %, 42 % and 54 % respectively for injured and 25 %, 17 % and 8 % for uninjured siblings. Sixty-six percent of injured sibling had narrow notches while 4 % of uninjured siblings did so. Chi-squared analysis showed a significant difference between injured and uninjured sibling pairs for GJL (p= 0. 019), knee hyperextension (p<. 001), knee valgus (p-. 06) pronation (p=. 06) and narrow <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notches</b> (p=. 003) There was no significant difference found between groups for early involvement in excessive sport. GJL, knee hyperextension, knee valgus, foot pronation and narrow femoral notches, especially if occurring together, put siblings at risk of ACL injury...|$|R
40|$|Degradable {{magnesium}} alloys {{are promising}} biomaterials for orthopedic applications. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the potential effects on both the synovial membrane (synovialis) and the synovial fluid (synovia) of the degradation products of a MgYREZr-pin implanted in the <b>intercondylar</b> femoral <b>notch</b> in a rabbit model. Thirty-six animals were randomized into two groups (MgYREZr or Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy) of 18 animals each. Each group was then divided into three subgroups with implantation periods of 1, 4, and 12 weeks, with six animals in each subgroup. The initial inflammatory reaction caused by the surgical trauma declined after 12 weeks of implantation, and elucidated a progressive recovery of the synovial membrane. Compared with control Ti 6 Al 4 V pins, there were no significant differences between the groups. However, after 12 weeks, recovery of the synovial membrane was more advanced in the titanium group, in which 92 % showed no signs of synovitis, than in the magnesium group. A cytotoxicity test with L 929 cells and human osteoblasts (HOB) was also conducted, according to EN ISO 10993 - 5 / 12, and no toxic leachable products were observed after 24 h of incubation. In conclusion, the MgYREZr alloy seems to be a suitable material for intra-articular degradable implants. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub. co. uk/journalsPermissions. nav...|$|R
40|$|After {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), bone loss in the paralysed limbs {{progresses}} at variable rates. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) {{in the first year}} range from 1 % (slow) to 40 % (rapid). In chronic SCI, fragility fractures commonly occur around the knee, with significant associated morbidity. Osteoporosis treatments await full evaluation in SCI, but should be initiated early and targeted towards patients exhibiting rapid bone loss. The potential to predict rapid bone loss from a single bone scan within weeks of a SCI was investigated using statistical shape modelling (SSM) of bone morphology, hypothesis: baseline bone shape predicts bone loss at 12 -months post-injury at fracture-prone sites. In this retrospective cohort study 25 SCI patients (median age, 33 years) were scanned at the distal femur and proximal tibia using peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography at < 5 weeks (baseline), 4, 8 and 12 months post-injury. An SSM was made for each bone. Links between the baseline shape-modes and 12 -month total and trabecular BMD loss were analysed using multiple linear regression. One mode fromeach SSMsignificantly predicted bone loss (age-adjusted P < 0. 05 R^ 2 = 0. 37 – 0. 61) at baseline. An elongated <b>intercondylar</b> femoral <b>notch</b> (femur mode 4, + 1 SD from the mean) was associated with 8. 2 % additional loss of femoral trabecular BMD at 12 -months. A more concave posterior tibial fossa (tibia mode 3, + 1 SD) was associated with 9. 4 % additional 12 -month tibial trabecular BMD loss.

50|$|The {{intercondylar}} fossa {{of femur}} (intercondyloid fossa of femur, <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> of femur) {{is a deep}} notch between the rear surfaces of the medial and lateral epicondyle of the femur, two protrusions on the distal end of the femur (thigh bone) that joins the knee.

50|$|According {{to recent}} studies, female athletes are two to eight {{times more likely}} to strain their {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) in sports that involve cutting and jumping as compared to men who play the same particular sports (soccer, basketball, and volleyball). Differences between males and females identified as potential causes are the active muscular protection of the knee joint, the greater Q angle putting more medial torque on the knee joint, relative ligament laxity caused by differences in hormonal activity from estrogen and relaxin, <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> dimensions, and muscular strength.|$|E
50|$|In the female, the acetabula, the concave {{surfaces}} {{to which}} the balls of the femurs attach via ligaments, are located farther apart, which increases {{the distance between the}} most outer points of the femurs (their greater trochanters) and thus the width of the hips; female femurs are therefore, more generally angled (laterally, further away from vertical). This greater angle applies a larger portion of the gravitational/vertical load as valgus torque (rotational force against the knee). This, combined with the female's weaker tendons & ligaments and a narrower <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch,</b> causes increased susceptibility to injury of the ACL in female athletes.|$|E
50|$|ACI {{articular}} cartilage repair procedures {{take place in}} three stages. First, cartilage cells are extracted arthroscopically from the patient's healthy {{articular cartilage}} that {{is located in a}} non load-bearing area of either the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> or the superior ridge of the femoral condyles. Then these extracted cells are transferred to an in vitro environment in specialised laboratories where they grow and replicate, for approximately four to six weeks, until their population has increased to a sufficient amount. Finally, the patient undergoes a second surgery where the in vitro chondrocytes are applied to the damaged area. In this procedure, chondrocytes are injected and applied to the damaged area in combination with either a membrane or a matrix structure. These transplanted cells thrive in their new environment, forming new articular cartilage.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} methods of {{grafting}} cartilage defects, including periosteal grafting, osteochondral grafting (mosaicplasty), and articular cartilage stem cell paste grafting. Periosteal grafts are harvested from the perichondrial tissue and grafted to the articular cartilage defect. Given low long-term success rates, perichondrial grafting alone {{has not been}} clinically accepted as a particularly excellent therapy. Mosaicplasty, a form of chondral grafting, is a therapy designed to replace cartilage {{on the surface of}} the knee joint that has been damaged by trauma or arthritis by implanting osteochondral plugs. The implants can be autogenic (autologous) or allogenic. Paste grafting involves replacing damaged cartilage with autologous cartilage and cancellous bone from the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> in the center of the knee that is first morselized into a paste (typically with hydroxyapatite) to better fill the defect and more successfully promote chondrocyte activity and cartilage formation. These procedures are often performed arthroscopically.|$|E
50|$|This cell based {{articular}} cartilage repair procedure {{takes place in}} three stages. In a first stage, between 200 and 300 milligrams cartilage is sampled arthroscopically from a less weight bearing area from either the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyle of the patient. The matrix is removed enzymatically and the chondrocytes isolated. These cells are grown in vitro in a specialised laboratory for approximately four to six weeks, until there are enough cells to reimplant on the damaged area of the {{articular cartilage}}. The patient then undergoes a second treatment, in which the chondrocytes are applied on the damaged area during an open-knee surgery (also called arthrotomy). These autologous cells should adapt themselves to their new environment by forming new cartilage. During the implantation, chondrocytes are applied on the damaged area in combination with a membrane (tibial periosteum or biomembrane) or pre-seeded in a scaffold matrix.|$|E
5000|$|One ACI treatment, called Carticel, is {{designated}} for young, healthy patients with medium to large sized damage to cartilage {{and is not}} applicable to osteoarthritis patients. The patient’s chondrocytes are removed arthroscopically from a non load-bearing area from either the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyles. 10,000 cells are harvested and grown in vitro for approximately six weeks until the population reaches 10-12 million cells. Then these cells are injected into the patient. These cells are {{held in place by}} a small piece of soft tissue from the tibia, called a periosteal flap, which is sutured over the area to serve as a watertight lid. The implanted chondrocytes then divide and integrate with surrounding tissue and potentially generate hyaline-like cartilage. The cost of the treatment ranges from ($USD) 20,000-35,000. A second generation technique, called Carticel II uses a [...] "fleece matrix" [...] implanted with chondrocyte cells that is arthroscopically inserted into the joint.

40|$|<b>Intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> {{narrowing}} is a {{risk factor}} for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, but it is unclear whether a narrow <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> correlates with bilateral ACL injuries. To determine whether a narrow <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> is associated with bilateral ACL knee injuries in athletes, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiography to investigate the notch size. A retrospective case-control study. This was a comparative cohort study on 50 subjects of which 25 patients with sport trauma-associated bilateral ACL injuries, 30 with unilateral ACL injuries, and 20 healthy subjects. the notch width index (NWI) was measured as the ratio of the width of the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> to the femoral condylar width on radiography and the MRI slice containing the region near the ACL attachment site on the femoral side (NWI-A) and on the following posterior slice (NWI-P).

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To compare objectively {{the shape}} of the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> in human osteoarthritic and non-osteoarthritic femora.  METHODS—A sample of 96  human femora from a large {{skeletal}} population were selected for study. These femora included subjects with evidence of late stage osteoarthritis (that is, with eburnation present) and subjects with no such evidence. The distal end of the femur, viewed axially, was recorded with a video camera, and digitised computer images were produced. The outline of the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> was extracted and represented mathematically as two functions. A functional principal components analysis was used to identify important modes of shape variation. These variations in shape were compared between eburnated and non-eburnated femora.  RESULTS—A statistically significant difference in {{the shape of}} the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> was found between the two groups. The difference related mostly to {{the shape of the}} edge of the medial condyle: in the non-osteoarthritic group this tended to exhibit a concavity; in the osteoarthritic group it tended to be straight.  CONCLUSIONS—This observed difference may be a predisposing factor to the development of osteoarthritis. The morphology of the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> is related to the functioning of and possible damage to the cruciate ligaments, and damage to the cruciate ligaments is a known risk factor for osteoarthritis.

Axial and longitudinal MRI were performed using a 1 -T Phillips machine with the patient's knee in an extended position. In all patients, the femoral notch and the distal condylar width were measured. Cases with normal ACL were used as control and patients with a complete or incomplete tear of ACL were chosen as case group. Because of the effect of osteoarthritis in decreasing the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> index, cases with obvious osteoarthritis {{were not included in the}} study. Independent sample Student's t test was used to compare the means. "nResults: 328 patients were enrolled in the study. The age range was 18 - 72 years. We found no significant difference in the mean notch width index (NWI) in patients with (0. 296) and&nbsp;without (0. 298) an ACL tear (P&gt; 0. 05). In addition, there was no significant difference in the frequency of ACL tears in patients with and without critical notch stenosis (P&gt; 0. 05). "nConclusion: We did not find a relationship between narrow <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> width and ACL tears and we do not recommend a knee MRI to predict the probability of ACL injury...|$|E
30|$|In {{the frontal}} plane, the {{position}} of the femoral tunnel along the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> can be described by the angular position of numerals on the face of a clock. In general, a tunnel positioned at 11 o’clock for a right knee (or 1 o’clock for a left knee) has been considered the correct tunnel position [80, 81, 82]. However, Markolf et al. emphasised the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> to have a three-dimensional configuration, such that variations in graft placement in the frontal plane inevitably resulted in variations in tunnel placement in the sagittal plane [83]. Hence, they demonstrated that the biomechanical consequences of varying femoral tunnel placement in the frontal plane were less critical than varying the anteroposterior position.|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} anatomic risk factors in ACL lesions are the morphometric parameters of <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch.</b> In the morphometric studies index of notch width and index of notch shape (NWI and NSI) are commonly used. The certain morphologic parameters of distal femoral part {{are used in}} calculation. Beside standard parameters we measured the maximal width of <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> and distal part of femur, which we used for calculation of maximal index of notch width and maximal index of notch shape (NWI max and NSI max). We compared two different methods of calculation of <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> indexes {{to find out which}} one represent anatomic risk factor and influence the ACL lesions. The indexes were measured in the two groups of patients (33) who have the history of knee injuries, the first group has document of ACL injuries and the second without ACL injuries (control one). The important difference between two groups was founded in NWI (p 0. 05). The NWI and NSI importance is higher in males, and smaller in females. There is no difference in NWImax and NSImax (p> 0. 05) comparing to the gender...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this prospective {{study was to examine}} <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> size and the value of inner angle of lateral femoral condyle as the risk factors for noncontact anterior cruciate ligament ACL injury and than to correlate them to the physical values of the athletes such as body mass index (BMI), hight, wight, etc There are indentified two type of risk factors, external include shoes-surface interaction, type of playing surface, weather conditions and internal include anatomic, neuromuscular, biomechanical and hormonal factors that may predispose female athlets to noncontact injury of ACL. Among anatomic factors, <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> stenosis and larger inner angle of lateral condyle of femur as the factors which can cause impigement of ACL, were related to an increased risk of injury of ACL. In this study were included 51 female athlete. In the study group there were 24 female handball players with ACL tear and in control group there were 27 female handball players without any type of injury of the knee, who are practicing handball on a daily basis for at least for two years. In the first step, were gathered clinical data performed by orthopaedic surgeon. In the second step, the femoral notch width and the inner angle of lateral condyle of femur were measured on coronal MR-images. Study has shown that value of inner angle of lateral condyle of femur was significantly higher in athletes with ACL tear compared to those without. Value of width of <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> was statisticaly smaller in athletes with ACL tear, comprared to those without. In the conclusion the inner angle of lateral femoral condyle is better predicting factor for ACL tear in young female handball players compared to <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> width...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} for identification {{of risk factors}} for Anterior Cruciate Ligament, ACL injury has challenged many investigators. Many authors have reported lower Notch Width Index, NWI measured on radiographs in patients with midsubstance ACL lesions compared to control groups. Since a narrow <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> has been implicated as a possible risk factor related to ACL injury we decided to compare NWI measured on MRI scans between age-matched groups with acute ACL injury {{with those of the}} normal population. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> width on MRI scans in an immature population to determine if there was a difference between the population with ACL tears and a control group. We also wanted to assess age as a risk factor in an ACL injury population. We retrospectively analysed the MRI scans of 46 patients with ACL injuries and 44 patients with normal MRI findings who served as a control group for NWI measurements. For the ACL injury group we collected information from medical charts including age at the time of injury, gender, mechanism of injury, type of activity practised at the time of injury and prevalence of meniscal injury. Demographic data of the control group were comparable with those from the study group. We found a statistically significant (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) difference in the mean value of the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> width between normal knees (0. 2691) and the ACL injury population (0. 2415). In the ACL injury group we did not find differences in NWI values with regard to gender, involved side, mechanism of injury and type of sport practised at the time of injury. A narrower <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> was found to be associated with the risk of ACL rupture in an immature population. The young group of athletes with ACL injury needs further study to prospectively assess the risk of knee injuries...|$|E
40|$|Femoral shaft {{fracture}} is a commonly encountered injury. Intramedullary (IM) nailing {{is the preferred}} method for treating the fracture and viewed as the standard care for femoral {{shaft fracture}}s. There are three entry points for IM nailing: 1) the piriformis fossa, 1) 2) the <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch,</b> 2) and 3) the greater trochanter. 3) The piriformis fossa {{has the advantage of}} being colinear with the long axis of the femur, which reduces the risk of iatrogenic fracture comminution and varus malalignment. 4) However, the disadvantages of this entry point are its sensitivity to anteroposterior transla-tion 5) and the technical difficulty. The <b>intercondylar</b> <b>notch</b> helps provide better fracture alignment of distal femoral shaft fractures, 6) and the union rates achieved using mod-ern techniques {{are similar to those of}} antegrade nailing...|$|E
