5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion. The relative {{risk of breast cancer}} for women who had a spontaneous abortion in this analysis was 0.98, and that for <b>induced</b> <b>abortion</b> was 0.93.|$|E
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an <b>induced</b> <b>abortion</b> {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to explore how}} informed choice on contraceptive methods influenced <b>induced</b> <b>abortions</b> among reproductive-age immigrant women in China. A total of 3230 participants were recruited in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. Information on informed choice was collected by questionnaires. The annual incidence rate (spells) of <b>induced</b> <b>abortions</b> was 0. 46 (1500 / 3230) among the participants. The sequence from the highest score to the lowest was long-term, short-term and natural contraceptive methods (p < 0. 0001). Significant differences of rates in <b>induced</b> <b>abortions</b> were found in region, occupation, length of the first immigration up to now (year), purpose for immigration, number of children, marital status, sex preference, contraceptive methods, deciders of contraceptive methods and side effects. In the zero-inflated negative binomial model, the joint impacts showed when a participant with one child employed condoms or family planning service providers as the deciders of contraceptive methods introduced intrauterine devices, the occurrence of <b>induced</b> <b>abortions</b> {{was more likely to}} be reduced.

25|$|In {{the third}} {{trimester}} of pregnancy, <b>induced</b> <b>abortion</b> may be performed surgically by intact dilation and extraction or by hysterotomy. Hysterotomy abortion is a procedure {{similar to a}} caesarean section and is performed under general anesthesia. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|An <b>induced</b> <b>abortion</b> may be {{performed}} by a physician for women {{who do not want}} to continue the pregnancy. Self-induced abortion performed by a woman or non-medical personnel is extremely dangerous and is still a cause of maternal mortality in some countries.

25|$|The {{association}} between breast feeding {{and breast cancer}} has not been clearly determined; some studies have found support for an association while others have not.

This hypothesis was the subject of extensive scientific inquiry, which concluded that neither miscarriages nor abortions are associated with a heightened risk for breast cancer.|$|E

Other common practices of <b>inducing</b> <b>abortion</b> outside of the law include the insertion of objects such as sticks and catheters into the uterus in order to rupture the amniotic sac in order to trigger termination. However, these methods of abortion are highly unsafe and often result in serious complications for the woman.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a number}} of risk factors for ectopic pregnancies. However, in as many as one third to one half no risk factors can be identified. Risk factors include: pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease, infertility, use of an intrauterine device (IUD), previous exposure to DES, tubal surgery, intrauterine surgery (e.g. D), smoking, previous ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis, and tubal ligation. A previous <b>induced</b> <b>abortion</b> does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
25|$|Up to 15 weeks' gestation, suction-{{aspiration}} or vacuum aspiration are {{the most}} common surgical methods of <b>induced</b> <b>abortion.</b> Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) consists of removing the fetus or embryo, placenta, and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary.|$|E

2500|$|In places {{lacking the}} {{necessary}} medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an <b>abortion</b> can be <b>induced</b> by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary.

25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{spontaneous}} abortion during the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities of the embryo or fetus, accounting for at least 50% of sampled early pregnancy losses. Other causes include vascular disease (such as lupus), diabetes, other hormonal problems, infection, and abnormalities of the uterus. Advancing maternal age and a woman's history of previous spontaneous abortions are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion. A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma; intentional trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered <b>induced</b> <b>abortion</b> or feticide.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 205 million pregnancies occur {{each year}} worldwide. Over a third are {{unintended}} {{and about a}} fifth end in <b>induced</b> <b>abortion.</b> Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. In the United Kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus. A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses. Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor or a woman's personal preference.|$|E
