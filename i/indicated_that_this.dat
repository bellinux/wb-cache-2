5|$|In 1691, Arsenije {{struck a}} deal with Leopold I, who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, whereby the Habsburgs granted the Serbs ecclesiastic {{autonomy}} and some degree of self-administration, much to the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Church and Hungarian authorities.

In 1712, Sremski Karlovci became the Patriarchate for Serbs living in the Habsburg Empire.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E
