40|$|With {{decreasing}} solder volumes {{and joint}} sizes, new aspects in electronics packaging occur. Previous publications report porous structures in Cu/Sn microbump interconnects after flux-assisted bonding and storage. The origin and mechanisms of pore formation are still discussed among researchers. In this study, {{the influence of}} no-clean flux during <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> is investigated on soldered Cu/SnAg 3. 5 microbumps with intermetallic compounds. Soldering was carried out on single dies in air atmosphere without cleaning agent at 240 Â°C for 15 min. Subsequent <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> was performed in air and N 2 atmosphere at 240 Â°C for 1 min, 10 min and 20 min. The microbumps were exposed to flux and flux fumes during <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage.</b> Reference samples were stored separately without any flux contact. The results show pores in samples with flux contact of any kind. Inert atmosphere seems to diminish pore formation. The study reveals different residue appearances on and around the microbumps according to different storage conditions. Reasons for pore formation are also discussed in this study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} heat energy release {{characteristics}} of shape-stabilized latent heat energy storage particles packed into a fluidized bed-type cylindrical heat energy <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> This type of latent heat energy storage material consists of normal paraffin (pentacosane C_ H_, latent heat : 164 kJ/kg, melting point of 327. 2 K) as a latent heat material, and polyethylene as a shape-stabilizing material. The effects of cold {{inlet air temperature}} and flow rate, {{and the amount of}} heat energy storage particles on the outlet air temperature from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> and the completion time of the heat energy release process were investigated. As a result, the non-dimensional correlations for the outlet air temperature from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> and the completion time of the heat energy release process were expressed in terms of non-dimensional pumping power, Stefan number and ratio of the packed particle layer height to the diameter of the cylindrical heat <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> 一般に、固液相変化潜熱蓄熱システムにおいては、熱媒体と蓄熱材とはカプセル壁により隔離されており、その熱抵抗が大きな熱損失と迅速な熱授受を阻害する要因となることから、著者らは潜熱体が融解しても蓄熱材が固相状態の形状を保つカプセル型の形状安定化平板状パラフィン蓄熱体の開発とその蓄熱槽内での蓄放熱特性に関する研究を行ってきた。また、前報においては、潜熱蓄熱槽内に充填した球状の形状安定化パラフィン蓄熱材を温空気流入により流動層化し、熱媒体である温空気の搬送動力の軽減と蓄熱材の均一な蓄熱効果の検討結果を報告した。本報告は、前報に述べた潜熱蓄熱操作により得られた形状安定化パラフィン系球状潜熱粒子充填層に低温空気を流入させ、流動層化した場合の、球状潜熱粒子群の放熱特性に関する実験結果を述べたものである。具体的には、この種の流動層型潜熱蓄熱槽の放熱特性を評価する上で重要な要素となる蓄熱槽出口空気温度および潜熱放熱完了時間に関して、送風動力、蓄熱槽入口空気温度および蓄熱材粒子層高さを実験因子として検討するものである。さらに、蓄熱槽出口空気温度および潜熱放熱完了時間を予測する無次元整理式の提案を試みるものである...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- After a {{cryogenic}} fluid has been liquefied and purified {{to the desired}} level; it must then be stored and transported. Cryogenic fluid storage-vessel and transfer line design has progressed rapidly {{as a result of}} the growing use of cryogenic liquids in many areas of engineering and science. The development of the Dewar vessel represented such an improvement in {{cryogenic fluid}} <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> that it could be classed as a “break-through ” in container design. The high performance <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> in use today are based on the concept of the Dewar design principle a double walled container with the space between the two vessels filled with an insulation and the evacuated from the space. The detailed conventional-cryogenic-fluid <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> design is covered in such standards as the American society of mechanical engineers (ASME) boiler and pressure vessel code, section VIII (1983), and British Standards Institution standards 1500 or 1515. Most users require that the vessels be designed, fabricated, and tested according to the code for sizes larger than about 250 dm 3 i. e. 66 U. S. gallons, because of the proven safety code design. Cryogenic <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> are pressure vessels are used for storage cryogenic liquids with minimum heat in-leak into the vessel from the outside as far as possible. The challenge of design is to use such materials that do not lose their desirable properties at such a low temperature. Here the utmost care is taken to design a <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> satisfying both mechanical and thermal design. The results will be compared to the existing vessel of industry...|$|R

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} {{level sensor}} {{was developed to}} measure the liquid level in a <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> under high pressures, namely up to 6000 psi. The sensor is described. A prototype sensor was installed in the cooling-water <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> of the Eight-Foot High-Temperature Tunnel. Plans are being made to install the readout instrument in the control room, so that tunnel operators can monitor the water level {{during the course of}} a tunnel run. It was discovered that the sensor will operate at cryogenic temperatures. Consequently, a sensor will be installed in the modified Eight-Foot High-Temperature Tunnel to measure the sound speed of liquid oxygen (LOX) as it is transferred from a <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> to the tunnel combustor at pressure of about 3000 psi. The sound speed is known to be a reliable indicator of contamination of LOX by pressurized gaseous nitrogen, which will be used to effect the transfer. Subjecting the sensor to a temperature cycle from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature and back again several times revealed no deterioration in sensor performance. The method using this sensor is superior to the original method, which was to bleed samples of LOX from the <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> to an independent chamber for measurement of the sound speed...|$|R
