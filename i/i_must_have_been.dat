500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it and I stayed. People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Duchess is {{left alone}} before Ribby's fire, and discovers her ham and veal {{pie in the}} oven. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> eating MOUSE! ... No wonder I feel ill," [...] she muses. Knowing she cannot {{adequately}} explain her ham and veal pie to Ribby, she puts it outside the back door intending to sneak back and carry it home after she leaves for home. Ribby and Dr. Maggoty arrive and, after much fuss, Duchess takes her leave, {{only to find that}} the magpie (who has left by the back door) and a couple of jackdaws have eaten her ham and veal pie. [...] Ribby later finds the remains of the pie dish and the patty-pan outside the back door and declares, [...] "Well I never did! ... Next time I want to give a party – I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!" ...|$|E
500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna {{felt that the}} lyrics, along with being an answer-song, could also be {{interpreted}} as a rebellious one, where Madonna looks back on a relationship where she was not allowed to speak her mind. The song's lyrics contain sarcastic backing vocals with Madonna asking rhetorical questions based on her real-life actions, such as [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?" [...] Madonna explained that the lyrics were about [...] "basically saying don't put me in a box, don't pin me down, don't tell me what I can and can't say. It's about breaking out of the restraints." [...] With the Los Angeles Times she further clarified that there was a defensiveness with the lyrics for [...] "Human Nature": ...|$|E

500|$|Dubbed at {{the time}} [...] "The Queen of obscene", Madonna and the Sex era is {{considered}} by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period. The book, widely panned by the press, is {{regarded as one of the}} factors that shaped the social reaction and critique towards Madonna during the early 1990s. Her fifth studio album Erotica was affected by the negative press surrounding the book. In March 1993, Spin magazine wrote an article praising the book, but months later in Mexico, social communicologist Nino Canún dedicated an episode of his morning talk show ¿Y usted qué opina? (English: So what's your opinion?), to Madonna. Some members of the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments as to why [...] "this morally clueless singer shouldn't be allowed to perform in the country", making reference to The Girlie Show World Tour, which was set to visit Mexico. Later, during the concert, Madonna wore a charro sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage, as a response to these comments. Continuing her provocative imagery, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which featured the singer fully nude and in scenes engaged in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, Madonna appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit film, album and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics regard Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. Later, on the song [...] "Human Nature", from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna addressed the public backlash the book was still receiving, particularly with the lines [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?".|$|E
2500|$|After his arrest, Josef Fritzl {{claimed that}} his {{behavior}} toward his daughter did not constitute rape but was consensual. His defence lawyer Rudolf Mayer forwarded extracts from {{the minutes of}} his talks with his client to the Austrian weekly News for publication. According to these statements, Fritzl said that he [...] "always knew during the whole 24 years that what I was doing was not right, that <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> crazy to do such a thing, yet it became a normal occurrence to lead a second life {{in the basement of}} my house." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{proportion}} of viewers responded negatively when Vicki {{was shown to}} have an abortion. Johnson claims she received abusive letters from fans of the show {{and that she was}} stopped in the street twice by older women who told her [...] "it was quite wrong [...] to have got rid of the baby. I found that awkward at the time. But, gradually, I came to realise it was rather flattering. Those women believed in my character so completely they forgot she wasn't real. So now I think <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> doing a good job." [...] Johnson has since been critical of the storylines given to her character describing them as weak.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a period}} of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: [...] "You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this once, I could say I never was bought {{in my life and}} this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the {{disappointed}} betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ".|$|E
2500|$|To {{hold off}} these heavy concentrations, Wellington {{deployed}} 73,000 troops. At Burgos, he had 24,000 Anglo-Portuguese and Santocildes' 11,000 Spaniards. In the south Hill occupied Toledo with 20,000 soldiers while Major General Charles Alten held Madrid with 18,000. Angry that Wellington {{had been offered}} the supreme command in Spain, General Francisco Ballesteros refused to obey the British general's orders to obstruct Soult's move. High hopes had been placed on 8,000 Anglo-Sicilians under Lieutenant General Thomas Maitland at Alicante on the east coast. Maitland remained completely inert during this crisis. Wellington was [...] north of Madrid at Burgos, dangerously separated from Hill's army. To make matters worse, the Tagus was not a serious military obstacle because of unexpectedly low water. When Wellington realized how badly he was outnumbered by Souham, he felt lucky to get away intact. He later wrote, [...] "I {{had no reason to}} believe the enemy were so strong till I saw them. Fortunately, they did not attack me: if they had, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> destroyed." [...] Even so, he was loath to undertake a long retreat.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
