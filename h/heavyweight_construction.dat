Nowadays, acoustic insulation {{is one of}} the most requested performances on the part of inhabitants, but not always fulfilled. Since these kind of edifices are relatively new in the market, there are very few studies on acoustic properties, regarding on impact sound performances. In this paper, an in-depth analysis of impact noise on bare timber floors is presented, focusing on how impact sound reduction cannot be as efficient as in <b>heavyweight</b> <b>constructions.</b> Two new equations are proposed, modelling the impact sound pressure level of common bare timber structures and the influence of traditional floating floor systems is analysed...|$|R

40|$|Thermal mass {{is usually}} {{positively}} associated with energy efficiency and thermal comfort in buildings. However, the slow response of <b>heavyweight</b> <b>constructions</b> is not beneficial at all times, as these dynamic effects may actually also increase heating and cooling energy demand during intermittent operation or can cause unwanted discomfort. This study investigates the potential of energy simulations to support the exploration-driven development of two innovative responsive building elements: “Spong 3 D” and “Convective Concrete”. Both use fluid flow (Spong 3 D: water, Convective Concrete: air) inside the construction to reduce building energy demand by exploiting the use of natural energy sinks and sources in the ambient environment, aiming to make more intelligent use of thermal mass. During {{the development of these}} concepts, different simulation tools were used alongside experiments for e. g. materials selection, climate analysis, comfort prediction and risk assessment. By presenting the results from a series of simulation studies and by reflecting on their application, this paper shows how computational building performance analyses can play a useful role in ill-defined R&D processes.

However, although the structure appeared to be of a <b>heavyweight</b> <b>construction,</b> long versions soon suffered weaknesses in the extended rear overhang and, in time, major corrosion set in, resulting in a life not quite as lengthy as might have initially been expected.

30|$|Woven fabrics {{have good}} {{mechanical}} properties and retain dimensional integrity even {{when exposed to}} heat and/or flame. The interlacing structure of warp and weft holds the decomposition products in place and eliminates the physical shrinkage of char. However, for open-weave structures in barrier applications, the volatile gases from the heated PUF can easily find their way towards the flame, resulting in sustained burning. The situation is worse when the cover fabrics are thermoplastic, as the molten thermoplastic penetrates through the open weave structure and ignites the PUF core. For woven barrier fabrics to be effective, they must have a <b>heavyweight</b> <b>construction</b> (e.g., 300 [*]g/m 2), as the higher density fabric can prevent escape of pyrolysis gases and/or penetration of molten polymer (Ohlemiller & Shields [1995]). The trade off is that higher area density and heavier weight can negatively impact the handle and drape properties, thereby affecting the formability, aesthetic, and comfort properties of the upholstered product.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{consequences}} are of a great concern and the likely increasing temperature would add more dilemmas for the choice of passive design options. The performance of building envelopes {{is one of the}} key determinants of energy use and thermal comfort. This research presents an evaluation of commonly used construction systems (lightweight and heavyweight) with different levels of thermal mass. The performance of different construction combinations is quantified on the basis of their impact on thermal comfort and energy consumption for current and future time slices in London, UK where climate change impact is expected to be extreme. A flat model is examined as a case study to model the performance of the construction systems with low, medium and high level of thermal mass. The dynamic thermal simulation software used was DesignBuilder, which employs EnergyPlus as its calculation engine. In essence, this study establishes a new approach for assessing the performance of well-insulated contemporary construction systems on the basis of overall annual thermal comfort hours and energy consumption.

40|$|Concrete is a <b>heavyweight</b> <b>construction</b> {{material}} whose high {{thermal mass}} {{could increase the}} thermal storage capacity of a building envelope and in turn affect indoor thermal comfort. Selecting an appropriate method for concrete construction and form could also affect the total energy performance and thermal comfort of a building, a fact that is often overlooked by structural engineers. This study {{presents the results of}} energy simulations of the potential impact that concrete construction forms, in particular two slab types, and structural materials have on the energy consumption of archetypal commercial office buildings in five major Australia cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Darwin). This study has three stages: 1) a structural analysis of two slab types (Flat and Waffle slab); 2) the selection of two types of structural concrete (conventional Normal weight concrete and novel Ultra-lightweight concrete); 3) a comparative analysis to quantify the magnitude of the change in predicted annual energy consumption due to changes in the form of construction and the type of structural concrete. The energy simulation results showed that the thermal energy performance of the building was influenced by structural materials and slab types. It is shown that the thermal capacity of the concrete construction forms can be utilized to shift thermal loads, reduce peak demand and reduce operational energy consumption. The selection of an appropriate concrete type was more important in terms of energy performance in the coldest (Melbourne and Canberra) and hottest (Darwin) climate zones of this study...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-lightweight {{concrete}} (ULWC) {{was recently}} introduced as a novel building material that combines moderate thermal insulation properties with load-bearing capacity. Its intended use as monolithic building envelope brings new opportunities in building physics, by merging characteristics of both <b>heavyweight</b> and lightweight <b>construction</b> types. This paper investigates {{the potential of}} ULWC building envelopes in terms of energy efficiency and thermal comfort. The dynamic thermal characteristics of a monolithic structure of ULWC were first compared to more conventional constructions using EN-ISO- 13786 calculation methods. The main contribution of this article lies in the subsequent development and application of a simulation strategy for predicting the energy and comfort performance of ULWC on the whole-building level. The quality of the simulations in EnergyPlus was first ensured in an analytical validation study, and then applied to assess the performance of ULWC for commercial and residential case studies in the Netherlands. Results show that ULWC constructions are comparable to heavyweight buildings in long-term behaviour, whereas they resemble the performance of lightweight building envelopes for short-term heating periods. ULWC can therefore be a suitable construction type in buildings with intermittent operation, but in other cases it can get outperformed by conventional constructions with low or high thermal mass...|$|R
