5000|$|As {{a result}} of the failure of the mass {{poisoning}} plan, it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>to</b> Plan <b>B.</b> Under the command of Kovner's deputy, Yitzhak Avidav, the Hanakam group poisoned hundreds of loaves of bread that were designated for the S.S. prisoners. On 14 April 1946, Nakam painted with diluted arsenic some 3,000 loaves of bread for the 15,000 German POWs from the Langwasser internment camp near Nuremberg (Stalag 13). The camp was under US authority. On 23 April 1946, the New York Times reported that 2,283 German prisoners of war had fallen ill from poisoning, with 207 hospitalized and [...] "seriously ill". According to Harmatz, 300 to 400 Germans died. He said this [...] "was nothing compared with what we really wanted to do." [...] However, a 2016 report by the Associated Press revealed that the operation ultimately caused no known deaths, despite documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request to the National Archives and Records Administration stating that the amount of arsenic found in the bakery was enough to kill approximately 60,000 persons. It is speculated that the plotters in their haste spread the poison too thinly.|$|R
