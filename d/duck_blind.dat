5000|$|A hunting blind (US), hide or [...] is a {{cover device}} for hunters, {{designed}} to reduce the chance of detection. There are different types of blinds for different situations, such as deer <b>blinds</b> and <b>duck</b> <b>blinds.</b> Some are exceedingly simple, while others are complex. The legality of various kinds of blinds may vary according to season, state and location.|$|R

50|$|This {{island is}} a {{hunting and fishing}} community. It has {{numerous}} <b>duck</b> hunting <b>blinds</b> located in the bay {{as well as on}} land, and is home to the Swan Island Hunting Club, a guided duck hunting club located across the bay on Swan Island. It is a favorite winter travel destination of artist/painter Bob Timberlake, among others.|$|R
50|$|The {{two most}} common high quality duck call {{materials}} are wood and acrylic. The key difference between wood and acrylic duck calls is that acrylic calls are much louder and carry much further than wood duck calls. This {{is important for}} different types of duck hunting. Acrylic calls are preferred in large, open spaces for a call {{to reach out and}} find the ducks. When hunting in timber or swampy area, a wood call is preferable. Another key difference is that acrylic is known to show less sound variance over the temperature ranges expected in a <b>duck</b> <b>blind.</b>|$|E
50|$|As digital {{imagery and}} {{printing}} technology increased, Mossy Oak's patterns became more realistic. Using these techniques Mossy Oak {{introduced a new}} version of their most popular pattern calling it New Break-Up. Over the next decade, Mossy Oak continued to improve their techniques and introduce new patterns. After New Shadow Grass, Obsession, the newest spring pattern, was released. In 2005 came the company's first Western big game pattern with Brush. Brush became popular with hunters in Western terrain who previously had trouble finding a specific pattern to disguise them. Mossy Oak continued its pursuit-specific patterns with <b>Duck</b> <b>Blind</b> in 2007 and a newer version of Treestand in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Bridle Trail: Morrow Mountain State Park has 16 mi {{of horse}} trails, which {{may also be}} used for hiking. In 2005, the Bridle Trail was split into 3 {{different}} trails. In 2006, the State Park renamed spurs of the trail, which now includes a quick 0.35 mi section known as <b>Duck</b> <b>Blind</b> Cove Spur Trail. The Short Loop (white horse circle blazes) includes a 3.5 mi hike or ride to and around Morrow Mountain. The Middle Loop is 5.2 mi and is a longer trail that includes portions of the Short Loop trail. The Long Loop is the 16 mi trail; it circles the Morrow Mountain vicinity as well as the northern section of the park. Difficulty = Medium ...|$|E
5000|$|This species usually breeds in colonies, {{in trees}} close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults {{generally}} {{return to the}} colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a heronry (a more specific term than [...] "rookery"). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within 4 to 5 km, to ideal feeding spots. Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and <b>duck</b> <b>blinds.</b> Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{incoming}} school year, the UTM student union organizes frosh week, an event held annually aimed at welcoming first year {{students into the}} University. Hosting approximately 1,200 students every year, UTM frosh week {{offers a variety of}} events and activities meant to introduce students into University life and allow first year students to meet other incoming students. [...] Frosh week events are held {{both on and off the}} UTM campus. Featured at the 2011 frosh week Shawn Desman performed for students at The <b>Blind</b> <b>Duck.</b> [...] Other frosh week activities included off campus visits to Medieval Times, Canada's Wonderland and the St. George U of T campus.|$|R
50|$|The tarsometatarsi (lower leg bones) of Talpanas lippa {{were short}} and stout, and the braincase shallow and wide {{relative}} to its length. It had very small orbits (eye sockets) and also very small optic foramina (holes in the skull {{through which the}} optic nerves pass as they travel from the eyes to the brain). Together, these physical characteristics show that the eyes and optic nerve of this duck were quite reduced in size, {{and it can be}} assumed that this species was probably both blind and flightless. However, the maxillo-mandibular foramina (holes through which the trigeminal nerve passes) are extremely large, indicating larger nerves were travelling through it. The authors hypothesize that this blind, or nearly <b>blind,</b> <b>duck</b> would have used tactile and olfactory stimuli (the senses of touch and smell) from its beak to explore its surroundings in the absence of good vision.|$|R

50|$|Duck hunters {{quite often}} employ {{a dog to}} {{retrieve}} downed birds. Most often hunters use a Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever or Chesapeake Bay Retriever to retrieve waterfowl. The use of a dog provides a number of advantages. As duck hunting often takes place in cold wet locations, {{the use of a}} dog frees the hunter from potentially dangerous forays into cold water to retrieve the bird. Such efforts can be dangerous for the hunter, but are managed by a dog quite easily. It also allows for the recovery of wounded birds that might otherwise escape. A dog's acute sense of smell allows them to find the wounded birds in swamps or marshes where weeds can allow a duck to hide. The use of a dog ensures that a higher percentage of the birds shot end up on the table.A disadvantage of having dogs in the <b>duck</b> <b>blind,</b> is that some dogs are not well-trained to sit still and can potentially ruin a good hunt. Dogs that run into the water looking for birds when guns are fired, rather than waiting until sent or released create a hazard to the dog and hunters. Nevertheless, dogs are considered the greatest conservation tool known to waterfowlers.|$|E
50|$|Duck blinds in {{the grain}} fields {{in south central}} Oregon and north central California {{can be as simple}} as a hunter walking two or three miles out into a grain field, {{stopping}} at a dike, a raised area, two feet (60 cm) or so high, 10 or 12 feet (3.0-3.6 m) wide and usually a half mile or so long on a side. The hunter simply sits down on the top and pushes dirt away with both feet, front and back. In two to three minutes a shallow depression is created. Then additional stubble from cut grain can be placed around the edges, enough to provide cover when the hunter lies down when birds are spotted, sitting up when they come in range. The blind can be deepened to allow sitting upright, if desired, by using a digging tool. In other areas duck blinds can be quite elaborate. More substantial structures are common in the midwestern United States, and their purpose often extends beyond concealment to include protection from the elements, particularly from rain and cold. In some areas, blinds can approach small cabins in their size and amenities. A sinkbox is another elaborate form of <b>duck</b> <b>blind,</b> designed for partial submersion in a body of water; sinkboxes are illegal to use in the United States.|$|E

40|$|A single {{specimen}} of Ambystoma texanum was collected 2 mi E, 2 mi S of Falls City, Richardson County, Nebraska, on 26 October 1969. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} first {{specimen of}} this species taken in Nebraska. This specimen was collected from a sunken horse tank used as a <b>duck</b> <b>blind,</b> on an oxbow lake cut from the Nemaha river. The lake is three to four feet deep with a muddy bottom and submerged logs. Slough grass, Spartina pectinata, the dominant vegetation, was trampled extensively by cattle except around the horse tank where it was protected by a fence. The sluggish salamander was captured at 0600 hrs; at the time of capture, air temperatures ranged from - 6 to 0 Â° C. The specimen was kept alive for three days, preserved, and is now deposited in the Kearney State College Vertebrate Museum...|$|E
