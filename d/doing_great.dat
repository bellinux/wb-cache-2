2500|$|Another {{significant}} {{artist whose}} art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, Witches, created in 1510, visually encompassed all {{the characteristics that}} were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of <b>doing</b> <b>great</b> harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic. The urn in Witches seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming {{as a source of}} energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding {{on the back of a}} goat-demon as representative of their [...] "flight-inducing [...] ". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.|$|E

2500|$|James Jackson Kilpatrick (1920–2010) was a {{well-known}} newspaper editor in Richmond, Virginia, {{who was a}} leader in supporting segregation and {{the control of the}} South by whites only. MacLean states: [...] "The National Review made Kilpatrick its voice on {{the civil rights movement and}} the Constitution, as Buckley and Kilpatrick united North and South in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy." [...] In the August 24, 1957, issue, Buckley's editorial [...] "Why the South Must Prevail" [...] spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the South until [...] "long term equality could be achieved." [...] It argued that [...] "the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes—the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race." [...] His answer was that temporary segregation in the South was a good idea now (in 1957) and the black population lacked the education, economic, or cultural development for racial equality to be possible, claiming the white South had [...] "the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races." [...] Two weeks after that editorial was published, another prominent conservative writer, L. Brent Bozell Jr. (Buckley's brother-in-law), wrote in the National Review: “This magazine has expressed views on the racial question that I consider dead wrong, and capable of <b>doing</b> <b>great</b> hurt to the promotion of conservative causes. There is a law involved, and a Constitution, and the editorial gives White Southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the Negro politically impotent." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 1795 Schomberg was {{appointed}} to the 56-gun , Captain Henry Trollope, stationed in the North Sea. As an experiment, she was armed with only carronades, twenty-eight 32-pounders on the upper deck and twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower, giving her a distinct advantage in weight of metal against ships armed with standard 32- and 28-pounders in a close action. This was demonstrated on 15 July 1796 when Glatton fought a French squadron of four frigates, two ship-corvettes, a large brig-corvette and an armed cutter off the coast of Flanders. In a short but violent confrontation Glatton attacked the French squadron just before nightfall, her heavy guns <b>doing</b> <b>great</b> damage to the enemy, though she was severely cut up in her sails, rigging and masts. After spending the night making repairs, Glatton sought out the enemy, but they declined a renewal of the engagement, and sailed for Flushing. The French ships were believed to be the razee Brutus, and the frigates , Magicienne and Républicaine. It was reported that they had suffered considerable damage, and one sank in the harbour. During the action, Schomberg, commanding the lower deck, found {{that he did not have}} enough men to fight all the guns on both sides, so resorted to forming them into gangs, who loaded and ran the guns out, then moved on to the next gun, while two men pointed and fired. Schomberg was commended for his conduct, and on 28 July {{was appointed}} first lieutenant of the frigate [...] Unfortunately, the ship was destroyed by an explosion while moored at Plymouth Dock while he was travelling to join her, and it was not until January 1796 that he received command of the 14-gun brig , in which he served on the coasts of Holland and Norway, at Newfoundland, off Cherbourg, and on the Guernsey and Jersey stations. He was promoted to commander on 2 April 1798, but remained in Rambler until 1 January 1801, when he was promoted to post-captain.|$|E
