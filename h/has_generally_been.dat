The common stingray {{was reported to}} be the most basal member of the genus, other than the bluespotted stingray (D. kuhlii) and pelagic stingray (D. violacea). However, D. violacea <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> recognized as belonging to its own genus Pteroplatytrygon, and recently D. kuhlii has also been placed in a different genus, Neotrygon.|$|E
5|$|Men in Black: Alien Attack is an {{interactive}} dark ride located at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, Florida.

5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{is found}} in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by finches. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> beneficial to this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder of}} the Scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell, wore six beads, as did Sir Percy Everett, then Deputy Chief Scout and the Chief's right hand. Baden-Powell's beads are on display at Baden-Powell House in London. Everett endowed his six beads to be worn by the Camp Chief of Gilwell as a badge of office. Since that time the wearer of the sixth bead <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> the {{director}} of leader training at Gilwell Park.|$|E
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their shirts. Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their shirts, above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E

Ender's Game won the 1985 Nebula Award for best novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for best novel. Its sequels, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind and Ender in Exile, follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts and novel Ender's Shadow take place {{during the same time}} period as the original.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a state coat of arms or seal <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> {{authorized}} by {{a provision in the}} state constitution or a legislative act. In most instances a committee (more often than not consisting of three members) was appointed to study the issue, seek advice from qualified artists, historians, legal scholars, etc., and report back to the authorizing legislative body with a design for their approval. Historically, this committee has consisted of notable members of society and elected officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> described as occurring mainly {{in response to}} external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{has been found to}} have a broad range of characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E

5|$|Thescelosaurus <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> allied to Hypsilophodon {{and other}} small ornithopods as a hypsilophodontid, {{although}} recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build, unusual hindlimbs, and, more recently, its unusually long skull. Peter Galton in 1974 presented one twist to the classic arrangement, suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build (not cursorial, or built for running, by his definition), it {{should be included in}} the Iguanodontidae. This has not been followed, with Morris arguing strongly against Galton's classification scheme. At any rate, Galton's Iguanodontidae was polyphyletic and not a natural group, and so would not be recognized under modern cladistic usage.|$|E
5|$|A thin {{conception}} {{of the rule of}} law <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> adopted by the Singapore Government and Members of Parliament from the ruling People's Action Party, as evidenced from the views expressed during a 1999 parliamentary debate on the rule of law. However, a thicker conception was evinced by the Minister for Law in a speech made during the 2009 seasonal meeting of the New York State Bar Association's International Section in Singapore. On the other hand, a thick {{conception of}} the rule of law that encompasses human rights has been adopted by a number of Government critics, including opposition politicians, and foreign and international organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada and the World Justice Project.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{relationship}} with its neighbours since 1990 <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> good. The country also {{plays an important}} role in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States, and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with China and Vietnam. The HIV trial in Libya, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in Benghazi in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange.|$|E

5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> chosen over ad hoc {{efforts to get}} up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E
5|$|Persona began {{development}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> positive, with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew negative comments for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Since 1979, Pachylemur <b>has</b> <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> {{regarded}} as a distinct genus, but some classifications include the genus in Lemur or the ruffed lemur genus Varecia. In a 1982 review, Ian Tattersall recognized two species, Lemur insignis and Lemur jullyi. He did not regard Pachylemur as a distinct genus or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, Lemur jullyi Standing, 1904, is preoccupied by Palaeochirogalus jullyi Grandidier, 1899, and thus invalid. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they {{belong to the same}} species, which he could continue to call Lemur jullyi. Recent classifications recognize Pachylemur as a valid genus with two species—P.insignis (Filhol, 1895) and P.jullyi (Grandidier, 1899)—but express doubt about the distinction between the two species.|$|E
