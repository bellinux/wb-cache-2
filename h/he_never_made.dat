5|$|Retiring {{from the}} {{military}} in December 1963, Shoup {{took a job at}} a life insurance company, but remained influential in the administration. Johnson considered taking Shoup as an adviser on a February 1964 trip to Vietnam, but did not, either because <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> the invitation or because Shoup declined. Johnson appointed Shoup to the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service in early 1966. It disbanded on 1 January 1967 after submitting a report.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood favors jazz (especially bebop), blues, classic {{rhythm and}} blues, classical, and country-and-western music; his {{favorite}} musicians include saxophonists Charlie Parker and Lester Young, pianists Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson, Dave Brubeck, and Fats Waller, and Delta bluesman Robert Johnson. He {{is also a}} pianist and composer. Jazz has {{played an important role}} in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album Cowboy Favorites, released on the Cameo label.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Ward {{moved to}} Kidderminster Harriers {{just prior to}} the start of the 2003-04 season on a one-year contract, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> really <b>made</b> the grade and was {{released}} at the end of the season.|$|R
5|$|Given {{started his}} career at Celtic, however <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a first-team {{appearance}} and he was released and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994. Given was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995–96 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season, while on loan from Blackburn Rovers. He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of £1.5million, {{and it was there}} that he began competing to be a first-choice Premier League goalkeeper. Given was part of the teams who came runners-up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns, and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for 2001–02 and 2005–06. He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle, and was involved in the club's title challenge in 2001–02. Although he submitted a transfer request during the 2000–01 campaign after losing his position in the starting line-up, it was denied, and Given went on to regain his place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{reshuffle}} in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich {{to assume the}} post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> it to Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He enjoyed being in demand and was happy {{to be sent to}} France on a generous salary of 90,000 gulden a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint-Cloud; soon, the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards. Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using his charm to win great eminence there. The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs that certainly included Napoleon's sister Caroline Murat, Laure Junot, and perhaps many besides.|$|E

25|$|Born in Liverpool, Lancashire, {{and educated}} at De La Salle School, Jewell {{began his career}} as an {{apprentice}} with home-city club Liverpool.

25|$|His cricket career, though {{reasonably}} successful, {{could be}} considered an unlucky one. He never took 100 wickets in a season, but came close on several occasions. His best season with the bat saw him fall just four runs short of 1,000 runs. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>made</b> a century, but had scores of 98 and 95 not out. Worst of all, he was struck down by an injury that all but finished his career {{just as he had}} appeared to have reached his peak.|$|E
