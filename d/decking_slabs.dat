40|$|While the {{expansive}} corrosion of steel reinforcement {{is a major}} concern in reinforced concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs,</b> the non-corrosive fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bars provide an excellent alternative reinforcement. This thesis investigates the behaviour of restrained concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with different types and ratios of FRP reinforcing bars under static loading conditions. The research includes two different phases; experimental and theoretical investigations. In the experimental phase, nine full-scale <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> 3000 -mm long × 2500 -mm wide × 200 -mm deep were constructed and tested to failure. Five <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> were reinforced with glass FRP bars, two <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> were reinforced with carbon FRP bars, one <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> was reinforced with steel bars, and the last <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> was constructed without any reinforcement (plain concrete). The <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> were supported on two steel girders spaced at 2000 -mm centre-to-centre and were subjected to a monotonic single concentrated load over a contact area of 600 mm x 250 mm to simulate the foot print of a sustained truck wheel load (87. 5 kN - CL- 625 Truck) acting on the centre of each slab. The experimental results were presented in terms of cracking, deflection, strains in concrete and reinforcement, ultimate capacity and mode of failure. It was observed that the mode of failure for all reinforced <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> was punching shear with carrying capacities of {{more than three times the}} design factored load specified by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). It was also concluded that the maximum measured crack widths and deflections at service load level were below the allowable code limits. The theoretical phase has two parts. The first part includes developing a finite element model (FEM) to analyze and predict the behaviour of bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with FRP reinforcement. The efficiency and accuracy of the computer model was verified by comparing its results to the experimental results. Then the FEM was used to conduct a parametric study on the most important parameters that are known to affect the behaviour of the <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> In addition the finite element program was used to analyze a typical concrete bridge reinforced with GFRP bars. The second part of the theoretical phase includes developing a new punching shear model to predict the punching shear capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> The proposed model can predict with good accuracy the punching capacity of FRP-reinforced bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> as well as FRP-reinforced two way slabs. In addition, the proposed model gives better predictions compared to the different available punching shear models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe hereby {{discussed}} bridge span {{consists of}} steel truss elements prepared in a workshop, equipped with corrugated sheets, which make formwork for a concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slab.</b> Truss elements, {{of which the}} upper chord makes reinforcement of bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slab,</b> will be supplied to the construction site in their final form, and then placed on pre-executed abutments. Truss elements placed side by side will {{assume the role of}} a self-supporting structure for execution of concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> made of fresh concrete mixture. After hardening of concrete in the <b>deck</b> <b>slab,</b> the bridge span will create a steel-RC truss composite element, where:•the upper part of the steel truss element is the bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> reinforcement which carry the service loads of the bridge,•the bottom part of the steel truss element (not braced), together with RC <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> is the composite truss-slab load carrying structure of the bridge span.

40|$|The {{management}} {{of a network}} of existing road bridges involves interventions in order to maintain safety and the priority of these interventions is often determined by safety criteria. During the evaluation of safety, the dynamic effect of traffic actions is considered using equivalent static loads determined by multiplying the effect calculated using traffic load models by a dynamic amplification factor. During the evaluation of a <b>deck</b> <b>slab,</b> the application of inappropriate dynamic amplification factors could have significant financial implications, all the more since the local dynamic effects of overloaded trucks are determinant for this type of structural element. Dynamic amplification factors defined in codes have usually been derived from the measurement of global traffic action effects in the main structural elements of bridges. Unfortunately, local dynamic effects in <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> have not been studied in detail until now. A better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> will lead to the definition of more accurate dynamic amplification factors and avoid the use of values that are too conservative. The behaviour of <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> of six typical Swiss highway bridges has been simulated in order to study their dynamic response during the passage of trucks. The structural arrangement of the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> was different for each of the six bridges. A parametric study was based on the simulation of various scenarios involving the passage of trucks for various combinations of speed, path and road surface roughness. <b>Deck</b> <b>slab</b> response was obtained by numerical simulation based on models of the bridge, truck and road surface. This system was resolved using a prediction - correction algorithm that considers the dynamic interaction between a bridge and trucks. Dynamic amplification factors were subsequently calculated from strains and deflections obtained from independent static and dynamic simulations. The simulation of numerous scenarios enabled the evaluation of the influence of different parameters on the dynamic response of a deck slab: The road surface roughness was found {{to be one of the}} most important parameters, with an increase in roughness leading to an increase in dynamic amplification factors. An overloaded truck produces a lower dynamic amplification factor in a <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> than an empty truck. The truck speed influences the dynamic interaction, but a clear relationship between speed and dynamic amplification factor could not be identified. The maximum dynamic amplification factor does not vary significantly from one point to another over a <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> in a girder bridge. The structural arrangement of a <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> in a girder bridge has little influence on dynamic amplification factors. Overall, the different <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> on the girder bridges studied were all equally sensitive to the dynamic effects of road traffic. In many cases considered for the framed slab bridge, the maximum dynamic amplification factor was found to occur over the supports. For such bridges, the sensitivity of the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> to the dynamic effects of road traffic is not uniform. Finally, two approaches to evaluating <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> of existing road bridges are proposed. The first approach is only applicable in certain situations and involves a simplified evaluation using an updated traffic load model and a dynamic amplification factor. In situations where a simplified evaluation is not applicable, the second approach is to evaluate a <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> using numerical or experimental analyses...|$|R

40|$|Researchers at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada, {{and at the}} Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) have {{successfully}} enhanced the strength of <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> by further exploiting their arching action. With the help of tests on both large- and small-scale laboratory models, they have concluded that a <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> supported by parallel longitudinal beams does not required any reinforcement, provided that the slab is suitably confined in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. In the longitudinal direction, the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> is confined by making it composite with the beams, and by edge beams with suitably high flexural rigidity in {{the plane of the}} slab. In the transverse direction, the confinement is provided by ensuring that the supports of the slab, i. e. the top flanges of the girders, are restrained effectively against relative lateral movement; such confinement can be provided, for example, by welding steel straps to the top flanges of the girders.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{non-corrosive}} nature, high strength and light weight, fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) are being widely used as reinforcement in concrete bridges, {{especially those in}} harsh environments. The current design methods of concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> in most bridge design codes assume a flexural behavior under traffic wheel loads.

40|$|Bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} corrosion-vulnerable bridge {{components}} due to the direct exposure to de-icing chemicals and severe weathering conditions. The use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) as reinforcement for bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> is a promising solution to corrosion-related problems. Recently, glass FRP (GFRP) bars have been widely used as internal reinforcement for concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> since they are less expensive compared to the other kinds of FRPs (Carbon and Aramid). Since bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> directly sustain repeated moving wheel loads, they {{are one of the}} most bridge elements susceptible to fatigue failure. However, the performance of FRP-reinforced concrete elements subjected to cyclic fatigue loading, which is a critical design limit for bridge decks, has not been fully explored. This research is designed to investigate, analytically and experimentally, the fatigue behaviour and fatigue life of concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with glass FRP bars. The experimental program includes construction and testing of ten full-size <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> The test parameters include reinforcement type, reinforcement ratio in the bottom and top layers, and the scheme of fatigue loading. The experimental program was carried out in two phases each with five <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> prototypes. The first phase investigated the behaviour of <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> under accelerated, variable amplitude, fatigue loads till failure. The second phase investigated the behaviour of test prototypes, loaded till failure, under monotonic loading conditions preceded by a specified number of fatigue load cycles representing different life-time loadings. Phase two helped to verify the residual static capacity as well as the performance and durability of the GFRP reinforcement under service loading conditions. The analytical study was conducted in two parts. The first part included developing a new fatigue life model, P-N curve, to predict the fatigue life of such slabs. This model was extended to evaluate equivalent damage relationships between different wheel load cycles and amplitudes. It was also used to calculate the fatigue damage accumulated to a bridge deck along its service life. The second part of the analytical study included finite element modeling (FEM) to analyze and predict the behaviour of bridge decks under static and cyclic fatigue loads. The FEM was carried out using commercially available software, ANACAP. The analytical model was verified against the test results and then was used to investigate the effect of different parameters such as concrete compressive strength and wheel loads in tandem on the fatigue performance of such structural elements. Results are presented in terms of deflections, strains in concrete and GFRP bars, mode of failure and crack widths at different levels of cyclic loading. The results showed the superior fatigue performance and longer fatigue life of concrete bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> reinforced with glass FRP composite bars. The proposed fatigue life model and equivalent damage rules are in good agreement with test results.

New design provisions for applications {{not covered by the}} first edition of the CHBDC and the rationale for those that remain unchanged from the first edition are given. Among the new design provisions are those for glass-fibre-reinforced polymer as both primary reinforcement and ten-dons in concrete; and for the rehabilitation of concrete and timber structures with externally bonded fibre-reinforced-polymer (FRP) systems or near-surface-mounted reinforcement. The provisions for fibre-reinforced concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> in the first edition have been reorganized in the second edition to explicitly include <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> of both cast-in-place and precast construction and are now referred to as externally restrained <b>deck</b> <b>slabs,</b> whereas <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> containing in-ternal FRP reinforcement are referred to as internally restrained <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> Resistance factors in the second edition have been recast from those in the first edition and depend on the condition of use, with a further distinction made be-tween factory- and field-produced FRP. In the second edition, the deformability requirements for FRP-reinforced and FRP-prestressed concrete beams and slabs of the first edition have been split into three subclauses covering the design for deformability, minimum flexural resistance, and crack-control reinforcement. The effect of sustained loads on the strength of FRPs is accounted for in the second edition by limits on stresses in FRP at the serviceability limit state.

Then, wall segments of this barrier were tested under static loading to-collapse to determine their structural behavior, crack pattern and ultimate load carrying capacity under simulated vehicle impact load. Test results led to establishing two Standard drawings by Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) for use by consulting engineers and contractors. The crash-tested barrier dimensions were identical to those specified by Ministry of Transportation of Quebec (MTQ) for PL- 3 barrier except that the base of the barrier was 40 mm short and the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> is of 200 mm thickness, leading to reduction in the GFRP embedment depth into the <b>deck</b> <b>slab.</b> As such, Ryerson University research team proposed an experimental program to ensure that the resistance of barrier-deck junction, with the reduced width of barrier base and thickness of the <b>deck</b> <b>slab,</b> is greater of equal to the specified factored design load applied to the barrier wall simulating vehicle impact.

40|$|During {{the last}} 70 years, corrosion-induced {{deterioration}} of bridge concrete decks {{has resulted in}} replacement and repair of the deck and a serious need for finding alternative design strategies that would substantially reduce susceptibility of the concrete deck to corrosive environments and the subsequent maintenance cost as well. One alternative is to replace the reinforcing or prestressing steel in concrete with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite bars, which are corrosion-resistant, and {{have a very high}} strength-to- weight ratio. FRP bars can be used as either non-prestressed or prestressed reinforcement. Despite ongoing research mostly focused on prestressed and non-prestressed FRP reinforced concrete beams, less attention has been focused on the structural performance of bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> with actual dimensions, boundary conditions, and structural details. Clear understanding of the structural performance and failure mechanism of the bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> as well as constructability issues are not achievable unless full-scale tests are conducted. The main objective of this research is to establish a design methodology that can be applied to designing a bridge deck system prestressed and reinforced with aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP) bars under service and ultimate loads. The research approach of this investigation consists of conducting an experimental study on a full-scale bridge <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> including two precast concrete panels prestressed and reinforced with AFRP bars perpendicular to, and parallel to the traffic direction, respectively. The precast panels are connected via a cast-in-place seam (wet joint). In order to gain clearer insight and valid interpretation of the structural performance, the components of the bridge deck are separately tested as well. This includes flexural and shear tests of the cast-in-place panel-to-panel seam, flexural tests of an 1830 mm long strip prestressed with AFRP bars representing the bridge deck section perpendicular to the traffic direction, and flexural tests of an 1830 mm long strip reinforced with AFRP bars representing the bridge deck section parallel to the traffic direction. Once the flexural capacity of the strips and panel-to-panel seam is known, the load capacity of the bridge deck and the corresponding failure mechanism can be better analyzed. Yield line theory, commonly used for analysis and design of steel reinforced concrete slabs, is employed and modified to perform the failure load analysis of the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> in spite of the linear and brittle behavior of AFRP bars. Tensile characteristics of AFRP bars are experimentally investigated in {{the first phase of the}} project to provide a reliable data set for analytical and experimental studies of the bridge deck system in subsequent steps.

Accurate prediction of crack tendency is essential for durability design of bridge decks, thus more sustainable bridges with increased usable life span and low life-cycle costs...|$|R
40|$|Steel-concrete {{composite}} structures {{have been used}} in bridge engineering from decades. This is due to rational utilisation of the strength properties of the two materials. At the same time, the reinforced concrete (or prestressed) <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> is more favourable than the orthotropic steel plate used in steel bridges (higher mass, better vibration damping, longer life) ...|$|R
40|$|Steel-free {{concrete}} replaces {{reinforced concrete}} in bridge decks and similar structures in marine environments and in northern climates having snow and ice. It {{is to eliminate}} the source of deterioration, the steel reinforcing bars in slabs exposed to deicing salts. Eliminating corrosion makes concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slabs</b> virtually maintenance-free, which makes life cycle costs of steel-free concrete decks much lower than reinforced concrete decks...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} 315.3 m long, {{measured}} between the abutments, comprising a steel arch supporting a reinforced concrete deck executed {{as a continuous}} girder across 17 spans: 17.52 m + 2 x 19.71 m + 19.68 m + 7 x 17.52 m + 19.68 m + 4 x 19.71 m + 17.52 m. The deck structure comprises a grillage consisting of the <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> with longitudinal girders and cross-girders. The 0.25 m thick reinforced concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> {{is supported by the}} cross-girders set 2.19 m apart and the longitudinal girders set 8 m apart and made composite. The bridge piers and spandrel columns comprise hollow square cross-section. Size of the squares (edge) varies depending on height of the piers and columns from 650 mm to 850 mm, except for the columns at the springing which are 2300 mm wide. The arch spans 155 m, with an arch rise of 41.45 m. The arch comprises a box cross section and provides a 55 m clearance below the bridge.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Departments of Transportation {{adopted the}} AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications {{during the year}} 2007, which is {{mandated}} by AASHTO and FHWA. The application of LRFD specification initiated numerous research works in this field. This investigation addresses the LRFD and Standard design methodologies of concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slab,</b> <b>deck</b> overhang, barrier and combined barrier-bridge overhang. The {{purpose of this study}} is to propose a simplified manual design approach for the barrier-deck overhang in concrete bridges. For concrete <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> overhang and barrier, application of National Cooperative Highway Research Program crash test is reviewed. The failure mechanism, design philosophy and load cases including extreme event limit states for barrier and overhang are discussed. The overhang design for the combined effect of bending moment and axial tension is probably the most important part of the design process. The overhang might be a critical design point of the deck with significantly higher amount of reinforcement. The design process becomes complicated due to combined force effect, LRFD crash test level requirement and the existence of several load combinations. Using this program, different LRFD load combinations are plotted together with the interaction diagram and the design is validated...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} prediction method of crack width in composite precast <b>deck</b> <b>slab</b> concrete structure under cyclic or repeated loading. The test result of crack width prediction procedures proposed by various researchers indicates that each formula contains {{a different set}} of variables. A literature review also suggests that there is no general agreement among various researchers on the relative significance of different variables affecting the crack width. An analytical method is developed to determine the concrete stress distribution near flexural cracks in reinforced concrete one-way slabs and used to investigate the effects of various variables on the spacing and width of cracks. The formula is developed using a large number of tri-linear model values calculated from the concrete and steel strains at various sections between adjacent cracks for a number of composite precast <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> The present method of incorporating the tension stiffening effect is verified by comparing calculated fracture mechanic and those measured by other researchers. The tri-linear model values at sections between adjacent cracks are calculated using an empirical formula. Development of this formula is based on the tri-linear model values calculated using the concrete and steel strains at various sections between successive cracks, for a number of composite precast <b>deck</b> <b>slabs.</b> Using the tri-linear model values evaluated by the proposed formula, short-term deflections were determined for a large number of flexural members and the results were compared with those measured by other researchers. This comparison indicated that the present method of incorporating the tension stiffening effect in fracture mechanic calculations is acceptable...|$|R
