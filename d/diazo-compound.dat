He correctly confirmed {{the finding of}} Thomas Aldrich that the formula for adrenaline was C9H13NO3 {{despite the fact that}} he was not working with pure samples, which only emerged much later. Pauly spent many years studying the diazo-reactions of proteins. In 1904 he published a paper that described what became known as the Pauly reaction, a method of detecting the presence of the amino acids tyrosine or histidine in proteins. In 1915 Pauly used diazo-benzene arsinic acid rather than diazo-benzene sulphonic acid to prepare an insoluble <b>diazo-compound.</b> He found that a tyrosine ring took on two molecules of the <b>diazo-compound</b> to form a bis-diazo-tyrosine. A histidine ring did the same. These discoveries proved invaluable to the work of Karl Landsteiner on immunity and allergy.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{manifold}} {{has been}} developed, catalytic in phosphorus (V), that promotes the dehydration reaction of an alcohol {{to give the}} symmetrical ether product. This has been achieved {{through the development of}} a novel dioxyphosphorane catalyst that, in conjunction with a triflic acid cocatalyst, conducts the coupling reaction without the need for any additional stoichiometric reagents. This has allowed the omission of the explosive <b>diazo-compounds</b> that are required in the widely-accepted Mitsunobu conditions, and has reduced the amount of inconvenient and difficult-to-remove phosphorus waste that is usually associated with phosphorus-mediated reactions.

40|$|Dedicated to Professor Dr. H. Begemann on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday Summary: Haemoglobin interference in the determination of bilirubin was compared in 7 different methods using the Jendrassik-Grofprocedure, the Jendrassik-Grof-Nosslin rhodification, and the more recent proce-dures using nitrophenyldiazonium, 2, 5 -dichlorophenyIdiazonium, 2, 4 -dichloraniline, and a direct reading method. To a variable degree, haemoglobin decreased the apparent absorption of the reaction product in all procedures. The extent of this decrease depended on the reagent used, the wavelength, incubation time, bilirubin concentratiori and the type of blank used. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of interference, haemoglobin was found to destroy the bilirubin <b>diazo-compound</b> whereas haemiglobin was ineffective. Likewise, storage of haemolytic samples for several days led to a disappearance of haemoglobin. H 2 O 2, which had no effect in the absence of haemoglobin, potentiated the action of haemoglobin on diazobilirubin coupling. From our observations it can be concluded that haemoglobin disturbs the diazo-bilirubin reaction by a dual mechanism. H 2 Ü 2, formed from oxyhaemoglobin by autoxidation, destroys the diazo bilirubin colour. In accordance with this explanation, potassium iodide stabilized the diazo compound against the peroxidative effect of oxyhaemoglobin; stabilization was not effective with Superoxide dismutase, mannitol or ascorbate...|$|E
40|$|Part I. Aldehyde and ketone p-tosylhydrazones react {{thermally}} with {{bases in}} aprotic solvents to give <b>diazo-compounds</b> which decompose by carbenic processes. In proton-donor solvents decomposition appears to occur primarily by cationic mechanisms involving diazonium and/or carbonium ion intermediates. Thermal decomposition of cyclobutanecarboxaldehyde p-tosyl-hydrazone gives methylenecyclobutane by hydrogen migration, cyclopentene by ring expansion, bicyclo(2. 1. 0) pentane by intramolecular insertion, 2 -methylbutene- 1 by reorganization, methylcyclobutane by hydride transfer, along with ethylene and acetylene by fragmentation. The effect of varying solvents and bases {{on the product}} compositions is reported. A brief historical review is given and the mechanisms of this reaction are discussed. Part II. A new method for the preparation of organic fluoro-compounds was discovered.

40|$|Complex {{scaffolds}} {{are readily}} accessed via Gold and Platinum π-acid catalysis starting from simple precursors. These precious metal π-acids {{are used to}} generate sulfur ylides which undergo rearrangement to interesting sulfur containing compounds analogous to those formed via diazo-chemistry. In this thesis the utility of these π-acids to generate sulfur ylides will be discussed by: 1) The in situ generation of α-carbonyl carbenoids directly from alkynes avoiding “sacrificial functionality”; 2) Achieving different regiochemical outcomes using electronically biased alkyne systems; 3) Designing domino reactivity using simple functional groups. Recent developments involve the use of ynamides as regio-directing agents for site specific oxygen-transfer from a suitable oxidant to form the α-oxo-gold-carbenoid functionality. These carbenoids mimic the reactivity observed by decomposition of <b>diazo-compounds</b> with non-precious transition metals. A new gold catalysed intramolecular rearrangement of ynamide tethered-sulfoxides have led to highly complex products. Designing the starting sulfoxide substrates to allow tandem cyclisation reactions have led to formation of polycyclic sulfur heterocycles which are close to sulfur analogues of known biologically active compounds...|$|R
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and <b>diazo-compounds,</b> azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and characterisation of the nitrile complexes cis- or trans-(ReC 1 (NCR) (dppe) _ 2) and (Re(NCR) _ 2 (dppe) _ 2) "+ {{are described}} (ch. I and II). The cis isomers of the neutral complexes {{are susceptible to}} electrophilic attack at the #beta# position of the NCR ligand or at the metal (with formation of methyleneamido- or hydride-complexes), cis-to-trans isomerization induced by chemical oxidation, or substitution reactions of the non-phosphinic ligands (e. g., with formation of the related dinitrile or the monocarbonyl complexes). the cationic dinitrile compounds only undergo cis-trans isomerization or exchange of the counter-ion (Ch. II). The methyleneamido- or hydrido-complexes can be deprotonated (reversibly in the latter case) by reaction with a base to give the trans isomers of the neutral mononitrile species. The mechanism of the fats protonation of the (cis and trans) neutral compounds was established by stopped-flow techniques. The electrochemical studies of the abovementioned compounds (Ch. III) revealed an anodicallyinduced cis-to-trans isomerization of the (neutral and cationic) nitrile or monocarbonyl species as well as electroinduced deshydrogenation and deprotonation reactions of the metyleneamido - and hydrido-complexes. Some of these mechanisms were investigated by digital simulation of cyclic voltammetry. Moreover, ligand and metal site effects on the redox potential have been discussed, and the corresponding electrochemical parameters estimated. A preliminary study on the activation of <b>diazo-compounds</b> by Pt(0) metal centre with formation of symmetrical olefins is described in Chapter IV. Analyses of high-resolution N. M.

40|$|Chemiluminescence is {{considered}} as the inverse of an elementary photochemical reaction. Nine elementary processes {{which could lead}} to luminescence are distinguished on this basis, and illustrated by examples. It is shown that the energy of the emitted quanta can only result from four combinations of bond dissociation energies; the most frequent are association and exchange processes. Moreover, in solution, a blue, violet, or ultra‐violet chemiluminescence can only be due to a reaction involving two free radicals. The quantum yield of such a reaction is necessarily small. The particular case of luminol (3 ‐aminophtalhydrazide) {{is considered}}. The luminescence of alcaline solutions of this substance, even in absence of H 2 O 2, is enhanced by substances known to produce OH and O 2 H radicals in H 2 O 2; for example, oxidizing and reducing agents and <b>diazo‐compounds.</b> This effect practically disappears on thorough outgassing, and the same treatment suppresses completely the spontaneous faint emission of the alcaline solutions (visual observation of estimated sensitivity less than 105 quanta per sec); the presence of O 2 is thus essential for the reaction to take place. The quantum yield of the luminescence, Φ, induced by Fe(CN) 6 K 3 and by NaOCl has been determined in the absence and in presence of H 2 O 2. The light intensities were measured by a photographic method, yielding a mean value Φ = 2, 5. 10 − 3 quanta per molecule of luminol. A mechanism of the oxidation of luminol by monovalent steps is suggested in which the luminescent reaction consists in an association of two different radicals; a dismutation is less probable. One of these radicals, derived from luminol, must be stable and should have semi‐quinonic structure, the other radical must have hydroperoxidic character (HO 2). The analogy with autoxydation reactions is pointed out. Previous data on the chemiluminescence of luminol are in agreement with this mechanism. Copyright © 1953 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
