5|$|After the {{emergence}} of the first or second group of offspring, workers take over the task of foraging and the queen spends most of her time laying eggs and caring <b>for</b> <b>larvae.</b> The colony grows progressively larger and eventually begins to produce males and new queens.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food <b>for</b> <b>larvae.</b> Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g <b>for</b> <b>larvae,</b> as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
50|$|Various {{species of}} Celtis are food plants <b>for</b> the <b>larvae</b> of various species of long-nosed butterfly; the genus Libythea. In particular, Celtis africana {{is the host}} to Libythea labdaca. The leaves also provide food <b>for</b> the <b>larvae</b> of Caloptilia celtina.|$|R
50|$|C. laricella are {{weather and}} {{temperature}} sensitive and natural fluctuations {{from year to}} year can greatly reduce populations. Needle blights which reduce the food supply <b>for</b> <b>larva</b> can also act as a reducing agent. Additionally, native predation and parasitism keep populations in check.|$|R
50|$|Adults have 2 flight seasons each year, one in mid-spring and {{the other}} in late summer. Females lay their eggs on the {{understory}} of the Horkelia clevelandii outer leaves. Eggs take 12-14 days to hatch and about seven weeks <b>for</b> <b>larva</b> to reach full adult maturity.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes {{trees are}} also girdled {{to act as}} trap trees to monitor for emerald ash borer. The {{stressed}} tree attracts egg-laying females {{in the spring and}} trees can be debarked in the fall to search <b>for</b> <b>larvae.</b> If detected, an area is often placed under a quarantine to prevent infested wood material from causing new infestations. Further control measures are then taken within the area to slow population growth by reducing beetle numbers, preventing them from reaching reproductive maturity and dispersing, and reducing the abundance of ash trees.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking <b>for</b> <b>larvae.</b> If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
25|$|Adult bees visit various flora for nectar and pollen. Adults drink nectar, {{and females}} collect pollen <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> {{to feed on}} during development. Males also visit flora for {{aromatic}} compounds, but it is uncertain what these are used for. Listed below {{are some of the}} flora that Eufriesea surinamensis forage from.|$|E

25|$|This {{species is}} predatory and {{typically}} eats live insects, {{but they also}} feed on the flesh of deceased prey. They typically prey on arthropods, including spiders and caterpillars. <b>For</b> <b>larvae</b> to grow into the pupal state, adult workers find prey and bring food back for them. When establishing the colony, the queen goes out in search of nectar and insects for the larvae, as well. This species does not produce honey, though.|$|E
25|$|Growth is a {{function}} of the worker to larvae ratio. The more workers there are, the more opportunities there are <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> to be fed. In B. petiolata, this ratio increased during November and December. This is the time period when gynes were being reared, indicating that there are more workers available to give food to the young that will become a part of the highest caste and need the most nutrition. The amount of food given to larvae influences caste.|$|E
25|$|An inseminated queen {{begins to}} create {{relatively}} small cells {{in which she}} raises around 40 small workers. Workers do not begin to work outside of the hive until July. Queens participate in activities outside the hive until mid-July, when they stay inside the nest and allow workers to do extranidal activities. Early August marks a fully developed nest, containing three combs holding 500 cells and 100 workers. After mid-September, no more eggs are laid and the focus shifts to caring <b>for</b> <b>larvae.</b> The queens die in late October.|$|E

25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} near water, not {{directly}} into it as other mosquitoes do, but typically near a stagnant pool. However, any open container containing water will suffice <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> development, even {{with less than}} an ounce (30 ml) of water. It can also breed in running water, so stagnant pools of water are not its only breeding sites. It {{is more likely to}} lay eggs in water sources near flowers than in water sources without flowers. It has a short flight range (less than 200m), so breeding sites are likely to be close to where this mosquito is found.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clear}} polyethism among A. pallipes where the young workers {{care for the}} larvae and older workers forage and defend the nest. It is {{hypothesized}} that the young workers are delegated {{to stay in the}} nest and care <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> because it is significantly safer {{within the confines of the}} nest while the older workers are outside being exposed to predation in order to increase life expectancy of the workers. Other activities performed by the older workers include removing larvae from the nest, rubbing gaster on the nest and destroying cells. Intra-cell activities like checking cells, moving gaster and self-grooming were all-indicative of younger workers. Therefore, there is a clear relation between age and function thus implying that A. pallipes displays temporal polyethism behavior.|$|E
25|$|Males {{have been}} {{experimentally}} {{shown to be}} capable of deliberately delivering food to larvae when females are absent and food surplus is available. Males feed the larvae with the same proportion of individuals as females. They are, however much less efficient than females at feeding. They spend over 90% of feeding bouts masticating and end up feeding far fewer larvae. The males also preferentially feed the largest larvae, resulting in the death of many smaller and younger larvae. It was only possible to observe this behavior by removing all females from a nest and hand feeding the males, as the males cannot forage on their own and have no opportunity to care <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> if females occupy this role. While males are typically not responsible for feeding larvae in naturally occurring populations, they are capable of doing so.|$|E

These results indicate that egg and larva density peak in winter-spring, with a greater concentration towards the southern zone of the study area. Annually, a clear tendency for egg density to decrease stands out. The signal <b>for</b> <b>larva</b> density is more erratic due to their capacity to avoid the sampling net...|$|R

25|$|If {{there is}} only a single foundress, she will work alone to build the nest and care <b>for</b> <b>larva</b> until they reach adulthood.

500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is an edible species, {{and cooking}} inactivates the enzymes that cause autodigestion or deliquescence—a {{process that can}} begin {{as soon as one}} hour after collection. It is {{considered}} ideal for omelettes, and as a flavor for sauces, although it is [...] "a very delicate species easily spoiled by overcooking". The flavor is so delicate that it is easy to overpower and hide with almost anything. The fungus also appeals to fruit flies of the genus Drosophila, who frequently use the fruit bodies as hosts <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> production.|$|E
500|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, but {{removal of}} the slimy cap cuticle and partial veil is recommended to avoid possible gastrointestinal upset; similarly, the 1992 field guide Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America recommends the {{removal of the}} tube layer before preparation, as it can become slimy during cooking. Opinions {{about the quality of the}} mushroom vary. According to the book Boletes of North America, it is [...] "very good" [...] with a [...] "lemony" [...] flavor. A Canadian field guide is more cautious in its assessment, and suggests that one would have to be brave to consume a mushroom with such a sticky veil. Mycologist David Arora, in his Mushrooms Demystified, opines that it is not worth eating. Whatever its palatibility to humans, the mushroom serves as a habitat <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> of mycophagous insects such as the muscid fly Mydaea discimana and the scuttle fly Megaselia lutea.|$|E

2500|$|Climate {{variations}} {{during the}} fall and summer affect butterfly reproduction. Rainfall, and freezing temperatures affect milkweed growth. Omar Vidal, director general of WWF-Mexico, said [...] "The monarch's lifecycle depends on the climatic conditions in the places where they breed. Eggs, larvae and pupae develop more quickly in milder conditions. Temperatures above 95°F can be lethal <b>for</b> <b>larvae,</b> and eggs dry out in hot, arid conditions, causing a drastic decrease in hatch rate." [...] If a monarch's body temperatures is below 86°F a monarch cannot fly. To warm up they will sit in the sun or rapidly shiver their wings to warm themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Large silk trails help {{increase}} adhesion to {{the host}} plant. As caterpillars advance in groups, they form thick mats of silk that provide them with secure adhesion. Isolated caterpillars have been observed to fall off their host trees and perish. It has been hypothesized that {{this is due to}} the production of thin strands that do not provide a secure grip or due to a faster exhaustion of silk supply. [...] In addition to this, making silk is more costly <b>for</b> <b>larvae</b> in their first instars, so grouping is beneficial in earlier stages. As caterpillars develop, they decrease the use of shared silk.|$|E
2500|$|Rainwater tanks {{may have}} a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute {{quantities}} of water for landscaping/gardening applications {{rather than as a}} potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels, often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or, in some cases, whiskey and wine aging barrels, are often inexpensive. [...] There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in developing countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water. [...] While most are properly engineered to screen out mosquitoes, the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds <b>for</b> <b>larvae.</b> With tanks used for drinking water, the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.|$|E
