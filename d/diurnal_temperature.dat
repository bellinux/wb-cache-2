5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of habitat. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of habitat that it was born into.|$|E
5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Dovi {{developed}} on February 5 {{from an area}} of circulation within the SPCZ near the northern Cook Islands. Dovi therefore saw favourable conditions throughout much of its existence. Due to a mid–level ridge to the east, the cyclone progressed on a southward track. Dovi eventually steered to the southwest, and continued to intensify steadily after fluctuating due to <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variations, becoming a Category1 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on February 8. An anticyclone positioned {{to the west of}} the system moved closer to Dovi, providing an improved environment. After developing an eye later that day, Dovi attained its maximum wind speeds of 205km/h (125mph) sustained over 10minutes. The cyclone then again steered towards the south, encountering high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures. As a result, Dovi quickly weakened as its convection was displaced. While its outflow in its western and southern quadrants remained favorable, elsewhere outflow was deteriorating. On February 10, Dovi's minimum barometric pressure was 980mbar (28.94inHg) as it moved south-southeast at 11km/h (7mph). The weakening Dovi became an extratropical cyclone on February 11. The remnants continued drifting southwest; the Meteorological Service of New Zealand in Wellington stopped issuing information on it on February 13.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{modifications}} {{caused by}} low tunnels made of perforated transparent polyethylene were determineted {{in an area}} alocated at the Federal University of Santa Maria, RS. The perforation densities were 100, 200, 300 and 400 perforations per square meter, corresponding respectively to 0. 78 % (T 1), 1. 57 % CT 2), 2. 35 % (T 3) and 3. 14 % (T 4) of area perforated. The results indicated that perforation density did not significantly affected solar energy availability. As perforation density increased there was a decrease on the average <b>diurnal</b> air <b>temperature</b> which demonstrated the viability of ventilating low tunnels with perforated plastic.

25|$|The Sangiovese grape {{performs}} {{better when}} it can receive more direct sunlight, which is a benefit of the many hillside vineyards in Tuscany. The majority of the region's vineyards are found at altitudes of 500–1600 feet (150–500 meters).

25|$|While {{the climate}} of Pomerol is broadly similar {{to the rest of}} Bordeaux in the {{maritime}} influence, the region's distance from the sea and the Gironde estuary make the climate distinctly more continental than that of the Médoc. This means that Pomerol sees more <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variation during the growing season, between daytime highs and evening lows. Also while the region experiences more rainfall during the spring (which can cause problems for Merlot during flowering) there is overall significantly less rainfall during the summer months after veraison.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} {{to determine whether the}} dormancy release effect of hydrated storage in darkness (dark-stratification) is common amongst annual ryegrass populations and has the potential to occur under field conditions. Dormant seeds from all populations tested (22) became sensitive to light during dark-stratification, enabling them to germinate when subsequently exposed to light. Under controlled temperature (25 / 15 degreesC), light (12 -h photoperiod), and hydration (solidified agar-water) conditions, more seeds germinated by 28 days if the first 14 days were in darkness followed by exposure to light for 12 h per day than if they were exposed to light throughout or darkness throughout. Constraint over the conditions imposed during dark-stratification and germination was gradually reduced to investigate whether the dormancy release effect was diminished. Dark-stratification was effective in promoting germination when performed under natural <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and burial in moist soil provided suitable conditions for dark-stratification to occur. The surface of moist soil, with natural <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperatures</b> and sunlight, was suitable for germination of dark-stratified seeds. Dark-stratification is a quick and effective means to enhance the sensitivity of dormant annual ryegrass seeds to light, enabling {{the majority of the population}} to germinate. However, large quantities of light are required to promote germination of dark-stratified seeds, so buried seeds must be moved to the soil surface to allow exposure to adequate light for germination...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} is developed for removing data scatter in the thermal-inertia approach to remote sensing of soil moisture which arises from environmental variability {{in time and}} space. It entails the utilization of nearby National Weather Service air temperature measurements to normalize measured <b>diurnal</b> surface <b>temperature</b> variations to {{what they would have}} been for a day of standard <b>diurnal</b> air <b>temperature</b> variation, arbitrarily assigned to be 18 C. Tests of the procedure's basic premise on a bare loam soil and a crop of alfalfa indicate it to be conceptually sound.

25|$|Climate varies {{throughout}} the Great Basin by elevation, latitude, and other factors. Higher elevations {{tend to be}} cooler and receive more precipitation. The western areas of the basin tend to be drier than the eastern areas because of the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada. Most of the basin experiences a semi-arid or arid climate with warm summers and cold winters. However, some of the mountainous areas in the basin are high enough in elevation to experience an Alpine climate. Due to the region's altitude and aridity, most areas in the Great Basin experience a substantial <b>Diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variation.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary source}} of rain in the Sahara is the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a {{continuous}} belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and southern Sahara. Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by: extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of relative humidity; a significant <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variation; and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Some days in {{the winter}} and spring can be warm and {{extremely}} dry, with Chinook winds often raising temperatures to near 70°F (21°C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90°F (32°C) in April. Windsor's elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68°F (20°C), even in the very hottest part of the summer. The <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime high and nighttime low not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall months. Rapid fluctuation in temperature is also common – a sunny 80°F (27°C) October afternoon can easily give way to a 28°F (-2°C) blizzard within 12 hours.|$|E
30|$|The Middle Rio Grande basin {{experiences}} a mild semiarid to continental climate, characterized by low precipitation, high light intensity, low humidity, {{and a wide}} range of annual and <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperatures</b> (Western Regional Climate Center 2006). Most precipitation falls during the peak monsoon months of July and August, with the rest somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year (Lenart 2007 b). Monsoon strength and area affected typically vary between years (Lenart 2007 b). Peak river flows usually occur during the spring snowmelt period. Prior to river regulation, these flows resulted in floods during high snowpack years (Molles et al. 1998). Occasional high flows also occur as a result of late summer monsoons and winter and spring Pacific storms (Lenart 2007 a).|$|R

25|$|Lunar lava tubes form a {{potentially}} important location for constructing a future lunar base, {{which may be}} used for local exploration and development, or as a human outpost to serve exploration beyond the Moon. A lunar lava cave potential has long been suggested and discussed in literature and thesis. Any intact lava tube on the Moon could serve as a shelter from the severe environment of the lunar surface, with its frequent meteorite impacts, high-energy ultraviolet radiation and energetic particles, and extreme <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variations. Following the launch of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, many lunar lava tubes have been imaged. These lunar pits are found in several locations across the Moon, including Marius Hills, Mare Ingenii and Mare Tranquillitatis.|$|E
25|$|Chile is a long, narrow {{country that}} is {{geographically}} and climatically dominated by the Andes {{to the east and}} the Pacific Ocean to the west. Chile's vineyards are found along an 800-mile stretch of land from Atacama Region to the Bio-Bio Region in the south. The climate is varied with the northern regions being very hot and dry compared to the cooler, wetter regions in the south. In the Valle Central around Santiago, the climate is dry with an average of 15inches (38 centimeters) of rain and little risk of springtime frost. The proximity to the Dry Andes help create a wide <b>diurnal</b> <b>temperature</b> variation between day and nighttime temperatures. This cool drop in temperature is vital in maintaining the grapes' acidity levels.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{this type}} of {{fingerprint}} work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports {{the case for a}} pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in snowpack, maximum and minimum (<b>diurnal)</b> <b>temperature,</b> and the seasonal timing of runoff over mountainous regions of the western United States. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in hurricane formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.|$|E

50|$|In humans, a diurnal {{variation}} {{has been observed}} dependent on the periods of rest and activity, lowest at 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. and peaking at 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monkeys also have a well-marked and regular {{diurnal variation}} of body temperature that follows periods of rest and activity, and is not dependent on the incidence of day and night; nocturnal monkeys reach their highest body temperature at night and lowest during the day. Sutherland Simpson and J.J.
