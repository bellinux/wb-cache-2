50|$|This {{route is}} very {{successful}} for higher order alkanes {{due to the}} fact that there is no formation of strong metal-carbon or metal-hydrogen bonds that could prevent any intermediates from reacting further. The reactions also take place in room temperature under mild conditions. However, when applying this method to methane specifically, the gaseous nature of methane requires an appropriate solvent. Reactions with other alkanes usually have the alkane in question be the solvent itself; however, any C-H bond with a lower BDE or higher polarity than methane will react first and prevent methane functionalization. Therefore, Pérez, Asensio, Etienne, et al. developed a solution to use supercritical carbon dioxide as the solvent, which is formed under the critical pressure of 73 bar and a temperature of 31 °C. In these conditions, scCO2 behaves as a liquid, and since fluorinated compounds can dissolve easily in scCO2, highly fluorinated silver-based catalysts were developed and tested with methane and ethyl diazoacetate. However, under the reaction conditions, only 19% yield of <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> was able to be achieved. The reaction depends on a delicate balance between methane pressure and catalyst concentration, and consequently more work is being done to further improve yields.|$|E

The presence of bile caused a 25 % decrease in cholesterol dissolving capacity of both MTBE and <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> (p < 0. 0001). This inhibitory effect of bile could be overcome {{by the addition of}} dimethyl-sulphoxide: dimethylsulphoxide caused an increase in cholesterol dissolving capacity of MTBE and <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> the increase depending on the dimethyl-sulphoxide/bile ratio in the mixture.

Journal of Dairy Science, 86, (5), 1789 - 1796. Sponsorship: Lallemand Animal Nutrition, Cedex, FranceThe preservation of crimped wheat grains by three bacterial inoculants or a chemical additive was compared. Crimped wheat grain [56. 8 g dry matter (DM) /kg] was conserved in 1. 75 -kg plastic bag, mini-silos without treatment, with 4 L/tonne of Crimpstore (CS; an additive containing {{a mixture of}} ammonium formate, <b>propionate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> benzoate, and benzoate, SAS Kelvin Cave, Ltd., UK) or 1 x 105 cfu/g of each of three inoculant additives containing Lactobacillus fermentum (A), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (B), and Lactobacillus buchneri (C). Six replicates were conserved per treatment. Ensiling DM losses, chemical composition, fermentation characteristics, and aerobic stability were measured in the silages after 68 d of ensiling. All the silages were well fermented and remained stable for 84 h after aeration. Subsequently, the rate of deterioration was slowest in crimped grains treated with CS treatment, followed by those treated with inoculant C, while those treated with inoculant A deteriorated most rapidly. Residual water-soluble carbohydrate concentration was higher in crimped grains treated with CS than those treated with the inoculants. Ammonia nitrogen concentrations were lowest in CS-treated crimped grains, followed by inoculants C and A. DM losses were greater in CS-treated crimped grains than in crimped grains treated with inoculants A and C. In vivo digestibility was also measured in Texel-cross lambs fed a grass silage basal diet supplemented with the additive-treated crimped grains or a conventional, lamb finisher concentrate. Dry matter intake and digestibility were unaffected by treatment. In conclusion, bacterial inoculants containing L. buchneri are promising preservatives for crimped wheat grains. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A comparison with experimental data shows that incorporating the connectivity {{of the pore}} network and considering percolation processes associated with different molecular sizes of the adsorptives in the mixture, {{as well as their}} different corresponding accessibility, can improve the prediction of binary adsorption equilibria using the LAST Selectivity of adsorption for the larger molecule in binary systems increases with an increase in the pore-network coordination number, as well with an increase in the mean pore width and in the spread of the pore-size distribution...|$|E
40|$|Even in {{the context}} of hydrocarbons’ general {{resistance}} to selective functionalization, methane’s volatility and strong bonds pose a particular challenge. We report here that silver complexes bearing perfluorinated indazolylborate ligands catalyze the reaction of methane (CH 4) with ethyl diazoacetate (N 2 CHCO 2 Et) to yield <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> (CH 3 CH 2 CO 2 Et). The use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) as the solvent is key to the reaction’s success. Although the catalyst is only sparingly soluble in CH 4 /CO 2 mixtures, optimized conditions presently result in a 19 % yield of <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> (based on starting quantity of the diazoester) at 40 °C over 14 hours.

40|$|RESTRITOThe main {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyze the volatile compounds extracted from fermented grape musts by two extraction methods in order to characterize the samples. The purge and trap system provided the necessary sensitivity for the analysis of low-boiling point compounds, such as acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate, and the liquid–liquid extraction method allowed for the analysis of a great number of medium to high boiling point volatile compounds, such as phenylethyl alcohol, hexanoic and octanoic acids, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> and propyl acetate, extracted by the liquid–liquid method, characterized the sample of grape must fermented by Kloeckera apiculata. The sample of grape must fermented by Pichia membranaefaciens was characterized by 2 -propanol and 2 -hexanone, extracted by the purge and trap system and liquid–liquid method, respectively. These results show that the purge and trap/dynamic headspace system and liquid–liquid extraction method are complementary in the determination of the aroma profiles of fermented grape musts and characterization of the samples...|$|E
40|$|Response {{of adults}} of the West Indian {{sugarcane}} weevil,Metamasius hemipterus sericeus, to various semiochemical treatments and physical trap designs was studied in southern Florida in field-grown banana and Canary Island date palms. Ethyl acetate released alone at 860 – 1007 mg/day was as effective for the capture ofM. h. sericeus {{as a combination}} of ethyl acetate (844 – 919 mg/day), <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> (348 – 362 mg/day), and ethyl butyrate (117 – 137 mg/day) and in one trial was more effective than fermenting sugarcane (250 g), <b>ethyl</b> <b>propionate</b> alone (353 – 384 mg/day), ethyl butyrate alone (123 – 174 mg/day), or no treatment. Ethyl acetate released alone at 675 – 683 mg/day was as attractive as 250 g of fermenting sugarcane or the racemic blend of the male-produced aggregation pheromones [(±) - 5 -methyl-nonan- 4 -ol and (±) - 2 -methyl-heptan- 4 -ol (8 : 1 ratio) “metalure”] at 3 mg/day. Weevil counts increased with binary combinations of ethyl acetate, sugarcane, and/or metalure over these treatments alone and the ternary combination was {{two to three times}} more effective than any of the binary treatments. Attraction to ethyl acetate released alone at 777 mg/day with metalure was greater than to the hydrolysis products of ethyl acetate (ethanol and/or acetic acid each released at about 6 – 8 mg/day) with metalure. Weevil counts from traps baited with 250 g of sugarcane and metalure increased with increasing dose of ethyl acetate to about 400 mg/day and then appeared to plateau. Ethyl acetate (about 700 mg/day) and metalure increased weevil counts in traps with increasing amounts of sugarcane (0 – 2 kg). Molasses (45 g) + water (158 ml) substitutes for sugarcane were about as effective for capturingM. h. sericeus as 250 g of fermenting sugarcane [all treatments with ethyl acetate (847 mg/day) and metalure]. Early experiments used a lethal pitfall trap. We demonstrated that several alternative trap designs were more effective than the lethal pitfall trap for capturing weevils. Color and height (on ground vs. 1 m on pole) did not affect trap efficacy when baited with the ternary combination of ethyl acetate (672 – 825 mg/day), sugarcane (250 g), and metalure.
