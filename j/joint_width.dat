40|$|The {{construction}} of Concrete Block Pavement (CBP) on slopes provides interesting challenges for road engineers. The horizontal (inclined) forces exerted {{on the road}} surface are greatly increased due to traffic accelerating (uphill) and braking (downhill). These forces will cause horizontal creep of the blocks down the slope, resulting in opening of joints {{at the top of}} the road section. The objective of this study was investigate the effect of parameters include degree of slope, laying pattern, <b>joint</b> <b>width,</b> and thickness of paving block on the performance of CBP on slopes. A laboratory-scale test was used to study these parameters based on steel frame horizontal force and push in tests. Three different laying pattern (stretcher bond, herringbone 90 o and herringbone 45 o) and <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> (3 mm, 5 mm and 7 mm) were used in the test program. The pavement responses are characterized in terms of horizontal creep and deflection due to applied load for half of an allowable single axle limit. The results indicate that herringbone 45 o laying pattern and 3 mm <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> performed best on slopes section. The 100 mm paver thickness is found to be more stable than 60 mm thickness from aspect horizontal force resistant.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{differences}} in mechanical properties amongst different welded joints’ regions obviously affect the strain distribution around the crack tip during the fracture test and, hence, influence the toughness value. The strength mis-match and width of welded joint {{have an effect}} on the stress-strain distribution in the vicinity of the crack tip. Both can contribute to a higher constraint in the weld metal. It was found that the width of the welded joint as constraint parameter has an effect on the limit load, maximum load and achieved fracture toughness values of a welded joint. In the case of strength overmatched welded joints, the limit and maximum loads increase with constraint (welded <b>joint</b> <b>width)</b> decrease. On the contrary, in the case of strength under-match welded joints the limit and maximum loads decrease and the constraint (welded <b>joint</b> <b>width)</b> decreases...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 In recent decades, {{many state}} DOTs have {{implemented}} ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) in bridge construction {{because of its}} advanced mechanical properties beyond those of conventional concrete. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has extensively tested a proprietary class of UHPC, but WSDOT has been hesitant to adopt this mix because of its high cost and associated high risk. In this study, a mix design developed by Washington State University was tested for its structural performance when used in a reinforced spliced connection between adjacent concrete deck-bulb tee (DBT) bridge decks. The important parameter for this application is the bond strength of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars to the UHPC {{as well as the}} tension strength of the UHPC when the rebar in the connection is stressed axially in tension. ASTM-standard test procedures in this study showed that compressive strengths up to 16 ksi, tension strengths above 2 ksi, and bond strengths up to 7 ksi can be achieved with this particular UHPC, all with improved ductility beyond that of conventional concrete due largely to the steel fiber reinforcement. Structural experiments were performed on idealized “bond curbs” as well as a section of deck representing actual DBT girders to determine the available bond strength and the corresponding required <b>joint</b> <b>width.</b> These experiments and the subsequent analysis showed that a UHPC <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> of 7. 11 inches, corresponding to a splice length of 5. 11 inches, is satisfactory to fracture the reinforcement within the connection.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact of axial {{traction}} during acquisition of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography of the wrist with regard to <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> and amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (12 male, mean age 38. 1 years) were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study. Three-compartment wrist MR arthrographies were performed between October and December 2009 on a 3 T unit using a fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted isotropic high-resolution volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) sequence in the coronal plane, with and without axial traction (3 kg). Two radiologists measured radiocarpal (radioscaphoid, radiolunate) and midcarpal (lunocapitate, hamatolunate) <b>joint</b> space <b>widths,</b> with and without traction, and assessed the amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces using a three-point scale: 0 = absence, 1 = partial, 2 = complete. RESULTS: With traction, <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> increased significantly at the radioscaphoid (Delta = 0. 78 mm, P < 0. 01), radiolunate (Delta = 0. 18 mm, P < 0. 01), and lunocapitate (Delta = 0. 45 mm, P < 0. 01) spaces, and both observers detected significantly more contrast material between the cartilage surfaces. At the hamatolunate space, the differences in <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> (Delta = 0. 14 mm, P = 0. 54) and amount of contrast material were not significant.

The radiographic grading of OA in the knee was performed by using the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria and the <b>joint</b> space <b>width.</b> The 71 patients with knee OA were divided into two groups: 37 patients exhibiting generalized osteoarthritis (GOA) and 34 non-GOA patients, according to the grading of their hand radiograph. C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary pyridinoline, YKL- 40, plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3, MMP- 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1 were measured as the biochemical markers of arthritis. The radiographic grading with the Kellgren-Lawrence scale revealed a significant relationship to the <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> (P = 0. 003) : the <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> decreased with increasing Kellgren-Lawrence grade.

40|$|A robust {{solder joint}} in {{crystalline}} silicon solar cell assembly {{is necessary to}} ensure its thermo-mechanical reliability. The solder joint formed using optimal parameter setting accumulates minimal creep strain energy density which leads to longer fatigue life. In this study, thermo-mechanical reliability of solder joint in crystalline silicon solar cell assembly is evaluated using finite element modelling (FEM) and Taguchi method. Geometric models of the crystalline silicon solar cell assembly are built and subjected to accelerated thermal cycling utilizing IEC 61215 standard for photovoltaic panels. In order to obtain the model with minimum accumulated creep strain energy density, the L 9 (33) orthogonal array was applied to Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) to investigate the effects of IMC thickness (IMCT), solder <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> (SJW) and solder joint thickness (SJT) on the thermo-mechanical reliability of solder joints.

We retrospectively examined 120 standardised X-rays of patients with advanced osteoarthritis of the shoulder. Exclusion criteria included rotator cuff tear, severe glenoid erosion or protrusion. Measurements of <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> at three levels in each plane (anteroposterior and axillary view), humeral head diameter and size of humeral osteophytes were made by two independent examiners. Osteoarthritis was graded according to Samilson and Prieto. Seventy-five of these patients had a complete record from the clinical investigation (pain record on VAS scale, active and passive range of motion) and the constant score (CS). Mean <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> in the central anteroposterior level was 1. 46  mm[*]±[*] 1. 08 and in the central axillary 0. 98  mm[*]±[*] 1. 02. Increasing age was positively correlated with joint space narrowing at all measured levels. The <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> was not correlated with the Samilson grade or the size of osteophytes.

40|$|In {{concrete}} block pavements, the blocks {{make up the}} wearing surface and are a major load-spreading component of the pavement. This research investigate the anchor beam spacing of {{concrete block}} pavement (CBP) on sloping road section based {{on the degree of}} slope, laying pattern, blocks shape, blocks thickness, <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> between blocks and bedding sand thickness. The results of a series of tests conducted in laboratory with horizontal force test and push-in test in several degrees of slopes. The horizontal force testing installation was constructed within the steel frame 2. 00 x 2. 00 metre and forced from the side until CBP failure (maximum horizontal creep). For the applied push-in test in a rigid steel box of 1. 00 x 1. 00 metre square in plan and 0. 20 meter depth, the vertical load was increased from zero to 51 kN on the CBP sample in 0 %, 4 %, 8 % and 12 % degrees of slopes. The herringbone 45 o is the best laying pattern compared to herringbone 90 o and stretcher bond to restraint the horizontal force, which the blocks contribute as a whole to the friction of the pavement, the blocks being successively locked by their rotation following their horizontal creep. The uni-pave block shape has more restraint of horizontal creep than rectangular block shape, because uni-pave block shape has gear (four-dents), while rectangular block shape has no gear (dents). The difference in deflections observed between uni-pave shape and rectangular shape are small. The change in block thickness from 60 to 100 mm significantly reduces the elastic deflection of pavement. The optimum <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> between blocks is 3 mm. For joint widths less than the optimum, the jointing sand was unable to enter between blocks. The relationship between push-in force with block displacement on the varying loose thicknesses of 30, 50, and 70 mm bedding sand, shows that the deflections of pavement increase with increase in loose thickness of bedding sand. The higher the loose bedding sand thickness, the more the deflection will be. The effect of the degree of slope on concrete block pavements on sloping road section area is significant with friction between blocks and thrusting action between adjacent blocks at hinging points is more effective with thicker blocks. Thus, deflections are much less for thicker blocks with increasing degree of the slope. The spacing of anchor beam is increase with decreasing <b>joint</b> <b>width,</b> degree of slope and bedding sand thickness. To compare results between laboratory test with the simulated mechanical behaviour of concrete block pavements, a structural model based on a Three Dimensional Finite Element Model (3 DFEM) for CBP was employed. The concept of HALI development, including design, fabrication, calibration and performance monitoring is presented. Before HALI can be greatly introduced highway research institutions, the equipment was tested with 1 m x 5. 4 m test pavement and subjected to 10, 000 cycles of load repetition. Additional tests, including shear resistance, skid resistance, and impact resistance were also conducted {{in order to have a}} better understanding of the effects of the pavement behaviour tested under HALI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Under the earthquake, {{pounding}} {{between the}} beam and the bridge abutment causes great damages to skew girder bridge, and current study on pounding response is still less as the collision effect is complex. In order {{to study the}} displacement and collision force under Elcentro and Tianjin ground motion, a three-dimensional finite element computational model for seismic pounding of a 16 m simply supported skew girder bridge was established and nonlinear time-history analysis was carried out with pounding element designed to simulate the pounding effect between beam and abutment. The {{results show that the}} displacement of side beam is more than that of middle beam in simply supported skew girder bridge. The maximum collision force of the side beam is more than that of middle beam, and the beam pounds the abutment several times. Appropriate expansion <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> should be set according to the displacement of the side beam when the expansion joint designed...|$|E

In this work, a three-dimensional (3 D) transient model for sequentially coupled thermal/mechanical analysis of laser transmission joining of 0. 1 mm thick PET film and 0. 1 mm stainless steel {{has been developed}} by using the ANSYS parametric design language APLD, along with a moving Gaussian laser heat source. It can be calculated {{how long it takes}} to reach the quasi-steady state through the stimulation of the temperature field. The calculated values of the <b>joint</b> <b>width</b> are in good agreement with the experimental results by comparison under conditions of different parameters, which indicates that the model is reliable and is helpful for optimizing process parameters. Then based on the temperature field, the residual stress field distribution on both PET and stainless steel surface is achieved by applying the indirect coupling methods to the analysis. this study also has laid a theoretical foundation for improving the stress distribution on the joint...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} pilot study was to quantify radiographic changes in subchondral bone after treatment with a minimally invasive joint unloading implant (KineSpring® Knee Implant System). Methods: Nine patients with unilateral medial knee OA resistant to nonsurgical therapy were treated with the KineSpring System and followed for 2 years. Main outcomes included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, function, and stiffness subscores and independent core laboratory determinations of <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> and fractal signature of the tibial cortex. Results: WOMAC scores, on average, improved by 92 % for pain, 91 % for function, and 79 % for stiffness over the 2 -year follow-up period. <b>Joint</b> space <b>width</b> in the medial compartment of the treated knee significantly increased from 0. 9 mm at baseline to 3. 1 mm at 2 years; <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> in the medial compartment of the untreated knee was unchanged. Fractal signatures of the vertically oriented trabeculae in the medial compartment decreased by 2. 8 % in the treated knee and increased by 2. 1 % in the untreated knee over 2 years. No statistically significant fractal signature changes were observed in the horizontally oriented trabeculae in the medial compartment or in the horizontal or vertical trabeculae of the lateral compartment in the treated knee. Conclusion: Preliminary {{evidence suggests that the}} KineSpring System may modify knee OA disease progression by increasing <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> and improving subchondral bone trabecular integrity, thereby reducing pain and improving joint function.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} a cut off value {{for changes in}} radiological <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> that allowed definition of radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis not related to measurement method errors and, thereafter, to determine factors predictive of radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis and to evaluate the correlations between clinical and radiological parameters. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal (one year duration), multicentre study was made of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip (American College of Rheumatology criteria). Data on clinical activity (pain, functional impairment), demographic data (age, gender, body mass index), and femoral head migration (superolateral, superomedial, concentric) were collected when the patient entered the study; radiological grade (<b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> in millimetres at the narrowest point using a 0. 1 mm graduated magnifying glass, evaluated by a single observer unaware of the chronology of the films) was recorded at the patient's entry to the study and after one year. RESULTS: Analysis {{of the means of}} the differences between two analyses performed by a single observer of 30 pairs of radiographs (one performed after an interval of one year) (0. 06 (SD 0. 23)) suggested that a change of more than 0. 56 mm (2 SD) after a one year follow up could define progression of osteoarthritis of the hip. Of the 508 patients recruited, 461 (91 %) completed the one year follow up and radiological progression was observed in 102 (22 %). The factors predictive of radiological progression that were identified in the multivariate analysis were: radiological <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> at entry 10, age at entry > 65 years (odds ratios 2. 11, 4. 25, 2. 51, 2. 66, 1. 90, respectively). The level of clinical parameters (pain, functional impairment) and the amount of symptomatic treatment required (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesic intake) accounted for 20 % (p < 0. 0001) of the variability of the changes in radiological <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> over the one year study period. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis could be defined by a change in <b>joint</b> space <b>width</b> of at least 0. 6 mm after a one year follow up period, is correlated with the changes in clinical status of the patients, and is related not only to demographic data (age, gender), but also to some specific characteristics of osteoarthritis (localisation, radiological severity, clinical activity) ...|$|R
