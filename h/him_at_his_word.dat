5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, the wording of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
5|$|In June 1399, Louis, Duke of Orléans, {{gained control}} of the court of the insane Charles VI of France. The policy of {{rapprochement}} with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, {{and for this reason}} he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England. With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399. Men {{from all over the country}} soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> and declined to interfere. The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke. Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July. He made his way to Conwy, where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations. On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September.|$|E
25|$|Questioned by police, Collins flatly denied {{even knowing}} Schell, and insisted {{he had spent}} the weekend of June 29–30 with his mother at her house in the Detroit suburb of Center Line, and had not {{returned}} to Ypsilanti until the morning of July 1. Initially, police took <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> and did not seek to verify his alibi.|$|E

But I {{want you to give}} me another chance and I'll try not to make you pay for it, either," [...] he added, with a flicker of his saucy humor.|$|R

25|$|According to {{the popular}} story, Godiva took pity {{on the people of}} Coventry, who were {{suffering}} grievously under her husband's oppressive taxation. She appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to remit the tolls. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride through the streets of the town. Godiva took <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> and, after issuing a proclamation that all persons should keep within doors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her long hair. In the end, Godiva's husband keeps his word and abolishes the onerous taxes. However, known facts do not corroborate the legend.|$|E
500|$|J. Gresham Barrett {{brought up}} {{legislation}} in the U.S. House of Representatives which, among other things, referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Congress members Tom Lantos, Jim Saxton, Thad McCotter, Chris Shays, Charles Boustany, Alcee Hastings, and Robert Wexler referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in their speeches supporting the legislation. Shortly before a speech by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, U.S. Congressman Dennis Hastert said, [...] "He [...] denounces terrorism, and I have to take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word.</b> Hezbollah is a terrorist organization." ...|$|E
500|$|Ready to Die {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. In his review for Rolling Stone, Cheo H. Cocker stated [...] "Ready to Die {{is the strongest}} solo rap debut since Ice Cube's Amerikkka's Most Wanted. From the breathtakingly visual moments of his birth to his Cobainesque end in [...] "Suicidal Thoughts," [...] B.I.G. proves a captivating listen. It's difficult {{to get him out}} of your head once you sample what he has to offer". Robert Christgau from The Village Voice commented [...] "His sex raps are erotic, his jokes are funny, and his music makes the thug life sound scary rather than luxuriously laid back. When he considers suicide, I not only take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> I actively hope he finds another way". The New York Times wrote [...] "Though drug dealing carries tremendous heroic value with some young urban dwellers, he sacrifices the figure's romantic potential. His raps acknowledge both the excitement of drug dealing and the stress caused by the threat from other dealers, robbers, the police and parents, sometimes one's own. In presenting the downside of that life, Ready to Die offers perhaps the most balanced and honest portrait of the dealer's life of any in hip-hop".|$|E
60|$|The unfortnit {{part of it}} {{was that}} George took <b>'im</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> {{and all the rest of}} the v'y'ge he acted as though Bob belonged to 'im, and by the time we got into the London river Bob couldn't call his soul 'is own.

60|$|Colonel Harris {{thought all}} that sort of thing so easy. One always does before one has had a genuine tussle with the {{unpleasant}} realities of life; to the good country squire with an assured position, an assured income, assured influence, it seemed very easy indeed to insist. He himself never had to insist; things occurred round <b>him</b> and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> as it were, of themselves.|$|R
60|$|De Stancy went. When he {{had gone}} a few steps he turned his head.

5000|$|After the credits, {{the scene}} shifts to Kazuya, who {{walks out of}} the arena and realizes that he lost control of the Jackhammers, who refuse to salute <b>him.</b> Back <b>at</b> Heihachi's execution, he kneels in front of a Jackhammer, who is holding <b>him</b> <b>at</b> gunpoint. <b>His</b> final <b>words</b> are: [...] "I am Heihachi Mishima. I...am...Tekken. You will obey." [...] The Jackhammer lowers down his gun and obeys his command.|$|R

6000|$|This (to a {{young man}} like me) was unendurable insolence. I had {{hitherto}} refrained from taking <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own bitter <b>word</b> {{in the matter of}} nick-name. In the irritation of the moment, I now first resolved to adopt his suggestion seriously. The next slip of paper that I handed to him administered the smartest rebuff that my dull brains could discover {{on the spur of the}} moment: [...] "The Cur is requested to keep his advice till he is asked for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 5. As he is thus, so again, {{he is said}} to be 'higher {{than the}} heavens.' For such an High Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, and undefiled, {{separate}} from sinners, and made higher than the heavens. The text saith, that neither saint, nor heavens, are clean in God's sight. 'Behold he puts no trust in his servants,' he chargeth his angels with folly; and again, 'Behold he putteth no trust in his saints, yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight' (Job 4:18, 15:15). Wherefore, by this expression, he shows us that our High Priest is more noble than either heaven or angel: yea, more clean and perfect than any. It shows us also that all the heavenly host are <b>at</b> <b>his</b> command, to do as his intercession shall prevail with the Father for us. All angels worship <b>him,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> they become, they all become ministering spirits for them who shall be heirs of salvation.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{could be}} more disagreeable than such an interview, {{but he could not}} allow himself to be guilty of the cowardice of declining it. Of a {{personal}} quarrel with Burton he was not afraid. He felt, indeed, that he might almost find relief in the capability of being himself angry with any one. But he must positively make up his mind before such an interview. He must devote himself either to Florence or to Julia; and {{he did not know how}} to abandon the one or the other. He had allowed himself to be so governed by impulse that he had pledged himself to Lady Ongar, and had sworn to her that he would be entirely hers. She, it is true, had not taken <b>him</b> altogether <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> but not the less did he know--did he think that he knew--that she looked for the performance of his promise. And she had been the first that he had sworn to love! ...|$|R
60|$|Helen {{was deeply}} wounded by this visit, and was sorely tempted to take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> {{and end the}} production, but she did not. She could not, so deep had her {{interest}} in him become. Loyal to him she must remain, loyal to his work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Jones," [...] {{said the}} lawyer, seeming to pay no {{attention}} whatever to Mollett's words, [...] "you know nothing of such men as that. If I were to take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> now, he would turn upon Sir Thomas again before three weeks were over." ...|$|E

6000|$|The uproar of {{the dogs}} had brought a servant to the door, a tall, hard-fisted country clown, with a livery coat put over the under-garments of a ploughman. I {{requested}} to see {{the master of the}} house, but was told he was at dinner with some [...] "gemmen" [...] of the neighborhood. I made known my business and sent in to know if I might talk with the master about his cattle; for I felt a great desire to have a peep <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> orgies. <b>Word</b> was returned that he was engaged with company, and could not attend to business, but that if I would [...] "step in and take a drink of something, I was heartily welcome." [...] I accordingly entered the hall, where whips and hats of all kinds and shapes were lying on an oaken table, two or three clownish servants were lounging about; everything had a look of confusion and carelessness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me get at him!" [...] yelled Mullens; {{and the men}} {{who held}} <b>him,</b> taking Vincent <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word,</b> {{released}} <b>him.</b> He rushed forward, but was received with another tremendous blow on the mouth. He paused a moment in his rush, and Vincent, springing forward, administered another blow upon the same spot, knocking him off his legs on to the floor. On getting up he gave no sign of a desire to renew the conflict. His lips were badly cut and the blood was streaming from his mouth, and he looked at Vincent with an air of absolute bewilderment. The latter, seeing that the conflict was over, quietly resumed his seat; while several of the passengers came up to him, and, shaking him warmly by the hand, congratulated him upon having punished his assailant.|$|R
60|$|Half a {{dozen of}} them were holding Drexley--a pitiable sight. His coat was torn, his eyes seemed {{starting}} from his sockets, his breath reeked of brandy and his face was pale with passion. Opposite him was Douglas, his cheek bleeding from the sudden blow which Drexley had struck him, gazing with blank surprise <b>at</b> <b>his</b> late assailant. Some one had told him that Drexley was there, had been drinking brandy all day and was already verging on madness, and he had gone at once into the little bar, hoping to be able to quieten <b>him.</b> But <b>at</b> <b>his</b> first <b>words</b> Drexley had sprung upon him like a wild animal--nothing but his own great personal strength and the prompt intervention of all the men who were present had saved the attack from being a murderous one. There had been no words--no sort of explanation. None came now--Drexley was furious but silent.|$|R
60|$|Henchard went home, {{apparently}} satisfied. But in the morning, {{when his}} jealous temper had passed away, his heart sank within him {{at what he}} had said and done.

60|$|When I {{arranged}} with Mr. Hudson for {{the publication of}} an American Edition of A Little Boy Lost, I asked him to write a special foreword to his American readers.

60|$|But {{the strangest}} fact {{connected}} with French or indeed with human Suspicion, is perhaps this of Camille Desmoulins. Camille's head, {{one of the}} clearest in France, has got itself so saturated through every fibre with Preternaturalism of Suspicion, that looking back on that Twelfth of July 1789, when the thousands rose round <b>him,</b> yelling responsive <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>word</b> in the Palais Royal Garden, and took cockades, he finds it explicable only on this hypothesis, That they were all hired to do it, and set on by the Foreign and other Plotters. 'It was not for nothing,' says Camille with insight, 'that this multitude burst up round me when I spoke!' No, not for nothing. Behind, around, before, it is one huge Preternatural Puppet-play of Plots; Pitt pulling the wires. (See Histoire des Brissotins, par Camille Desmoulins, a Pamphlet of Camille's, Paris, 1793.) Almost I conjecture that I Camille myself am a Plot, and wooden with wires.--The force of insight could no further go.|$|R
60|$|Captain Broughton {{was almost}} as much {{surprised}} as delighted by {{the warmth of the}} acknowledgment made by the eager-hearted passionate girl whom he now held within his arms. She had said it now; the words had been spoken; and there was nothing for her but to swear to him over and over again with her sweetest oaths, that those words were true--true as her soul. And very sweet was the walk down from thence to the parsonage gate. He spoke no more of the distance of the ground, or the length of his day's journey. But he stopped her at every turn that he might press her arm the closer to his own, that he might look into the brightness of her eyes, and prolong his hour of delight. There were no more gibes now on her tongue, no raillery <b>at</b> <b>his</b> London finery, no laughing comments on his coming and going. With downright honesty she told him everything: how she had loved him before her heart was warranted in such a passion; how, with much thinking, she had resolved that it would be unwise to take <b>him</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> first <b>word,</b> and had thought it better that he should return to London, and then think over it; how she had almost repented of her courage when she had feared, during those long summer days, that he would forget her; and how her heart had leapt for joy when her old friend had told her that he was coming.|$|R
60|$|Borrowdean, if {{he possessed}} no conscience, was not {{altogether}} free from some kindred eccentricity. He was reminded sharply {{enough of the}} fact about one o'clock the next morning, when {{the door of the}} little house on Merton Street was suddenly opened before he could touch the bell. Framed in a little slanting gleam of light, Hester, still wearing her plain black gown, stood and looked <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>His</b> careless <b>words</b> of explanation died away upon his lips. The fire which flashed from her hollow eyes seemed to wither up the very sources of speech within him. The half lights were kind to her. He saw nothing of the hollow cheeks. The weariness of her pose and manner had passed like magic away. She stood there, erect as a dart, her head thrown back, a curious mixture of scorn, of loathing, and of fear in her expression. She looked <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadily, and he felt his cheeks burn. He was ashamed--ashamed of himself, ashamed of his errand.|$|R
