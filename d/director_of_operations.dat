5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray.

40|$|The role of IT (information technology) in {{businesses}} {{has become}} more important, and IT investments in firms are steadily increasing every year. However, many firms do not appropriately evaluate IT investments and performance of IT assets. The following situation is very common. An IT section does not provide executives and <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> with enough information because {{it is hard for}} them to understand it. Therefore, executives and <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> entrust a handful of IT experts or an IT section with the matter. The situation above creates distrust between the IT department and the executives and <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> It can be said that there is insufficient communication among the IT section, executives and <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> regarding the actual needs of the organization. In this paper, whilst recognizing the problem above, we discuss an actual framework for IT management in a firm, aiming for the mutual operational harmony among the IT section, executives and <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations.</b> In the example of the firm which has 5, 000 employees, it has succeeded in establishing the mutual perception of assessment of IT investments and assets by applying the dual management cycle of a fiscal year cycle and each investment item. The firm achieved establishing the mutual perception by classifying IT investments and expenses as profit and loss based on the mutual understanding, and promoting the communication among the three groups by analyzing the IT assets from the value chain perspective...|$|R
