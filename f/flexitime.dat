50|$|Hesketh and Cooper are {{currently}} researching the second aspect of Leaveism, associated with using time off such as Annual Leave, <b>Flexitime</b> and other Rest Day allocations {{to look after}} dependents, including both children and elderly relatives; the so-called sandwich generation. Again, {{the consequences of this}} are that employees are vulnerable to workload overload, which may, over time, have major health implications to those individuals. This may also impact on workplace outcomes, such as lost productivity and/or reduced performance and efficiency. This work also looks at the implications for resilience, engagement and discretionary effort.|$|E

This equipment made it possible, for the first time, to record the actual time that an employee worked and not just the beginning and end times of the working day. This was revolutionary in the 1960s.To reach a wide public with his flexible working hours concepts and to make them popular, Haller created the Swabian / English slogan 'I laik Gleitzeit' (I like <b>Flexitime),</b> which became the subject of discussion for many and was seen as bumper stickers on many cars.|$|E
50|$|Leaveism (Leavism) {{is a term}} first coined in 2013 by Dr Ian Hesketh, a {{researcher}} at Lancaster University Management School in the UK, to describe the phenomena of employees using <b>flexitime,</b> annual leave, rest days and other leave entitlement schemes to have time off {{when they are in}} fact too unwell to go to work. He later extended this to include occasions whereby employees took work home and/or on holiday that they could not complete in paid working hours. Hesketh's research, which centred on well-being in the UK police service, sought to identify a lacuna in current thinking around Absenteeism and Presenteeism; of which there is a plethora of academic study and commentary. The aim of his studies was to highlight that the true extent of sickness absence may be masked by the practice of Leaveism, and {{that there may be a}} hidden populus experiencing significant workload overload.|$|E

5000|$|Flextime (also spelled <b>flexitime</b> English, flex-time) is a {{flexible}} hours schedule that allows workers to alter workday start and finish times. In contrast to traditional work arrangements that require employees {{to work a}} standard 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day, flextime typically involves a [...] "core" [...] period of the day during which employees are required {{to be at work}} (e.g., between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.), and a [...] "bandwidth" [...] period within which all required hours must be worked (e.g., between 5:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.). The working day outside of the [...] "core" [...] period is [...] "flexible time", in which employees can choose when they work, subject to achieving total daily, weekly or monthly hours within the [...] "bandwidth" [...] period set by employers, and subject to the necessary work being done [...] The total working time required of employees on flextime schedules is the same as that required under traditional work schedules. A flextime policy allows staff to determine when they will work, while a flexplace policy allows staff to determine where they will work. Advantages include allowing employees to coordinate their work hours with public transport schedules, with the schedules of their children, and with daily traffic patterns to avoid high congestion times such as rush hour. Some claim that flexible working will change the nature of the way we work.|$|E
50|$|Sahira {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital as a {{registrar}} on the cardiothoracic surgery ward, Darwin. Having taken time {{out from her}} career to have two children, she is assigned a mentor - a reluctant Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), who sees her as a potential rival. It emerges that Sahira took the job {{at the behest of}} Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry), who she worked under at three previous hospitals. Tasked with managing budget cuts, Hanssen is looking to make staff redundancies, and asks Sahira to report to him on the capability of registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). Although Greg struggles in an operation, Sahira claims that he is an excellent surgeon. She tells Hanssen that she will not be his spy, and does not want special favours from him in return. Hanssen therefore reneges on his promise to allow Sahira to work <b>flexitime.</b> With a consultant position available, Sahira decides to apply, which pits her against Jac. Greg feels that Sahira is taking liberties by arranging her childcare schedule on duty and delegating patient care to him. He suggests that she is incapable of balancing her personal and professional life, but feels guilty when Sahira subsequently struggles in an operation and is berated by Hanssen. On the day of the consultant interviews, Sahira becomes emotionally involved in a patient's plight and misses her interview slot, so Jac is awarded the position by default. Greg later oversteps Sahira to take the lead on the case of a teenage girl with a rare heart condition. He is devastated when she dies in theatre, and breaks Hanssen's windscreen in a drunken accident. Hanssen issues Greg with a formal warning; Sahira sympathises with him, and when he later makes a medical error, she takes the blame and resultant warning herself.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis {{was to develop a}} <b>flexitime</b> feasibility analysis model for production oriented organizations. Current literature on <b>flexitime</b> was reviewed to give insight into the background and growth of the <b>flexitime</b> concept. Laws and regulations restricting full utilization of the <b>flexitime</b> system are examined and discussed, as well as the common fears and misconceptions of management, supervisors, and organized labor. Further clarification on analyzing the feasibility of <b>flexitime</b> was gained from interviews with administrators, managers, and employees in organizations utilizing <b>flexitime.</b> In those organizations where genuine employer-employee trust and cooperation abound, the authors noted that few difficulties were encountered in applying or administrating the concept of <b>flexitime.</b> <b>Flexitime</b> is not a cure for poor management-labor relations. However, given an organization where progressive management techniques are in practice, <b>flexitime</b> can result in greater employee motivation and higher productivity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the benefits of <b>flexitime</b> amongst users and non-users, and determine what <b>flexitime</b> is used for by employees using a gender perspective. Design/methodology/approach – The study consisted of interviews of 30 employees of a New Zealand local-government organisation, including 22 users and eight non-users of <b>flexitime.</b> Social exchange theory was used to test the benefits of <b>flexitime</b> towards job attitudes and work-family balance, while the socialisation perspective was used to explore <b>flexitime</b> usage divided into use by gender and parental status. Findings – Employees were highly positive of <b>flexitime,</b> including the eight non-users. Further, many positive comments were made regarding the important role that <b>flexitime</b> plays in allowing employees to balance their work and family commitments. Analysis showed that while there were no differences between males and females who had no dependants, there were major differences between parents. Mothers, exclusively used their <b>flexitime</b> to support their mothering role like attending school events, while fathers used <b>flexitime</b> for personal activities such as exercise. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of this research is the small sample of employees interviewed. Implications are that <b>flexitime</b> is a very positive work-family practice with universal appeal to all employees including non-users. However, this may come at the expense of reinforcing gendered roles for working mothers and fathers. Future research is needed to determine whether the <b>flexitime</b> usage by gender is universal, and whether working parents see the reinforcing of gender roles as a negative. Originality/value – This paper undertakes one of the few examinations of employee usage of <b>flexitime</b> by gender and parental status, and clearly provides insights that can aid the work-family and gender literature. It also reinforces the value of a work-family practice to users and non-users alike. Flexible working hours, Gender, Local government, New Zealand, Socialization...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the effects of {{flexible}} working arrangements on workers' labour market outcomes. The particular type of flexible working arrangement analysed in this thesis is called "flexitime". This is an arrangement which gives workers {{the freedom to choose}} when to start and end their work. <b>Flexitime</b> provides workers with a new way to cater to their domestic responsibilities and in turn may reduce the costs of participating in the labour market. Therefore, it is closely connected with workers' compensation structure, human capital accumulation process, labour supply and job mobility. The effects of <b>flexitime</b> on workers' labour market outcomes are analysed from three aspects: wage, labour supply, and job mobility. The first chapter gives an introduction and overview of the thesis. The second chapter is a study on the compensating wage differentials associated with <b>flexitime.</b> In general I do not find convincing evidence showing the existence of compensating wage differentials associated with <b>flexitime.</b> One possible reason might be that <b>flexitime</b> brings additional benefits to firms (such as increased productivity and reduced turnover rate) so that firms may not necessarily need to reduce actual wages in exchange for <b>flexitime</b> provision. In the third chapter, I develop a model describing how <b>flexitime</b> may affect workers' labour supply decisions. The main finding of the model is that <b>flexitime</b> will increase workers' labour supply when the benefit associated with <b>flexitime</b> (increased child care production efficiency) is high relative to the cost of wage reduction (prediction 1). Meanwhile, the model also predicts that <b>flexitime</b> causes high human capital workers to increase their labour supply more than low human capital workers (prediction 2). Empirical findings show that <b>flexitime</b> is positively associated with working mothers' labour market hours, which confirms model prediction 1. However, there is arguably insufficient empirical evidence verifying model prediction 2. The fourth chapter considers the relationship between <b>flexitime</b> and workers' job satisfaction and job mobility. <b>Flexitime</b> is associated with high job satisfaction levels for both male and female workers. It also reduces the probability of quitting for female workers with young children. Male workers' job mobility decisions are not significantly affected by <b>flexitime.</b> The fifth chapter gives the conclusion of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to present and discuss the {{findings}} of a study on <b>flexitime</b> as a novel people management practice emerging in Sri Lanka. Specifically, the paper presents and discusses factors that predict the level of satisfaction with <b>flexitime,</b> differences in attitudes towards <b>flexitime,</b> the effectiveness of <b>flexitime</b> as a strategy to attract and retain employees, and barriers that hinder its use. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 108 employees involved in producing IT-related output as their primary job function, from 30 software development companies, responded to the self-administered survey questionnaire. In analysis, univariate, bivariate and multivariate techniques were adopted. Findings – <b>Flexitime</b> allowed autonomy to employees to harmonize work and non-work demands on their time, resulting in better workplace relations. Overall, the findings support a non-traditional approach to people management. However, the findings also have important implications for the design or modification of <b>flexitime</b> arrangements. Originality/value – The majority of <b>flexitime</b> research is criticized for its theoretical nature, a failure to include statistical treatment of the data, and failure to pay specific attention to managerial and professional employees. Further, there is a marked absence of research-led literature in developing countries to clarify the way in which non-traditional people management practices work in different contexts.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Work–life {{balance is}} one of the most central issues and {{concerns}} for 21 st century societies, and according to the American Psychological Association balancing work and family {{is one of}} the major challenges for the current generation of employees. Helping employees balance their work and family life is viewed as a social and business imperative since work–life imbalance experienced by employees negatively impacts on employers and society as a whole. Evidence from a study of international employers indicates significant increases in the implementation and use of workplace flexibility, more commonly known as <b>flexitime,</b> as a work–life balance policy. Research into the use and implementation of <b>flexitime</b> within South Africa is limited, especially with regard to the aspects that influence the use of <b>flexitime</b> as well as the associated benefits, challenges and consequences for both South African employees and organisations. Consequently, organisations are left to design, implement and manage their own <b>flexitime</b> policies, with very little information or guidance available to ensure employee and organisational benefit. In this study, a qualitative research design with an exploratory approach was used to explore and describe employees? perceptions regarding the implementation of <b>flexitime.</b> A non–probability purposive, voluntary sample of 15 participants was taken from the offices of an international auditing and consulting organisation located in Johannesburg. Data was collected by means of semi–structured individual interviews and the verbatim transcripts were analysed by means of content analysis. Seven themes were extracted from the interviews, namely: variations in the use of flexitime; factors influencing the use of flexitime; challenges relating to the use of flexitime; perceptions regarding the use of flexitime; required aspects for the effective use of flexitime; consequences relating to the use of flexitime; and the benefits resulting from the use of <b>flexitime.</b> Organisations should be made more aware of the individual as well as organisational benefits, challenges and consequences of <b>flexitime</b> as highlighted in this research. When implementing such policies, specific required aspects for the effective use of <b>flexitime</b> should be taken in consideration. Organisations interested in successfully implementing <b>flexitime</b> for the benefit of both the employee and organisation are advised to consider the findings of this study and take heed of the critical findings presented. Efforts should be made to accommodate employee preferences regarding their use of <b>flexitime.</b> Organisations should be alert to the potential challenges, consequences and negative perceptions surrounding <b>flexitime</b> and, consequently, the importance of ensuring that prerequisites or those aspects required for the implementation of <b>flexitime</b> are in place and perceptions relating to the policy are managed.

40|$|Orientation: Helping {{employees}} {{to balance their}} work and family lives is a business imperative. Work–life balance policies (like <b>flexitime)</b> aim to support {{employees to}} do so. However, implementing these policies is problematic. Research purpose: The aim {{of this article is}} to report on the challenges and benefits associated with implementing <b>flexitime</b> as a work–life balance policy. Motivation for the study: Organisations must develop and implement work–life balance policies. This requires human resource practitioners to investigate and understand experiences and perceptions about the challenges and benefits of <b>flexitime.</b> Research design, approach and method: The researcher used a qualitative research design with an exploratory approach. She drew a nonprobability purposive and voluntary sample (n = 15) from the financial sector. She used semi-structured in-depth interviews to collect the data and conducted content analyses to analyse and interpret them. Main findings: The researcher extracted four main themes (individual and general challenges, the aspects organisations need to implement <b>flexitime</b> effectively and the benefits that would follow its implementation) from the data. Its benefits vary from work–life balance to employee loyalty and commitment. Some challenges are maintaining productivity, a shortage of critical resources and understanding <b>flexitime.</b> Practical/managerial implications: The research identified requirements that human resource practitioners should attend to in order to ensure that organisations use <b>flexitime</b> more effectively. Contribution/value-add: The researcher obtained unique findings about the minimum requirements for implementing <b>flexitime</b> effectively. They could assist organisations to address the challenges that employees face. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|While <b>flexitime</b> is {{becoming}} a cornerstone of twenty-first century employment, <b>flexitime</b> policies have been largely geared toward satisfying work-life balance needs. A wider argument is emerging, which proposes that a performance case exists for <b>flexitime.</b> However, the empirical findings remain inconclusive. Although several limitations of prior studies have been explored, no known studies have addressed the inadequate measure of work performance, which might account for this variability. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare individual performance outcomes as a function of two-work schedules (i. e. <b>flexitime</b> and a traditional schedule) using the Multilevel Performance Inventory (MPI). This instrument captures an expanded set of performance behaviors. Specifically, the purpose was to determine whether <b>flexitime</b> employees would score higher on key performance indicators relative to the traditional hours (or control) group. The sample consisted of 136 participants either working a <b>flexitime</b> schedule (n = 58) or a traditional schedule (n = 78). Participants were distributed across a number of industries. A one-way MANOVA revealed a nonsignificant multivariate effect, F (9, 126) = 1. 06, p >. 05, η 2 =. 07.

40|$|The {{ability to}} combine work with quality time {{together}} as a family {{is at the heart of}} the concept of work-life balance. Using previously unexploited data on couples work schedules we investigate the effect of flexible working on couples coordination of their daily work schedules in the UK. We consider three distinct dimensions of flexible working: flexibility of daily start and finish times (<b>flexitime),</b> flexibility of work times over the year (annualized hours), and generalized control of working hours. We show that having <b>flexitime</b> at work increases a couples amount of coordination of their daily work schedules by a half to one hour, which is double the margin of adjustment enjoyed by couples with no <b>flexitime.</b> The impact is driven by couples with children. In contrast to <b>flexitime,</b> the other two forms of flexible working do not seem to increase synchronous time. Our results suggest that having <b>flexitime</b> plays an important role in relaxing the work scheduling constraints faced by families with young children, and that effective flexible working time arrangements are those that increase the workers and not the employers flexibility...|$|E

40|$|Using {{previously}} unexploited data on time scheduling in {{the employment}} and household contexts, we investigate {{the effect of}} flexible working on couples' coordination of their daily work time schedules in the UK. We consider three distinct dimensions of flexible working: flexibility of daily start and finish times (<b>flexitime),</b> flexibility of work times over the year (annualised hours), and generalised control of working hours. We find that in couples with <b>flexitime</b> there is greater spouse synchronization in daily working times by nearly one hour. The effect is driven by couples with dependent children. However, we find the effect in couples with children of any age (under 16), suggesting it does not stem from the childcare requirements of young children. Robustness checks indicate that <b>flexitime</b> is not endogenous, suggesting that an expansion of <b>flexitime</b> would increase couples' work time coordination. There is less evidence that broader control over working hours increases daily synchronous working time and no evidence that annualised hours increase synchronous time on a daily basis. The weaker relationships with daily synchronous time for these two flexibility measures are consistent with their broader scope (control over amount of hours as well as timing) and longer time span...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three studies}} which explore {{the effects of}} individualized human resource management (HRM) practices from recipients’ and non-recipients’ perspectives. The first two studies, focusing {{on the concept of}} idiosyncratic deals (i-deals), investigate the role of managers’ emotions and employees’ behaviours in translating negotiated i-deals into attainment (Study 1), and how obtained i-deals influence recipients’ work performance positively in the long term (Study 2). In delineating how individualized HRM practices unfold for their recipients, the concept of i-deals is challenged. The third study explores the effects of non-entitlement to <b>flexitime</b> on employees’ overall perceptions of fairness, which in turn shape their affective commitment toward the organization. This study also introduces a contextual condition – the normativeness of <b>flexitime</b> – to understand under what conditions the association between non-entitlement to <b>flexitime</b> and overall fairness perceptions is stronger or weaker. A quantitative methodology is adopted across the three studies. The first two studies draw on two-wave, multi-source data collected in Istanbul, Turkey. The third study is based on the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS, 2011). This thesis makes important theoretical contributions to research on i-deals, <b>flexitime</b> and, more broadly, to individualized HRM. As a practical implication, this thesis underlines that caution is needed when differentiating certain HR practices for a select group of employees...|$|E
30|$|Flexible working (time) {{arrangements}} are therefore increasingly gaining in favour. This trend {{will continue in}} the near future. This especially concerns those who face the task of combining family obligations with work duties. The increasing flexibility offers new potential for people to combine work and private spheres more sufficiently. Yet, as the German Trade Union (DGB) shows, the connection between these two spheres is not always promising [46]. The vague border between work, leisure, family and privacy is a major stress factor for employees.

Controlling for time-constant individual heterogeneity, {{we find that the}} three considered FWPs-flexitime, sabbaticals and working from home-significantly increase job satisfaction and that sabbaticals and working from home (but not <b>flexitime)</b> significantly decrease turnover intention. In addition, sabbaticals but not <b>flexitime</b> or working from home significantly increase leisure satisfaction. The effects of FWPs on health are mostly weak and statistically insignificant. Models that do not control for such individual heterogeneity either underestimate the positive effects of FWPs or find detrimental effects.

The inorganic volumetric fraction of two addition silicones (Reprosil Putty/Fluid and <b>Flexitime</b> Easy Putty/Fluid), three condensation silicones (Clonage Putty/Fluid, Optosil Confort/Xantopren VL and Silon APS Putty/Fluid), one polyether (Impregum Soft Light Body) and one polysulfide (Permlastic Light Body) was accessed by weighing a previously determined mass of each material in water before and after burning samples at 600 ºC, during 3 h. Unsettled material samples were soaked in acetone and chloroform for removal of tthe organic portion. The remaining filler particles were sputter-coated with gold evaluation of their morphology and size, under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). <b>Flexitime</b> Easy Putty was the material with the highest results for volumetric particle fraction, while Impregum Soft had the lowest values. Silon 2 APS Fluid presented the lowest mean filler size values, while Clonage Putty had the highest values. SEM micrographs of the inorganic particles showed several morphologies - lathe-cut, spherical, spherical-like, sticks, and sticks mixed to lathe-cut powder. The results of this study revealed differences in particle characteristics among the elastometic materials that could lead to different results when testing mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the temporal response of four dental impression materials, namely three siloxanes (Imprint 4, <b>Flexitime,</b> Aquasil) and one polyether (Impregum). The null hypothesis {{was that the}} nominal working times are confirmed by instrumental laboratory tests. We also aimed to identify alternative techniques with strong physical-chemical background {{for the assessment of}} temporal response. Traditional characterization was carried out by shark fin test device and durometer at both ambient and body temperature. Additionally, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was performed at room temperature. From shark fin height and Shore hardness versus time the working time and the setting time of the materials were evaluated, respectively. These were in reasonable agreement with the nominal values, except for Impregum, which showed longer working time. Spectroscopy confirmed the different character of the two types of materials, and provided for Imprint 4 and Aquasil an independent evaluation of both evolution times, consistent with the results of the other techniques. Shark fin test and durometer measurements showed deviations in setting time, low sensitivity to temperature for <b>Flexitime,</b> and longer working time at higher temperature for Impregum. Deviations of working time appear in operating conditions from what specified by the manufacturers. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can provide insight in the correlation between material properties and their composition and structure...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{increased}} {{number of women in}} the labour market in the UK, many significantly reduce their working hours or leave the labour market altogether after childbirth; typically with serious consequences for their careers. Based on border and boundary management theories, this study examines whether <b>flexitime</b> and teleworking can help women maintain their employment and working hours post childbirth. We examine the UK case, where the right to request flexible working has been expanded quickly and promoted as a major way to address work-life balance issues. The dataset used is Understanding Society (2009 - 2014), a large household panel survey with data on these flexible work arrangements. We find some suggestive evidence that flexible working can help women stay in employment after the birth of their first child. More evidence is found that perceived access to teleworking and especially the use of <b>flexitime</b> lowers the likelihood of mothers reducing their working hours after childbirth. This contributes to the literature and policies in understanding flexible working not only as a tool for work-life balance, but also as a tool to enhance and maintain individuals’ work capacities in periods of increased family demands, with major implications for supporting women’s careers after childbirth...|$|E
