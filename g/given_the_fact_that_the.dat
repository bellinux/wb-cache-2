She saw no action in World War I, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austro-Hungarian fleet, Italy's main naval rival, remained in port {{for the duration of}} the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as – unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects – the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence [...] before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that [...] "techniques {{that had been used}} against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP , and {{there had to be a}} reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage – which usually meant when trials were showing promise." [...] He concluded at the time, in April 1945, that the intelligence failure had not made much practical difference <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: [...] "there was little warning; [...] there was little danger." ...|$|E
500|$|Athletic {{competition}} between the Soviet Union and United States had grown intense during the 1950s. Their opposing ideologies and interests in nations such as East and West Germany, China and North and South Korea created a delicate situation as the 1960 Winter Games approached. Of particular interest was {{the question of whether}} China would be allowed to participate. [...] Chinese athletes last competed at the 1952 Summer Games but had since withdrawn from the IOC due to a dispute over Taiwan's participation as a separate country. The United States supported Taiwan while the Soviet Union stood behind China. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1960 Games were to be held in America, there was concern among IOC members that the United States would not allow China or any other Communist country to participate. In 1957 IOC president Avery Brundage, himself an American, announced that if the United States refused entry to any country recognized by the IOC, then they would revoke Squaw Valley's invitation to host the Games and he would resign the presidency. Bowing to international pressure, the United States allowed athletes from Communist countries to participate. China continued to demand that Taiwan be expelled from the IOC, demands that were refused until China broke off relations ending any hope that they would participate in 1960.|$|E

NMEs Dan Martin was {{of the opinion that}} [...] "Judas" [...] was the song that Gaga should have come back with. But he understood why she did not choose it as the lead single from Born This Way, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> song was characteristic of Gaga's music. Pointing the same thing, Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote that the song played to Gaga's established musical sensibilities. He added that although [...] "Judas" [...] certainly had its own charms and [...] "at least three insanely catchy hooks it leans hard on Gaga's signature moves." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice summarized the song as a twin of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing its [...] "instantly memorable wordless vocalizing, a pummeling beat, lyrics about a romance that is, well, bad." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey gave the song five out of five stars, commending the [...] "blasphemously camp" [...] chorus and comparing it to be worthy of Eurovision – [...] "a Scooch-meets-Lordi affair that, unsurprisingly, takes a few listens to get your head around." [...] Mark Lepage from The Gazette praised the song and understood that as Gaga's music has progressed, so has her themes and inspirations, indicated by the conflicted relationship she has with the character Judas in the song. Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, compared it to [...] "'Like a Prayer' on steroids" [...] and gave it three out of five points. NME called the song [...] "Gaga's worst single so far".|$|E

2500|$|The {{in-depth}} study of Mishneh Torah underwent a revival in Lithuanian Judaism {{in the late}} 19th century. The Lithuanians did not {{use it as a}} source book on practical halakha, as they followed the Ashkenazi authorities such as Moses Isserles and the Aruch ha-Shulchan. [...] Instead they used it as a guide to Talmudic interpretation and methodology. [...] <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mishneh Torah entirely omits these topics, this reading seems paradoxical and against the grain. [...] Their method was to compare the Talmudic source material with Maimonides' final decision, in order to reconstruct the rules of interpretation that must have been used to get from one to the other.|$|E
2500|$|Builders {{and real}} estate speculators {{predicted}} that the [...] Empire State Building would be the world's tallest building [...] "for many years", thus ending the great New York City skyscraper rivalry.

In 1978 the committee published its report, concluding that: [...] "The formal claim that Ulrike Meinhof committed suicide by hanging is unfounded, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> investigation results reasonably converge to the conclusion that she could not hang herself.

2500|$|The name Sørvágur {{translates}} to [...] "The Bay of Sør". While {{the second half}} of the name makes sense <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> village is located at a bay, the first half is more mysterious. Legend has it that the first man to settle at this place was called 'Sørli' and hence the village was named in honour of him. Another explanation on the origin of 'Sør' comes from the old-Norse 'Seyr' which is a word for sand (seyr is also a word for foggy rain). Sørvágur has quite a large sandbeach in comparison with other Faroese villages and towns, and therefore it was speculated that the original name of Sørvágur was Seyrvágur, and during the course of time, Seyrvágur became Sørvágur. During the first half of the 20th century local people in Sørvágur tried to correct this historical injustice and used the name Seyrvágur instead of Sørvágur. However, this trend died out again. One reason may be that there is no proof in the Faroese historical records that justifies the name Seyrvágur.|$|E
2500|$|This {{traditional}} {{practice for}} {{the determination of the}} start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring {{the beginning of a new}} month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its [...] "age" [...] since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.|$|E

This restricted the town's potential to attract high street retailers due to the a lack of suitable sites and the associated traffic hazards of the N2. In 2002, a local area plan for the town was completed which provides for the future development of Ashbourne. The plan provided for a major expansion of Ashbourne westward into the townland of Killegland adjoining the new N2 Ashbourne bypass. It led to the introduction of residential units, a retail park, community facilities and industrial units. The town is being planned westward, further into County Meath, as the Fingal County boundary is only 1.5kilometres(0.9mi) from {{the east side of the}} town, which decreases to approximately 600metres(2,000ft) at the north end of the town, in the townland of Rath.|$|E
