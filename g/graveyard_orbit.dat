5000|$|For {{satellites}} in geosynchronous orbit, {{both the}} International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and United Nations (UN) recommend that GEO-satellites be designed {{such that they}} can, at end of life, remove themselves to a disposal orbit some 350 km above the GEO belt, and then passivate themselves by removing any internally stored energy. [...] "There is no international enforcement of these recommendations" [...] {{but the majority of}} these GEO spacecraft are being boosted up into the recommended <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R

25|$|Brasilsat A1 was a Brazilian {{communications}} satellite which was operated by Embratel. It was {{constructed by the}} Spar Aerospace, {{and is based on}} the HS-376 satellite bus. The Brasilsat A1 was off duty in March 2002 and was transferred to the <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{additional}} dead satellite debris are {{the remains of}} the 1970s/80s Soviet RORSAT naval surveillance satellite program. The satellite's BES-5 nuclear reactor were cooled with a coolant loop of sodium-potassium alloy, creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life. While many satellites were nominally boosted into a medium-altitude <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits,</b> not all were. Even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy, forming additional debris.|$|R
5000|$|Professor Farnsworth {{pulls up}} a biographical movie about [...] "Philip J. Fry", where the crew learns {{that he was}} a millionaire, rock star, astronaut, and is now buried with the seven-leaf clover in Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery, a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbiting</b> Earth. A furious Fry sets off to rob Philip J. Fry's grave and recover the clover. The story jumps back to the early 21st century, where an adult Yancy is rummaging through his missing brother's music to find {{something}} to play at his wedding. Yancy discovers the seven-leaf clover and takes it.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} evolution of spacecraft in Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEOs). The single averaged disturbing potential due to luni-solar perturbations and zonal harmonics of the Earth gravity field is written. The double averaged potential is also derived in the Earth-centered equatorial system. Maps of long-term evolution are constructed to identify conditions for quasi-frozen, or long-lived libration orbits. In addition to allow meeting specific mission constraints, quasi-frozen orbits can be selected as <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits</b> for the end-of-life of HEO missions. On the opposite side, unstable conditions can be exploited to target an Earth re-entry at the end-of-mission...|$|R
25|$|Instead {{of being}} de-orbited, most {{satellites}} are either left {{in their current}} orbit or moved to a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b> As of 2002, the FCC requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit</b> {{at the end of}} their operational life prior to launch. In cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting, the major variable is the solar flux, and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself, and the gravitational perturbations generated by the Sun and the Moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges, whether above or below sea level). The nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78km, with a range between 72 and 84km. Solar panels, however, are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95km.|$|E
25|$|During May 2005, B-SAT ordered BSAT-3a, the {{replacement}} satellite for BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. It was successfully launched on August 2007, and {{accepted into the}} fleet the next month. During November, 2007 BSAT-3a took over the broadcasting of analog and digital signals from BSAT-1a and BSAT-1b. In 3 August 2010, BSAT-1a {{was placed in a}} <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit</b> and decommissioned.|$|E
25|$|BSAT-1a was a {{geostationary}} {{communications satellite}} designed and manufactured by Hughes (now Boeing) on the HS-376 platform. It was originally ordered {{and operated by}} the Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation (B-SAT). It {{was used as the}} main satellite to broadcast television channels for NHK and WOWOW over Japan. It had a pure Ku band payload and operated on the 110°E longitude until it was replaced, along its backup BSAT-1b, by BSAT-3a. On 3 August 2010, it was decommissioned and placed on a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
50|$|With such a {{large number}} of {{satellites}} being added to the already crowded low Earth orbit, plans for handling the satellites once the operational life of each satellite is completed are an important consideration. The region between 600 and 1000 km is already the most congested orbital regime around Earth, and concerns about adding to the existing space debris problem have been expressed. There could be a new regime of <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits</b> added, similar to those in use for decades to handle post-operational commsats that operated in the geostationary belt; however at the orbital altitudes envisioned for WorldVu, the disposal orbit may not have a sufficiently long life to assure long-term stability.|$|R

50|$|For {{man-made}} spacecraft {{orbiting the}} Earth at comparatively low altitudes the deviations from a Kepler orbit are {{much larger than}} for the Moon. The approximation of the gravitational force of the Earth {{to be that of}} a homogeneous sphere gets worse the closer one gets to the Earth surface and the majority of the artificial Earth satellites are in orbits that are only a few hundred kilometers over the Earth surface. Furthermore, they are (as opposed to the Moon) significantly affected by the solar radiation pressure because of their large cross-section to mass ratio; this applies in particular to 3-axis stabilized spacecraft with large solar arrays and is allowed for in calculation of <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits.</b> In addition they are significantly affected by rarefied air below 800-1000 km. The air drag at high altitudes is also dependent on solar activity.|$|R
25|$|When {{satellites}} {{reach the}} end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b> Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th manmade satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of August 2009.|$|E
25|$|After the {{satellite}} {{was launched in}} February 1985, it {{was placed in the}} orbital position of 65 degrees west longitude. In 1994 it was transferred to 63 degrees west in inclined orbit, where it remained until the middle of June 1996, when it was moved to 79 degrees west in inclined orbit, where it remained until August 1998 in January 1999 it went to 144 degrees west in inclined orbit, the Brasilsat A1 remained in this position until March 2002 when it left of service and was sent to the <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E

40|$|This report (Part I of the Study Note of Work Package 2) {{presents}} the results obtained by applying the most accurate and complete long-term orbit propagator used in SDM 4. 0 to study specific problems involving the MEO and GEO orbital regimes. In particular, the following topics were investigated: 1. The long-term evolution of GEO disposal orbits and the role in it of the initial eccentricity vector; 2. The identification of initial orbit elements and area-to-mass ratios leading to synchronous high eccentricity orbits like those recently discovered by the ESA 1 m telescope in Tenerife; 3. The orbital lifetime of objects in Molniya-like orbits {{as a function of}} initial conditions and operational practice. The long-term evolution of objects placed in the <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits</b> used or proposed for the navigation satellites in MEO, in particular Galileo, is addressed in a companion report (Part II of the Study Note of Work Package 2) ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{three different}} {{strategies for the}} disposal of Lagrangian Point Orbit (LPO) missions that have been analyzed {{in the frame of}} the European Space Agency study "End-of-life disposal concepts for Lagrange-points and HEO missions". The first strategy analyzes a Moon impact scenario, the second one a reentry in Earth's atmosphere, whereas the third concerns the injection into heliocentric <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits.</b> For Moon impact and Earth's reentry an optimization problem is set up to minimize the propellant consumption while satisfying constraints on terminal position. For the graveyard, two methods are proposed: the first is a fully numerical approach based on the solution of an optimization problem via genetic algorithms, whereas the second one is based on the Jacobi constant and on a tangential disposal maneuver designed to close the Hill's regions. In this paper, solutions compatible with mission constraints are presented for SoHO and GAIA...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that the medium-Earth orbit (MEO) region of the global {{navigation}} satellite systems is permeated by a devious network of lunisolar secular resonances, which can interact to produce chaotic and diffusive motions. The precarious state of the four navigation constellations, perched on the threshold of instability, makes it understandable why all past efforts to define stable <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits,</b> especially in the case of Galileo, were bound to fail; the region is far too complex to allow for an adoption of the simple geosynchronous disposal strategy. We retrace one such recent attempt, funded by ESA&# 039;s General Studies Programme in the frame of the GreenOPS initiative, that uses a systematic parametric approach and the straightforward maximum-eccentricity method to identify long-term-stable regions, suitable for graveyards, as well as large-scale excursions in eccentricity, which can be used for postmission deorbiting of constellation satellites. We then apply our new results on the stunningly rich dynamical structure of the MEO region towards the analysis of these disposal strategies for Galileo, and discuss the practical implications of resonances and chaos in this regime. We outline how the identification of the hyperbolic and elliptic fixed points of the resonances near Galileo can lead to explicit criteria for defining optimal disposal strategies...|$|R
50|$|A <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit</b> is {{used when}} {{the change in}} {{velocity}} required to perform a de-orbit maneuver is too large. De-orbiting a geostationary satellite requires a delta-v of about 1500 m/s, whereas re-orbiting it to a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit</b> only requires about 11 m/s.|$|E
50|$|Disposal orbit - A {{synonym for}} <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{satellites}} in {{geostationary orbit}} and geosynchronous orbits, the <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is a few}} hundred kilometers above the operational orbit. The transfer to a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit</b> above geostationary orbit requires {{the same amount of}} fuel as a satellite needs for about three months of stationkeeping. It also requires a reliable attitude control during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators try to perform such a maneuver {{at the end of their}} satellites' operational lives, through 2005 only about one-third succeeded. However, as of 2011, most recently decommissioned geosynchronous spacecraft were said to have been moved to a <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} risk {{caused by the}} population of Space junk in LEO and especially in SSO, an ecient active debris removal program must be developed. It has {{to take into account}} not only the technical challenges but also the econo-political ones implied by this complex task. This thesis presents three dierent ways to de-orbit the population of rocket bodies in SSO. The rst one, the Picker, implies to send one spacecraft to remove one debris at a time. The second one, the Mothership, has to visit several debris to equip them with autonomous de-orbiting units. The last one, the Shuttle, travel back and forth between high and low orbits to catch the debris and bring them on short-lifetime <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits.</b> The three scenarios are optimized in terms of number of debris per spacecraft, number of spacecraft per launch vehicle and propulsion system (chemical solid, liquid bi-propellant or electric). They are compared in terms of cost per mass removed. The results shown that the Picker is approximately ten times more ecient than the other ones, with normalized cost as low as 10, 500 [$/kg]. In a second time, the comparison is made between a collaborative global program between the U. S., Russia and Europe and their three separated national program. The conclusion is that choosing the collaboration rather than the isolated program allows each government to save million...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic {{modeling}} of spacecraft has wide-reaching {{applications such as}} detumbling space debris in the Geosynchronous Earth Orbit regime before docking, servicing and tugging space debris to <b>graveyard</b> <b>orbits,</b> and Lorentz augmented orbits. The viability of electrostatic actuation control applications relies on faster-than-realtime characterization of the electrostatic interaction. The Volume Multi-Sphere Method (VMSM) seeks the optimal placement and radii of {{a small number of}} equipotential spheres to accurately model the electrostatic force and torque on a conducting space object. Current VMSM models tuned using force and torque comparisons with commercially available finite element software are subject to the modeled probe size and numerical errors of the software. This work first investigates fitting of VMSM models to Surface-MSM (SMSM) generated electrical field data, removing modeling dependence on probe geometry while significantly increasing performance and speed. A proposed electric field matching cost function is compared to a force and torque cost function, the inclusion of a self-capacitance constraint is explored and 4 degree-of-freedom VMSM models generated using electric field matching are investigated. The resulting E-field based VMSM development framework is illustrated on a box-shaped hub with a single solar panel, and convergence properties of select models are qualitatively analyzed. Despite the complex non-symmetric spacecraft geometry, elegantly simple 2 -sphere VMSM solutions provide force and torque fits within a few percent...|$|R
