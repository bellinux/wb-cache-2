25|$|In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, Jahanara, {{was burned}} when the {{chemicals}} in <b>her</b> <b>perfume</b> were ignited by a nearby lamp while in Agra. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara {{back to health}} in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects. Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor. Other sources tell us that Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir.|$|E

500|$|Kristin Booker of {{the fashion}} website Refinery29 {{described}} the scent as a [...] "voluptuous, sexy floral". Kathleen Hou writing for New York opined that the perfume's best part {{was that it was}} inspired by a poem by Angelou. Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and vetiver extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good". With a similar opinion, Treye Green of the International Business Times noted more masculine notes with the addition of woods, cashmere, musk. She hailed Rise as a [...] "sweet treat" [...] for her fans along her self-titled album's surprise release a week earlier and noted, [...] "Beyoncé's definition of feminism has stirred quite the debate following her new album's release. But maybe <b>her</b> <b>perfume</b> version of it will be more openly embraced – plus who can deny the genius of a Maya Angelou-inspired scent." [...] Madison Lafayette in an article for VIBE Vixen praised Beyoncé's decision to release Rise [...] "capitaliz off" [...] her success and [...] "giving us another reason to talk about her".|$|E

The range was later augmented by eau de toilettes including Pink Sparkle, Couture and Inverse. On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she discussed her illness and said that her chemotherapy treatment had been like [...] "experiencing a nuclear bomb". While appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2008, Minogue said that her cancer had originally been misdiagnosed. She commented, [...] "Because someone is in a white coat and using big medical instruments doesn't necessarily mean they're right", but later spoke of her respect for the medical profession.|$|E

500|$|According to Inside the Hits, {{the lyrics}} {{refer to the}} commotion created by Billie Jean on a dance floor. She entices the crowd with a seductive come-on before luring Jackson to her bedroom, through the {{fragrance}} of <b>her</b> <b>perfume.</b> Jackson's vocal range spanned from a high baritone to a falsetto and he usually wrote melodies to show this range. However, in the verses of [...] "Billie Jean", the singer's vocals range from a tenor to a low falsetto. A four note falsetto is showcased in the chorus and, during the last line, Jackson peaks at a full octave. The song has a tempo of 117 beats per minute {{and is in the}} key of F minor. Following the first chorus, a cello-like synth eases in at the beginnings of both the third, and later, the fourth, verses. Upon the announcement that the baby's eyes resemble Jackson's, a voice laments, [...] "oh no". This is met with Jackson's signature falsetto [...] "hee hee". The bridge debuts the strings, and holds a pedal tone tonic with the exception of two lines and a chord leading into the chorus. Violins are then played, followed by a four-note minor guitar solo. During the solo, vocal shouts, screams and laughs are added. Throughout this, the chord progression remains unaltered and is laced with Jackson's vocal hiccups. All the musical and vocal elements are then brought together in the final chorus. In the fade, Jackson repeats the denial of fathering Billie Jean's child.|$|E

2500|$|Hepburn reteamed {{with her}} Sabrina co-star William Holden in Paris When It Sizzles (1964), a screwball comedy {{in which she}} played the young {{assistant}} of a Hollywood screenwriter, who aids his writer's block by acting out his fantasies of possible plots. Its production was troubled {{by a number of}} problems. Holden unsuccessfully tried to rekindle a romance with the now-married Hepburn, and his alcoholism was beginning to affect his work. After principal photography began, she demanded the dismissal of cinematographer Claude Renoir after seeing what she felt were unflattering dailies. Superstitious, she also insisted on dressing room 55 because that was her lucky number and required that Givenchy, her long-time designer, be given a credit in the film for <b>her</b> <b>perfume.</b> Dubbed [...] "marshmallow-weight hokum" [...] by Variety upon its release in April, the film was [...] "uniformly panned" [...] but critics were kinder to Hepburn's performance, describing her as [...] "a refreshingly individual creature in an era of the exaggerated curve".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2008, The Times {{reported}} that Lewis had {{turned down a}} seven-figure sum from Mohamed Al Fayed to open a Harrods sale.

6000|$|That wondrous {{clear and}} fresh summer morning of June the seventh {{will not be}} {{forgotten}} for many years.

[...] Throughout the changing seasons Sawanec called to him in words of love: sometimes her face was hidden by cloud and fog and yet he heard her voice! Sometimes <b>her</b> <b>perfume</b> as to-day--made him dream; sometimes, when the western heavens were flooded with the golden light of the infinite, she veiled herself in magic purple, when to gaze at her was an exquisite agony, and she became as one forbidden to man.

60|$|Wait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's <b>her</b> <b>perfume.</b> Why {{she waved}} her hand. I leave you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it? Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little {{jessamine}} mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance {{if you go into}} a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like {{what do you call it}} gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way. We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.|$|E
