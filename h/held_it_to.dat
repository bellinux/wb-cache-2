Mirjam Ott and Allison Pottinger played a high-scoring game which {{resulted}} in a win for Ott, and Eve Muirhead scored an early lead over Heather Nedohin and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> win another point for Team World. Jennifer Jones made a precise draw to tie her game with Margaretha Sigfridsson and secured a half-point for Team North America, averting a sweep by Team World.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} race, Greg Biffle {{was the leader}} at the start. On the fourth lap, Kenseth passed Biffle {{to take over the}} lead. He lost the {{position}} when Joey Logano and Kyle Busch moved into the top two places. Biffle passed Kyle Busch by the 29th lap and held it during his pit stop 14 laps later. With three laps remaining in the race, Kenseth attempted a race-winning slingshot and passed Biffle when the final lap started and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> win the second Gatorade Duel. There were five lead changes among five different drivers and no cautions were shown {{during the course of the}} second race.|$|E
5|$|Juan Pablo Montoya {{started from}} pole {{position}} alongside Ralf Schumacher. Michael Schumacher, the eventual Drivers' Champion started fourth, behind Mika Häkkinen of McLaren. The race {{was marked by}} an airborne accident going into the first corner involving Michael Schumacher and Luciano Burti for Prost, which caused the track to be scattered with shreds of carbon fibre and the race restarted as a result. Both Williams drivers retained their positions {{at the end of}} the first lap, with Michael Schumacher passing Häkkinen for third. Over the course of the race, Montoya extended a considerable lead over Ralf Schumacher. Montoya lost the lead on lap 24 when an issue with a refulling rig caused him to be stationary for more than 20 seconds. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> win his third victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch won {{the pole}} {{position}}, which he held for 20 laps {{until he was}} passed by Edwards. He held the lead until the first green-flag pit stops and regained the position after the stops ended. Busch retook the lead on lap 81 and held it until he was passed by Matt Kenseth. Jeff Gordon took over the lead on lap 163, before Earnhardt became the leader on the 181st lap and maintained this position until Edwards regained it 14 laps later. The race was stopped for 17 minutes when Gordon crashed on lap 262, and car parts were strewn {{into the path of}} other drivers, requiring officials to clean the track. Edwards maintained the lead at the restart and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> win the race. There were eleven cautions and 19 lead changes by nine different drivers during the race.|$|E

Martin finished second, ahead of Kenseth in third, Montoya fourth, and Kurt Busch fifth. Gordon, Allmendinger, Kahne, Stewart and Newman rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology. The {{story of how the}} robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|Vettel led by 0.9 {{seconds on}} the final lap, before he ran wide at turn six. Button passed {{him to take the}} lead, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> win the race. Vettel {{recovered}} from going off-track and finished second, ahead of Webber in third and Schumacher in fourth. Petrov took fifth place, while Massa passed Kobayashi on the finish line for sixth place. Alguersuari, Barrichello and Buemi filled the final point scoring positions, and Rosberg's car had lost the front wing, dropping him to eleventh.

5|$|In {{the other}} races of the 1935 season, Caracciola won the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring and {{finished}} second at the Penya Rhin Grand Prix in Barcelona. He {{also won the}} Tripoli Grand Prix, organised by the Libyan Governor-General Italo Balbo. The Grand Prix {{was held in the}} desert, around a salt lake, and because of the intense heat Neubauer was concerned that the tyres on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where he began to feel he had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.|$|E
5|$|The Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) {{category}} was {{won by the}} Signatech Alpine driven by Nicolas Lapierre, Gustavo Menezes and Stéphane Richelmi.

5|$|The {{next night}} on Raw, Orton faced Batista, {{who had become}} World Heavyweight Champion. Orton stated {{on-screen}} that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury. While sidelined, Orton appeared on Raw and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury. He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed {{a candidate for the}} draft, leaving a possibility of a return to SmackDown!. Orton returned to WWE programming for SmackDown! on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery. He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father. Two months later, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a Handicap Casket match, after the match Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes {{in the top of the}} casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker. The following month, Orton replaced the late Eddie Guerrero as a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown against Team Raw at Survivor Series, after having lost a qualifying match to Rey Mysterio. In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year, as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown. At the event, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacked the SmackDown superstars who came to the ring to celebrate Team SmackDown's victory. On the SmackDown! episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered. Randy Orton RKO'd the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set him on the back of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown set, causing an explosion. The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon, where The Undertaker offered to retire if he lost. On December 16, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared to be standing in the ring. The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack. The druid revealed himself to be Orton's father, who gave Orton The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, allowed whomever <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> control The Undertaker. The Undertaker, however, beat both Ortons in a Hell in a Cell match, ending their nine-month-long feud.|$|E

25|$|Manuel II's reign {{saw another}} {{temporary}} respite for the Byzantines. For an Empire in such trouble, {{he succeeded in}} retaking some territory and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of his}} reign. His limited success largely came through the resurrection of Mongol Power in the East and the great friendship achieved between Manuel II and Mehmed I. However, he lived long enough to see his son undo much of his achievements.|$|E
25|$|Diversity {{of belief}} among {{organized}} spiritualists {{has led to}} a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion sui generis (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian organization, the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and the more Christian spiritual church movement.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Basso {{aimed to}} win his second Giro d'Italia, leading Team Liquigas with his {{teammate}} Vincenzo Nibali. Despite having a quiet start to the race, he won the 15th stage of the 2010 Giro d'Italia atop Monte Zoncolan, after his Liquigas team had set the pace for some 150km in order to chase down a breakaway. After Stage 19, he lead the general classification {{as a result of}} out-climbing previous race leader David Arroyo, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the end of the race. This resulted his second Giro win since 2006.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} 45-minute {{practice}} session, Rosenqvist set a benchmark time of {{two minutes and}} 11.743 seconds with around ten minutes remaining in the session and ultimately <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion of practice. King followed nearly three-tenths of a second adrift in second with Ocon third. Verstappen came out in fourth and Auer followed in fifth. Giovinazzi and Latifi placed sixth and seventh with Coletti eighth. Cassidy and Merhi completed the top ten ahead of second qualifying. Fuoco crashed heavily at Fisherman's bend after ten minutes but a red flag was not necessitated since marshals were able to remove his car from the track. MacLeod was forced to make a pit stop after hitting the barriers lining the circuit on the Mountain bend, and the session ended early when Rosenqvist removed his car's front wing after clouting the wall at Maternity Bend.|$|E
