25|$|The WTO's predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), was {{established}} after World War II {{in the wake}} of other new multilateral institutions dedicated to international economic cooperation – such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. A comparable <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> for trade, named the International Trade Organization never started as the treaty was not approved by the U.S. and other signatories, and so GATT slowly became a de facto international organization.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{a growing}} {{literature}} {{has argued that}} European Union (EU) member states have undergone a profound transformation caused by <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> and by the EU, in particular. However, the state core – the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force, embodied by the police – seemed to remain intact. The literature has argued that in this area, <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> are weak, and cooperation has remained informal and intergovernmental. We take issue with these claims and evaluate the strength of <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> in two core areas of policing (terrorism and drugs) over time. We find {{that in terms of}} decision-making, precision, and adjudication, <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> have become considerably stronger over time. Even when <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> remain intergovernmental they strongly regulate how EU member states exercise their monopoly of force. Member states are even further constrained because adjudication is delegated to the European Court of Justice. Thus, even the state core is undergoing a significant transformation...|$|R

25|$|In 1994, Dr. Cordero was {{appointed}} {{deputy director of}} the National Immunization Program, where he made important and long-lasting contributions in many areas of one of the nation's most successful public health programs. In 2001, he was named the first director of the NCBDDD that was created by the Children's Health Act of 2000. In a few years, NCBDDD became a leading <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> devoted to research and prevention of birth defects and developmental disabilities and health promotion of people of ages living with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{against a}} student uprising, the {{president}} combined {{the two major}} youth organizations in Dahomey, chapters of the World Federation of Youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, into the National Union of Dahomeyan Youth. It was to remain a nationally run organization, unaffiliated with any <b>international</b> <b>institution.</b> Nonetheless, he would do nothing more than reprimand students who protested him, not even revoke their scholarships. On December 31, 1961 the Maga administration raised certain taxes, including those on income, transportation, and permits {{in an attempt to}} balance his country's budget. He nonetheless ran into trouble in the enforcement of his plan. Throughout his first term as president, Maga toured various parts of Dahomey to bring enthusiasm to his plan, offering undeveloped land to its supporters.|$|E
25|$|The peace {{movement}} {{began to grow}} in influence by the mid-nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of American consul to Birmingham Elihu Burritt and the reverend Henry Richard, convened the first International Peace Congress in London in 1843. The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration {{in the affairs of}} nations and the creation of an <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> to achieve that. Richard became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the 'Apostle of Peace'. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the {{peace movement}} by securing a commitment from the Great Powers in the Treaty of Paris (1856) {{at the end of the}} Crimean War, in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by social upheaval, the first peace congress was held in Brussels in 1848 followed by Paris a year later.|$|E
40|$|How do {{domestic}} politics influence {{the formation of}} <b>international</b> <b>institutions,</b> and how do <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> shape {{domestic politics}}? These questions cannot be answered in isolation because national leaders form and join <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> to advance their domestic interests. We illuminate the relationship between <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> and domestic politics by analyzing whether preferential trading agreements (PTAs) promote liberal economic reform. In developing countries, leaders engage in PTA negotiations with major powers (European Union and United States) when these leaders want to implement reforms but cannot do so due to domestic political opposition {{and a lack of}} credible commitment. PTA negotiations promote economic reform by enabling credible commitment and allowing the leader to condition the implementation of the PTA on liberal policies...|$|R

Because few <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> are designed to deal with the broad nature of environmental risks, i t focuses on institutional learning. By analyzing the experiences of the United Nations Environment Program, World Meteorological Organization, and other <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> involved with global warming, this article identifies institutional properties (or functions) that encourage or inhibit social learning in the management of global environmental risks by <b>international</b> <b>institutions,</b> and that influence the adoption of such lessons b y their constituent members.

50|$|Realists {{with their}} focus on power and the {{struggle}} for survival in an anarchical world, criticize the role of <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> that govern the world economy, such as the World Bank, World Trade Organization (WTO), EU, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Scholars argue that the influence exerted by <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> is dependent upon the states that form part of them, and therefore <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> have little independent impact. Accordingly, the realist school emphasises the impact of state power over {{the strength of the}} institution per se.|$|R
500|$|In The New York Times, book {{reviewer}} Geoffrey Wheatcroft {{said that}} A Moral Reckoning (2003) presents {{an indictment of}} the Roman Catholic Church comparable to Goldhagen's indictment of Germany in Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996), saying, [...] "both as an <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> {{under the leadership of}} Pope Pius XII (1939–58), and at national levels in many European countries, the Church was deeply implicated in the appalling genocide.... Just as Germans had been carefully taught to hate the Jews, {{to the point that they}} could readily torment and kill them, so had Catholics"; that author Goldhagen [...] "sees a deep vein of Jew-hatred ingrained within Catholic tradition; and he does not think that there was any difference of kind, between that old religious Jew-hatred and the murderous racial antisemitism of the twentieth century".|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "Abhayagiri Vihara" [...] {{means not}} only a complex of monastic buildings, but also a {{fraternity}} of Buddhist monks, or Sangha, which maintains its own historical records, traditions and way of life. Founded in the 2nd century BC, it had grown into an <b>international</b> <b>institution</b> by the 1st century AD, attracting scholars {{from all over the}} world and encompassing all shades of Buddhist philosophy. Its influence can be traced to other parts of the world, through branches established elsewhere. Thus, the Abhayagiri Vihara developed as a great institution vis‑a‑vis the Mahavihara and the Jetavana Buddhist monastic sects in the ancient Sri Lankan capital of Anuradhapura.|$|E
60|$|The {{argument}} {{was a strong}} one; but had it been ten times as strong, the result {{would have been the}} same. The Mixed Tribunals, an <b>international</b> <b>institution,</b> delivered its judgment on strictly political grounds, the judges taking their orders from the different countries they represented. It was solemnly pronounced that war expenses were not 'extraordinary expenses.' The proximate destruction of the Khalifa's power was treated quite as a matter of everyday occurrence. A state of war was apparently regarded as usual in Egypt. On this wise and sensible ground the Egyptian Government were condemned to pay back £E500,000, together with interest and costs. After a momentary hesitation as to whether the hour had not come to join issue on the whole subject of the financial restrictions of Egypt, it was decided to bow to this iniquitous decision. The money had now to be refunded. It had already been spent. More than that, other sums were needed for the carrying on of the war. The army was by then occupying Dongola, and was in actual expectation of a Dervish counter-attack, and it was evident that the military operations could not be suspended or arrested. It was impossible to stop; yet without money it seemed impossible to go on; and, besides, it appeared that Egypt would be unable to repay the £E500,000 which she had been granted, and of which she was now deprived.|$|E

50|$|Some {{believe that}} these <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> lead to neotrusteeship, or postmodern imperialism. <b>International</b> <b>institutions</b> lead to an {{interconnectedness}} between strong and weak or post-conflict nations. In a situation such as a collapsed, weak-nation without the means of autonomous recovery, <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> often lead to involvement by a stronger nation to aid in recovery. Because there is no definite international security policy to address weak or post-conflict nations, stronger nations sometimes face “mission-creep,” a shift from supplying and aiding nations to an escalation of mission goals, when aiding weaker nations. In addition, there is some debate {{due to lack of}} testing that international intervention is not the best institution to aid weak or post-war nations. Possible mission-creep, as well as inefficiencies in international intervention, creates debate as to the effectiveness of <b>international</b> <b>institutions</b> in peacekeeping.|$|R
