We provide evidence {{for the role of}} secreted lipopeptides, and more particularly of <b>fengycins,</b> in the protective effect afforded by the strain against damping-off of bean seedlings caused by Pythium ultimum and against gray mold of apple in post-harvest disease. This role was demonstrated by the strong biocontrol activity of lipopeptide-enriched extracts and through the detection of inhibitory quantities of <b>fengycins</b> in infected tissues. Beside such a direct antagonism of the pathogen, we show that root pre-inoculation with M 4 enabled the host plant to react more efficiently to subsequent pathogen infection on leaves. <b>Fengycins</b> could also be involved in this systemic resistance-eliciting effect of strain M 4, as these molecules may induce the synthesis of plant phenolics involved in or derived from the defense-related phenylpropanoid metabolism. Much remains to be discovered about the mechanisms by which Bacillus spp suppress disease.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the interaction of}} <b>fengycin,</b> a lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis, with lipid monolayers using the Langmuir trough technique in combination with Brewster angle rnicroscopy. Thermodynamic analyses were performed to get further information about the mixing behavior and the molecular interactions between the two components. The effect of <b>fengycin</b> on the structural and morphological characteristics of DPPC monolayers, as a simple model of biological membranes, depends on the <b>fengycin</b> molar ratio. With {{a small proportion of}} <b>fengycin</b> (X-f {{less than or equal to}} 0. 1), the compressibility of the monolayer is modified but the morphological characteristics of the DPPC are not significantly affected. At an intermediate molar ratio (0. 1 < X-f less than or equal to 0. 5), <b>fengycin</b> has a fluidizing effect on the DPPC monolayer by interacting partially with DPPC molecules. At higher molar ratio (X-f = 0. 66), <b>fengycin</b> totally dissolves the ordered phase of the lipid.

40|$|Based on its {{outstanding}} antifungal properties, it {{is reasonable}} to believe that <b>fengycin</b> might be efficient to topically treat localized dermatomycoses. Since most of the fungi species involved in the formation of those mycotic skin diseases colonize primarily the stratum corneum (SC), studying the interaction between <b>fengycin</b> and SC-mimicking lipid membranes is a primary step to determine the potential of <b>fengycin</b> to overcome the physical barrier of the skin. In this respect, multilamellar lipid vesicles (MLVs), with a lipid composition mimicking that of the SC, were prepared and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of <b>fengycin</b> was also assessed under skin conditions and found to be 1. 2 ± 0. 1 μM. The molecular interactions of <b>fengycin</b> with SC-mimicking MLVs were investigated by both DSC and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

At 40 °C and below, <b>fengycin</b> induced exothermic changes in the lipid structures suggesting that less-ordered lipid domains became more-ordered in presence of <b>fengycin.</b> At 60 °C, clearly endothermic interaction enthalpies were observed, which could arise from the "melting" of remaining solid domains enriched in high melting lipids that without <b>fengycin</b> melt at higher temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{environmental}} conditions both on the behaviour of <b>fengycin</b> at the air-aqueous interface and on its interaction with DPPC was studied using surface pressure-area isotherms and AFM. The ionisation state of <b>fengycin</b> is at the origin of its monolayer interfacial properties. The most organised interfacial arrangement is obtained when <b>fengycin</b> behaves as if having zero net charge (pH 2). In a fully ionised state (pH 7. 4), the organisation and the stability of <b>fengycin</b> monolayers depend on the ionic strength in the subphase. This can modulate the surface potential of <b>fengycin</b> and consequently the electrostatic repulsions inside the interfacial monolayer, {{as well as the}} lipopeptide interaction with the layer of water molecules forming the air-water interface. Intermolecular interactions of <b>fengycin</b> with DPPC are also strongly affected by the ionisation state of lipopeptide and the surface pressure (Pi) of the monolayer. A better miscibility between both interfacial components is observed at pH 2, while negatively charged lipopeptide molecules are segregated from the DPPC phase. A progressive desorption of <b>fengycin</b> from the interface is observed at pH 7. 4 when Pi increases while at pH 2, <b>fengycin</b> desorption brutally occurs when Pi rises above Pi value of the intermediate plateau.

In the present study, we have further analyzed this methanolic extract using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

40|$|BackgroundBacillus subtilis strains {{produce a}} broad {{spectrum}} of lipopeptides that are potent biosurfactants and have specific antimicrobial and antiviral activities. The cyclic lipodecapeptide <b>fengycin</b> is one such compound. Although the <b>fengycin</b> biosynthetic genes in B. subtilis 168 (pps genes) and F 29 - 3 (fen genes) have been well characterized, only limited information is available about the biochemical features of the <b>fengycin</b> synthetase multienzyme system. ResultsFive multifunctional peptide synthetases (Fen 1 – 5) that catalyze biosynthesis of the peptide portion of <b>fengycin</b> have been purified from crude extracts of the B. subtilis b 213 and A 1 / 3 strains. These enzymes activate all <b>fengycin</b> amino-acid components as aminoacyl adenylates or aminoacyl thioesters. Fen 1, Fen 2 and Fen 3 are each ~ 286 kDa, Fen 4 is ~ 400 kDa and Fen 5 is ~ 140 kDa; each enzyme activates a different set of l-amino acids. A five-gene cluster (fen 1 – 5) was detected in the B. subtilis A 1 / 3 genome that shows high homology to the pps and fen genes in B. subtilis strains 168 and F 29 - 3. Disruption of fen 4 resulted in a loss of <b>fengycin</b> production. The <b>fengycin</b> synthetase enzymes isolated from B. subtilis b 213 were assigned to the corresponding A 1 / 3 fen genes by their amino-terminal sequences. ConclusionsThe structural and functional organization of the <b>fengycin</b> synthetase system from B. subtilis b 213 has been characterized in detail and correlated with the corresponding pps and fen genes in B. subtilis strains 168, A 1 / 3 and F 29 - 3.

40|$|<b>Fengycin</b> is {{a natural}} lipopeptide synthetized by Bacillus subtilis strains. It is {{characterized}} by strong antifungal and low hemolytic activities. It seems {{also play a role}} in the promoting of elicitor activities of other compounds. The target of the biological activities of <b>fengycin</b> is supposed to be plasma membrane of sensitive cells. Even though the natural <b>fengycin</b> from has been discovered 25 years ago, nowadays, there is an increase of interest for this compound because of its potent applications. Until 15 years ago, the primary structure of <b>fengycin</b> was a matter of open debate before the publication of the corrected structure obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy techniques. Although the infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectra of the lipopeptide were measured, no detailed analysis of these data was performed probably because of the unconventional sequence of the lipopeptide making these kinds of analyses complicated. In this work, our attempt was to analyze the conformational properties of <b>fengycin</b> as well as the calcium-induced changes using two complementary spectroscopic methods, Fourrier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and circular dichroism (CD). In a first step, we have characterized the conformational properties of pure <b>fengycin.</b> The lipopeptide adopts turn conformation in trifluoroethanol, a membrane-mimicking solvent. D-aminoacids seem to be involved in intra molecular hydrogen bonds. In a second step, we have investigated the role played by Ca 2 + ions on the possible conformational changes of <b>fengycin.</b> The addition of calcium gives rise to important modifications of the conformation. As <b>fengycin</b> has two glutamate residues, calcium is supposed to bind to their side chains. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the conformation of <b>fengycin</b> is closely depending of the environment and the presence of calcium ions play an important role on the conformational changes of the lipopeptide.

40|$|Background: <b>Fengycin</b> is a lipopeptide {{antibiotic}} synthesized nonribosomally by five <b>fengycin</b> synthetases.

Methods: Deletions were generated in the <b>fengycin</b> synthetases. The interaction of these mutant proteins with their partner enzymes in the complex was analyzed in vitro by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) or nickel pulldown assay. Results: The communication-mediating donor (COM-D) domains of the <b>fengycin</b> synthetases, when fused to GST, specifically pulled down their downstream partner enzymes in the GST-pulldown assays. The communication-mediating acceptor (COM-A) domains were required for binding between two partner enzymes, although the domains alone did not confer specificity of the binding to their upstream partner enzymes. This {{study found that the}} COM-A domain, the condensation domain, and a portion of the adenylation domain in <b>fengycin</b> synthetase B (FenB) were required for specific binding to <b>fengycin</b> synthetase A (FenA).

30|$|Ultrafiltration {{is highly}} {{suitable}} for the purification of lipopeptides {{from a series of}} extremely complex extract of bacteria and impurity.

But if methanol was added to micellar solution, micelles will recover into monomers. This feature can be used to process a two-step ultrafiltration for the purification of lipopeptides by choosing appropriate aperture of ultrafiltration membrane (Isa et al. 2007). Electrospray ionisation (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify lipopeptides homologs produced by B. licheniformis (Pecci et al. 2010) and B. subtilis (Iatsenko et al. 2014).

Three families of lipopeptides produced by Bacillus subtilis - surfactins, <b>fengycins</b> and iturins represent an interesting class of such compounds. They exert a wide range of biological activities and possess a good potential for modifications and improvement of their structure and function. Lipopeptides produced by B. subtilis are surface active compounds capable of reducing surface/interface tension. The variety of their biological activities stems from their ability to insert into lipid membranes leading to disruption and permeabilization of the membrane. Specific mode of action differs between the three families but the common feature is that it is concentration dependent. First, lipopeptides induce ion leakage, pore formation and then the increasing concentration eventually causes complete solubilisation of the membrane in a detergent-like manner. In addition, surfactin can inhibit some enzymes by chelating divalent cations required for their activity. These properties make the B. subtilis lipopeptides promising compounds for commercial applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of CD, FT-IR, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques {{was applied to}} elucidate the conformation of <b>fengycin,</b> a natural lipopeptide with antifungal and eliciting activities, in a membrane-mimicking environment and to investigate the effect of calcium ions on the conformation. We mainly observed that <b>fengycin</b> adopts a turn conformation and that the side chain of glutamate residues {{plays a key role}} on the stabilization of the peptide ring backbone conformation. More particularly, the binding of calcium ions by the carboxylic moieties has a consequence on the environment of the tyrosine residues. Our data suggest also an arrangement of <b>fengycin</b> molecules into “-sheet like micelles” in a membrane-mimicking environment and the enhancement of this aggregating effect in presence of calcium ions. The modulation of the <b>fengycin</b> conformation by the environmental conditions may influence its biological properties. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Effects of cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) {{obtained}} from Bacillus subtilis ABS-S 14 on eliciting defense-related gene transcription and activity of defense-related enzymes; glucanase (GLU), chitinase (CHI), peroxidase (POX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) in Citrus sinensis cv. Valencia fruit were determined. The maximum level of GLU transcripts induced in fruit treated with <b>fengycin</b> was significantly greatest among treatments at 48 h. Surfactin enhanced the LOX and POX transcripts. In parallel, corresponding enzyme activities {{were correlated with}} changes in gene expression observed in fruit inoculated with Penicillium digitatum following treatment with individual CLPs. Synergistic effects of <b>fengycin</b> and iturin A, <b>fengycin</b> and surfactin were shown in gene transcript of GLU and CHI, respectively, and surfactin induced POX and LOX gene expression of citrus flavedo without pathogen infection. These results suggest that <b>fengycin</b> and surfactin act as elicitors of defense-related gene expression in "Valencia" fruit following infection...|$|E
30|$|The {{reports of}} {{mechanisms}} for the anticancer effects of iturin and <b>fengycin</b> are comparably {{much less than}} those of surfactin. <b>Fengycin</b> interacts with lipid monolayers at the air-aqueous interface-implications on biological membranes. Iturin A inhibits Akt-mediated GSK 3 beta and FoxO 3 a signaling and triggers apoptosis in breast cancer (Dey et al. 2015). The induction of apoptosis by a mitochondria-dependent pathway has also {{been found in the}} mechanisms for the anti-fungal activities of Bacillus lipopeptides, including surfactin, <b>fengycin,</b> and iturin A. The current study revealed the inhibitory effect of B. subtilis lipopeptides consisting of a majority of iturin on K 562 blood cancer cells.|$|E
40|$|Biodeterioration is {{a common}} problem finding in art works such as rock art caves, mural {{paintings}} and historic buildings, resulting from interactions between living organisms, specific substrate and environmental conditions [1]. Many microorganisms produce serious damage in historic materials, which are decomposed {{by the action of}} specific enzymes and organic acids produced by microbial communities. Biocide treatments are considered {{to be one of the}} practical approaches for conservation of artworks [2] however, the typical treatment is based on the application of chemical products that can present high toxicity to humans. Bacillus species are worth for treatment of these historic materials because they produce a great diversity of secondary metabolites with biological activity [3, 4]. Some strains of Bacillus subtilis have been referred to produce antifungal lipopeptides, such as surfactins, iturins and <b>fengycins.</b> These amphiphilic cyclic biosurfactants have many advantages over other biocides: low toxicity, high biodegradability and environmentally friendly characteristics [5]. In this study, it was produced lipopeptides from bacterial origin by means of Bacillus sp liquid cultures and evaluated the inhibitory effect of these microbial lipopeptides against biodeteriogenic fungal strains (Cladosporium sp., Penicillium sp., Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger) isolated from biodegraded mural paintings...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium graminearum causes Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB), a devastating disease {{that leads to}} {{extensive}} yield and quality loss of wheat and barley. Bacteria isolated from wheat kernels and plant anthers were screened for antagonistic activity against F. graminearum. Based on its in vitro effectiveness, strain SG 6 was selected for characterization and identified as Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis SG 6 exhibited a high antifungal effect on the mycelium growth, sporulation and DON production of F. graminearum with the inhibition rate of 87. 9 %, 95. 6 % and 100 %, respectively. In order to gain insight into biological control effect in situ, we applied B. subtilis SG 6 at anthesis through the soft dough stage of kernel development in field test. It was revealed that B. subtilis SG 6 significantly reduced disease incidence (DI), FHB index and DON (P ≤ 0. 05). Further, ultrastructural examination shows that B. subtilis SG 6 strain induced stripping of F. graminearum hyphal surface by destroying the cellular structure. When hypha cell wall was damaged, the organelles and cytoplasm inside cell would exude, leading to cell death. The antifungal activity of SG 6 could {{be associated with the}} coproduction of chitinase, <b>fengycins</b> and surfactins...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Some {{isolates}} of the Bacillus subtilis/amyloliquefaciens {{species are}} known for their plant protective activity against fungal phytopathogens. It is notably due to their genetic potential to form an impressive array of antibiotics including non-ribosomal lipopeptides (LPs). In the work presented here, we wanted to gain further insights into the relative role of these LPs in the global antifungal activity of B. subtilis/amyloliquefaciens. To that end, a comparative study was conducted involving multiple strains that were tested against four different phytopathogens. We combined various approaches to further exemplify that secretion of those LPs is a crucial trait in direct pathogen ward off and this can actually be generalized to all members of these species. Our data illustrate that for each LP family, the fungitoxic activity varies in function of the target species and that the production of iturins and <b>fengycins</b> is modulated by the presence of pathogens. Our data on the relative involvement of these LPs in the biocontrol activity and modulation of their production are discussed in the context of natural conditions in the rhizosphere. © 2014 The Authors.
