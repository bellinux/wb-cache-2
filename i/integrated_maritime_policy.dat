40|$|This {{report is}} a {{prospective}} document which aims at showing the potentials of marine productivity and fish habitat monitoring {{to support the}} EU <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Policies.</b> The main proxy for marine productivity relies on the daily tracking of productive frontal systems of the surface ocean (chlorophyll-a fronts) and of the hydrological tolerance of a specific species by physical ocean models. The monitoring of pelagic habitats allows to introduce the still lacking spatial and environmental dimensions in the fisheries management to a) improve stock assessments, b) adjust fishing opportunities to the productivity of marine ecosystems, c) identify {{in space and time}} the essential fish habitats to preferably protect for sustainable catches and d) limit by-catch by differentiating target from non-target species habitats. Other applications such as the risk of ship strike with large cetaceans or the eutrophication detection illustrate the capacities of the pelagic habitat monitoring to support the integration of multiple human activities within the EU Maritime Spatial Planning.

50|$|The {{increasing}} {{integration of}} European policies has increasingly influenced {{the work of}} the parliamentary forum. In 2007, the European Commission created an action plan for an <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>policy.</b> Subsequently, the parliamentary forum dealt on a regular basis with the measures announced in the action plan, e.g. the support of intersectionary clusters or the competitiveness of maritime transport. So the main topic of the 7th parliamentary forum which took place in Schwerin was “The implementation of European strategies in the southern Baltic”. From then onwards, the parliamentary forum had significantly supported the development of the EU strategy for the Baltic sea region and made comprehensive contributions in the consultation process. Additionally, it was decided to evaluate the policies resulting from the EU strategy on a yearly basis. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is particularly active as the coordinator for the tourism policies. The main topic of the 9th Southern Baltic Sea Parliamentary Forum in Gdansk was the EU strategy for the Baltic sea region. The 13th parliamentary forum took place from 20-21 April 2015 in Hamburg. It mainly dealt with “Science and university cooperation in the Baltic sea area”. The 14th parliamentary forum with the topic “Agriculture, fishery and food industry - Innovation and cooperation in the southern Baltic region” took place from 12-14 June 2016 in Kiel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a few general {{comments on the}} effective global ocean governance (GOG). The Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) establishes fundamental legal principles for the governance of the marine environment and its resources. Furthermore, {{in the context of}} GOG the international community is conscious that improving of global and regional cooperation ought to be in the mainstream of socio-economic and political discourse. Nowadays, the UNCLOS is not able to give an answer for all new questions arising in the law of the sea. Therefore, it would seem that there is a great need to provide more pragmatic approaches to global ocean governance by international community as well as national governments, using the holistic paradigm of sustainable development. At the regional level, the European Union promotes an <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>policy.</b> Each EU marine Member State is obliged to prepare national <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>policy</b> {{as a part of the}} <b>integrated</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>policy</b> of EU.

40|$|The European Union's <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Policy</b> is {{intended}} {{in part to}} co-ordinate sectoral policies, to achieve joined-up thinking and action and overcome the inconsistency between policy approaches {{that has led to}} the degradation of European seas. An integrated governance would be relatively straight-forward if the different interests and actors were operating on the basis of shared values, but they are not. While the fisheries sector, whether large or small-scale, is driven by a commercial imperative which tends towards the greatest extraction of the resource possible, environmentalists would champion the removal of all human impacts, other than redress activity, as the optimum state for the ecosystem. However, the greatest impediment to an integrated approach is the failure to subject the EU's Common Fisheries Policy to the objectives of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Policy.</b> Instead, all decisions concerning fisheries will continue to be made in accordance with the Fisheries Regulation which demands exploitation of the fragile resource. Attention needs to be given to how EU fisheries policy is to acquire values beyond that of commercial extraction for immediate economic benefit so that it may cohere with objectives of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Policy</b> and aid the regeneration of the seas.

The MSFD has been widely criticised for legal vagueness, lack of coordination, uncertainty about funding, and poor governance; its future role within EU <b>Integrated</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Policy</b> remains unclear.
