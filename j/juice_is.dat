40|$|Effect of {{ultrasound}} {{treatment on}} carrot <b>juice</b> <b>was</b> investigated through measuring pH, electrical conductivity, viscosity, visual color, total soluble solids, total sugars, total carotenoids, ascorbic acid contents and microbial load. No significant effect (p> 0. 05) of ultrasound treatment on pH of carrot <b>juice</b> <b>was</b> observed. Electrical conductivity, viscosity and color values gradually increased (p< 0. 05) with treatment time increase. Total soluble solids, total sugars, total carotenoids and ascorbic acid contents of carrot <b>juice</b> <b>were</b> significantly improved (p< 0. 05) due to ultrasound treatment. Moreover, significant decrease (p< 0. 05) in microbial load of sonicated carrot <b>juice</b> <b>was</b> observed.

40|$|Fruit <b>juices</b> <b>are</b> popular {{worldwide}} {{with children}} of all ages as they are sweet and perceived to be healthful. This in vitro study was sought to measure pH of 10 different fruit juices, to find out possible erosive effects on human dental enamel of 40 extracted sound premolars and also to measure fluoride and trace elements of these juices. The estimation of pH of fruit <b>juices</b> <b>was</b> done by using Systronic upH 362 pH meter. The erosive effects of fruit <b>juices</b> <b>were</b> tested by using polarized light microscope. Orion electrode was used to measure fluoride. The trace elements were estimated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer No. 6501 F. The pH values in different <b>juices</b> <b>were</b> observed at different levels, and pH values of these <b>juices</b> <b>were</b> more acidic than baseline after 24 hours. As the time increased, the erosion effect became more in pineapple; grape and sugarcane juices, and they had more cariogenic trace elements like selenium, iron and manganese. So, these <b>juices</b> <b>were</b> found to be cariogenic. To conclude, orange, mousambi, mango, pomegranate, apple, chikku and watermelon juices had no erosive effect on the human enamel, with the presence of highest amount of trace elements like fluoride and phosphorous which are considered as strongly cariostatic...|$|R

5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%.

5|$|The {{sweetness}} of carrots allows the vegetable {{to be used}} in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot <b>juice</b> <b>is</b> also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Homemade {{fruit juices}} {{are also a}} common {{household}} drink during warm days and during Ramadan, the holy month for fasting by Muslims. In the Palestinian culture, coffee and tea is traditionally served to adults during a visit or gathering, while <b>juice</b> <b>is</b> served to everyone. Drinks such as tamar hind or qamar deen are served during special occasions to everyone. Tamar hind, originally from Africa is a liquorice drink made by soaking or infusing liquorice sticks, and adding lemon juice. Qamar deen is traditionally served to break the Ramadan fast (as is water), and is an iced drink made from a dry sheet of apricots soaked in water, and mixed with lemon juice or syrup.|$|E

5|$|There are {{currently}} two forthcoming missions {{planned for the}} Jovian system. Juno, launched on 5 August 2011, has limited imaging capabilities, but it could monitor Io's volcanic activity using its near-infrared spectrometer, JIRAM. The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (<b>JUICE)</b> <b>is</b> a planned European Space Agency mission to the Jovian system that is intended {{to end up in}} Ganymede orbit. JUICE has a launch scheduled for 2022, with arrival at Jupiter planned for January 2030. JUICE will not fly by Io, but it will use its instruments, such as a narrow-angle camera, to monitor Io's volcanic activity and measure its surface composition during the two-year Jupiter-tour phase of the mission prior to Ganymede orbit insertion. The Io Volcano Observer (IVO) is a proposal for a Discovery-class mission that would launch in 2021. It would involve multiple flybys of Io while in orbit around Jupiter beginning in 2026.|$|E

50|$|Fruit <b>juices</b> <b>are</b> {{condensed}} by evaporation for storage, {{transport and}} commercial use.

40|$|Amla, a richest {{source of}} vitamin C ranges upto 950 mg/ 100 g. Due to its {{astringent}} taste, it is not palatable for direct consumption, hence processing is essential.

40|$|The Flash Profile is a {{descriptive}} analysis method derived from Free-Choice Profile, {{in which each}} taster chooses and uses his/her own words to evaluate the product while comparing several attributes.

This study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties (color, titratable acidity and solid content) as well as sensory analysis like Flash profile and affective test. In physicochemical characterization and in Flash Profile, the juice A (pulp) had higher solid content and consistence, the juice B (concentrated <b>juice)</b> <b>was</b> the least acidic and presented the lowest value of soluble solids and presented strong aroma and flavor of passion-fruit, the juice C (reconstituted <b>juice)</b> <b>was</b> pale yellow and showed artificial flavor and the juice D (concentrated <b>juice)</b> <b>was</b> the most acidic, consistent with the natural flavor.
