2500|$|While {{efficient}} {{energy use}} and resource efficiency are growing as public policy issues, more than 70% of coal {{plants in the}} European Union are more than 20 years old and operate at an <b>efficiency</b> <b>level</b> of between 32–40%. Technological developments in the 1990s have allowed efficiencies {{in the range of}} 40–45% at newer plants. However, according to an impact assessment by the European Commission, this is still below the best available technological (BAT) efficiency levels of 46–49%. With gas-fired power plants the average efficiency is 52% compared to 58–59% with best available technology (BAT), and gas and oil boiler plants operate at average 36% efficiency (BAT delivers 47%). According to that same impact assessment by the European Commission, raising the efficiency of all new plants and the majority of existing plants, through the setting of authorisation and permit conditions, to an average generation efficiency of 51.5% in 2020 would lead to a reduction in annual consumption of [...] of natural gas and [...] of coal.|$|E

[...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001 The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine what the reading <b>efficiency</b> <b>levels</b> of at-risk first year students are. Secondly to determine in which way, if any, the reading <b>efficiency</b> <b>levels</b> of at-risk first year students will improve after completing a reading enrichment and learning development course. Thirdly to determine in which way the academic achievement of at-risk first year students will be affected, if at all, by this learner support programme. As basis of the empirical research a pre-post- test experimental design was used. The at-risk students' reading <b>efficiency</b> <b>levels</b> were determined by means of a infra red Visagraph II apparatus. Academic achievement {{for the purpose of this}} study was determined by means of the first (pre-test) and third (post-test) Psychology class test. The results of the Learning and Study Strategy Inventory questionaire were used to determine if the learner support programme made a difference to at-risk first years' study strategies. The quantitive results were qualitively analysed and discussed. The results showed that the reading <b>efficiency</b> <b>levels</b> of the identified students were at least four levels below the required reading <b>efficiency</b> <b>levels</b> for their age group. Statistical and practical meaningful improvement in reading <b>efficiency</b> <b>levels</b> as well as improvement in their academic achievement levels were found in the experimental groups' results. The results indicated that this Inclusive form of learner support made a meaningful difference. Resulting from these findings recommendations for future studies were made. Master...|$|R

50|$|For energy {{production}} purposes, one might use a container located inside a solenoid. The container {{is filled with}} gaseous uranium hexafluoride, where the uranium is enriched, to a level just short of criticality. Afterward, the uranium hexafluoride is compressed by external means, thus initiating a nuclear chain reaction and {{a great amount of}} heat, which in turn causes an expansion of the uranium hexafluoride. Since the UF6 is contained within the vessel, it can't escape and thus compresses elsewhere. The result is a plasma wave moving in the container, and the solenoid converts some of its energy into electricity at an <b>efficiency</b> <b>level</b> of about 20%. In addition, the container must be cooled, and one can extract energy from the coolant by passing it through a heat exchanger and turbine system as in an ordinary thermal power plant.|$|E
5000|$|Thirdly is the {{magnitude}} of fatigue loading experienced by the external cables, and their subsequent treatment by design codes. Unlike a bridge's near-constant dead load, its live load can be highly variable both in time and position, resulting in fluctuations in the stress level experienced by the bridge's structural elements as the live loading varies. The lower proportion of live load carried by the extradosed cables results in a reduced magnitude of stress fluctuations within the cables, down from typically [...] or above for cable-stay bridges to around [...] for extradosed designs. This has a direct benefit in reducing the detrimental effects of fatigue experienced by the stay cables and their end anchorages, and bridge design codes allow extradosed stay cables to operate at a significantly higher design stress level and therefore material <b>efficiency</b> <b>level</b> as a result.|$|E
