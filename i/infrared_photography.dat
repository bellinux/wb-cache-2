5|$|X-ray {{analysis}} {{shows that there}} were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the paint was applied. This is left exposed in some areas, most noticeably in the Virgin's veil and mantle and in Christ's shroud. <b>Infrared</b> <b>photography</b> reveals little underdrawing but shows that the canvas underwent several changes before it was completed; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was painted over the Virgin's mantle.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and <b>infrared</b> <b>photography</b> {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
25|$|Photography {{has become}} {{ubiquitous}} in recording events and data {{in science and}} engineering, and at crime scenes or accident scenes. The method has been much extended by using other wavelengths, such as <b>infrared</b> <b>photography</b> and ultraviolet photography, as well as spectroscopy.

25|$|A {{majority}} of the collection from the Qumran caves was acquired by the Palestine Archaeological Museum. The Museum had the scrolls photographed by Najib Albina, a local Arab photographer trained by Lewis Larsson of the American Colony in Jerusalem, Between 1952 and 1967, Albina documented the five-stage process of the sorting and assembly of the scrolls, done by the curator and staff of the Palestine Archaeological Museum, using <b>infrared</b> <b>photography.</b> Using a process known today as broadband fluorescence <b>infrared</b> <b>photography,</b> or NIR photography, Najib and the team at the Museum produced over 1,750 photographic plates of the scrolls and fragments. The photographs were taken with the scrolls laid out on animal skin, using large format film, which caused the text to stand out, making the plates especially useful for assembling fragments. These are the earliest photographs of the museum's collection, which was the most complete {{in the world at}} the time, and they recorded the fragments and scrolls before their further decay in storage, so they are often considered the best recorded copies of the scrolls.|$|E
25|$|Reviewers {{have pointed}} out that the show {{effectively}} utilizes a number of cinematic techniques common in horror film. The editing leaves open the question of whether paranormal activity is actually occurring, and the cinematography uses night-vision and <b>infrared</b> <b>photography</b> to create a suspenseful atmosphere. The writing on the show is particularly effective at creating a sense of portent and dread, one reviewer noted, and the music and graphics contribute effectively to the tension and fear as well.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1993, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration used digital {{infrared}} imaging technology to produce photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments. In {{partnership with the}} Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully worked to expand {{on the use of}} <b>infrared</b> <b>photography</b> previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of spectra at which images are photographed. NASA used this multi-spectral imaging technique, adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes, in order to reveal previously illegible text on fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The process uses a liquid crystal tunable filter in order to photograph the scrolls at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, image distortion is significantly diminished. This method was used with select fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls to reveal text and details that cameras that take photographs using a larger light spectrum could not reveal. The camera and digital imaging assembly was developed specifically for the purpose of photographing illegible ancient texts.|$|E

500|$|The panel {{consists}} of a single [...] oak board, cut vertically down close to the painted surface. It has a small unpainted area at the upper left. The support's encasing was probably changed in the 19th century; today four of the eight supports are fixed {{to the edges of}} the interior borders, forming inner mouldings. The other four act as inner pins. The varnish is severely degraded, with key areas of paint and ground either removed or overpainted. <b>Infrared</b> <b>photography</b> of the reverse reveals traces of short vertical hatching and underdrawings, but no hint as to the identity of the sitter. Its ground is mostly chalk-based; the pigments are predominantly blacks, red lake, and blues. The final portrait differs in many ways from the underdrawingâ€“ the fingers are shorter, the right thumb and the parapet are lower, and the right arm once extended over a larger area. In the final portrait, the ear is elevated, and the scroll occupies a larger pictorial space. Analysis of the pigment shows that the flesh of his face is painted with whites and vermilion, and traced with greys, blacks, blues, and some ultramarine over a red-lake glaze.|$|E

2500|$|Rudenko's most {{striking}} discovery was {{the body of}} a tattooed Pazyryk chief: a thick-set, powerfully built man who had died when he was about 50. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see [...] ). Subsequent investigation using reflected <b>infrared</b> <b>photography</b> revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed. No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature embroidery, and these were probably used for tattooing.|$|E

This could refer to the Aztec painter Marcos Cipac de Aquino, who was active at that time. But [...] "if he did, he did so without making a preliminary sketch â€“ in itself a near-miraculous procedure.

40|$|Background: A {{sensitive}} {{method is}} required to detect retinal hamartomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the color fundus <b>photography,</b> <b>infrared</b> imaging (IFG), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the detection rate of retinal hamartoma in patients with TSC. Methods: This study included 11 patients (22 eyes) with TSC, who underwent color fundus photography, IFG, and spectral-domain OCT to detect retinal hamartomas. TSC 1 and TSC 2 Results: The mean age of the 11 patients was 8. 0 Â± 2. 1 years. The mean spherical equivalent was âˆ’ 0. 55 Â± 1. 42 D by autorefraction with cycloplegia. In 11 patients (22 eyes), OCT, <b>infrared</b> fundus <b>photography,</b> and color fundus photography revealed 26, 18, and 9 hamartomas, respectively. The predominant hamartoma was type I (55. 6 %). All the hamartomas that detected by color fundus photography or IFG can be detected by OCT. Conclusion: Among the methods of color fundus photography, IFG, and OCT, the OCT has higher detection rate for retinal hamartoma in TSC patients; therefore, OCT might be promising for the clinical diagnosis of TSC...|$|R
