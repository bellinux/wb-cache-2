In 1971 the Welsh <b>Greyhound</b> Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council announced that a revamp of the Arms Park site would not include <b>greyhound</b> racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh <b>Greyhound</b> Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 <b>greyhound</b> fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than ten minutes to reject a plan to switch <b>greyhound</b> racing to nearby Maindy Stadium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greyhound</b> Charter Services {{arranges}} charter buses {{for customers}} using Greyhound's fleet of motorcoaches. Unlike many smaller charter operators, <b>Greyhound</b> {{is able to}} operate nationwide and offer one-way services, due to its network of routes.

2500|$|A {{very common}} {{misconception}} regarding <b>Greyhounds</b> {{is that they}} are hyperactive. This is usually not the case with retired racing <b>Greyhounds.</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> can live comfortably as apartment dogs, as they do not require much space and sleep almost 18 hours per day. Due to their calm temperament, <b>Greyhounds</b> can make better [...] "apartment dogs" [...] than smaller, more active breeds.|$|R
25|$|The Sault Ste. Marie <b>Greyhounds</b> (aka Soo <b>Greyhounds)</b> {{are a major}} junior {{ice hockey}} team in the Ontario Hockey League. The <b>Greyhounds</b> play home games at the Essar Centre. The present team was founded in 1962 as a team in the Northern Ontario Hockey Association.

5|$|<b>Greyhound</b> Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra legroom. In many stations <b>Greyhound</b> Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers traveling on other <b>Greyhound</b> services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto <b>Greyhound</b> Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who bought their tickets earlier get to board the bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greyhound</b> Lines, Inc., usually {{shortened}} to <b>Greyhound,</b> is an intercity bus {{common carrier}} serving over 3,800 destinations across North America. The company's first route began in Hibbing, Minnesota in 1914, {{and the company}} adopted the name The <b>Greyhound</b> Corporation in 1929. Since October 2007, <b>Greyhound</b> has been a subsidiary of British transportation company FirstGroup, but continues to be based in Dallas, Texas, {{where it has been}} headquartered since 1987. <b>Greyhound</b> and sister companies in FirstGroup America are the largest motorcoach operators in the United States and Canada.|$|E

5|$|<b>Greyhound</b> racing was {{introduced}} to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first purpose-built <b>greyhound</b> stadium, constructed {{at a cost of}} £22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the <b>Greyhound</b> Racing Association (GRA), a company chaired by Sir William Gentle, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, with the proviso {{that it had to be}} used for <b>greyhound</b> racing.|$|E

The <b>Greyhounds</b> promoted Lambert to the head coaching position.|$|R
25|$|<b>Greyhounds</b> {{have higher}} levels of red blood cells than other breeds. Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger {{quantities}} of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles. Conversely, <b>Greyhounds</b> have lower levels of platelets than other breeds. Veterinary blood services often use <b>Greyhounds</b> as universal blood donors.|$|R

5|$|In August 1992, <b>Greyhound</b> {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} <b>Greyhound</b> be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a <b>Greyhound</b> terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and <b>Greyhound</b> agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E
5|$|In February 1987, <b>Greyhound</b> Lines' new {{ownership}} and the ATU {{agreed on a}} new, 3-year contract. In June 1987, <b>Greyhound</b> Lines acquired Trailways, Inc.

5|$|In October 1998, Laidlaw {{announced}} it would acquire the U.S. operations of <b>Greyhound</b> Lines, Inc., including Carolina Trailways and other <b>Greyhound</b> affiliates, for about $470 million.

5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against <b>Greyhound.</b> The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a <b>Greyhound</b> bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a <b>Greyhound</b> bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, <b>Greyhound</b> idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, <b>Greyhound</b> was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused <b>Greyhound</b> to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to <b>Greyhound.</b> While the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 film Tomorrowland {{has several}} scenes {{featuring}} <b>Greyhound,</b> including a character {{traveling to the}} 1964 New York World's Fair on a historic bus (a 1969 GMC), a <b>Greyhound</b> Glide-a-Ride trackless train on the World's Fair midway, and the main character traveling on a <b>Greyhound</b> bus in 2015 (a MCI 102DL3) from Cape Canaveral, Florida to Houston, Texas. <b>Greyhound</b> also sponsored a sweepstakes tied in with the film, wrapped several <b>Greyhound</b> buses with imagery from the film, placed promotional items inside terminals, and sponsored the film's Los Angeles premier.|$|E

50|$|After {{starting}} the 1992-93 {{season with the}} North Bay Centennials, Penney finished the season with the Sault Ste.

In the playoffs, Penney scored seven goals and 17 points in 18 games as the <b>Greyhounds</b> lost to the Peterborough Petes in the OHL finals.|$|R
50|$|He became {{involved}} in a court case regarding dog licences, where one of his employees was found with four <b>greyhounds</b> that were allegedly unlicensed. The reporting media noted {{that it was a}} case of considerable importance for large owners of <b>greyhounds.</b> The magistrates were eventually satisfied that the dogs were licensed, but noted that it was desirable that separate licences were granted for separate packs of <b>greyhounds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{problem was}} further {{addressed}} in 2014 when <b>Greyhound</b> rolled {{out a new}} yield management computer system. With the new system, <b>Greyhound</b> is now able to more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, <b>Greyhound</b> still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on <b>Greyhound</b> Express routes).|$|E
5|$|As the 1930s progressed and {{the economy}} improved, the <b>Greyhound</b> Corporation began to prosper again. In 1934, {{intercity}} bus lines (of which <b>Greyhound</b> was the largest) carried approximately 400,000,000 passengers—nearly as many passengers as the Class I railroads. The film It Happened One Night (1934) centered on an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by <b>Greyhound</b> bus with a reporter (Clark Gable). The movie is credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide. In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. In 1935 Wickman was able to announce record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, <b>Greyhound</b> began taking delivery of 306 new buses.|$|E

50|$|The Canidrome soon {{looked to}} Ireland for its supply of <b>greyhounds,</b> and some unscrupulous owners in Ireland readily sold young <b>greyhounds</b> not graded {{high enough to}} race on tracks in the UK and Ireland to agents in Hong Kong, who sell such <b>greyhounds</b> on at an auction at the Canidrome, {{sometimes}} for large profits. In March and April 2016, 9 young <b>greyhounds</b> were flown from Dublin to Hong Kong and were then ferried on to Macau.
