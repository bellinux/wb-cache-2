40|$|Freedom of {{expression}} and censorship are frequently cast in opposing but symmetrical terms. According to the conventional narrative, the {{right to free speech}} was acquired when first the American and then the French Revolution overthrew the repressive censorship apparatus of the ancien régime. However this account of increasing emancipation overlooks the important role played by the French Revolution in establishing a new definition of censorship that was both tolerant of free speech and repressive of political difference. This paper contends that precisely when political representation in the widest possible sense is at stake, freedom of speech cannot be reduced solely to a question of rights. It begins by revisiting the <b>Directory</b> <b>period</b> when the enlightened ideal of an unmediated public sphere openly clashed {{for the first time with}} the opposing ideal of an ‘unmediated’ or ‘popular’ sovereignty promoted by the radical press. It then focuses on the Conspiracy of Equals to show how the presumed neutrality of the liberal press was forged by repressing competing understandings of the right to free speech. Rather than assume that revolutionary propaganda is the ‘other’ of liberalism, this paper demonstrates the joint origins of both liberal and revolutionary understandings of free speech in the new censorship laws that attempted to separate the message from the medium of revolution...|$|E

Analysis included the use of general grouping and choropleth mapping of distributions, centrographic and analysis of variance techniques in an investigation of segregation patterns, and migration analysis in a study of the processes of change. The initial pattern of high status segregation was concentric and centrally located resembling the pre-industrial patterns identified by Schnore and contrary to classical theory, High status growth was slow and axial resulting in the present day sectoral pattern, but not in the form predicted by Hoyt. Outward growth of the dominant high status area in the northwest has been minimal in the last two or three decades, with the older areas accommodating many of the new elite, and being surrounded by lower status suburban growth. Thus the experience of Christchurch has demonstrated a number of time and culture-specific aspects of the Burgess - Hoyt hypothesis, Residential structure is related to ongoing social processes with contemporary structural change in large part reflecting the tremendous growth of an increasingly affluent property owning middle-class, aided by car ownership, governmental encouragement, and an egalitarian ethic...|$|R

40|$|The {{machine tool}} {{industry}} {{is one of several}} branches of the engineering industry which developed as a manufacturing industry {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. It is perhaps the most important of all the capital goods industries, since its products are used by, and are indispensable to, all other industries processing metals. Ihe production of industrial machine tools thus made possible the considerable advances in the use of metals which took place during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, on which much of modern industrial society is based. This thesis is the first attempt to write a comprehensive economic history of the English {{machine tool industry}} during the period of its transition from a craft, or handicraft, industry to a full manufacturing industry. Professor [?] Saul has discussed the industry, largely fron the standpoint of individual firms, in several articles, but there has been no other extended treatment of the industry. Two separate lines of approach to the history of the maohine tool industry are used, firstly, the growth and performance of the industry is analysed in aggregate terms, principally through two major statistical sources, which have not previously been used in such a way, the trade <b>directories</b> of the <b>period</b> and the statistics of the imports of machine tools into France, a major customer for the machine tools of Britain and her competitors. It is argued that the nachino tool industry can only be understood within the context of the engineering industry as a whole, and the relationships between the manufacture of machine tools and other metal goods is investigated. The size of the nachine tool industry, in terms of the number of firms making machine tools at any one time, is shown to be directly related to the fluctuations in the demand for machinery within the domestic economy. The success of the industry is considered in relation to American and other foreign competition, and it is argued that simplified explanations of English decline and American growth as producers of machine tools do not accord with the chronology of competition which is established. Possible explanations are then explored for the changes in the competitive position of English exporters and producers of machine tools. Secondly an analysis is made of the experience of one machine tool producer, Greenwood and Bailey, to provide information on characteristics of the industry which could not easily be approached through aggregate analysis. The very extensive cost and sales records of the firm, covering all its production between 1856 and 1900, are used in this study. The market for one of the principal products of the fim, machine tools for the production of small-arms, is described in detail, and the sales made by the firm are analysed and its pricing policies investigated. The production of machine tools by the firm is considered through an analysis of chances in productivity; it is argued that the productivity of labour employed by the firm was increasing at a substantial rate throughout the period of analysis, and that this can largely be explained by the effects of technical change in the industry. The implications of this rise in labour productivity for the machine tool and engineering industries as a whole are also briefly considered. Throughout the thesis, the major emphasis is placed upon the use of statistical sources and techniques in writing the hietory of the industry. This emphasis, together with considerations of space and time, prevented more than incidental reference to some aspects of the industry, principally the experience of its labour force. Because of the imperfections of the evidence, it was impossible also to discuss trends in output or prices for the industry as a whole. As a counterweight to this, three major sources of statistical evidence on the industry, trade directories, trade statistics, and the records of Greenwood and Batley, have been analysed in detail. Computer data processing and analysis methods were used to enable those records to be utilised, and the value of this type of approach to the writing of economic history is discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|GLOBALIZATION AND TRANSNATIONAL VIEWS OF CHILEAN ELITES IN OPTIONS OF CONTEMPORANEOUS FOREIGN POLITICS WITH THE UNITED STATES One of the {{manifestations of}} current civil society is {{expressed}} in the growing and relevant role that diverse elites play in orientations and agendas of State foreign politics. These manifest, with a higher or lower degree of commitment, transnational values and ideas that in turn reflect an international community that {{is more and more}} global and interdependent. This is the case of many individuals and groups of interest in Chile, which have been educated in the world’s most advanced cultural and technological centres and nowadays have global views and behaviours that are more cosmopolitan than in the past, and which are influencing Chile’s international projection. In this regard, it is interesting to confirm, as an example illustrating this globalization of national elites, the study of their perceptions and attitudes towards the United States from the long experience of one institution - currently bi-national - of cultural and scientific exchange: the Fulbright Program in Chile. This study adopts as central work hypothesis that the growing globalization and interdependence of civil society in the international system would contribute to achieve a greater interest, presence and influence of local elites in formulation processes of Chilean foreign politics in the last decades. In turn, transnational principles and values that these groups would be assuming and expressing would have their origin in educational connections and interactions that are facilitated by exchange cultural and cooperation organisms. This is the case of the influence which has, through various means, been enforced on Chilean elites by the United States scientific and academic community. The counterpart for this has been the attempt by these subjects to have a closer and more coincident political rapprochement with the North American country. Due to the above, the experience in scientific and academic cooperation that the Fulbright Program has acquired during its time in Chile not only can be a case study to assess cultural cooperation between both countries, but it would also explain the perceptions and attitudes of local elites in regard to preferences and views of Chile’s international placement, particularly in terms of its relation with the United States. Therefore, this project involved an empirical research on these matters, based on opinions and attitudes of former Fulbright scholarship holders in Chile. Quantitative instruments such as the elaboration and application of a 60 questions questionnaire to a sample of 40 “Fulbrighters” were used for this purpose. Likewise, in-depth interviews were conducted on 6 members of the Fulbright Commission´s <b>Directory</b> from different <b>periods</b> and official documents of the institution, from the year it was set up in Chile to present days, were examined. The development of the selected case study in this project offers an opportunity to dimension the impact of the United States’ foreign politics, especially in regard to the influence that the so called “soft power” has had on Chilean and Latin American societies. The degree in which democratic values of the United States’ civic culture are assumed by the local elites of our societies represents an important aspect of transnationalization and globalization of international civil society, a matter that is currently getting more and more transcendental in concerns and debates about global governability. Therefore, the identification and exemplification of cases in these processes, through a study such as the one presented, may represent a contribution to the conceptual and analytical discussion in the field of international studies. Likewise, a study of this nature allows testing theoretical proposals in regard to their scope and validity to explain that views and behaviours on democracy that transnational and cosmopolitan elites would be expressing, such as those described by Lasch in its work. The evaluation of the roles of values and ideas in international civil society and in foreign politics agendas of the States, from the interaction of actors such as transnational elites, is also a significant contribution of studies such as the one here proposed. More specifically, in our own regional reality, empirical exercises such as the one developed by this research can be applied to other similar Fulbright experiences or other programs alike in societies such as ours. These can be samples of additional cases for a deeper knowledge and better understanding of transnationalization of local elites and its effects on international placement of Latin American countries.
