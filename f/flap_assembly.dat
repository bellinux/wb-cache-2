50|$|During early 2010, an Atlas Air {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} a safety and maintenance incident. In February, the cover of part of the <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> on a Boeing 747 detached from the aircraft, which {{was in the process of}} landing in Miami, Florida. On 17 May, a similar incident occurred; in this case, part of the inboard flaps on the right wing of a Boeing 747 separated from the aircraft. Due to alleged improper maintenance practices, the US Federal Aviation Administration on 5 May proposed a roughly $500,000 fine against the airline. The airline is fighting the allegations.|$|E
50|$|A belt trailer or self {{unloading}} belt trailer is a semi-trailer {{that uses}} either a chain and <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> or a continuous belt that runs lengthwise {{on the bottom}} of the trailer. The belt is bolted to bars that in turn bolt to a chain that runs the length of the trailer. This belt is usually composed of rubber that allows the belt to grip the product and various widths are available depending on manufacturer generally ranging from 25 inches to 61 inches wide. A planetary, which is powered by a PTO pump, electric, or gas motor, cycles the belt.|$|E

The test components included a flightworthy CF 6 - 50 D engine, nacelle, and USB <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> utilized in conjunction with ground verification testing of the USAF YC- 14 Advanced Medium STOL Transport propulsion system. Results, based on a preliminary analysis of the data, generally show reasonable agreement with predicted levels based on model data. However, additional detailed analysis is required to confirm the preliminary evaluation, to help delineate certain discrepancies with model data, and to establish a basis for future flight test comparisons...|$|E
40|$|Variable camber {{actuator}} assemblies {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag performance is maximized for slotted flap wings. Lift is improved over {{a broader range of}} cruising speeds by varying wing camber with rotational flap movements that do not introduce wing slots and induced drag. Forward flaps are secured to forward flange links which extended from, and are a part of forward <b>flap</b> linkage <b>assemblies.</b> The forward <b>flaps</b> rotate about flap pivots with their rotational displacement controlled by variable camber actuator assemblies located between the forward flaps and the forward flange links. Rear flaps are held relative to the forward flaps by rear <b>flap</b> linkage <b>assemblies</b> which may act independently from the forward <b>flap</b> linkage <b>assemblies</b> and the variable camber actuator assemblies. Wing camber is varied by rotating the flaps with the variable camber actuator <b>assemblies</b> while the <b>flaps</b> are in a deployed or tucked position. Rotating the flaps in a tucked position does not introduce significant wing surface discontinuities, and reduces aircraft fuel consumption on most flight profiles...|$|R

40|$|Jet peak-velocity decay {{data were}} {{obtained}} {{for a variety of}} circular and noncircular single-element and multi-element nozzles for application to externally-blown-flap (EBF) STOL aircraft. These data permit a rational approach, in terms of element type and element spacing, to nozzles designed to promote mixing of the jet exhaust with the surrounding air. Rapid mixing and the resulting lower axial jet velocity decreases the noise caused by the interaction of jet impingement on the <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> of EBF STOL aircraft. Empirical relationships are presented that permit the prediction of peak axial-velocity decay curves for a wide spectrum of mixer-type nozzles. The data are useful also in the design of ejector-type noise suppressors and for the suppression of VTOL downwash velocities caused by vertically oriented exhaust nozzles...|$|E
40|$|The noise {{characteristics}} {{associated with}} various {{upper surface blowing}} configurations were investigated using a small model consisting of a plate and <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> (simulated wing with flap) attached to a rectangular nozzle. Nozzle aspect ratio, flow-run length, and flap-deflection angle were the experimental parameters studied. Three nozzle-exit velocities were used. The normalized noise spectra obtained for different nozzle aspect ratios proved to be similar in terms of Strouhal number based on jet velocity and flow-run length. Consequently, the need for knowing local flow velocity and length scales (for example, at the flap trailing edge) as required {{in some of the}} existing noise prediction schemes is eliminated. Data are compared with results computed from three different noise prediction schemes, and the validity of each scheme is assessed. A simple method is proposed to evaluate the frequency dependence of acoustic shielding obtained with the simulated wing flap...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic stall is a {{major concern}} for highly loaded {{helicopter}} rotors in fast forward flight. The potential of a backflow flap for dynamic stall reduction is investigated. The <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> is mounted on the suction side of a helicopter airfoil undergoing deep-stall pitch oscillations. Wind-tu nnel experiments using high-speed particle image velocimetry were conducted to identify the flow topology and to imiestigate the flap's method of operation. A phaseaveraged proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to identify relevant flow events and to compare test cases with and without flap. The evolution of the la rge-scale dynamic stall vortex in the in itial phases of flow separation is analyzed in detail. The back-flow flap splits the vortex into two smaller vortices and thereby reduces the pitching moment peak. This effect can be described through the eigenmode coefficients of the POD. The study closes with an analysis of different pitching frequencies, which do not affect the flap's method of operation...|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing the X- 38 vehicle {{that will be}} used to demonstrate the technologies required for a potential crew return vehicle (CRV) for the International Space Station. This vehicle would serve both as an ambulance for medical emergencies and as an evacuation vehicle for the Space Station. Control surfaces on the X- 38 (body <b>flaps</b> and rudder/fin <b>assemblies)</b> require high temperature seals to limit hot gas ingestion and transfer of heat to underlying low-temperature structures to prevent over-temperature of these structures and possible loss of the vehicle. NASAs Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Glenn Research Center (GRC) are working together to develop and evaluate seals for these control surfaces. This paper presents results for compression. flow, scrub, and arc jet tests conducted on the baseline X- 38 rudder/fin seal design. Room temperature seal compression tests were performed at low compression levels to determine load versus linear compression, preload. contact area, stiffness. and resiliency characteristics under low load conditions. For all compression levels that were tested, unit loads and contact pressures for the seals were below the 5 lb/in. and 10 psi limits required to limit the loads on the adjoining Shuttle thermal tiles that the seals will contact. Flow rates through an unloaded (i. e. 0 % compression) double arrangement were twice those of a double seal compressed to the 20 % design compression level. The seals survived an ambient temperature 1000 cycle scrub test over relatively rough Shuttle tile surfaces. The seals were able to disengage and re-engage the edges of the rub surface tiles while being scrubbed over them. Arc jet tests were performed to experimentally determine anticipated seal temperatures for representative flow boundary conditions (pressures and temperatures) under simulated vehicle re-entry conditions. Installation of a single seat in the gap of the test fixture caused a large temperature drop (1710 F) across the seal location as compared to an open gap condition (140 F) confirming the need for seals in the rudder/fin gap location. The seal acted as an effective thermal barrier limiting heat convection through the seal gap and minimizing temperature increases downstream of the seal during maximum heating conditions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} robust and {{efficient}} method to design a <b>flap</b> <b>assembly</b> to be resistant to a full scale experimental bird strike in according to the airworthiness certifications. In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including wing track attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the roller carriages, which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty seats. The flap model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by wing, fan cowl and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage). Result overview allows the selection of the bird impact points based on links and composite failure criteria, in particular on the flap tracks metallic attachments, and lower skin and rear spar damage; Result of current work have allowed to establish robust criteria and to define most critical impact points need to be investigated by means of a strike test. Reducing number of shots a two location allow laboratories to perform test bus using of a unique test specimen saving time and cost. The conclusion of this activity is dedicated a comparison of test result performed and relevant analysis. For the two shots strain gauge and force reaction history acquisition will be compared...|$|E
