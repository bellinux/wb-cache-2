5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gate {{was created}} at the {{animation}} studio White Fox, and {{was produced by}} Mika Nomura and Yoshinao Doi, directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satō, and written by Jukki Hanada, with Kyuuta Sakai serving as character designer and chief animation director. While Takeshi Abo, the composer for the Science Adventure games, only had a small role in the previous anime adaptation of the series, he was appointed to compose for the Steins;Gate anime together with his coworker Jun Murakami. Abo composed new music, and made use of the same atmosphere and musical worldview as when he composed for the Steins;Gate game, but also had to consider that the music had to be synchronized with the motions of the anime; {{this was a very}} <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> working than the one he uses when composing for games.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a natural}} {{ordering}} on the ordinals, which is itself a well-ordering. Given any ordinal α, one can consider the set of all ordinals less than α. This set {{turns out to have}} ordinal number α. This observation is used for a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> introducing the ordinals, in which an ordinal is equated with the set of all smaller ordinals. This form of ordinal number is thus a canonical representative of the earlier form of equivalence class.|$|E
25|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{have also}} been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be {{described in terms of}} Alfvén waves.|$|E

25|$|The folk {{religious}} practices offer {{a very different}} aspect of life from the Buddhist practices. Burmese folk faith consists of {{many different kinds of}} festivals that all involve singing and dancing, drinking and merriment, or nat-pwes. These festivals are a way for people to let go, and enjoy themselves. This idea of relieving stress and indulging in various pleasures {{is very different from the}} traditional doctrine of Buddhism, which emphasises losing all desires. This can often be done by fasting or through deep meditation in a quiet temple. These traditional Buddhist practices offer a starkly <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> achieving religious consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Note that, in {{a minimal}} k-coloring of any graph G, {{contracting}} each color {{class of the}} coloring to a single vertex will produce a complete graph Kk. However, this contraction process does not produce a minor of G because there is (by definition) no edge between any two vertices in the same color class, thus the contraction is not an edge contraction (which is required for minors). Hadwiger's conjecture states that there exists a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> properly edge contracting sets of vertices to single vertices, producing a complete graph Kk, {{in such a way}} that all the contracted sets are connected.|$|E
25|$|Kugel {{reported}} that the Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein found no pig bones in hilltop sites starting in the Iron I period (roughly 1200–1000 BCE) and continuing through Iron II, while before that, in Bronze Age sites, pig bones abounded. Kugel deduced from Finkelstein’s data that the new hilltop residents were fundamentally different from both their predecessors in the highlands and the city Canaanites — either because they were a different ethnic group, or because they had adopted a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life, for ideological or other reasons. Kugel inferred from Finkelstein’s findings that these highlanders shared some ideology (if only a food taboo), like modern-day Jews and Muslims.|$|E

25|$|The {{experiment}} {{created a}} form of neutrinos, muon neutrinos, at CERN's older SPS accelerator, on the Franco–Swiss border, and detected them at the LNGS lab in Gran Sasso, Italy. OPERA researchers used common-view GPS, derived from standard GPS, to measure the times and place coordinates at which the neutrinos were created and detected. As computed, the neutrinos' average time of flight {{turned out to be}} less than what light would need to travel the same distance in a vacuum. In a two-week span up to , the OPERA team repeated the measurement with a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> generating neutrinos, which helped measure travel time of each detected neutrino separately. This eliminated some possible errors related to matching detected neutrinos to their creation time.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, the {{government}} established the Red Cloud Agency on the Platte River, downstream from Fort Laramie. As {{outlined in the}} 1868 Treaty, the agency staff were responsible for issuing weekly rations to the Oglala, {{as well as providing}} the annually distributed supply of cash and annuity goods. The agent and Washington officials would determine how much of the annuity was to be paid in cash or goods, and sometimes the supplies were late, in poor condition, inadequate in amount, or never arrived at all. Red Cloud took his band to the agency (a predecessor of the Native American reservation) and tried to help them in the transition to a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life. In the fall of 1873, the agency was removed to the upper White River in northwestern Nebraska.|$|E

While he {{considered}} their previous record heartfelt, he felt a more instinctual feeling to speak for the time period in which the album was released. He had felt the desire to increase the amount of political content in his lyricism as he grew into adulthood, noting that the [...] "climate" [...] surrounding his aging produced feelings of responsibility in the songs he wrote. Armstrong said, [...] "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge song structure ... it opens up your mind to this <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> writing, where there really are no rules." [...] In addition to the album's political content, it also touches on interpersonal relationships and what Dirnt labeled [...] "confusion and loss of individuality." ...|$|E

500|$|Power (1938) {{is written}} with a mind toward the {{political}} ills that marred the headlines of the day. The work {{appeared at the}} brink of World War II, and contains more than one pointed reference to the dictatorships of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, and one reference to the persecution of German Czechoslovakians. (Russell 1938:147) When his remarks treat of current affairs, they are often pessimistic. [...] "Although men hate one another, exploit one another, and torture one another, they have, until recently, given their reverence to those who preached a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life." [...] (Russell 1938: 204; emphasis added) As Kirk Willis remarked on Russell's outlook during the 1930s, [...] "the foreign and domestic policies of successive national governments repelled him, as did the triumph of totalitarian regimes on the continent and the seemingly inexorable march to war brought in their wake... Despairing that war could be avoided and convinced that such a European-wide conflict would herald a new dark age of barbarism and bigotry, Russell gave voice to his despondency in Which Way to Peace? (1936) – {{not so much a}} reasoned defence of appeasement as an expression of defeatism". (Russell 1938:xxii-xxiii) ...|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a <b>different</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E
