50|$|In Europe {{there is}} {{considerable}} concern over the funds necessary to finance final decommissioning.

50|$|Decommissioning {{options for}} a retired nuclear plant may be chosen based on {{availability}} of <b>decommissioning</b> <b>funds,</b> operation of other reactors {{at the same}} site, or availability of waste disposal facilities.

50|$|Much of {{the concern}} using nuclear {{entombment}} is the worry of nuclear leakage. Nuclear leakage occurs {{when there is}} a slight crack in the cementitious material or the clay for any radiation to seep through. Entombment does not solve the problem for every type of isotope of waste. Many different types of nuclides outlive the lifetime of the materials containing it by a thousand years or more. There are some disagreements among state governments on nuclear entombment, as it does not uphold the polluter pays principle. It is often not possible to make an exact estimate of total decommissioning costs, leaving a certain financial liability for a future generation. It is also difficult to guarantee that the necessary expertise for final decommissioning will be available in due time, or that the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>fund</b> has earned sufficient interest. The main concern for many of the infrastructures being used to entomb the waste, is that the facilities being used to entomb the radioactive waste were built for operations and not for disposal and burial of the waste. Some of the facilities may be too small for nuclear waste to be entombed because of the financial aspect going into all the materials needed to build safe housing for the hazardous material. The only other option {{in the case of the}} facility being too small is for the nuclear waste to be transferred to another disposing facility or the facility will have to be reinforced. Many U.S. state governments chose to steer clear of entombment because of its potential hazards of not being properly contained. If any of the nuclear waste were to come in contact with any water source, it has the potential to spread through rivers and lakes into highly populated cities to radioactively contaminate it and anyone who drinks from it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} trends over 1997 - 2001 in my {{baseline}} simulation {{analysis of the}} sufficiency of electric utilities' <b>funds</b> to eventually <b>decommission</b> the nation's nuclear power plants. Further, for 2001, I describe the utilities' funding adequacy results obtained using scenario and sensitivity analyses, respectively. In this paper, I {{focus more on the}} wide variability observed in these adequacy measures among utilities than on the results for the ''average'' utility in the nuclear industry. Only individual utilities, not average utilities [...] often used by the nuclear industry to represent its funding adequacy [...] will decommission their nuclear plants. Industry-wide results tend to mask the varied results for individual utilities. This paper shows that over 1997 - 2001, the variability of my baseline <b>decommissioning</b> <b>funding</b> adequacy measures (in percentages) for both utility fund balances and current contributions has remained very large, reflected in the sizable ranges and frequency distributions of these percentages. The relevance of this variability for nuclear <b>decommissioning</b> <b>funding</b> adequacy is, of course, focused more on those utilities that show below ideal balances and contribution levels. Looking backward, 42 of 67 utility fund (available) balances, in 2001, were above (and 25 below) their ideal baseline levels; in 1997, 42 of 76 were above (and 34 below) ideal levels. Of these, many utility balances were far above, and many far below, such ideal levels. The problem of certain utilities continuing to show balances much below ideal persists even with increases in the adequacy of ''average'' utility balances...|$|R
