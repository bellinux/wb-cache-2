25|$|But Bashir himself rarely {{spent his}} time in Baghdad and finally left the country after the First Gulf War in 1991. Guest {{performances}} mainly in Europe offered <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> open-minded audience, and therefore an excellent platform for the presentation of his meanwhile very original and mature style of improvisation and composition. Most of his records were also recorded in Europe. In his last years he aimed at making his son Omar his musical successor. A duo-recording of Bashir and Omar made in February 1994 {{is considered to be}} a classic of Bashir's Œuvre, because of its exemplary combination of traditional – mainly folk – material mixed with improvisation.|$|E

[...] The director David Ayliff, son of Richardson's and Olivier's mentor, said, [...] "Ralph was a natural actor, he couldn't stop being a perfect actor; Olivier did it through sheer hard work and determination." [...] Comparing the two, Hobson said that Olivier always made the audience feel inferior, and Richardson always made them feel superior. The actor Edward Hardwicke agreed, saying that audiences were in awe of Olivier, [...] "whereas Ralph would always make you feel sympathy... you wanted to give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hug. But they were both giants." ...|$|E

500|$|On 18 February 1975, de Lucía {{became the}} first-ever flamenco {{performer}} {{to perform at}} the Teatro Real of Madrid. He played a set with his brother Ramón, {{in front of a}} relatively young audience without the use of effects. Pohren said that de Lucía's performance [...] "was brilliant technically, and played a meaningful, moving, traditional brand of flamenco that did not betray what Paco had in store for the flamenco guitar in the future." [...] The recording was released as En vivo desde el Teatro Real. His 1976 album, Almoraima, was a wider success and featured Almoraima and Río Ancho. The album was named after a former convent of the same name located about [...] from Algeciras on the road to Jimena de la Frontera, which had recently been converted into a hotel complex. The album featured significant Arabic and jazz influences especially in the bulerías composition of the same name; the name Almoraima is of Arabic origin from the Moorish period. De Lucía performed on an episode of Parkinson on BBC in the UK, in which Michael Parkinson said [...] "a marvelous young musician who is making his very first appearance on British television.

Initially, he had doubts about his musical and creative abilities after achieving sobriety, but he gained confidence as the sessions progressed. Shannon later recalled: [...] "In Step was, for <b>him,</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> growing experience. In my opinion, it's our best studio album, and I think he felt that way, too." [...] Bramhall, who had also entered rehab, wrote songs with Vaughan about addiction and redemption. According to Vaughan, the album was titled In Step because [...] "I'm finally in step with life, in step with myself, in step with my music." [...] The album's liner notes include the quote [...] "Thank God the elevator's broken," [...] {{a reference to the}} twelve-step program proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).|$|E

After racing in third place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Pole Star and Kasthari.

2500|$|Jimmy Durante {{is known}} to most modern audiences as the {{character}} who narrated and sang the 1969 animated special Frosty the Snowman. He also performed the Ron Goodwin title song to the 1968 comedy-adventure Monte Carlo or Bust (titled Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies in the U.S.) sung over the film's animated opening credits. There are numerous Durante depictions and allusions in animation. Pumbaa does a brief Durante impression while singing [...] "Hakuna Matata" [...] in The Lion King. A character in M-G-M cartoons, a bulldog named Spike, whose puppy son was always getting caught by accident {{in the middle of}} Tom and Jerry's activities, referenced Durante with a raspy voice and an affectionate [...] "Dat's my boy!" [...] In another Tom and Jerry short, a starfish lands on Tom's head, giving <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> nose. He then proceeds with Durante's famous [...] "Ha-cha-cha-cha" [...] call. The 1943 Tex Avery cartoon [...] "What's Buzzin' Buzzard" [...] featured a vulture with a voice that sounded like Jimmy Durante. A Durante-like voice (originally by Doug Young) was also given to the father beagle, Doggie Daddy, in Hanna-Barbera's Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy cartoons, Doggie Daddy invariably addressing the junior beagle with a Durante-like [...] "Augie, my son, my son", and with frequent citations of, [...] "That's my boy who said that!"

2500|$|In 1992 Antonio Peña {{founded a}} new wrestling {{promotion}} called Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), signing Tapia {{to a contract}} early on. Peña {{came up with the}} idea to repackage Tapia as [...] "La Parka", a character who wore a full bodysuit and mask that resembled a skeleton like the ones used in Mexico's Day of the Dead ceremonies. The character was an almost instant success with the fans, the imagery combined with Tapia's charisma and flamboyant actions in the ring made <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> crowd favorite despite La Parka initially being a rudo character. One of his initial storyline feuds was with Lizmark, a feud that resulted in a match for the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship at AAA's inaugural Triplemania event, in which Lizmark successfully defended the title against La Parka. In August 1993 La Parka won his first championship when he defeated Lizmark for the WWA Light Heavyweight Championship on a WWA/AAA co-promoted show. The title reign lasted until October 23, 1993 when Lizmark won the title back. The feud between the two saw La Parka defeat Lizmark for the WWA title for a second time on June 20, 1994. La Parka was one of the wrestlers that worked the When Worlds Collide show, a joint AAA/World Championship Wrestling (WCW) pay-per-view where he teamed with Jerry Estrada and Blue Panther, losing to the team of The Pegasus Kid, 2 Cold Scorpio, and Tito Santana. On September 9, 1994 La Parka won the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship that he had been chasing for over a year when he defeated Lizmark for the title, finishing off the storyline between the two. La Parka held the title for 200 days losing it to Jerry Estrada. La Parka would wear the Mexican National Light Heavyweight championship two further times while working for AAA, in 1995 and in 1996 until he lost the belt to Pimpinela Escarlata on May 13, 1996. In 1995 he would make an appearance for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the United States, teaming with Psicosis, losing a tag team match against Konnan and Rey Misterio, Jr.|$|E
