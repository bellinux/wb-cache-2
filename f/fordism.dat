After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted <b>Fordism</b> and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

His Prison Notebooks are considered a highly original contribution to 20th century political theory. Gramsci drew insights from varying sources – not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Vilfredo Pareto, Georges Sorel and Benedetto Croce. The notebooks cover {{a wide range of}} topics, including Italian history and nationalism, the French Revolution, Fascism, <b>Fordism,</b> civil society, folklore, religion and high and popular culture.|$|E
25|$|Ford {{introduced}} {{methods for}} large-scale manufacturing {{of cars and}} large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known {{around the world as}} <b>Fordism.</b> Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.|$|E
25|$|Fascism {{emphasizes}} both palingenesis and modernism. In particular, fascism's nationalism {{has been}} identified as having a palingenetic character. Fascism promotes the regeneration of the nation and purging it of decadence. Fascism accepts forms of modernism that it deems promotes national regeneration while rejecting forms of modernism that are regarded as antithetical to national regeneration. Fascism aestheticized modern technology and its association with speed, power and violence. Fascism admired advances in the economy in the early 20th century, particularly <b>Fordism</b> and scientific management. Fascist modernism has been recognized as inspired or developed by various figures—such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Ernst Jünger, Gottfried Benn, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that <b>Fordism</b> derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding <b>Fordism</b> to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), <b>Fordism,</b> operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E

2500|$|In the Soviet Union, Taylorism was {{advocated}} by Aleksei Gastev and nauchnaia organizatsia truda (the movement {{for the scientific}} organisation of labor). It found support in both Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced <b>Fordism</b> and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five Year Plan and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly {{to the influence of}} Taylorism on Soviet thinking.

2500|$|The sociological view of postmodernity ascribes it to {{more rapid}} transportation, wider {{communication}} {{and the ability}} to abandon standardization of mass production, leading to a system which values a wider range of capital than previously and allows value to be stored in a greater variety of forms. Harvey argues that postmodernity is an escape from [...] "Fordism", a term coined by Antonio Gramsci to describe the mode of industrial regulation and accumulation which prevailed during the Keynesian era of economic policy in OECD countries from the early 1930s to the 1970s. <b>Fordism</b> for Harvey is associated with Keynesianism in that the first concerns methods of production and capital-labor relations while the latter concerns economic policy and regulation. Post-fordism is therefore one of the basic aspects of postmodernity from Harvey's point of view.|$|E
2500|$|Ford's image transfixed Europeans, {{especially}} the Germans, arousing the [...] "fear of some, the infatuation of others, and the fascination among all". Germans who discussed [...] "Fordism" [...] often {{believed that it}} represented something quintessentially American. They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service—an [...] "American thing" [...] that represented {{the culture of the}} United States. Both supporters and critics insisted that <b>Fordism</b> epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States. As one German explained, [...] "Automobiles have so completely changed the American's mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car. It is difficult to remember what life was like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation". For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} {{novel and}} memoir Buruieni de dragoste depicts Sanda Marinescu, a thinly disguised version of Marta Rădulescu; Revista Mea becomes Revista Revistelor, and [...] "Justus" [...] is Professor Barbu Marinescu, a Freemason. The journalist Trestieru, standing in for Crevedia, slowly discovered that Sanda's political prose {{is actually the}} work of her father, and also that the latter has commonplace political opinions, dictated by sociology, democracy, and <b>Fordism.</b> Reviewing the work in 1937, folklorist Iosif Bâtiu argued: [...] "The nationalist youth will easily recognize in the novel's characters, admirably contoured as they are, many pioneers of the nationalist movement, {{as well as its}} detractors, the latter viewed in all their spiritual emptiness." [...] This opinion was contrasted by that of Pagini Literare columnist Romulus Demetrescu, who suggested that Crevedia wrote a [...] "lampoon [...] against Marta Rădulescu 's family", [...] "doing away with all discretion and delicacy". He found especially [...] "upsetting" [...] and indecent that Crevedia had disguised other known characters under transparent pseudonyms, suggesting that the author was suffering from megalomania.|$|E
2500|$|Himself {{sympathetic}} {{toward the}} Guard, Crevedia published {{his own account}} of the affair in the 1936 novel Buruieni de dragoste ("Love Weeds"), with himself as the protagonist Trestieru and Marta as Sanda Marinescu; Fluor is disguised as the agronomist Grâu Marinescu. This work cemented earlier allegations against Dan Rădulescu (including that he had penned his daughters' work), but added that he was ideologically unreliable. Appearing as Professor Barbu Marinescu, he is a democratic-minded, [...] "bookish" [...] Freemason, obsessed with sociology and <b>Fordism.</b> In love with Sanda, whom he believes to be his ideal [...] "intellectual woman", Trestieru is disappointed by her plagiarism and her overall mediocrity. Praised by nationalists as {{an attack on the}} [...] "spiritual emptiness" [...] of the Guard's [...] "detractors", or as a [...] "lifelike expression of today's Romanian bourgeoisie", Buruieni de dragoste was panned by reviewer Romulus Demetrescu. A former schoolteacher whose students had included Fluor Rădulescu, he described Crevedia's book as a megalomaniac's lampoon, [...] "doing away with all discretion and delicacy". Lovinescu sees Crevedia's book as accomplished, but [...] "embarrassing".|$|E
50|$|The {{period after}} <b>Fordism</b> has been termed Post-Fordist and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global {{capitalism}} {{has made a}} clean break from <b>Fordism,</b> including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French Après-Fordisme) to denote that what comes after <b>Fordism</b> was or is not clear.|$|E
5000|$|Later, {{under the}} {{inspiration}} of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the <b>Fordism</b> concept in the 1930s and developed Post-Fordism in the 1970s. Antonio and Bonanno (2000) trace the development of <b>Fordism</b> and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized America's role in globalization. [...] "Fordism," [...] for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that <b>Fordism</b> peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on {{the people in the}} 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Scholars {{view this}} {{recession}} more importantly as {{a representation of}} a larger structural shift from a <b>Fordism</b> economic production system underpinning many North American industries, toward one of Post-Fordism. [...] <b>Fordism</b> is a system of production methods based on principles of specialized mass production technologies, aimed at capturing economies of scale. [...] However, due to rising global competition, energy crises, stagflation and recession, <b>Fordism</b> began to unravel. [...] Consequently, {{a new system of}} economic production, characterized by greater flexibility and the exploitation of economies of scope, known as Post-Fordism, began to emerge.|$|E

50|$|Production methods {{based on}} <b>Fordism</b> {{are no longer}} the primary method of {{industrial}} production. There are three main driving forces behind the emergence of 'Post-Fordism.' They are the rising of new technologies, internationalization and the paradigm shift from <b>Fordism</b> to post-Fordism. Post <b>Fordism</b> is based on flexible production, rising incomes for polyvalent skilled workers and the service class and increased profits based on technological and other innovations. Also post-Fordism accumulation will be more oriented to world-wide demand, not so much on demand within a state. Post-Fordism is more demand than supply-driven. As a labour process, post-Fordism can be defined as a flexible production process based on flexible systems and an appropriately flexible workforce.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} OB {{practitioners}} documented their ideas about management and organisation. The best known theories today originate from Henri Fayol, Chester Barnard, and Mary Parker Follet. All {{three of them}} drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation. One of the first management consultants, Frederick Taylor, was a 19th century engineer who applied an approach known as the scientific management. Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method. The scientific method was further refined by Lillian and Frank Gilbreth, who utilized {{time and motion study}} to further improve worker efficiency. In the early 20th century the idea of <b>Fordism</b> emerged. Named after automobile mogul Henry Ford, the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that <b>Fordism</b> developed independently of Taylor. <b>Fordism</b> can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and <b>Fordism</b> resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fordism</b> is a tag used to characterise the post-1945 long boom {{experienced}} by western nations. It is typified by {{a cycle of}} mass production and mass consumption, the production of standardized (most often) consumer items to be sold in (typically) protected domestic markets, {{and the use of}} Keynesian economic policies. While the standard pattern is postwar America, national variations of this standard norm are well known. Regulation theory talks of National Modes of Growth to denote different varieties of <b>Fordism</b> across western economies.|$|E
50|$|Work is {{no longer}} creative, but alienating and mind-numbing {{as a result of}} a more and more {{distorted}} organization of work (taylorism, <b>fordism,</b> toyotism/lean management).|$|E

50|$|Economic {{dimensions}} of the Empire of Liberty involved dissemination of American management methods (such as Taylorization, <b>Fordism,</b> and the assembly line), technology, and popular culture such as film.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fordism</b> is [...] "the eponymous {{manufacturing}} {{system designed}} to spew out standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them." [...] It has also been described as [...] "a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor." [...] Although <b>Fordism</b> was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle {{could be applied to}} any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles: ...|$|E
5000|$|In Regulation theory, it is a [...] "regime of accumulation" [...] or a {{macroeconomic}} {{pattern of}} growth, {{developed in the}} US and diffused in various forms to Western Europe after 1945. It consisted of domestic mass production {{with a range of}} institutions and policies supporting mass consumption, including stabilizing economic policies and Keynesian demand management that generated national demand and social stability; it also included a class compromise or social contract entailing family-supporting wages, job stability and internal labor markets leading broadly shared prosperity: rising incomes were linked to national productivity from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. At the level of the labor process <b>Fordism</b> is Taylorist and as a national mode of regulation <b>Fordism</b> is Keynesianism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fordism</b> as an ROA broke down, {{dependent}} on national experiences, {{somewhere between the}} late 1960s and the mid-1970s. Western economies experienced slow or nil economic growth, rising inflation and growing unemployment, much {{of this as a}} result of the 1973 oil shock.|$|E
5000|$|Ford and {{his senior}} {{managers}} {{did not use}} the word [...] "Fordism" [...] themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an [...] "". However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name <b>Fordism</b> to it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fordism</b> {{describes}} modern {{economic and}} social systems based on industrialized, standardized mass production and mass consumption. The concept is named for Henry Ford. It is used in social, economic, and management theory about production, working conditions, consumption, and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantages}} {{of such a}} change was that it {{cut down on the}} manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production. There are four levels of <b>Fordism,</b> as described by Bob Jessop.|$|E
50|$|According to {{historian}} Charles S. Maier, <b>Fordism</b> proper was preceded in Europe by Taylorism, {{a technique}} of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly-scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the fin de siècle to World War I.|$|E
50|$|The main {{criticism}} of post-Fordism asserts that post-Fordism mistakes {{the nature of}} the Fordist revolution and that <b>Fordism</b> was not in crisis, but was simply evolving and will continue to evolve. Other critics believe that post-Fordism does exist, but coexists with <b>Fordism.</b> The automobile industry has combined Fordist and post-Fordist strategies, using both mass production and flexible specialization. Ford introduced flexibility into mass production, so that <b>Fordism</b> could continue to evolve. Those who advocate post-Fordism, however, note that criticism that focuses primarily on flexible specialization ignores post-Fordist changes in other areas of life and that flexible specialization cannot be looked at alone when examining post-Fordism. Another criticism is that post-Fordism relies too heavily on the examples of the Third Italy and Japan. Some believe that Japan is neither Fordist nor post-Fordist and that vertical disintegration and mass production go hand in hand. Others argue that the new, smaller firms in Italy didn’t develop autonomously, but are a product of the vertical disintegration of the large Fordist firms who contracted lower value-added work to smaller enterprises. Other criticisms argue that flexible specialization is not happening on any great scale, and smaller firms have always existed alongside mass production. Another main criticism is that we are too much in the midst to judge whether or not there really is a new system of production.|$|E
5000|$|Advances in {{technology}} {{and the end of}} the Cold War ushered in a new [...] "neoliberal" [...] phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of <b>Fordism,</b> such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America's pursuit of democracy to surface.|$|E
5000|$|Liberal {{corporatism}} was {{an influential}} {{component of the}} Progressivism in the United States that {{has been referred to}} as [...] "interest group liberalism". In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the New Deal economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in Keynesianism and even <b>Fordism.</b>|$|E
