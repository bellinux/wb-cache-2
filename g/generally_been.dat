5|$|After {{the death}} of Bede in 735, Latin prose in England declined. It reached its lowest level in the ninth century, when few books and {{charters}} were produced, and they were of poor quality. King Æthelstan's grandfather, Alfred the Great (871–899) embarked on an extensive programme to improve learning, and by the 890s the standard of Latin in charters was improving. Few charters survive from the reigns of Alfred and his son, Edward the Elder (899–924), and none from 909 to 925. Up to then charters had <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> plain legal documents, and King Æthelstan's early diplomas were similar.|$|E

5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits.

As women have <b>generally</b> <b>been</b> political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E
