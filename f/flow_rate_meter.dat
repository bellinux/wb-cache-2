The meter measures the flow rates at line pressures, which are typically {{orders of magnitude}} greater than atmospheric pressure, but the meter must report {{the oil and gas}} volumes at standard (atmospheric) pressure and temperature. The meter must thus know the Pressure / Volume / Temperature properties of the oil, to add to the measured gas rate at line pressure the additional gas that would be liberated from the oil at atmospheric pressure, and also know the loss in oil volume from the release of that gas in conversion to standard conditions. With co-mingled flow from oil zones with differing PVT response, and different water salinities and hence densities, this PVT uncertainty may be the largest source of error in the measurement.|$|E

The principle of the LDA <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>meter</b> applied for circular pipe is following. The center line velocity of pulsating pipe flow was measured by the LDA. The velocity distribution profile in the pipe cross section can be numerically estimated, and then the instantaneous flow rate was calculated by the integration of the profile. Firstly, it was applied and evaluated at the pulsating flow made by an artificial heat-lung system. The system has a double roller pump with a vinyl tube of Ω-shape. Secondly, an intermittent flow rate at high fuel pressure injection system was also measured. Swirl injector generated the oscillating pipe flow under high line pressure of 5 MPa at injection frequencies of 20 and 40 Hz. There was a little difficulty at the measurement of injection flow depending on the zero velocity shifting. Finally, a correction method of zero shifting was proposed and the applicability of the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>meter</b> was demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{definition}} of an accurate mathematical model of a production common-rail-type injector for automotive diesel engines. The mathematical model defined in a previous work was refined, accounting for {{a broader range of}} effects on injector performance, thus allowing a more strict validation of the model predictions against experimental data. The geometry of the control-valve holes, crucial in determining the actual discharge coefficient, was accurately evaluated by means of silicone molds. The moving mechanical components of the injector, such as control valve, needle, and pressure rod were modeled using the mass-spring-damper scheme. The axial deformation under pressure of needle, pressure rod, nozzle and injector body was modeled. This effect was found to also affect the control valve device operation, and was properly accounted for. The model obtained was implemented in Simulink; the ordinary differential equations were solved by means of the numerical differentiation formulas implicit scheme of second-order accuracy, while the partial differential equations were integrated using the finite-difference Lax-Friedrichs method. In order to obtain sufficient data for validating the model in its entire operation field, two separate sets of tests were carried out. In the first analysis, a constant reference pressure was imposed in the rail, and the injector energizing time was progressively increased from values relative to small pilot injections to values characteristic of large main injections. The injected volume per stroke was measured by means of a mean delivery meter (EMI) device. During the second set of tests, the injector was mounted on a <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> <b>meter</b> (EVI) device so as to measure the injection law. Electric current flowing through the injector solenoid, oil pressure in the common rail, and at the injector inlet, needle, and control valve lift were also gauged and recorded.

The nozzle hole discharge coefficient dependence upon time and needle lift was discussed, and the trends were presented in several working conditions. The flow in the control volume holes was studied, in order to determine whether cavitation occurs or not, giving an answer to a long disputed topic.

This review precipitated the conclusion that a number of techniques have been proposed, which may be applicable to the measurement under investigation. However, very little experimental verification of sensing systems based on these techniques had been undertaken. A test facility, suitable for such verification was therefore developed and an extensive programme of tests were carried out, of a sensing system based on an electrostatic technique.

SEM surface roughness analysis of a secondary test article indicated that the default average surface roughness for steel in ANSYS FLUENT was reasonable. In addition, the methodology could be further applied to future duty life studies for the cavitating venturi flow meter. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{consolidated}} porous medim as a gas-metering {{device and}} for determination of gas viscosity has been investigated over a moderate range of temperature and pressure. With normal laboratory techniques it appears possible to calibrate large porous Alundum fil-tering thimbles to meter gas with a probable error of 0. 1 to 0. 2 per-cent. The geometry of such elements permits an appreciable range ofA gas <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> to be <b>metered</b> with small, accurately controlled, pres-sure drops. The advantages of such a device warrant its use as a. laboratory instrument. Results of the flow tests have been employed in {{the determination of the}} viscosity of air up to approximately 900 pounds per square inch absolute at the two test temperatures of 75 ° and 5170 F. These data appear to check sufficiently well with other published viscosity data to justify the use of this method as a recommended procedure...|$|R
