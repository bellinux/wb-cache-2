Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> state of Ohio the following day.|$|E
