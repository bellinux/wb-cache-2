40|$|Abstract Background Patients with {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) and {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) constitute to be a high-risk population {{for the development of}} contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), in which the incidence of CIN is estimated to be as high as 50 %. We performed this trial to assess the efficacy of N -acetylcysteine (NAC) in the prevention of this complication. Methods In a prospective, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial, we studied 90 patients undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography with DM and CKD (serum creatinine ≥ 1. 5 mg/dL for men and ≥ 1. 4 mg/dL for women). The patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral NAC (600 mg BID, starting 24 h before the procedure) or placebo, in adjunct to <b>hydration.</b> <b>Serum</b> creatinine was measured prior to and 48 h after coronary angiography. The primary end-point was the occurrence of CIN, defined as an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0. 5 mg/dL (44. 2 μmol/L) or ≥ 25 % above baseline at 48 h after exposure to contrast medium. Results Complete data on the outcomes were available on 87 patients, 45 of whom had received NAC. There {{were no significant differences between}} the NAC and placebo groups in baseline characteristics, amount of hydration, or type and volume of contrast used, except in gender (male/female, 20 / 25 and 34 / 11, respectively; P = 0. 005) and the use of statins (62. 2 % and 37. 8 %, respectively; P = 0. 034). CIN occurred in 5 out of 45 (11. 1 %) patients in the NAC group and 6 out of 42 (14. 3 %) patients in the placebo group (P = 0. 656).

40|$|BackgroundRadiocontrast {{nephropathy}} {{is associated}} with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with percutaneous coronary interventions. A number of agents that improve renal circulation have been clinically tested for prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy, {{but none of them}} has succeeded. Protection of renal tubular cells against oxidative stress is another approach to avoid radiocontrast nephropathy. Prophylactic effects of antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine have been reported by several investigators, although the effectiveness of these compounds is still a matter of debate. Ascorbic acid, an antioxidant agent, a safe and not expensive medication, could be used to prevent radiocontrast nephropathy. MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ascorbic acid in 202 patients who underwent coronary angiography and/or intervention. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral Vitamin C (3 g at least 2 hours before the procedure and 2 g in the night and the morning after the procedure) or placebo, in adjunct to <b>hydration.</b> <b>Serum</b> creatinine was measured prior to and 48 h after coronary angiography. The primary end-point was the occurrence of CIN, defined as an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0. 5 mg/dL (44. 2 μmol/L) or ≥ 25 % above baseline at 48 h after exposure to contrast medium.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine whether acetylcysteine could provide a protective effect on renal function in a population of patients with normal renal function or mild to moderate chronic renal failure, usually referred for a coronary procedure. BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy is a well-recognized complication of coronary angiography. Recent studies suggest that saline hydration and acetylcysteine reduce the incidence of contrast-induced worsening of renal function in patients with pre-existing chronic renal failure who are undergoing computed tomography examinations. METHODS: One hundred eight patients were blindly and randomly assigned to receive either acetylcysteine or placebo before and after administration of contrast agent in association with a moderate <b>hydration</b> protocol. <b>Serum</b> creatinine and urea nitrogen were measured before and 24 hours after coronary procedure. RESULTS: The mean serum creatinine concentration remained unchanged 24 hours after contrast agent administration in both groups: from 1. 04 +/- 0. 26 to 1. 03 +/- 0. 29 mg/dl in the acetylcysteine group and from 1. 16 +/- 1. 1 to 1. 06 +/- 0. 41 mg/dl in the control group (p = 0. 29, for the comparison between two groups, NS). We divided the population into 3 subgroups according to their creatinine clearance: no significant change of serum creatinine concentration was observed in patients with normal renal function nor in patients with pre-existing mild to moderate chronic renal failure in both groups. There was no significant difference for the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy between both groups (2 of the 53 patients in the acetylcysteine group and 3 of the 51 patients in the placebo group, p = 0. 98, NS). CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the systematic use of acetylcysteine before a coronary procedure in patients with normal renal function or mild to moderate chronic renal failure, to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|At {{physiological}} pH, {{negatively charged}} glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix may influence distribution volume of macromolecular probes, {{a phenomenon of}} importance for hydration of the interstitium and therefore for body fluid balance. We hypothesized that such charge effect was dependent on <b>hydration.</b> Human <b>serum</b> albumin (HSA) (the pH value for the isoelectric point (pI) = 4. 9) was made neutral by cationization (cHSA) (pI = 7. 6). Rat dermis was studied in vitro in a specially designed equilibration cell allowing control of hydration. Using a buffer containing labelled native HSA and cHSA, the distribution volumes were calculated relative to that of 51 Cr-EDTA, an extracellular tracer. During changes in hydration (H), defined as (wet weight – dry weight) (dry weight) − 1), {{the slope of the}} equation describing the relationship between extracellular fluid volume (V x) (in g H 2 O (g dry weight) − 1) and H (V x = 0. 925 H + 0. 105) differed significantly from that for available volumes of cHSA (V a,cHSA = 0. 624 H – 0. 538) and HSA (V a,HSA = 0. 518 H – 0. 518). A gradual reduction in H led to a reduction in difference between available volumes for the two albumin species. Screening the fixed charges by 1 M NaCl resulted in similar available and excluded volumes of native HSA and neutral cHSA. We conclude that during gradual dehydration, there is a reduced effect of fixed negative charges on interstitial exclusion of charged macromolecules. This effect may be explained by a reduced hydration domain surrounding tissue and probe macromolecules in conditions of increased electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, screening of negative charges suggested that hyaluronan associated with collagen may influence intrafibrillar volume of collagen and thereby available and excluded volume fraction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to test a rapid protocol of intravenous acetylcysteine for prevention of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN). BackgroundOral acetylcysteine (NAC) may provide better prophylaxis against RCIN than intravenous (IV) hydration alone. Current protocols preclude prophylaxis of same-day or emergency patients owing to the need for prolonged pretreatment. MethodsWe prospectively randomized 80 patients with stable renal dysfunction undergoing cardiac catheterization/intervention to a rapid protocol of IV NAC (150 mg/kg in 500 ml N/saline over 30 min immediately before contrast followed by 50 mg/kg in 500 ml N/saline over 4 h, n = 41, 67 ± 10 years, 90 % men) or IV hydration (1 ml/kg/h N/saline for 12 h pre- and post-contrast, n = 39, 71 ± 8. 8 years, 85 % men). ResultsRadiocontrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 2 of the 41 patients in the NAC group (5 %) and in 8 of the 39 patients in the hydration group (21 %; p = 0. 045; relative risk: 0. 28; 95 % confidence interval 0. 08 to 0. 98). In the NAC group, mean serum creatinine fellfrom 1. 85 ± 0. 59 to 1. 77 ± 0. 73 and 1. 79 ± 0. 73 mg/dl 48 h and four days post-contrast (p = 0. 02 and 0. 023 vs. baseline, respectively). In the <b>hydration</b> group, <b>serum</b> creatinine increased from 1. 75 ± 0. 41 to 1. 81 ± 0. 6 48 h and 1. 80 ± 0. 50 mg/dl four days post-contrast (p = 0. 99 and 0. 23, respectively). NAC infusion was ceased after the bolus in three patients (7 %) due to flushing, itching, or a transient rash. ConclusionsAdministration of IV NAC should be considered in all patients at risk of RCIN before contrast exposure when time constraints preclude adequate oral prophylaxis, provided the patient is able to tolerate this degree of volume loading...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: To prevent {{contrast}} induced renal dysfunction a periprocedural prophylactic hydration is applied. Due to dilution {{it should}} cause {{a drop in}} serum creatinine concentration (SCR). Surprisingly, no reduction in SCR after contrast admission is found in up to 25 % of patients as early as 12 - 18 hours after coronary angiography/angioplasty. This study aims to find a clinical explanation as well as predict circumstances for this phenomenon. Methods: Retrospective clinical and laboratory data was used from 341 patients who underwent elective coronary angiography/angioplasty, received a prophylactic <b>hydration,</b> and had <b>serum</b> creatinine concentration measured prior to, and 12 - 18 hours after invasive procedure with iodine contrast administration. To exclude an improper hydration due to no creatinine decrease, the number of red blood cells was analysed as well as hemoglobin and hematocrit in blood donations collected during the study time points. Results: The resulting lack of serum creatinine reduction {{could be explained by}} dehydration (measured by increase in number of RBC, HGB and HCT) only in 13. 5 %, 10. 8 %, and 20 % of cases, respectively. Any form of abnormal glucose metabolism combined with either baseline serum creatinine concentration 86. 77 mL/min, or GFR by CKD EPI > 80. 08 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, or GFR by MDRD > 74. 48 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 were the predictors for no creatinine decrease at outcome. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the lack of creatinine decrease was more often observed among those patients whose initial renal function was better than in the subjects with reduction of SCR.
