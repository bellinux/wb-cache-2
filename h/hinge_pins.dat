50|$|Coiled pins {{are used}} {{extensively}} in cosmetic cases, automotive door handles and locks, and latches as <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> They {{are also used}} as pivots and axles, for alignment and stopping, to fasten multiple components together—such as a gear and shaft—and even as ejector pins to remove motherboards from PCs. The automotive and electrical industries use coiled pins in such products as steering boxes and columns, pumps, electric motors and circuit breakers.|$|E
40|$|A hinge (20) {{includes}} two hinge plates (22, 24) and a connecting <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32). A coil spring (48) supported on a bushing (44) overlies the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32), which {{is free to}} move along its longitudinal axis (30). A cam follower (42) on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) engages a cam (32) mounted {{to one of the}} hinge plates (22), so that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) slides longitudinally as the hinge plates (22, 24) pivot relative to each other about the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32). As the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> (32) slides longitudinally, it axially compresses or decompresses the spring (48). The cam (32) is oriented such that pivoting of the hinge plates (22, 24) in either direction from an open position compresses the spring (48), providing a restoring force which tends to retain the hinge plates (22, 24) in the open position...|$|R

50|$|A {{substantial}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{joins the}} {{two parts of the}} rifle or shotgun; the stock with its firing mechanism and the fore-piece and barrel, which hold the round to be fired. In some cases the <b>hinging</b> <b>pin</b> may be easily removable, allowing the two portions of the weapon to be compactly and safely stored. In other cases the hinge will consist of a hook over a pin; releasing an auxiliary latch will allow sufficient travel to allow the hinge to be unhooked.|$|R

Milazzo (M.Milazzo P.Sardella analisi XRF quantitativa nelle applicazioni archeometriche), The XRF {{analysis performed on}} the metal of the crown revealed that all the foils, rosettes and bezels were made with the same alloy, made of 84 - 85% gold, 5 - 7% silver, and 8 - 10% copper, suggesting a contemporary construction of {{the main part of}} the crown, while the fillets external to the enamel plates and the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> were made of 90 - 91% gold and 9 - 10% silver, suggesting one or more subsequent reworking.|$|E
50|$|Traditional working {{dinghies}} have a lee {{board that}} can be hooked over the side. This does not split the cargo space. A sailing rudder is usually tied or clipped to a simple pair of pintles (<b>hinge</b> <b>pins)</b> on the transom with the bottom pintle being longer so that the rudder can be mounted one pintle at a time. The rope keeps the rudder from floating off in a wave. Both rudders and lee boards have swiveling tips so the dinghy can be landed. Rudders are often arranged so the tiller folds against the rudder to make a compact package.|$|E
50|$|In 2002 {{the studio}} gained two new {{partners}} Pride Hutchison and Michael Dumas. The studio was then {{brought back to}} business under its original name Radio Recorders, and they {{enlisted the help of}} longtime friends Jordan Winsen and Steve Loiacano as their staff second engineers. Tom O'Brien, who was working for Schwartz, was kept on as chief engineer. In 2004 the property was declared a historic attraction but never achieved official landmark status by the city of Los Angeles. From 2002 to 2008 the studio welcomed many great projects and clients including Natalie Cole, Dwight Yoakum, Lucinda Williams, Lil' John, Exzihbit, Annie Lennox and many more... The facility closed again in 2008 a midst a fraud dispute between Hutchison, Dumas and Shwartz, Silent owners seeking to save the building and real estate property flipper David Bennet. In the end the building was sold in bankruptcy court. Shwartz was left broke, betrayed and feeling blindly used. With lack of capital to fight and overturn the courts decision, the silent owners were left with no moves and the legendary Radio Recorders building was gutted and demolished from the inside. The story as it goes from the inside supposedly is :Schwartz had a partner before Dumas and Hutchison who died and with him likely many of the studios strongest contracts.Under Schwartz mismanagement the studio struggled and subsequently defaulted on all financial obligations. Hutchinson and Dumas than found Schwartz in a vulnerable position and for a total sum if 50-60k each (100k) Schwartz agreed to partner with them. It is unclear whether they were ever added to the deed or if this money ever went to debts. Its also rumored that during the period of their partnership many raves were held in soundstage studio E(dubbed so for Elvis) and rampant drug abuse took place and continued among the partners. It is known that methamphetamine was found in the cupboards of the studio kitchen shortly after Schwartz and that his behavior was often erratic. What than takes place is a battle for property rights among all involved both the silent partner and David Bennet claiming they paid Schwartz a sum of money for his rights.One side is that a late night meeting took place with notary a menial fee was given to Schwartz and he gave his rights. The other side is David Bennet provided compensation to both Dumas and Hutchison in excess of 50k each for their investment as well as 100k to Schwartz in return for all of their rights. The problem for Bennet being a flipper was that currently each studio was occupied by a tenant and this other silent partner was laying claim. He proceeded to systematically attempt to forge alliances under the false premises that all who helped would bennifit either from the sale / that he wouldn't sell the building and had no intention of gutting it but rather would maintain it as a studio/That he would sell the property atca fair price to a tenant if they helped him and could raise the capital in a small window.. Supposedly this stipulation was met and Bennet than backed out on his agreement. Hutchison and Dumas were the first to go followed by others. All gear by this point including the piano axel rose recorded November rain with was liquidated and only one studio operated in the building. When Bennet backed out of his deal (or perhaps the money was never actually raised) the fight for ownership intensified. Reportedly glass doors were shatterd having had the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins</b> pulled from them and orange Xs were spray painted on other wooden doors of vacant rooms when no one was around. While the silent partner and tenant had teamed up. The results were the same radio recorders studios shut its doors September 2009. Sleepy Brown of Organized Noise would be the last artist to produce a record in the building. Despite Bennett's best assurances the studios would all be gutted turned into accounting offices sadly only to become owned by a studio company againv. Schwartz sadly would take his own life.Today the space is used for art exhibits.|$|E
50|$|Other {{changes were}} implemented, some during the war, {{but not all}} M1917s {{received}} these updates. Beginning in 1938, the pivot in the top cover was replaced with a new one that would become standard on all M1919 series guns. While the World War I pattern top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{appears to have been}} retained on most converted M1917s, the later production M1917A1s had a positive locking top cover <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> that allowed the top cover to remain open lessening the chance of it dropping closed on one's hands while working on the gun—this became the standard on all M1919 series guns.|$|R
30|$|The {{assessment}} {{was based on}} crack initiation only and hence complete dislocation was not investigated here. But as the wall thickness from the drilled hole to the outer surface of the bone is small, {{it can be concluded}} by simple engineering reasoning that complete rupture of the opposite cortex follows soon after crack initiation. These data suggest that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> offers no relevant benefit for the treatment of malalignment since the need for correction in patients with varus alignment is frequently above 8 ° of correction. It is well documented that the risk of revarisation {{in the presence of the}} opposite cortex fracture increases with every degree of valgus correction (Pape et al. 2004 a, 2004 b). Obviously, the current study suggests that the cortex-preserving <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> effect is absent in larger corrections exceeding 5 °. This observation is confirmed in an experimental study by Reyle et al. (2017), which used human cadaver tibial bone, artificial Synbones and Sawbones to investigate the fracture of the lateral hinge in an open-wedge HTO with and without a <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Contender is how the barrel is {{attached}} to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber or length can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for this change.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} {{in question is}} an existing personnel access platform located in the D-Zero Assembly Building. This platform is used to access the preamplifiers located on the central calorimeter. The platform {{will need to be}} shortened to a 'fold-out' length of 36 in. due to some modifications recently made to the detector. The purpose of this note is to determine whether this modification affects the safety and the rated load of the platform. Three of the load carrying members were analyzed; the gusset supports, the hinge supports, and the <b>hinge</b> <b>pins.</b> The long and short beams which make up the platform's flooring were not analyzed. The long beams will not be affected by this modification because there is no change in the length of their moment arms. The short beams will be affected, but will see a smaller bending stress because of the decrease in the length of their moment arms. Any weld results previously found will also not be affected...|$|E
50|$|The core, foot {{deck and}} {{peduncle}} are constructed of anodized CNC machined aluminum. The flukes are {{a composite of}} rubber compression molded around an aluminum core frame. The <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is 316 stainless steel with a delrin bearing.|$|R
30|$|The {{current study}} {{suggests}} that the drill hole (<b>hinge</b> <b>pin)</b> {{at the end of}} the horizontal osteotomy reduces the stresses in the contralateral cortex and hence increases the critical opening angle prior to cracking of the opposite cortex in specimen with small correction angles. But the difference from having a drill hole or not is not so significant, especially for older patients. The ductility of the cortical bone is the decisive parameter for the calculated critical opening angle. Transferred to clinical practice, these data suggest that the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is an asset, but not the decisive parameter, and it cannot avoid cracking and rupture of the opposite cortex in cases of larger correction angles.|$|R
50|$|The Contender, first {{introduced}} in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle {{with a number}} of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is exposed; by pushing this <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.|$|R

40|$|During {{the time}} frame {{allocated}} by the delivery order, members of the UAH Applied Research Program, {{with the cooperation of}} representatives from NASA investigated and conducted stress analysis of the SEDSAT 1 satellite. The main area of concern was with the design of the deployable 10 m antennas. The placement of the holes for the antenna door <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> was too close {{to the edge of the}} antenna canister. Because of the load placed on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> the stress analysis of this area suggested that more space would be needed between the holes and the edge of the material. Due to other conflicts, SEDSATI was removed from flying on the space shuttle and moved to the Delta Launch Vehicle. This changed many of the design requirements for the mounting and deployment of the satellite that forced a new design for the satellite. Once this happened, the stress analysis became obsolete, and the task was concluded...|$|R

50|$|The {{receiver}} on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is {{the portion}} of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron sights, barrels with telescopic sights, and even the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin,</b> are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.|$|R
50|$|In door hinges, {{bearings}} sit {{between the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> and housing to ensure smooth {{movement of the}} door when it is opened and closed by passengers. Composite bearings are used {{in a number of}} automotive hinge systems due to their durability under high loads and corrosion resistance. Bearings also play a role in obtaining a quality paint finish on the car. Composite bearings’ PTFE compound liners are conductive and can transfer electricity to the hinges to facilitate the electrostatic painting process.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt guide rod assembly guides the bolt in the receiver, retains the recoil springs and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding {{the upper and lower}} receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|R

30|$|Obviously, the {{capacity}} for maintaining bony stability {{in the presence of}} (multiple) cortex fissures can vary significantly among patients and bone stability does not allow an “all-or-nothing principle”. Nevertheless, the data of the present study indicate that a correctly placed <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> {{at the end of the}} horizontal and ascending tibial osteotomy does not prevent opposite cortex fracture in larger corrections. The data suggest that bone ductility is an important factor for the crack initiation and hence integrity of opposite cortex, especially for higher corrections.|$|R

50|$|A hinge is a {{component}} that attaches one {{edge of a}} door to the frame, while allowing the other edge to swing from it. It usually consists {{of a pair of}} plates, each with a set of open cylindrical rings (the knuckles) attached to them. The knuckles of the two plates are offset from each other and mesh together. A <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> is then placed through the two sets of knuckles and usually fixed, to combine the plates and make the hinge a single unit. One door usually has about three hinges, but it can vary.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{used in the}} Peabody rifle, it {{saw more}} {{widespread}} use in the Martini-Henry and the subsequent Martini-Enfield. It employs a breechblock with a rear hinged falling block design, in which the breech is opened by permitting {{the front of the}} breechblock to drop down while pivoting on its hinge. Firing force is transmitted through the knuckle of the hinge and does not act directly on the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b> The breechblock design as has been called a falling or tilting block but in omitting the role of the hinge can lead to ambiguities. It is also used in the Krag-Petersson rifle.|$|R

50|$|The Pedersen rifle {{operated}} on the hesitation blowback principle: energy released by firing a cartridge immediately caused the breech to start moving rearward, but mechanical leverage {{built into the}} mechanism caused the actual opening of the breech to be delayed long enough so that pressure within the barrel would fall to a safe level. This was achieved with a bearing surface machined onto {{the front end of}} the crank. As the case head pressed on the breech block head and forced it to move rearward (as guided by contact surfaces in the receiver), pressure was exerted on the body, which in turn exerted pressure on the crank. The crank had contact surfaces on its rear end which would transmit pressure to corresponding surfaces in the rear of the receiver, thus relieving the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> of excessive stress. As the rear surface of the body continued to exert pressure on the bearing surface on the front of the crank, the leverage exerted would cause the crank to move about 95 degrees upward from the horizontal on the fulcrum formed by it being attached to the rear of the receiver by the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin.</b> The breech block mechanism thus operated in a manner resembling the operation of the Luger pistol, but unlike that pistol the Pedersen mechanism was at no time mechanically locked. The operating principle was the same as that used in the Model 07/12 Schwarzlose machine gun used by Austria-Hungary during the First World War.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} regularities of {{the influence}} of forces of viscous resistance generated by the damper device in the cylindrical hinges of the nodes connect the links of the crane-manipulator units mobile transport-technological ma-chines. The specified effect is considered on the efficiency of the damping of oscillations of the metal in the process of operation, due to the presence of increased clearances due to wear of the holes of the hinge eyes. It is shown that the force of viscous resistance should be considered in addition to the generated damping devices forces of elastic resis-tance, as the latter determine the effectiveness of damping in general. The main role of forces of viscous resistance is the dissipation of energy of an oscillatory turning movement of the mating parts of the metal structures due to oscilla-tory displacement of the <b>hinge</b> <b>pin</b> within the <b>hinge</b> gap until the complete decay of oscillations.
