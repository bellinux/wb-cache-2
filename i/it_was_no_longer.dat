5|$|The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God is not {{the first}} church {{building}} to occupy the position on top of the Tsarevets hill.

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a net exporter of silk.|$|E
5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket salient. The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> possible.|$|E

HP and Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E

Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> so lucrative.

5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, and she could not be repaired as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> possible for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Delfina was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that affected southeastern Africa in January 2003. The fourth named storm of the 2002–03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Delfina formed off the northwest coast of Madagascar on December30, 2002. It quickly intensified while moving westward, becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December31. Delfina weakened while moving inland, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January1, 2003. However, its remnants {{moved across the}} country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina were last observed on January9.|$|E

The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
