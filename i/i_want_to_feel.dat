25|$|In early 2013, Ringwald {{released}} Except Sometimes, a jazz record. It {{follows a}} tradition in jazz for the Ringwald family set by her father. “I {{grew up in a}} home filled with music and had an early appreciation of jazz since my dad was a jazz musician. Beginning at around age three I started singing with his band and jazz music has continued to be one of my three passions along with acting and writing. I like to say jazz music is my musical equivalent of comfort food. It's always where I go back to when <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> grounded,” Ringwald said in a statement.|$|E
500|$|Orci and Kurtzman read {{graduate}} school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They also noted that, {{in the creation}} of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in pacing. [...] "I want to feel the space, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> speed and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> all the things that can become a little bit lost when Star Trek becomes very stately" [...] said Orci. Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences, while Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how [...] "Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey." [...] Spock and Uhura were put in an actual relationship as a nod to early episodes highlighting her interest in him. Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were [...] "patsies" [...] included to make Kirk look greater by comparison.|$|E

I made a lot of political statements. But now, I feel that I just want to have fun; I want to dance; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> buoyant. And I want to give other people the same feeling. There's a lot of madness in the world around us, and I want people to be happy." ...|$|E

It's this feeling that I have of just <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> run as fast as I possibly can and just move. I wasn't going to just record something and release shit for the sake of having a song out, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> something when <b>I</b> heard it, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like <b>I</b> did when I first started, like when I used to sing in my bedroom when I was 15." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I like everybody. It's just that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E
500|$|Between verses, {{the rhythm}} is punctuated by samples of former glamour model Samantha Fox ("Touch me, touch me, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> your body"), {{as well as}} a sample [...] "Ancients of Mu Mu" [...] (by The JAMs' {{associate}} rapper Chike) which recurred throughout the next ten years' work of Drummond and Cauty. [...] Also heard is a rendition by children of [...] "Ring a Ring o' Roses", rhythmic panting, and an original female vocal line concerning infant mortality. Sounds magazine stated that the deliberate placement of Fox's sexually provocative [...] "Touch Me" [...] alongside [...] "Ring a Ring O'Roses" [...] ("the nursery rhyme about the Plague") [...] "highlights explicitly the depth of contradiction embedded in society's attitude towards death through sex". More succinctly, NME said: [...] "'All You Need...' is by everyone" [...] (so many samples) [...] "and about everything" [...] (and a variety of thematic nuances).|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of the Barnes family, Pamela was {{initially}} met with suspicion and hostility from the rival Ewing family after she had married Bobby Ewing and moved onto the Southfork Ranch to live with her new husband. The strongest hostility towards Pamela came from Bobby's older brother, J.R. Ewing, who tried to drive Pamela off Southfork Ranch with methods of bribery and intimidation, as well as trying to con Bobby into believing that Pamela {{was having an affair with}} her ex-boyfriend, Ray Krebbs. Principal, who wanted to represent her character's outsider perception of the family, would portray this with the cast. Leonard Katzman described her as being [...] "the world's most isolated lady". When confronted by Katzman about why Principal chose to be isolated from everyone else, he described the situation as: [...] "After a while, I thought, 'Maybe she doesn't like us'. I went to see her. She said, 'No, I like everybody. It's just that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing.'" [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Fellow actor Patrick Duffy analyzed: ...|$|E

"I {{warned him}} {{there would be}} a lot of scope creep with this album because I had an idea how big <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it <b>to</b> be, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> spend a lot of time," [...] says Cardiff.

500|$|Nada Es Igual... is {{an album}} which {{consists}} of [...] uptempo [...] "jazzy, brassy, Al Jarreau-like" [...] pop songs and power ballads. [...] Its uptempo tracks include [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] and [...] "Todo Por Su Amor" [...] which utilize horn instruments and [...] "Cómo Es Posible Que a Mi Lado" [...] which incorporates house music. [...] "Dame" [...] is a R-lite" [...] with tune hip-hop influences.

2500|$|During a 1985 {{interview}} with [...] "Frets" [...] magazine, Jerry Garcia {{was asked if}} he was inspired by any non-guitarists. [...] He said [...] "Oh, yeah, sure. Art Tatum is my all-time favorite. Yeah, he's my all-time favorite. He's the guy I put on when <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> really small. When <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> really insignificant. He's a good guy to play for any musician, you know. He'll make them want to go home and burn their instruments. Art Tatum is absolutely the most incredible musician – what can you say?" ...|$|E
2500|$|At age eight, Clarkson {{was first}} {{inspired}} {{to venture into}} music {{during a visit to}} an African-American church in Fort Worth. She recalled: [...] "I was like, 'Wow, whatever they're feeling, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> it too'." [...] Clarkson has been influenced by musicians across various genres. She cited soul singer Aretha Franklin as her major influence. Many of her chosen Idol numbers were Aretha Franklin covers, including [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" [...] which is considered her breakout moment during the competition.

Clarkson was also influenced by rock acts such as Radiohead, Garbage, Aerosmith, and Jimi Hendrix as her influences. She has also listed Reba McEntire, Bette Midler, and Rosemary Clooney.
