5000|$|Any {{condition}} that causes abnormally {{high levels of}} unburned hydrocarbons—raw or partially burnt fuel—to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature, bringing {{the risk of a}} meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction. Usually the ignition system e.g. coil packs and/or primary <b>ignition</b> components (e.g. <b>distributor</b> <b>cap,</b> wires, <b>ignition</b> coil and spark plugs) and/or damaged fuel system components (fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, and associated sensors) could damage a catalytic converter - this also includes using a thicker oil viscosity not recommended by the manufacturer (especially with ZDDP content), oil and/or coolant leaks. Vehicles equipped with OBD-II diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver to a misfire condition by means of illuminating the [...] "check engine" [...] light on the dashboard, or flashing it if the current misfire conditions are severe enough to potentially damage the catalytic converter.|$|R

50|$|EEC-III uses a Duraspark III module (brown grommet where wires emerge) and a Duraspark II {{ignition}} coil. A resistance wire {{is used in}} {{the primary}} circuit. The distributors in EEC-III (and later) systems eliminate conventional mechanical and vacuum advance mechanisms. All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> electrodes to prevent cross-fire, resulting in a large-diameter <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R

50|$|In older vehicles, {{a single}} coil would serve all the spark plugs via the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor.</b> Notable {{exceptions}} are the Saab 92, some Volkswagens, and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder. The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just contact breakers, in a wasted spark system.|$|R
50|$|The {{key feature}} of Motronic 1.7 is the {{elimination}} of an <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor,</b> where instead each cylinder has its own electronically-triggered ignition coil. Motronic 1.7 family has versions 1.7, 1.7.2, 1.7.3, all of them used on M42/M43 engines in BMW 3 Series (E36) up to 1998 and BMW 5 Series (E34) up to 1995. The BMW M70 12 cylinder had the Motronic M1.7 and two distributor.|$|R
50|$|Certain 1981-83 models {{used the}} EEC-III system, {{which uses a}} Dura-Spark III module (brown grommet where wires emerge) and a Dura-Spark II {{ignition}} coil.

All timing is controlled by the engine computer, which is capable of firing the spark plug at any point within a 50-degree range depending on calibration. This increased spark capability requires greater separation of adjacent <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> electrodes to prevent cross-fire, another reason for its large-diameter <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> This system is very similar to the systems used at MSD; MSD used the Duraspark during R&D.|$|R
50|$|Ford Motor Company {{began using}} {{electronic}} ignitions in 1973 with the Duraspark electronic ignition system and introduced the Duraspark II system in 1976. The biggest change, {{apart from the}} control box redesign, was the large <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> to handle the increased spark energy.|$|R
5000|$|The QX4 {{received}} its first major update in 2000 for model year 2001, {{with a new}} VQ series engine (also later seen in the G35 and FX35) increasing its power from a relatively low [...] to a [...] V6 engine. The displacement went from 3.3 L to 3.5 L. The timing belt was replaced with a timing chain and the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> was replaced with an individual coil ignition system.|$|R
50|$|A cheaper {{configuration}} on high-speed engines {{with fewer}} than six cylinders is to use an axial-piston distributor pump, consisting of one rotating pump plunger delivering fuel to a valve and line for each cylinder (functionally analogous to points and <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> on an Otto engine).|$|R
50|$|It uses 2 {{ignition}} coils and no <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor.</b> Cylinders are fired in pairs (dual fire) - 1 and 4 together, and 2 and 3 together. The {{crankshaft position sensor}} is sensing the movement of two radially opposed position plates on the flywheel, {{one of which is}} magnetized, and the other is not. Thus, the engine management has precise information which group of cylinders to fire, and which group of injectors to spray.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s Oakland Motor Car {{engineers}} designed an all {{new engine}} for their [...] "companion" [...] make, the Pontiac that {{was introduced in}} 1926. It was a side-valve design with a one piece cast iron block with three main bearings. An unusual feature was that it had two separate cylinder heads that each covered three cylinders. The <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> was mounted {{on top of the}} block in the gap between the heads.|$|R
50|$|The <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> is a {{prime example}} of a {{component}} that eventually succumbs to heat and vibration. It is a relatively easy and inexpensive part to replace if its bakelite housing does not break or crack first. Carbon deposit accumulation or erosion of its metal terminals may also cause distributor-cap failure.|$|R
5000|$|As it is {{generally}} easy to remove and carry off, the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> can be taken off {{as a means of}} theft prevention. Although not practical for everyday use, because it is essential for the starting and running of the engine, its removal thwarts any attempt at hot-wiring the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Manifold {{pressure}} {{may also}} be [...] "ported". Porting is selecting a location for the pressure tap within the throttle plate's range of motion. Depending on throttle position, a ported pressure tap may be either upstream or downstream of the throttle. As the throttle position changes, a [...] "ported" [...] pressure tap is selectively connected to either manifold pressure or ambient pressure. Antique (pre-OBD II) engines often used ported manifold pressure taps for <b>ignition</b> <b>distributors</b> and emission-control components.|$|R
50|$|Kendal {{checks on}} Alby, {{a young boy}} who lives on his own. She tells him of Dean's plan to escape via a Cessna that has been almost fully repaired; all they need is the proper <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> However, Alby says he is better able to survive {{on his own and}} asks her not to visit him so often, as it attracts Carson's attention. After finally {{recovering}} the proper <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> from a car in Carson's compound, Kendal returns home again, only to find that three survivors have wandered onto their property in search of water. Dean convinces Kendal to donate water to them, though Kendal remains suspicious of their intentions. When they return shortly afterward, her suspicions are confirmed as they seek to steal the remaining water. Dean, barely able to walk, shoots them before they can kill Kendal.|$|R
5000|$|HEI is characterised by the {{incorporation}} of the ignition coil built into the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> for most applications. The system consists of a control module and a magnetic pickup mounted in the <b>distributor.</b> This eliminates <b>ignition</b> points and the coil wire. The control module basically performs the same function as the breaker points in a points and condenser system.|$|R
50|$|Engines {{that use}} a {{mechanical}} distributor may fail if they run into deep puddles because any water that gets onto the distributor can short out the electric current that should {{go through the}} spark plugs, rerouting it directly {{to the body of}} the vehicle. This in turn causes the engine to stop as the fuel is not ignited in the cylinders. This problem can be fixed by removing the <b>distributor's</b> <b>cap</b> and drying the cap, cam, rotor and the contacts by wiping with tissue paper or a clean rag, by blowing hot air on them, or using a moisture displacement spray e.g. WD-40 or similar. Oil, dirt or other contaminants can cause similar problems, so the distributor should be kept clean inside and outside to ensure reliable operation. Some engines include a rubber o-ring or gasket between the <b>distributor</b> base and <b>cap</b> to help prevent this problem. The gasket is made of a material like Viton or butyl for a tight seal in extreme temperatures and chemical environments. This gasket should not be discarded when replacing the <b>cap.</b> Most <b>distributor</b> <b>caps</b> have the position of the number 1 cylinder's terminal molded into the plastic. By referencing a firing order diagram and knowing the direction the rotor turns, (which can be seen by cranking the engine with the cap off) the spark plug wires can be correctly routed. Most <b>distributor</b> <b>caps</b> are designed so that they cannot be installed in the wrong position. Some older engine designs allow the cap to be installed in the wrong position by 180 degrees, however. The number 1 cylinder position on the cap should be noted before a cap is replaced.|$|R

These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days.

5000|$|A {{distributor}} {{consists of}} a rotating arm or [...] inside the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap,</b> {{on top of the}} distributor shaft, but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle (ground). The distributor shaft is driven by a gear on the camshaft on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The distributor shaft may also drive the oil pump.) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded carbon brush {{on the underside of the}} <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> The metal part of the rotor arm passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via high tension leads to the spark plug of each cylinder. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the rotor arm and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.|$|R

2500|$|Most {{four-stroke}} engines {{have used}} a mechanically timed electrical ignition system. The heart {{of the system is}} the distributor.

50|$|The {{appearance}} of the B16 was not unlike its predecessor, the B14. The block and cylinder heads bore no particular difference at a glance. The B16B sported twin SU HS4 carbs, notably larger than the B14A's HS2 carbs. Also, the remote oil filter attached next to the water pump on the <b>ignition</b> <b>distributor</b> side of the engine on the B14 had been relocated to a housing under the intake and exhaust manifold side on the B16. The exhaust manifold which dumped centrally on the B14 now was made to exit towards {{the rear of the}} B16 manifold.|$|R
50|$|The <b>distributor</b> <b>cap</b> has one {{post for}} each cylinder, and in points {{ignition}} systems {{there is a}} central post for the current from the ignition coil coming into the distributor. There are some exceptions however, as some engines (many Alfa Romeo cars, some 1980s Nissans) have two spark plugs per cylinder, so there are two leads {{coming out of the}} distributor per cylinder. Another implementation is the wasted spark system, where a single contact serves two leads, but in that case each lead connects one cylinder. In General Motors high energy ignition (HEI) systems there is no central post and the ignition coil sits on top of the distributor. Some Toyota and Honda engines also have their coil within the <b>distributor</b> <b>cap.</b> On the inside of the cap there is a terminal that corresponds to each post, and the plug terminals are arranged around the circumference of the cap according to the firing order in order to send the secondary voltage to the proper spark plug at the right time.|$|R
