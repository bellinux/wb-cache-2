5|$|Other {{potentially}} damaging materials include non-archival quality cardboard, card, paper, {{cotton and}} cork, {{all of which}} <b>give</b> <b>off</b> acidic vapors over time. PVC and polyurethane plastics are also a problem, as they degrade and <b>give</b> <b>off</b> acidic vapors with time. High humidity of the air is a significant contributing factor, as is lack of ventilation of the specimens. High ambient temperatures can increase the rapidity of the decay.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{patch of}} {{hair on the}} central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a distinctive odor.

5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E

5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not <b>give</b> <b>off</b> light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark when bothered, and a shrill whistle when in pain. When at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} <b>give</b> <b>off</b> low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given when shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E

5|$|Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to <b>give</b> <b>off</b> green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL soldiers {{as well as the}} process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message was somehow routed through several black holes to mask its point of origin.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} statistic {{tracked by}} {{the game is}} Karma which {{is affected by the}} decisions and actions the character performs during the game. Positive actions to Karma include freeing captives and helping others, while negative actions towards this include killing good characters and stealing. Actions vary in the level of karma change they cause; thus, pickpocketing produces less negative karma than the killing of a good character. Karma can have tangible effects to the player, beyond acting as flavor for the game's events, in that it can affect the ending the player gets, alter dialogue with non-player characters (NPCs) or <b>give</b> <b>off</b> unique reactions from other characters, while also granting access to certain perks that require a specific Karma level. However, the player's relationships with the game's factions are distinct, so any two groups or settlements may view the player in contrasting ways, depending on the player's conduct.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as keypad entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} nervus trigeminus of Mabuya quinquetaeniata. The {{results showed that the}} nervus trigeminus has one root, and two {{separate}} ganglia, a maxillomandibular ganglion and an ophthalmic one. The maxillomandibular ganglion is continuous with the ophthalmic ganglion. The lateral part of the ventromedial division of the trigeminal root <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the anguli oris nerve and nerves to the adductor mandibularis externus and the pseudotemporalis muscles. The constrictor dorsalis nerve innervates the protractor pterygoideus, levator pterygoideus, and depressor palpbrae inferioris muscles. It has no anastomosis with ramus palatinus of the nervus facialis. The ramus frontalis is connected with the lacrimal plexus. The ramus nasalis anastomoses with the ethmoidal ganglion and divides into its to rami lateralis and medialis nasi within the nasal capsule. The ramus maxillaris <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> lacrimal and temporal branches in the postorbital region. In the orbital region, it is termed infraorbital nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a nerve to the Harderian gland, the supralabial gland and the upper teeth. It fuses with the ramus palatinus lateralis of the nervus facialis. It receives an anastomosing branch from the ramus palatines medialis and fuses with the ramus palatines intermedialis for a short distance. It carries ganglionic cells at the point of fusion. It enters the maxilla as superior alveolar nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> nerve to the narial muscles. The ramus mandibularis <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> nerves to the pseudotemporalis and pterygomandibularis muscles.

5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina â€“ spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They <b>give</b> <b>off</b> one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple branches to supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends branches to supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which <b>give</b> <b>off</b> 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, eider duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
