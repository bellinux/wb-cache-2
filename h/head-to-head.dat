5|$|Like the original, {{there are}} the {{challenge}} and <b>head-to-head</b> game modes. In challenge mode, players play a series of races against three opponents and must finish first or second to progress to the next race. If a good enough lap time {{on any of the}} earlier levels is achieved, players automatically win the race. Placing first three times in a row earns players the chance to win an extra life by playing a special round to collect vehicles within a time limit. <b>Head-to-head</b> is a game which involves one opponent achieving enough distance from opponents to be the only racer on the screen. This earns that player a point, represented by coloured lights on the screen: one light turns the colour of that player. If all eight lights are one colour, the player of that colour wins. If after three laps, the colours are mixed, the player with the most lights wins. Players are given thee lives in both modes. Players select a character, whose stats only affect computer-controlled players, to play as before racing.|$|E
