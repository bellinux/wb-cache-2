50|$|Trains are {{classified}} as either up (<b>even-numbered)</b> <b>trains</b> or down (odd-numbered) trains. Since the capital Beijing is treated as {{the focal point of}} the rail network, trains from Beijing are down services (e.g. the T109 from Beijing to Shanghai), while trains towards Beijing are up services (e.g. the T110 from Shanghai to Beijing).|$|R
25|$|The {{second and}} third digits {{indicate}} the sequence number of the train. For instance, x01 is the first train of the day. These digits also indicate {{the direction of the}} train; odd-numbered trains run northbound, and <b>even-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> run southbound. Thus x02 is the first southbound train of the day, x03 is the second northbound train of the day, etc.|$|R
50|$|There are 60 Haruka train {{services}} per day, numbered 1 to 60; odd-numbered trains run south (toward the airport) and <b>even-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> run north (away {{from the}} airport). They operate {{every half hour}} during the daytime and early evening. The typical travel time between Kyoto Station and the airport is 75 minutes for southbound trains and 73 minutes for northbound trains.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, most {{railroad}}s use [...] "east and west", and it {{is unusual}} for a railroad to designate [...] "north and south" [...] (the New York City Subway and the Washington Metro are rare examples). <b>Even-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> (superior) travel east (or north). Odd-numbered trains (inferior) travel west (or south). An easy way to remember this: [...] "ODD trains go to San Francisco (west). VERY ODD trains go to Los Angeles (south)".|$|R
50|$|Oddly enough, then as now, odd {{numbered}} ran eastbound and <b>even-numbered</b> <b>trains</b> ran westbound, against traditional railroad operating procedure. The {{reason for}} this is because before Colonel Springs bought the railroad, trains ran through from points north of Chester. Thus, they started their runs as southbound trains which, like westbound trains, normally have odd-digit numbers. They kept their odd-numbers all the way to Lancaster on the Chester and Cheraw, even after they turned east at Chester.|$|R
5000|$|Summer-season {{construction}} {{began in}} 1910 including ten reinforced concrete bridges. The longest was a 200 ft span over the Presumpscot River There was a 100 ft span over the Little Androscoggin River in Auburn and {{a span of}} similar length near West Falmouth. Approximately 30 mi of 70 lb steel rail was laid in 33 ft lengths over private right-of-way connecting segments of trackage rights over Portland, Lewiston, and Auburn city streetcar lines. Scheduled interurban service began on 7 July 1914. At Gray, odd-numbered northbound trains took a siding to cross <b>even-numbered</b> southbound <b>trains</b> on the following route from north to south: ...|$|R
50|$|The TEE service {{started with}} trainnumber TEE 128 (Paris - Brussel), at 1 September 1963 the trainnumber TEE 119 was {{assigned}} to the southbound train. At 26 May 1967 the train was renumbered, the northbound service became TEE 64, the southbound service became TEE 61. At 23 May 1971 a new renumbering was implemented. All TEE services between Amsterdam and Paris got sequential numbers from 80 up to 87. The odd-numbers for northbound <b>trains,</b> the <b>even-numbers</b> for southboud <b>trains.</b> Within these numbers TEE 83 and TEE 84 were assigned to TEE Brabant.|$|R
