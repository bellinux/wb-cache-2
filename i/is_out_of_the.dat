5|$|The group bring Tom back {{to their}} camp. Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) and Lourdes (Seychelle Gabriel) operate on Tom. While Tom is in surgery, flashbacks appear, filling in the gaps of his 3 month departure. He is {{apparently}} tortured by the alien “Overlords” while on the spaceship. Later, the Overlords wish to speak with him. They communicate through Karen (Jessy Schram), who was once part of the 2nd Mass. It tells Tom about a “Neutral Zone”, in which survivors can live in peace – detained in a camp run by The Overlords. Tom quickly realizes that negotiation with their invaders <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question, and he immediately refuses. He attacks a nearby Skitter and is knocked unconscious in the process.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} a young heiress who has two suitors, one a French baron and the other an American {{businessman}} named Jack. Her aunt, who favors the French noble out her desire for status, is hurt {{to learn that the}} heiress has chosen to marry the American businessman. The baron vows revenge and schemes with the aunt to aid his plot. When the businessman comes to the house to see his fiancée, he learns that she <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house and sits down with the baron and aunt. Moments later, the servant rushes into the room attracted by cries to see Jack bending over the wounded baron with a knife in hand. Both the aunt and the baron accuse him of the stabbing as well as the servant and a policeman, who also saw Jack with the knife. In court, the jury finds it to be a clear case and Jack is sentenced to ten years in prison.|$|E
25|$|An out of {{the money}} (OTM) option has no {{intrinsic}} value. A call option <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> money when the strike price is above the spot price of the underlying security.

40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop <b>is</b> a form {{of partial}} ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop can <b>be</b> eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless <b>of</b> who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{critical}} factor for reduction of the death of the tooth root cells and the subsequent root replacement resorption following reimplantation of knocked-out teeth is maintenance of normal cell physiology and metabolism of the cells left on the tooth root while the tooth <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socket.

If the z-coordinate <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the screen display will be left-handed.|$|E
