40|$|Abstract Eczema is {{a chronic}} {{relapsing}} atopic <b>dermatitis</b> (AD) associated <b>with</b> <b>pruritus,</b> sleep disturbance and poor {{quality of life}} of the patient. Treatment of eczema includes use of emollient, topical and systemic antimicrobial agents, corticosteroid or immunomodulating agents. Many patients also seek alternative treatments such as dietary avoidance, supplementation or both. This article reviews the basic pathophysiology of eczema and clinical trials involving Chinese medicine in the treatment of eczema. Research reports on Chinese herbal medicine for eczema were retrieved from PubMed and the Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews for this review. Only a few RCTs demonstrated the efficacy (or lack of efficacy) of Chinese medicinal herbs in treating atopic eczema. Further larger scale trials are warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|A 36 -year-old woman {{presented}} <b>with</b> chronic recurring <b>dermatitis</b> of the vulva, perineum, and lips. The genital lesions had a 3 -year {{history and}} were associated <b>with</b> slight <b>pruritus</b> and occasional pain. The lesions {{of the upper}} lip {{had a history of}} 6 months. The patient had been treated with cycles of antimycotics and topical steroids which only partially controlled the symptoms during treatment. Dermatologic examination showed <b>erythematous,</b> infiltrative <b>dermatitis</b> <b>with</b> edema of the labia majora and persistent edema of the upper lip (Fig. 1 a,b). Routine blood chemistry, urine analysis, and chest X-ray were normal. Microscopic examination and cultures of vaginal swabs did not reveal any pathogenic bacteria or fungi. Histologic examination of a biopsy of vulval lesional skin showed lichenoid lymphocytic infiltration of the papillary dermis and small, nonnecrotic epithelioid granulomas in the deep dermis (Fig. 1 c,d). No microorganisms, including acid-fast bacilli or fungi, were identified. Culture was negative for fungi. Polymerase chain reaction was negative for the mycobacterial genome. Histologic examination of a biopsy from the upper lip showed similar results. The pathology reports of both regions were compatible with a diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis and vulvitis. To investigate concomitant asymptomatic inflammatory bowel disease, the patient underwent colonoscopy with retrograde ileoscopy and gastroscopy, which were both negative. The patient refused radiographic examination of the small intestine with a barium meal. The patient was treated with systemic metronidazole (500 mg/day). After 6 months of therapy, the upper lip showed significant improvement and erythema and desquamation in the genital area showed slight improvement, but genital edema was unaffected...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the pharmacological and toxicological actions of puriˆed snake enzymatic cream (PSE) isolated from Agkistrodon Halys Venom, <b>erythematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> was induced by applying dinitro‰uorobenezene (DNFB) {{on the back}} skin of guinea pigs. Consequent local alterations at diŠerent doses of PSE were observed and compared using negative control methods. In skin irritation and acute toxicological experiments, 500 times the eŠective doses were used in artiˆcially lesioned skin. The marking criteria in the former were based on local manifestations, and in the latter, on changes of some indicators including body weight, breath, and heart rate {{before and after the}} experiments. PSE sig-niˆcantly alleviated <b>erythematous</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (p＜ 0. 01, t test) without systemic or local adverse drug reactions within 7 days.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that 10 - 50 % of patients <b>with</b> <b>pruritus</b> but no skin rash have an underlying systemic disease and up to 70 % a psychiatric one. The aim of this retrospective study was to review the records {{of a large number of}} patients <b>with</b> chronic <b>pruritus</b> for concomitant diseases and treatment options. Medical records of 139 patients (52 males, 87 females) <b>with</b> chronic <b>pruritus</b> who visited the outpatient dermatological clinic during a 17 -month period were reviewed. Itch was the presenting symptom in 6 of 47 patients with systemic disease and in 17 of 31 patients with psychiatric disease. Twenty-four patients had neuropathic itch and 37 patients had pruritus of unknown origin. The most severe and long-lasting itch was found in patients with multiple systemic diseases and in those <b>with</b> <b>pruritus</b> of unknown origin. Pruritus of the scalp and face was most common in psychogenic pruritus. Phototherapy was found to be a useful therapeutic option. In conclusion, systemic diseases are unlikely to cause chronic pruritus in patients consulting a dermatology department...|$|R

40|$|Pruritus {{is still}} one of the most common and {{disturbing}} symptoms of end-stage renal disease. The objective of this study is to analyze the prevalence of pruritus in hemodialysis patients and the possible factors implicated in its genesis. In a cross-sectional study, 101 patients on hemodialysis at our center were screened for pruritus. The relationship of various factors <b>with</b> <b>pruritus</b> was evaluated. Of the 101 patients included, 31 (30. 7 %) had pruritus at the time of examination. Patients <b>with</b> <b>pruritus</b> were significantly older than those without pruritus (P= 0. 0027). Pruritus tended to be more prevalent in patients undergoing dialysis 3 times a week than in those undergoing daily dialysis, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0. 0854). Lower transferrin saturation levels were found in patients <b>with</b> <b>pruritus</b> than in those without pruritus (P= 0. 0144). C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients <b>with</b> <b>pruritus</b> than in those without pruritus (P= 0. 0013). There was no significant difference between the groups in the levels of the other inflammatory biomarkers measured. However, there was a tendency toward a correlation between the levels of alpha- 1 -glycoprotein and the intensity of pruritus (P= 0. 0834). Our results suggest a possible relationship of the inflammatory response upregulation to pruritus. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between pruritus and iron deficiency, possibly associated with inflammatory elevation of hepcidin. A better understanding of the factors implicated in the genesis of pruritus related to end-stage renal disease is crucial in the development of more effective treatments for this symptom...|$|R
