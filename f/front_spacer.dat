40|$|Purpose: The present paper {{describes}} a knowledge-based system (KBS) developed for selection of progressivedie components to automate {{the design process}} of progressive dies in stamping industries. Design/methodology/approach: The production rule based KBS approach of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hasbeen utilized for constructing the proposed system. The system has been structured into seven KBS modules. Modules are user interactive and designed to be loaded in to the prompt area of AutoCAD. Findings: The output of system modules includes the type and proper dimensions of progressive die componentsnamely die block, die gages (<b>front</b> <b>spacer</b> and back gage), stripper, punches, punch plate, back plate, die-set andfasteners. The system has been designed {{in such a way}} that the expert advices imparted by its modules areautomatically stored in different output data files. These data files can be further utilized for automatic modelingof die components and die assembly. Research limitations/implications: Although the system is limited to the design of progressive dies only, yet itcan be extended further for the design of other types of dies also. Practical implications: The proposed system is ready for use in sheet metal industries for quick selection ofprogressive die components. The system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software and thereforeits low cost of implementation makes it affordable by small and medium sized stamping industries. Originality/value: The proposed system is capable of accomplishing the time-consuming task of selection ofprogressive die components in a very short time period...|$|E

Curiously, {{it is the only}} Powertrack/Speedtrack car to have a <b>front</b> axle with <b>spacer</b> bushes on it. This suggests it was a very early Matchbox prototype that could just about pass for production.|$|R

A high-contrast {{pattern of the}} first metasurface is operable for modifying, over a first phase profile, a phase front of an incident light beam. A second metasurface, is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface with a second high-contrast pattern and operable for shaping, over a second phase profile, the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase <b>front.</b> A <b>spacer</b> layer, in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts, is disposed in a controllably changeable separation {{between the first and}} second metasurfaces. Controllably changing the separation between the first and the second metasurfaces by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance significantly greater than the first distance...|$|R
