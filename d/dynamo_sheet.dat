40|$|Magnetic measurements, {{carried out}} {{by means of the}} Epstein frame, have shown that most typical dynamo steel sheets have certain {{anisotropic}} properties. In numerical analysis, anisotropic properties are taken into account {{with the use of the}} special function of the grain distribution in the given <b>dynamo</b> <b>sheet.</b> For engineering purposes, it is desirable to assess the influence of these properties on the changes of the magnetic flux density in typical dynamo steel sheets, especially during the rotational magnetization. For this purpose, measurements of the flux density changes and field strength changes in the circular-shaped samples of two selected typical dynamo sheets were performed. These measurements were carried out for several values of the current flowing in windings which generated the axial or rotational magnetic field in the test <b>dynamo</b> <b>sheet.</b> The influence of the magnetic anisotropy on the magnetization process was briefly discussed for both types of the magnetization processes...|$|E
