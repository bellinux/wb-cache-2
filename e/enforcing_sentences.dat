40|$|We see faces {{every day}} within a rich {{situational}} context. Previous ERP {{research has demonstrated}} that priming faces with contextual sentences varying in self-relevance and valence alters electrocortical and emotional responding to them, though the time-course of these effects is still unclear. It is also unclear if these effects interact with another cue that inherently contains emotional and self-referential information: whether or not the face is looking at the participant. We primed direct and averted gaze neutral faces (gaze manipulation) with emotional sentences to give them context. These sentences contained positive or negative opinions (valence manipulation) that the face held of the participants or of someone else (self-relevance manipulation). After reading each sentence, participants viewed the corresponding face and rated how positive or negative, and how affectively aroused, it made them feel. Eye-tracking <b>enforced</b> <b>sentence</b> reading and face fixation, while ERPs recorded at face onset tracked the time-course of when context and gaze effects interacted. Faces put into self-relevant contexts were more arousing than those in other-relevant contexts, and elicited different ERP waveforms just 150 ms post-face, earlier than previously reported. This self-relevance effect was modulated by valence at both the behavioural and ERP level. Finally, faces put into positive self-referential contexts elicited different N 170 ERP amplitudes depending on gaze direction, interacting during the time window thought to reflect the structural encoding of the face. These findings were paralleled in our behavioural measures, where positive self-referential faces made participants feel more positive if they had direct rather than averted gaze. These results indicate that the contextual cues of self-relevance and valence impact early visual perception of neutral faces in a complex and nuanced manner, interacting with gaze direction. They emphasize the importance of studying the effect of gaze cues on face perception within context mimicking the complexities of real world interactions...|$|R

They were established in 1942 and 1943. The Polish underground jurisdiction played very important role – it was created to establish Polish justice on the occupied by the Nazis territory. Vilnius Region had complicated ethnical and political structure at this time. These problems were used by Soviet and Nazi occupants to suppress Polish underground. There were many individuals who collaborated with the occupant’s authorities.

50|$|It {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} {{for young}} people to be sentenced to imprisonment. For the most serious crimes, such as murder and manslaughter, the penalty may be institutionalisation at a specialised youth home. The National Board of Institutional Care is responsible to <b>enforce</b> these <b>sentences.</b> This punishment is for a fixed term, and its focus is on care, treatment and the rehabilitation of young offenders. By contrast, the age of criminal responsibility in the Netherlands is 12. A specialised youth police and courts system was reintroduced in the Netherlands, in order to provide for a specialised task force to deal with youth crime. At the age of 16, an offender who commits crime may be tried in an adult court. The ‘stop and halt’ program is also aimed at punishing young offenders. Younger {{children under the age of}} 12 can be ‘stopped’ when they offend, with the main aim at confronting the onset of delinquency. Older children (over the age of 12) can be ‘halted’, with successful completion meaning no criminal record and no prosecution for the young offender in the hope of rehabilitation.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the story}} of the INA {{unfolded}} in post-war India, the view of Indian soldiers on the INA - and on their own position during the war - also changed. The Raj observed with increasing disquiet and unease the spread of pro-INA sympathies within the troops of the British-Indian forces. In February 1946, while the trials were still going on, a general strike by ratings of the Royal Indian Navy rapidly deteriorated into a mutiny incorporating ships and shore establishments of the RIN throughout India. The mutineers raised slogans invoking Subhas Bose and the INA, demanding and end to the trials. The mutiny received widespread public support. In some places in the British-Indian Army, non-commissioned Officers started ignoring orders from British superiors. In Madras and Pune British garrisons faced revolts from within the ranks of the British-Indian Army. These were suppressed by force. At the conclusion of the first trial, when the sentences of deportation were commuted, Fay records Claude Auchinleck as having sent a [...] "personal and secret" [...] letter to all senior British officers, explaining: ... practically all are sure that any attempt to <b>enforce</b> the <b>sentence</b> would have led to chaos in the country at large, and probably to mutiny and dissension in the Army, culminating in its dissolution.|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} and subsequently {{the execution of}} criminal penalties of deprivation of liberty byanother Member State, {{other than the one}} of the conviction, is an act of mutual trust between Member Statesof the European Union. However, the differences between criminal legal norms, particularly regarding theminimum and maximum limits of some punishment prescribed for the same offense, require a differentapproach in the sense that a member can not recognize and then <b>enforce</b> a <b>sentence</b> of deprivation of libertywith the maximum limits greater than its own legislation, for the same offense. This very sensitive issue wasresolved by adopting the Framework Decision 2008 / 909 /JHA of the Council from 27 November 2008, wherethe European legislative act allows the executing Member State the re-individualization of the deprivation ofliberty sentence, the goal being that the penalty imposed is compatible with the internal law of theenforcement state. In the implementation of European legislative act depositions, any member State whichhas recognized such a court order, based on a legal decision ordered by a competent judicial body may stillre-individualize the penalty regarding its maximum limit. The examination of the European legislative acthighlights also some flaws that must be corrected, taking into account the possibility for the executingMember States to fully modify the applied punishment, as regards both its nature and its proportion applied inthe sentencing State...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an environmental impact}} assessment (EIA) controversial case, which was finally settled by the passing of a <b>sentence.</b> The <b>sentence</b> <b>enforced</b> a payment {{to compensate for the}} economic damage caused to a fish farm through local environmental changes in Urola river estuary, located in the Basque Country. The damage was allegedly caused by a breakwater extension built at the mouth of an estuary nearby the farm, and linked to a recreation port project located within the estuary. While the sentence settled the meaning of compensation from an economic perspective, it raised by contrast some questions on the difficulty of undertaking ecological compensation within EIA practice, using of this particular case. Maybe these difficulties account for the lack of compensation in coastal development projects, which we have observed in a variety of cases in Spain, particularly for coastal development projects...|$|R

Secondly, this paper also discusses whether the fact that the prison sentence protects the victim’s interests serves the purpose of rehabilitating the offender or, whether it becomes an obstacle in their reintegration into society, leading to the introduction of victimological considerations only being acceptable if they do not affect this basic objective of <b>enforcing</b> the custodial <b>sentence,</b> and can therefore serve as a useful element of custodial treatment and as data to be used for judgement purposes in risk assessments that should be carried out at different points of the enforcement...|$|R
40|$|As {{state and}} local governments have devoted a rising share of their {{resources}} to crime-related programmes, concerns have arisen that spending on other programmes such as education will fall. Coupled with growing public concerns over performance of the public education system, and expectations that prison populations will rise as states pass and <b>enforce</b> more stringent <b>sentencing</b> laws, {{it is not surprising that}} some view the expansion of crime-related programmes as troublesome. One hypothesis is that education and crime-related programmes directly compete for government expenditures so that what one programme gains the other must lose as in a fixed-pie situation. A competing hypothesis is that spending on these two public programmes are unrelated and therefore higher crime-related spending may also lead to higher taxes or public debt issuance, or to reduction in spending on programmes other than education. We estimate a three equation model of spending on crime-related programmes, spending on education, and the crime rate from which we directly test whether spending on crime and education influence each other. ...|$|R
40|$|The Catholic Church’s {{opposition}} {{to the death penalty}} places Catholic judges in a moral and legal bind. While these judges are obliged by oath, professional commitment, and the demands of citizenship to enforce the death penalty, they are also obliged to adhere to their church’s teaching on moral matters. Although the legal system has a solution for this dilemma by allowing the recusal of judges whose convictions keep them from doing their job, Catholic judges will want to sit whenever possible without acting immorally. However, litigants and the general public are entitled to impartial justice, which may be something a judge who is heedful of ecclesiastical pronouncements cannot dispense. Therefore, the authors argue, we need to know whether judges are legally disqualified from hearing cases that their consciences would let them decide. While mere identification of a judge as Catholic is not sufficient reason for recusal under federal law, the authors suggest that the moral impossibility of enforcing capital punishment in such cases as <b>sentencing,</b> <b>enforcing</b> jury recommendations, and affirming are in fact reasons for not participating...|$|R
