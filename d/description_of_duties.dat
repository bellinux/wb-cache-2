40|$|This project {{features}} a handbook designed for clinicians looking to assist individuals {{caring for a}} patient diagnosed with dementia. Informal caregivers can face many challenges as their care recipient progresses {{through the course of}} Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. These challenges, although perceived uniquely by each caregiver, can be associated with psychological symptoms that have implications for psychotherapists working with them in a clinical setting. This handbook contains useful information for clinicians interested in working with caretakers involved in dementia care. It introduces the topic by explaining symptoms and causes of dementia, including information on Alzheimer's disease. This handbook also provides readers with information on the experience of providing care for an individual diagnosed with dementia. This includes a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> caregivers perform, the changes caregivers experience over time, and an overview of health outcomes they may experience {{as a result of their}} duty to manage cognitive, behavioral and psychological symptoms accompanying the care recipient's diagnosis.

This article focuses onGreek reality and analyses the Nurses’ role in emergency health care-related issues {{from a legal}} perspective in {{the last thirty years}} (1982 - 2011). Presented are the evolution of School Nursing in Greece, Legal Provisions pertaining to it, Professional Duties, and the work ofSchool Nurses, keeping abreast of existing legal bibliography including the latest Act, which introduces the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> vis-à-visemergency health care. Aim: This study links Greek School Nurses with Emergency Health Care in the School Environment. It is aimed at updating and raisingawareness about further legal regulation of emergency care procedures at Schools and constructing a model to be compared to the currentlegislation and practice in other countries. Methods: Systematic review of laws and review of articles published in the last 30 years (1982 - 2011) in scientific journals,academic databases included in HEAL-LING, SAGE, ELSEVIER, WILSON, SCIENCEDIRECT, MEDLINE, PUBMED,PsycINFO, Cochrane, EMBASE, SCOPUS and CINAHL having as search criteria and key words the terms of Greeklanguage «Σχολική Νοσηλευτική», (“School Nursing” [MeSH]), «Ειδική Αγωγή» (“Special Education” [MeSH]),«Επείγουσα Φροντίδα» (“Emergency Care” [MeSH]), «Νοσηλευτική Νομοθεσία» (“Law and Nursing Ethics” [MeSH]),«Άτομα με Ειδικές Ανάγκες» (“Children with Special Needs” [MeSH]), «Πρώτες Βοήθεις» («First Aid» [MeSH]). Discussion: School Nursing in Greece is only limited to Special Education whereas health care procedures are rather unclear from a legalpoint of view. Further clinical training, wider roles for nurses in emergency care, and the introduction of School Nurses in all Schools and ofa legal framework supporting them may be some of the future development prospects for this profession in Greece. conclusion: An important finding of this study is the conclusion that in Greece School Nurses in the last third years are solely confined todaily, scheduled care of Children with Special Needs and their Education rather than responding to emergency health needs, their role beingmarked by the absence of a clear legal framework...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Hospital managers, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} health care workers, are the subject of continuous education. In some countries around the world, health management education is an important part of health reforms. The aim of present research is to perform evidence-based studies based on assessing hospital managers’ needs. Therefore, it should be considered that educational need assessment regarding hospital managers is essential in today’s health care management. Methods: A total of 26 hospital managers were surveyed using a data gathering form (questionnaire) including 59 open questions designed in order to obtain data in 3 different areas. These included managers’ insight towards job duties and the capabilities required to fulfill their duty along with educational needs determined by managers. The next step involved presenting standard <b>description</b> <b>of</b> job <b>duties</b> to hospitals managers and asking them to document their educational needs regarding capabilities required to fulfill their <b>duties.</b> The standard <b>description</b> <b>of</b> job <b>duties</b> originated from ISO 9001 certified hospitals. For each manager, a score ranging from 0 to 19 was attained. For each correct matched statement, a positive point was considered and in the case of unmatched statements, managers received no points. Results: Out of 26 participating managers, only 20 did state the educational needs of hospitals managers. In describing job <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> hospital managers, the mean scores regarding hospital managers of public sector was 10. 27 while it was 8 with private hospital managers. Conclusion: The findings of our study indicate that hospital managers as the leaders of the most sophisticated health care facilities delivering expensive complicated services need proper training regarding job competency. Therefore, it seems that continuous need assessment in this area should be carried out...|$|R
