5|$|Forest <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> viewed {{for many}} decades {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
5|$|New <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> reported: Count Adam Christoffer Knuth's {{house in}} Pustervig, a cellar in Købmagergade (Market Street) and a haystack at Nørreport (Northern Gate) all {{broke out in}} flames; the latter likely ignited by embers carried by the wind.|$|E
5|$|A church {{close to}} the {{refinery}} {{was used as a}} point for families seeking information on relatives employed at the facility. So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative. At the close of the day of the explosion, six people were missing, with no confirmed deaths. Overnight, several deep-seated <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> uncovered and firefighting continued the next day.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> now 90% contained. <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> still {{estimated}} at 4,400 hectares.|$|R
50|$|Wood <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> prohibited. Charcoal <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> allowed, but {{charcoal}} is {{not available}} for purchase on the island.|$|R
50|$|The Rim <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> ignited on the Stanislaus National Forest in August 2013, and {{eventually}} grew {{to become the}} third-largest fire in California history. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> named after the Rim of the World Vista on California State Route 120, where the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> initially reported.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> {{generally}} {{believed to be}} detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fires</b> <b>were</b> a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever {{been seen in the}} east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E
50|$|On July 3, the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> 95% contained. The Wallow <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} 100% contained as of 6 p.m., July 8.|$|R
50|$|The East Peak <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> {{a forest}} <b>fire</b> that began {{east of the}} East Spanish Peak near La Veta, Colorado at 5:10 PM on Wednesday, June 19, 2013. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} named the Scout Ranch Fire because the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> first reported by the Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch.|$|R
50|$|The River Complex <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in the Trinity Alps Wilderness, Trinity County, California during the 2015 California wildfire season. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> started on July 30 {{as a result of}} a lightning strike. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared 100 percent contained on October 29, with 75,081 acre burned.|$|R
5|$|Sherman {{captured}} {{the state capital}} of Columbia, South Carolina, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> accidental, others a deliberate act of vengeance, and still others that the retreating Confederates burned bales of cotton {{on their way out}} of town.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships of}} the class entered service {{in time to see}} action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the {{commander}} of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed at the island of Lissa. There, the Austrian fleet under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff attacked the Italians. The four Regina Maria Pias all took part in the ensuing Battle of Lissa. Regina Maria Pia had been set on fire and badly burned in the battle, and minor <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> started by Austrian shells aboard San Martino and Castelfidardo, but neither were seriously damaged. Ancona emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.|$|E
5|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{flying over}} the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn {{on the morning of}} 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, blocking the road, causing many horses to bolt over a precipice {{on one side of the}} road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E
5000|$|In Chinese philosophy, <b>fire</b> (...) <b>is</b> the prosper of the matter, or the matter's {{prosperity}} stage. <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} phase of Wu Xing.|$|R
50|$|By June 7, reports {{indicated}} the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> slowing down. On June 8, President Clinton signed Federal Disaster Declaration AK-1119-DR, making federal disaster relief funding available. This funding eventually exceeded $8 million. On June 10, the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared to be contained. On June 15, the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared {{to be under}} control.|$|R
50|$|The Goose <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in Fresno County, California. By {{the time the}} <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> contained, 2,241 acre of land had burned.|$|R
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants were most likely the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In Southaven, 40homes were flooded and 200were left {{homeless}} as {{a result}} of the heavy rainfall. A church undergoing construction in Calhoun County was damaged, and a street light in Lee County was snapped. Also, a fallen tree damaged a house in Itawamba County. One indirect fatality occurred in Jasper County from an automobile accident due to wet roads. An estimated 24,000customers lost electric power during the storm. After the storm, several <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> sparked due to downed electrical wires. In all, the weakening Hurricane Dennis left $2.6million (2005USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|One {{large group}} of fires {{was known as the}} Snake River Complex. These <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> in the {{southern}} section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum rate}} of <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> usually stated as five rounds/minute, and 65 rounds/hour sustained. In Soviet service, {{the unit of}} <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> 60 rounds.|$|R
30|$|ENSO values during fire {{years prior}} to 1900 did not depart {{significantly}} from mean ENSO values, although years in which <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> widespread (at least four sites recording <b>fire)</b> <b>were</b> associated with positive ENSO (El Niño) values. Years in which no <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> recorded were associated with negative ENSO (La Niña) values (Figure 5).|$|R
50|$|A {{skyscraper}} fire or high-rise <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> a {{class of}} structural fire specific to tall buildings. Skyscraper <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> {{one of the most}} technical fire-suppression challenges posed to modern fire departments, and require a high degree of organization and cooperation among participating units to be successfully contained and extinguished. Skyscraper <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> often multiple-alarm <b>fires.</b>|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the fires}} of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent of the}} park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to blend in with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> forbidden. Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} the explosion on April 19, 1989, and the heroic {{efforts by the}} ship's crew to contain the fires and avoid a cataclysmic detonation of the turret's powder magazines. After the <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> contained, Moosally ordered the crew to immediately begin cleaning up the turret. The cleanup involved removing {{the bodies of the}} deceased turret crewman and disposing of the damaged turret equipment, all without photographing or otherwise recording the locations of the bodies or equipment which would have presumably assisted with the resulting investigation.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{made by the}} Chicago Police Department {{and fire}} department. The survivors claimed that the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time. Although the actual cause of the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> unknown, the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson. It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the <b>fire</b> <b>were</b> never noted.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> a self-sustaining, {{exothermic}} oxidation {{reaction that}} emits heat and light. When a <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> accelerated, it can produce more heat, consume the reactants more quickly, burn {{at a higher}} temperature, and increase {{the spread of the}} fire. An accelerated <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> said to have a higher [...] "heat release rate," [...] meaning it burns more quickly.|$|R
50|$|The Frog <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a fatal <b>fire</b> that {{occurred}} during the 2015 California wildfire season that burned 4,863 acre of land in the Modoc National Forest. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> one of many <b>fires</b> that <b>was</b> started on July 30 during a lightning storm.|$|R
5|$|The {{fires in}} Yellowstone left {{a mosaic of}} areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} and police worked {{to keep the}} mob at bay, and drove them {{to the far end}} of the station near Lee Street. There they assailed the buildings of the depot with stones. At 10:30pm the rioters set fire to passenger cars, the dispatcher's office, and the roundhouse. Some firefighters dispatched to the scene were driven off, and others had their hoses cut when they attempted to set up their pumps, but, under the protection of the police and soldiers, the flames were extinguished. The Sun reported the fires damaged one passenger car and engine, destroyed the dispatcher's office, and damaged the roof of the depot's shed. Two subsequent <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> started in the south of the city, but were dealt with without major damage.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
50|$|The Border <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in Potrero, San Diego County, California. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> so named {{due to its}} proximity to the United States-Mexican border.|$|R
5000|$|Fire - a <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> {{started by}} using a spark created by jumper cables {{connected}} to car batteries. The <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> used for light, boiling water, and cooking.|$|R
50|$|The Santiago <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{located near}} Santiago Canyon in Orange County, California, U.S., {{and one of}} twenty-three California wildfires of October 2007. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> intentionally started.|$|R
