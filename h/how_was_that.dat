[...] He {{was the first to}} rise in rebellion but was finally willing to surrender to others. [...] Did he not know that this put him in great danger? [...] Further, he could not actually submit, contributing his abilities to serve the emperor, and he finally rebelled, becoming only a madman. [...] He did not accept Wang Bodang's words, and he finally suffered disaster at Taolin. [...] Some have compared him to Xiang Yu. [...] Even if he had sufficient civil and military abilities to match, he was far more lacking in bravery and decisiveness. [...] If Yang Su had favored Li Mi's abilities, he should have let Li Mi be a servant of the emperor, but instead he gave Li Mi to his idiotic son , finally leading to the slaughter of his house. [...] <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> appropriate? ...|$|E
60|$|Hers to decide? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> possible? What {{could he}} mean? She pressed him with some such questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems odd. I cannot {{account for}} it. You talk a great deal--you talk freely. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{circumstance}} never touched on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>How</b> cold <b>is</b> <b>that</b> bosom which folly once fired, [...] <b>How</b> pale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cheek {{where the}} rouge lately glisten'd; [...] How silent that tongue which the echoes oft tired, [...] <b>How</b> dull <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ear which to flatt'ry so listen'd! ...|$|R
3000|$|... 41.55, the {{occlusion}} {{right before}} the troubled occlusion, the combined method still gets the whole assignment right. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> possible? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "All in due time; unless, like Miss Rachel, {{you wish}} to tell me my story yourselves. By-the-bye, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> poor girl to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Washed {{up out of}} the sea!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Chillingsworth. [...] "Why, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> Come, {{begin at}} the beginning, and tell me all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lost {{the half}} of it, Louis!" [...] said Mactavish. [...] "Why, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> You must have lost more than half your spirits with it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No governess! <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> possible? Five daughters {{brought up}} at home without a governess! I {{never heard of}} such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Lucy, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Such an oracle really whets my curiosity. What am I to-day? What was I the {{yesterday}} of {{ten years}} back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{you are a}} heretic {{about art}} generally. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> I should have {{expected}} you to be very sensitive to the beautiful everywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> friend?" [...] still conscientiously {{holding back}} the old Adam in him, {{as if it}} were a mastiff he had by the neck.|$|R
6000|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> bit of pencil moved? The {{messages}} he ignored--they didn't matter--but {{the method}} of their production seemed to eliminate all trickery, conscious or unconscious. Why did his mother's left hand quiver--and how could that writing shape itself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] said Sutton, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that it was mighty lucky that he came into that money. You can't keep open house for ever on thirty a week. By the way, Arthur, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> I heard it was his uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|Not a doubt. They are so {{different}}, {{that they}} look like bits of two different continents. Scrambling over the fence is like scrambling out of Europe into Australia. Now, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> difference made? Think. Don't guess, but think. Why does the rich grass {{come up to the}} bank, and yet not spread beyond it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{very happy}} about this-â€”the {{connection}} especially. I don't think he could have borne it if it had <b>been</b> the Infanta. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> dear Babie?" ...|$|R
6000|$|DON JUAN. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> very {{flattering}} statue, by the way? Does {{it still}} come to supper with naughty people and cast them into this bottomless pit? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forget it! <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> to <b>be</b> done? <b>How</b> can {{the mind}} forget {{the history of}} its own life? No,--I cannot forget it. I can forgive it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An Irishman {{who lived}} at Markdale had a little pig," [...] she said, [...] "and he gave it a pailful of mush. The pig at the whole pailful, and then the Irishman put the pig IN the pail, and it didn't fill {{more than half the}} pail. Now, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> when it held a whole pailful of mush?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{bell rang}} sharply, and away hurried Alice, leaving her {{daughter}} with a miserably sore and impatient heart, and {{the consciousness of}} having harshly wounded the mother whom she had meant to protect. And there was no hugging and kissing {{to make up for}} it possible. They would not meet till dinner-time, and Nuttie's mood of stormy repentance had cooled before that time into longing to be more tender than usual towards her mother, but <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> possible during the awful household ceremony of many courses, with three solemn men-servants ministering to them? ...|$|E
6000|$|On the 18th of July, Wolfe made a reconnoitring {{expedition}} up the river, {{with two}} armed sloops, and two transports with troops. He passed Quebec unharmed, and carefully noted the shores above it. Rugged cliffs rose {{almost from the}} water's edge. Above them, he was told, was an extent of level ground, called the Plains of Abraham, by which the upper town might be approached on its weakest side; but <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> plain to be attained, when the cliffs, for the most part, were inaccessible, and every practicable place fortified? ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> The Catechism, I think, {{will tell}} us. The Doxology, {{at the end}} of the Lord's Prayer, will tell us, if we {{consider}} it.|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN: <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Les distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles {{again in}} his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object fills.) That fell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I!" [...] {{replied the}} cavalier, [...] "I, who never saw Mistress Alice {{in my life}} till to-night, and then only for an instant--zooks, man, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> possible?" ...|$|R
60|$|Are {{these details}} insipid? Look back, good friend, {{at your own}} youth, and ask <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> I {{like to think of}} a well-nurtured boy, brave and gentle, warm-hearted and loving, and looking the world in the face with kind honest eyes. What bright colours it wore then, and how you enjoyed it! A man has not many years of such time. He does not know them whilst they are with him. It is only when they are passed long away that he remembers how dear and happy they were.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{looked away}} into the night with white, {{stricken}} face, and cursed his father's weakness. Supposing that this priest had discovered that his conscience would not allow him to keep the secret! What more likely! Why else was he here,--why else did he disclaim the confessional? There was only one other alternative! Perhaps he desired to trade upon his secret. Yet <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> possible? Of what use could money be to him? What could he gain by it? Besides, his was not {{the face of an}} adventurer.|$|E
6000|$|Linda {{was well}} aware now that her aunt knew it all, and was aware also that Steinmarc had been the informer. No idea of denying {{the truth of the}} story or of concealing anything, crossed her mind for a moment. She was quite {{prepared}} to tell everything now, feeling no doubt but that everything had been told. There was no longer a hope that she should recover her aunt's affectionate good-will. But in what words was she to tell her tale? That was now her immediate difficulty. Her aunt was standing before her, hard, stern, and cruel, expecting an answer to her question. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> answer to be made {{on the spur of the}} moment? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hippopotamus!" [...] {{he shouted}} to an {{elevated}} road pillar. [...] "Well, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for a bum guess? Why, blast my skylights! I {{know what he}} was driving at now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. A strange {{order it}} was! Broiled mushrooms, pancakes with maple syrup and ice cream. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for a mix-up--and at dinner time, too!" [...] said the clerk, disgustedly.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> careful hermit did {{his best}} With many kinds of {{medicines}} meet to tame The poisonous humour that did most infest Their reakling wounds, and every day them duly dressed.|$|R
60|$|In {{her mind}} she was {{contrasting}} this supercilious, vacillating weakling with the stern, strong man who lode yonder. A sigh fluttered across her lips. Had things but been different. Had Ombreval been the Revolutionist and La Boulaye the Vicomte, {{how much better}} pleased might she not have been. But since it was not so, why sigh? It was not {{as if she had}} loved this La Boulaye. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> possible? Was he not of the canaille, basely born, and a Revolutionist--the enemy of her order--in addition? It were a madness to even dream of the possibility of such a thing, for Suzanne de Bellecour came of too proud a stock, and knew too well the respect that was due to it.|$|E
60|$|She {{went up to}} {{her room}} and began to dress for dinner. Which of her frocks did he like best? The pale, low-cut amber, or that white, soft one, with the coffee-dipped lace? She decided on the latter. Scrutinizing her supple, slender image in the glass, a shudder went through her. That would all go; she would be like those women taking careful {{exercise}} in the streets, who made her wonder at their hardihood in showing themselves. It wasn't fair that one must become unsightly, offensive to the eye, in order to bring life into the world. Some women seemed proud to be like that. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> possible? She would never dare to show herself in the days coming.|$|E
6000|$|Here on the Adriatic side {{there were}} {{political}} entanglements that by comparison made our western after-the-war problems plain sailing. He talked {{of the game}} of spellicans among the Balkan nationalities. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> difficulty to be met? In Macedonia there were Turkish villages that were Christian and Bulgarians that were Moslem. There were families that changed the termination of their names from ski to off as Serbian or Bulgarian prevailed. I remarked that that showed a certain passion for peace, and {{that much of the}} mischief might be due to the propaganda of the great Powers. I have a prejudice against that blessed Whig [...] "principle of nationality," [...] but the King of Italy was not to be drawn into any statement about that. He left the question with his admission of its extreme complexity.|$|E
5000|$|We {{want the}} {{intellectual}} worker {{to become a}} more definitely organised factor in the human scheme. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> factor to <b>be</b> organised? Is there any way of implementing knowledge for ready and universal effect? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>was</b> asking <b>how</b> it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I came to {{be among}} his party; and when I {{explained}} <b>how</b> it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I left my place, he seemed perfectly satisfied; so I don't expect I shall hear anything more about it." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> wave made? Let us think. Perhaps in many ways. But {{two of them}} I {{will tell}} you as simply as I can, because they seem the most likely, and {{probably}} the most common.|$|R
