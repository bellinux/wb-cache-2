The poster, that depicted Vijay holding a cigar in <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>was</b> criticised by social activists for violating the Indian Tobacco Act, which prohibits advertising tobacco products. Murugadoss explained {{that it was only}} for promotional purposes and added that the film had no such scenes, claiming that even a small sequence featuring Vijay smoking had been deleted from the film.|$|E

25|$|This {{tour was}} a {{particularly}} tough one for the West Indies, where they struggled in most departments, however the fielding continued to improve {{under the guidance of}} Fountain. It was during this tour that Fountain had to put his money where <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> when, due to a large number of injuries, he had to take to the field as West Indies Substitute Fielder (12th Man) during the Prime Minister's Xl fixture at the Manuka Oval, Canberra. He rose to the challenge by running out Anthony McGuire with a direct hit from the boundary. He was also required as Substitute Fielder (12th Man) against Australia 'A' in Hobart, Tasmania.|$|E

25|$|Half-Wits Holiday (released 1947) {{would be}} Curly's final {{appearance}} {{as an official}} member of the Stooges. During filming on May 6, 1946, Curly suffered a severe stroke while sitting in director Jules White's chair, waiting to film the last scene of the day. When Curly was called by the assistant director to take the stage, he did not answer. Moe went looking for his brother: he found Curly with his head dropped to his chest. Moe later recalled that <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> distorted and {{he was unable to}} speak, only cry. Moe quietly alerted White to all this, leading the latter to rework the scene quickly, dividing the action between Moe and Larry while Curly was rushed to the hospital, where Moe joined him after the filming. Curly spent several weeks at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California before returning home for further recuperation.|$|E
500|$|During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was {{regarded}} as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, [...] "I am not a role model." [...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies. They're there long before I open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, the hint of a smile that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first going {{to be involved in the}} editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. [...] "Toxic" [...] is Spears's most expensive music video to date, at a cost of $1 million.|$|E

500|$|Reasonable Doubt {{has often}} been {{considered}} by many fans to be Jay-Z's best record. He himself deemed it his best. According to Birchmeier, it differed from his subsequent albums by lacking [...] "pop-crossover" [...] songs and hits. Shaheem Reid of MTV explained, [...] "Reasonable Doubt might not have the radio hits or club bangers {{of many of his}} other albums, but it may be Jay at his most lyrical—and certainly at his most honest, according to him". Huey said the lyrical appeal lied within Jay-Z's [...] "effortless, unaffected cool" [...] flow, [...] "disarming honesty", and knack for [...] "writing some of the most acrobatic rhymes heard in quite some time". According to Huey, this [...] "helped Reasonable Doubt rank as one of the finest albums of New York's hip-hop renaissance of the '90s". Birchmeier, on the other hand, believed the superior quality of producers was more responsible for the album's reputation as a classic more so than Jay-Z. In a retrospective review for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the album was [...] "designed for the hip-hop cognoscenti and street aesthetes who still swear he never topped it," [...] finding it [...] "richer than any outsider could have known, and benefiting from everything we've since learned about the minor crack baron who put his money where <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was.</b> You can hear him marshalling a discipline known to few rappers and many crack barons, and that asceticism undercuts the intrinsic delight of his rhymes".|$|E
2500|$|Baird {{set up the}} Baird Television Development Company Ltd, {{which in}} 1928 made the first transatlantic {{television}} transmission, from London to Hartsdale, New York, and the first television programme for the BBC.

2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the door to my left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. <b>His</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>was</b> twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E
