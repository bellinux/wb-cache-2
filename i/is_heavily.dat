5|$|Musically, DecembeRadio <b>is</b> <b>heavily</b> {{influenced}} by hard rock and blues-rock from the 1970s, owing to early exposure to family members' record collections. Their sound {{has been compared}} to that of Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, The Black Crowes and Lenny Kravitz, among others.|$|E

It is bounded by the Irish Sea to the north, the Welsh {{counties}} of Gwynedd {{to the west and}} Powys to the south, and the English counties of Shropshire and Cheshire to the southeast and east respectively; much of the eastern boundary follows the course of the River Dee and its estuary. Other large rivers in the county include the River Alyn, a tributary of the Dee, the River Clwyd and the River Conwy in the west. The northern coastal strip of the county <b>is</b> <b>heavily</b> developed for tourism and has many resorts, including Llandudno, Colwyn Bay, Colwyn, Abergele, Rhyl and Prestatyn.

5|$|Agriculture in Wales <b>is</b> <b>heavily</b> subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy with farmers getting annual {{payments}} {{for the area}} they farm. A new scheme was announced in 2014; after a transitional period lasting until 2019, lowland farms will receive almost £200 per hectare while farms in disadvantaged areas will receive £166. The total payment for Wales between 2014 and 2020 will be £1,870 million, but some of this (15%) {{will be used for}} rural development projects.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, 3487 {{locations}} of rock art {{had been discovered}} in Cundinamarca alone, of which 301 on the Bogotá savanna. Other locations have been found over the years.

5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui <b>is</b> <b>heavily</b> mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island <b>is</b> <b>heavily</b> vegetated, {{and most}} islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation is consistent across the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E
