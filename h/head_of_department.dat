The {{research}} study departs from the, angle that <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> occupy an important {{position at the}} interface of management and delivery of education. Their functions range from teaching to managing the school's departments in a diligent way. It was assumed that failure for <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> {{to be part of}} the leadership in the school and at the same time manage their department and engage in teaching duties would result in a school becoming dysfunctional. A literature study was conducted to explore the leadership and management functions <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> and to investigate the specific challenges facing <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> in technical high schools. The empirical research consisted of a questionnaire survey to determine the views <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> on their management and leadership functions and the challenges they experience in executing their tasks. It involved 75 <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> in 13 Technical High School in the North West Province. The major findings of the {{research study}} reveal that <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> experience challenges with a heavy workload, find it difficult to strike a balance between teaching duties and management duties and also face challenges in executing their functions even if a job description exists. It was also revealed that respondents strongly agree with the African cultural perspective concerning the ideal leadership characteristics <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department.</b> Generally the study indicated that <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> require training aimed at meeting the specific needs of middle managers.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> in Singapore cluster secondary schools {{against the backdrop of}} a major educational reform in the Singapore education system, namely, the implementation of the School Cluster system in 1997, and a host of new initiatives including self-appraisal of schools and performance appraisal in the education service. <b>Heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> in a school cluster participated in a questionnaire survey, and the findings were triangulated with data from interviews as well as documentary analysis. The study found that external educational policy changes such as the School Cluster system have transformed the management of schools with the formation of administrative school clusters and expanded the scope of the middle managers' role with the creation of a collaborative cluster role for <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> department; and changing expectations in the internal appraisal of schools and the performance management of education officers have resulted in increasing emphasis on the leadership role <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department.</b> However, the increasing demands and expectations on the role <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> have not been matched with a corresponding increase of time and adequate training and professional development for <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> to effectively carry out their role. The study has incorporated the findings within the unique internal and external contexts in which <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> operate to propose a Singapore model of the role <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> in cluster secondary schools. The model which has used contingency theory in explaining the work that <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> do and built its components on the impact of recent policy changes in the Singapore Education Service provides a snapshot of the scope and complexity <b>of</b> the <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department's</b> role and its key determinants...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: One general {{practice}} has offered preregistration rotations in {{general practice}} since 1981. Although popular with doctors {{who participate in}} the scheme, and considered a success by the associated teaching hospital, it remains the only established general practice rotation in the United Kingdom. AIM: A study was undertaken to assess the degree of interest in preregistration rotations in general practice expressed by medical school deans and <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments</b> <b>of</b> general practice. METHOD: A questionnaire was sent to all 26 deans of medical schools and all 25 <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments</b> <b>of</b> general practice of teaching hospitals in the UK that undertook clinical training. RESULTS: A total of 24 deans (92 %) and 24 <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments</b> <b>of</b> general practice (96 %) replied to the questionnaire. The scheme {{was thought to be}} of value by 58 % of deans and 79 % <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments</b> <b>of</b> general practice. Half of the teaching hospitals thought that they might consider such a rotation in the next 3 - 5 years. The most frequently cited problem initiating such a scheme was financial. CONCLUSION: Given the current interest in medical teaching in the community, preregistration rotations in general practice deserve more attention...|$|R

40|$|Undertaken from a {{distributed}} leadership theory perspective, this {{qualitative study}} attempts to gain understanding regarding how <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> develop educators within the organisational context of different schools and departments. A Based on existing literature, a detailed discussion is provided on what professional development is, the conditions needed for effective professional development, professional development strategies, distributed leadership {{theory and the}} functioning <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> and subject departments within the current policy framework for professional development in South African Schools. Two fee-paying and two non-fee-paying schools were selected and {{interviews were conducted with}} <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>department</b> from single subject (unitary) and multi-subject (federal or confederate) departments in each school. The data was transcribed, coded, inductively analysed and related to the research question(s). A full description and analysis of the data is provided.
