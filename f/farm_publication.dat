40|$|This NebGuide {{disputes}} previous {{reports that}} corn yields are reduced after black layer if harvest is delayed. An October 1995 article {{in a national}} <b>farm</b> <b>publication</b> reported that corn dry matter decreased 1 percent for every percent loss in rain moisture as corn dried in the field after black layer (physiological maturity). The dry matter loss reportedly was hybrid specific and possibly due to seed respiration. This observation was based on research conducted at Purdue University with three hybrids over four years. All hybrids tested had significant dry matter losses {{in three of the}} four years. A report of similar observations from farmers and agronomists appeared in 1984 in a regional farm magazine. Many farmers have also documented yield losses associated with delayed harvest. If large dry matter losses occur during field dry down, it may be more cost effective to dry grain with artificial heat [...] Several researchers have investigated kernel weight and/or yields after black layer. In most of the studies no changes in kernel dry weight were observed following black layer; however, in one report, four of 18 hybrids and five of 42 hybrids studied had changes in kernel dry matter as corn dried from 35 percent to about 15 percent grain moisture. Of the hybrids with dry matter changes after black layer, some had increased dry matter and some had decreased dry matter. These dry matter changes however, were not consistent over years [...] Seed respiration is cited as a possible cause for the reported large dry matter losses following black layer. Respiration rates are greatest when grain moisture is near 50 percent and decreases to a minimal level as grain dries to 15. 5 percent. These dry matter losses increase with greater temperatures and with greater mechanical damage to kernels. But, with good kernel quality and typical fall temperatures in the corn belt (average daily temperatures ranging between 50 °F and 65 °F), it would take an estimated 25 to 50 days for 1 percent dry matter loss to occur from respiration. This is far less than the 1 percent dry matter loss reported for every percent moisture loss after black layer...|$|E

Lead articles from 1976 and 1996 issues of Farmlife are taken as the research focus to determine how representations have altered in line with restructuring of the agricultural industry. Reference is made to Connell's (1987) notions of hegemonic masculinity and emphasised femininity to inform the analysis {{about the ways in which}} these gender identities are (re) produced through the British farming media. A simple typology is derived from the articles which assists in revealing a remarkable degree of consistency in the portrayal of gender identities over time. The findings augment evidence from international research suggesting that dominant gender identities within agriculture are being perpetuated through the farming media. The implications of this are highlighted and suggestions made for research with the consumers of these media products...|$|R

50|$|The {{establishment}} of the station caused a political controversy that was widely reported on in the Toronto and Guelph daily newspapers, and <b>farm</b> <b>publications</b> in Ontario. On 28 February 1941 the Premier of Ontario, Mr. Mitchell Hepburn, announced the gift of OAC {{to the federal government}} for the war effort. The City of Guelph, many farm groups, and others opposed this gift. These people did not want the Ontario Agriculture College closed down, and Mr. George Drew, the leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, took up their cause. A debate ensued and on 7 March 1941 the legislature voted for a compromise that would keep the OAC open for classes while permitting the RCAF to use the campus for No. 4 Wireless School. The RCAF would get the dormitories and instructors it wanted and the OAC and OVC could continue, although their students would have to live off-campus. Classes at the Macdonald Institute were completely cancelled. It was left to the people of Guelph to make this compromise work.|$|R
