25|$|For speech perception, {{the model}} starts with an {{external}} acoustic signal (e.g. produced by an <b>external</b> <b>speaker).</b> This signal is preprocessed, passes the auditory map, {{and leads to}} an activation pattern for each syllable or word {{on the level of}} the auditory-phonetic processing module (ES: external signal, see Fig. 5). The ventral path of speech perception (see Hickok and Poeppel 2007) would directly activate a lexical item, but is not implemented in ACT. Rather, in ACT the activation of a phonemic state occurs via the phonemic map and thus may lead to a coactivation of motor representations for that speech item (i.e. dorsal pathway of speech perception; ibid.).|$|E
2500|$|The {{two common}} guitar {{amplifier}} configurations are: a combination ("combo") amplifier that includes an amplifier {{and one or}} more speakers in a single cabinet, and a standalone amplifier (often called a [...] "head" [...] or [...] "amp head"), which passes the amplified signal via a speaker cable {{to one or more}} <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> cabinets. A wide range of speaker configurations are available in guitar cabinets—from cabinets with a single speaker (e.g., 1×10" [...] or 1×12") or multiple speakers (e.g., 2×10", 4×10" [...] or 8x10").|$|E
2500|$|Noting Taylor's {{loyalty to}} the same Peavey bass guitar onstage with Duran Duran for several years, in early 2006, Peavey Guitars asked Taylor to create a {{signature}} 4-string bass guitar. With his design partner Patty Palazzo, and designer Ted McCann, Taylor created the limited-edition [...] "Peavey Liberator JT-84", which featured a detachable amplifier built into a custom-built case. The amp could be expanded into an <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> or amplifier to increase volume and flexibility. Taylor designed a six-string guitar, the [...] "Peavey Liberator A435" [...] (named after the main road that led from his childhood home into the city of Birmingham). Only 100 each of the numbered-and-signed basses and guitars were {{made available to the}} public, in October 2006.|$|E

2500|$|More {{expensive}} amplifiers {{may have}} a patch bay for multiple inputs and outputs, such as a pre-amp out (for sending to another guitar amplifier), a second low gain input, to use with active basses, an in jack to create an effects loop (when used with the pre-amp out jack), an <b>external</b> <b>speaker</b> output (for powering an additional speaker cabinet), and stereo RCA jacks or an 1/8" [...] jack, for connecting a CD player or MP3 player so that a player can practice along with recorded music. Some amps have a 1/4" [...] jack for connecting a pedal to turn the amp's onboard overdrive and reverb on and off or to switch between channels. Some amps have an XLR jack for a microphone, either for the guitar amp {{to be used for}} singing (in effect as a mini-PA system, or, for acoustic guitar, to mix a mic signal with a pickup signal.|$|E
