The global anti-dyslipidemic market grew by 19 % from 2000 to 2001, {{achieving}} {{sales of}} over $ 21 billion (Smith, 2004 : 2). This market is currently well sewed {{by a number}} of effective and well-tolerated treatments. Lipid-lowering drugs are considered as the first choice drugs in control of dyslipidemias and they are well tolerated by most patients. As with many drug therapies, there should be a balance between the benefits of cholesterol lowering agents, increased medication cost and the overall risk of adverse drug reactions. According to Ballesteros (2001 : 514), <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> are consumed on a large scale and most consumers are elderly. This warrants a study of expenditure incurred because of inadequate prescribing of these agents. The general objective {{of this study was to}} determine the utilisation and cost of <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> in the private health care environment in South Africa. A quantitative retrospective drug utilisation review was performed using a medicine claims database. Data for twenty-four consecutive months (May 1, 2001 to April 30, 2003) were used to determine and compare the utilisation patterns and cost of drugs associated with the management of dyslipidemia a year before (1 st May 2001 to 30 April 2002) and a year after (1 st May 2002 to 30 April 2003) the implementation of a medicine reference price system (MPL). Data analysis was done by calculating the average value, the standard deviation, effect size, and cost-prevalence indices. The results of this study revealed that <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> constituted 2. 70 % (n = 21820911) and 2. 78 % (n = 27277825) of the total number of all medicine items for the first and the second study years respectively. On the other hand, the total cost of all <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> accounted for 6. 33 % (n= R 3 097 604 602) and 6. 23 % (n= R 4 053 280 295) of the total cost of all medicine items claimed during the first and the second study years respectively. The prevalence of generic <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> accounted for 0. 89 % (n= 589036) and 4. 88 % (n= 759675) of the total number of <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> claimed during the first and second study year respectively. Innovator drugs, on the other hand, constituted 99. 1 1 % (n= 589036) and 95. 11 % (n= 759675) of the total number of <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> claimed during the first and second study years respectively. It was found that R 23 694. 5 and R 603 277. 36 could have been saved for generic bezafibrate and generic simvastatin respectively if they had been sold at ME'L prices. The total cost of generic <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> accounted for 0. 60 % and 2. 94 %. The total cost of innovator <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> accounted for 99. 40 % and 97. 06 % of the total cost of <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> claimed during the first (n=R 196 076 050) and second (n=R 252 919 285) study year respectively. With respect to the prescribed daily dose, it was found that most prescriptions for individual <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> did not conform to the defined daily dose. It was, however, found that most prescriptions whose prescribed daily dose was for one tablet once daily and whose strength was similar to the defined daily dose conformed to the defined daily dose. The conclusion is that there was an insignificant difference in both the prevalence and cost of <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> a year before and after the implementation of MPL. It was further concluded that increased utilisation of generic hypolipidemic medicine items a year after the implementation of the MPL, could have been brought about by the introduction of generic simvastatin into the market as opposed to the implementation of the MPL.

In localization studies using laser-scanning microscopy, we show that L-FABP and PPARα colocalize in the nucleus of mouse primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by pull-down assay and immunocoprecipitation that L-FABP interacts directly with PPARα. In a cell biological approach {{with the aid of}} a mammalian two-hybrid system, we provide evidence that L-FABP interacts with PPARα and PPARγ but not with PPARβ and retinoid X receptor-α by protein–protein contacts.

The subject of the present thesis was to investigate the effect of selected, frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs (amlodipine, metoprolol), and <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> (ezetimibe, atorvastatin) on bone metabolism in healthy male Wistar albino rats and in rats after orchidectomy (Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats). During my postgradual study, three experiments in rats with above mentioned drugs were performed. In the first experiment, drugs [...] ...|$|R

Whereas millimolar drug concentrations are required to affect de novo lecithin synthesis catalyzed by ChoPTase, reacylation of lysolecithin by LLAcylTase is inhibited at micromolar levels. Increasing effectiveness in ChoPTase inhibition is observed in the series CPIB, SaH- 42 - 348, tibric acid, S- 321328, WY- 14643, S- 8527, and DH- 990, with IC 50 ranging from 22 mM (CPIB) to 0. 3 mM (DH- 990). LLAcylTase inhibition by the <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> follows the same general pattern, but IC 50 concentrations range from 9 mM (CPIB) to 40 microM (DH- 990). The agents inhibit ChoPTase (Ki, 25 - 0. 25 mM) and LLAcylTase (Ki, 10 - 0. 025 mM) noncompetitively. The data suggest that inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis, particularly by the LLAcylTase pathway, {{may be related to}} a drug's effectiveness in decreasing serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels by blocking lipoprotein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} systematically (i) the appropriate dietary conditions to induce {{the features of}} the MetS in APOE* 3 Leiden. humanCholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (E 3 L. CETP) mice and (ii) whether the response of this model to different antidiabetic and <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> is similar as in humans. Methods: Male obese, IR and dyslipidemic E 3 L. CETP mice were treated with antidiabetic drugs rosiglitazone, liraglutide or an experimental 11 β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase- 1 (HSD- 1) inhibitor, or with <b>hypolipidemic</b> <b>drugs</b> atorvastatin, fenofibrate or niacin for 4 - 6 weeks. The effects on bw, IR and plasma and liver lipids were assessed. Results: Rosiglitazone, liraglutide and HSD- 1 inhibitor significantly decreased glucose and insulin levels or IR. Liraglutide and HSD- 1 inhibitor also decreased bw. Atorvastatin, fenofibrate and niacin improved the dyslipidemia and fenofibrate and niacin increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In addition, hepatic triglycerides were significantly decreased by treatment with rosiglitazone and liraglutide, while hepatic cholesterol esters were significantly decreased by rosiglitazone and atorvastatin. Conclusions: We conclude that the E 3 L. CETP mouse is a promising novel translational model to investigate the effects of new drugs, alone or in combination, that affect IR, diabetic dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
