5|$|This violent {{collision}} formed {{most of the}} galaxy's (metal-rich) <b>galactic</b> <b>halo</b> {{and extended}} disk. During this epoch, star formation {{would have been very}} high, to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy had a very close passage 2–4 billion years ago. This event produced high levels of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk– even some globular clusters– and disturbed M33's outer disk.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity <b>galactic</b> <b>halo</b> and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E

It is shown that the <b>galactic</b> <b>halos</b> in the f(R) gravity model tend to acquire significantly higher specific angular momentum {{than those in the}} standard ΛCDM model. The largest difference in the specific angular momentum distribution between these two models occurs for the case of isolated <b>galactic</b> <b>halos</b> with mass less than 1011 h – 1 M ☉, which are likely least shielded by the chameleon screening mechanism. As the specific angular momentum of <b>galactic</b> <b>halos</b> is rather insensitive to other cosmological parameters, it can in principle be an independent discriminator of modified gravity. We speculate a possibility of using the relative abundance of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) as a test of general relativity given that the formation of the LSBGs occurs in fast spinning dark halos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{amplification}} {{caused by}} gravitational light bending by compact objects in a foreground galaxy {{can affect the}} apparent number density of background QSOs, {{as well as their}} distribution in the fields of <b>galactic</b> <b>halos.</b> In this work we investigate the distribution of QSOs in the fields of <b>galactic</b> <b>halos</b> caused by point mass lensing effect and singular isothermal lensing effect, and apply the microlensing effect due to dark compact objects in the halo to NGC 3628. NGC 3628 is a well-studied nearby edge-on Sbc peculiar galaxy, where QSOs are shown to be concentrated around the galaxy with a density much higher than background. We find that the statistics of the distribution of QSOs in the fields of <b>galactic</b> <b>halos</b> of nearby galaxies can be used to probe the nature of dark matter, and we also show that the dark matter mass may be one to two orders of magnitudes higher that inferred previously from the measured rotation curve in NGC 3628.

5|$|The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 {{reported}} that observations {{of four of}} the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—R and S Microscopii—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, {{and the other two}} U and RY Microscopii are more difficult still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the <b>galactic</b> <b>halo</b> of the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic {{habitable}} zone {{was further}} developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the <b>galactic</b> <b>halo</b> would lack the heavier elements required to produce habitable terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} the galactic habitable zone. Being too close to the galactic center, however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the galactic bulge.|$|E

It is shown that when the total number of particles in a DACHO exceeds a threshold value, the total attractive potential acting on the particles exceeds their total mass-energy, causing the bound state to acquire a negative mass.

We consider the SZ distortion from the hot gas in those <b>galactic</b> <b>haloes</b> in which the gas cooling time is longer than the halo destruction time-scale. We show that the SZ distortion signal from the hot gas in these <b>galactic</b> <b>haloes</b> at redshifts z ≈ 1 – 8 can be significant at small angular scales (ℓ ∼ 104), and dominate over the signal from galaxy clusters. The estimated SZ signal for most massive galaxies (halo mass ≥ 1012. 5 M⊙) is consistent with the marginal detection by Planck at these mass scales. We also consider the SZ effect from warm circumgalactic gas. The integrated Compton distortion from the warm O vi absorbing gas is estimated to be y ∼ 10 − 8, which could potentially be detected by experiments planned for the near future. Finally, we study the detectability of the SZ signal from circumgalactic gas in two types of surveys, a simple extension of the South Pole Telescope survey and a more futuristic cosmic-variance-limited survey. We find that these surveys can easily detect the kinetic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich signal from CGM. With the help of a Fisher matrix analysis, we find that it will be possible for these surveys to constrain the gas fraction in CGM, after marginalizing over cosmological parameters, to ≤ 33 per cent, in case of no redshift evolution of the gas fraction...|$|R
