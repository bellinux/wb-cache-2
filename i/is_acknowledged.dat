5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to a mediocre commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> in Argentine historiography as an {{important}} battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory did nothing to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that these characteristics are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, as the {{precursor}} extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale {{and later a}} storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60mph (60 to 95km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing {{to the south of}} the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well.|$|E

One 2006 study concludes that the Microsporidia are a sister group to the true fungi; that is, they are each other's closest evolutionary relative. Hibbett and colleagues suggest that this analysis does not clash with their classification of the Fungi, and although the Microsporidia are elevated to phylum status, it <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> that further analysis is required to clarify evolutionary relationships within this group.|$|E
5|$|The {{name of the}} warship {{that served}} the Confederacy in the Battle of Hampton Roads has been a {{continuing}} source of confusion and some contention. She was originally a screw frigate in the United States Navy carrying the name USS Merrimack. All parties continued to use the name after her capture by secessionists while she was being rebuilt as an ironclad. When her conversion was almost complete, her name was officially changed to Virginia. Despite the official name change, Union accounts persisted in calling Merrimack by her original name, while Confederate sources used either Virginia or Merrimac(k). The alliteration of Monitor and Merrimack has persuaded most popular accounts to adopt the familiar name, even when it <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> to be technically incorrect.|$|E

5|$|As {{the son of}} {{the filmmaker}} Rakesh, Roshan faced the media {{spotlight}} from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry.

He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's reign {{is known}} as the Elizabethan era. The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the {{seafaring}} prowess of English adventurers such as Francis Drake. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. Such was the case with Elizabeth's rival, Mary, Queen of Scots, whom she imprisoned in 1568 and had executed in 1587. After the short reigns of Elizabeth's half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.|$|E

5|$|Hata's major {{contribution}} to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ("The Nanking Incident"), published in 1986, {{which is a}} detailed study of the event based on Japanese, Chinese, and English sources that was later noted by historians such as Daqing Yang {{to be one of}} the few impartial works of scholarship written on the massacre during the period. The book is known for its relatively low estimate of the death toll, which Hata put at up to 40,000 because he based the number of civilian killing on the work of Lewis S.C. Smythe who conducted survey of massacre in the immediate aftermass (War Damage in Nanking Area, Dec.1937 to March 1938, Urban and Rural Surveys) and also exclude Chinese soldiers. Hata's book <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> as the first to discuss what might have caused the massacre, whereas previous books had focused only on the event itself. Hata argued that the Japanese Army's lack of military police and facilities to detain POWs, its ignorance of international laws, and the Chinese General Tang Shengzhi's decision to flee the city without formally surrendering, which left large number of plain-clothes soldiers within the civilian population which was followed by excessive mopping-up operations by the Japanese, among the factors which led to the slaughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing process}} for Pleasant Dreams began in January 1981. With Sire Records {{management}} being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing alcohol problems, resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing <b>is</b> <b>acknowledged</b> this way.|$|E
