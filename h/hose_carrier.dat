5000|$|Bun Rab: An {{enthusiastic}} white rabbit with a {{drum and}} drum-major hat who often accompanies P. T. Bridgeport and likes to broadcast {{news in the}} manner of a town crier. He lives in a grandfather clock, and frequently appears as a fireman in the swamp's clownish Fire Brigade â€” where he serves as official <b>hose</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hose</b> <b>carriers,</b> the Schlauchwagen (SW). Typically large {{trucks with}} {{a supply of}} rolled or folded and pre-coupled hoses (usually 1000 m or 2000 m), in case longer {{distances}} have to be bridged.|$|R
50|$|Stemco {{was founded}} on March 1, 1951, by Ben Cook and Tom Davidson in St. Charles, MO, and {{originally}} manufactured mufflers and oil reservoirs for commercial trucks. The company moved to Longview, TX, in 1958 to expand the company and began manufacturing new truck parts, including dual wheel adapters, hub <b>hose</b> <b>carriers,</b> drum check gauges and exhaust accessories. This move led {{to an increase in}} production and employee growth. In 1964, Stemco was purchased by Garlock Inc, an industrial sealing company.|$|R
50|$|Roller {{chain and}} sprockets, toothed belts and pulleys, <b>hose</b> and cable <b>carrier</b> systems, shaft coupling/locking, reducer/variable speed drives, motion control/clutch, {{overload}} protectors, linear actuators, automotive timing belt systems, conveyance, sorting, and storage systems, bulk handling systems, metalworking chips handling and coolant processing systems.|$|R
5000|$|Fluid {{velocity}} and resistance of metals : As with water <b>hoses,</b> the <b>carrier</b> drift velocity in conductors is {{directly proportional to}} current. However, water only experiences drag via the pipes' inner surface, while charges are slowed at all points within a metal, as with water forced through a filter. Also, typical velocity of charge carriers within a conductor is less than centimeters per minute, and the [...] "electrical friction" [...] is extremely high. If charges ever flowed as fast as water can flow in pipes, the electric current would be immense, and the conductors would become incandescently hot and perhaps vaporize. To model the resistance and the charge-velocity of metals, perhaps a pipe packed with sponge, or a narrow straw filled with syrup, {{would be a better}} analogy than a large-diameter water pipe. Resistance in most electrical conductors is a linear function: as current increases, voltage drop increases proportionally (Ohm's Law). Liquid resistance in pipes is not linear with volume, varying as the square of volumetric flow (see Darcy-Weisbach equation).|$|R
