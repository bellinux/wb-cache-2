50|$|Upon {{completing}} a judicial clerkship, a <b>law</b> <b>clerk</b> often becomes very marketable to elite law firms. However, some <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> decide they enjoy the position {{so much they}} continue to serve the judge as a <b>law</b> <b>clerk</b> in a permanent capacity.|$|R
40|$|In Switzerland, <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> hold an {{important}} position, {{which is a}} particularity of the Swiss judicial system. <b>Law</b> <b>clerks</b> have {{a wide range of}} tasks. For instance, they are involved in the instruction of the cases, {{as well as in the}} decision-making process. The number of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> is continuously increasing, which is namely due to the growing caseload. Nowadays, at many courts in Switzerland there are more <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> than judges. The result of this development is that judges have a different role than in the past. Despite the crucial role of <b>law</b> <b>clerks,</b> science has paid little attention to their function. This article aims to describe the important role of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> from a legal point of view. It also enumerates concerns connected to the position of <b>law</b> <b>clerks.</b> Methodologically, the paper is based on a document analysis and on the results of a quantitative survey. Specifically, the article will discuss the following question: Is the Swiss legal system – where <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> are key-players – a reasonable solution in order to cope with the increasing caseload in an efficient way? The paper is divided into six parts: 1. Introduction 2. The Swiss judicial system 3. Definition and function of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> 4. Development and legal issues 5. Performance targets for <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> 6. Conclusion and research need...|$|R

5000|$|In Pakistan, law clerkship {{programmes}} {{have been}} introduced {{in the past few}} years to assist the Judges of the Superior Courts. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has an extremely competitive, semi-formal process in place for the appointment of <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> (research associates). The senior most professors and heads of faculty of the country’s most prestigious law colleges are invited to nominate their best students from the graduating class or recent graduates who they deem qualified to serve at the apex court. In recent years, nominations have also been sought from foreign law schools as well as judges of the high courts to nominate bright young lawyers. Nominees are then formally invited by the Supreme Court to make a formal application. The best applications are then selected for a written exam followed by an interview conducted by a panel of senior judges and <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> of the court. [...] There is no fixed number of positions that may be offered any given year. Only candidates who are deemed to be sufficiently qualified and talented are offered a position subject to the number of judges desirous of having a <b>law</b> <b>clerk</b> (research associate) appointed to assist them. This strict selection process is partly why many judges do not have <b>law</b> <b>clerks.</b> In recent years, all <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> appointed have been licensed advocates placed at the top of their class with excellent research credentials. Currently, most of the senior judges of the Supreme Court are assisted by <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> (research associates). The <b>law</b> <b>clerk</b> to the presiding judge of a bench sits in court during hearings. In chambers, he or she assists a judge in making determinations of law, conducting research and preparing briefs etc. <b>Law</b> <b>clerks</b> serve as paid staff of the court for an extendable one-year term.|$|R

50|$|Former federal <b>law</b> <b>clerks</b> {{are often}} highly sought after by large law firms.
