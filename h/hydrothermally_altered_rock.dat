The Colorado Mineral Belt, a northeast-trending zone of historical base- and precious-metal mining, cuts diagonally across the study area. The investigation was intended {{to test the hypothesis}} that degraded water and sediment quality are restricted to catchments in which historical mining has occurred. Water, streambed sediment, and aquatic insects were collected from (1) catchments underlain by single lithogeochemical units, some of which were hydrothermally altered, that had not been prospected or mined; (2) catchments that contained evidence of prospecting, most of which contain <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock,</b> but no historical mining; and (3) catchments, all of which contain <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock,</b> where historical but now inactive mines occur.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the factors affecting arsenic (As) mobility from <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> under in-situ conditions. Four impoundments were built on site with rectangular base, truncated-pyramid structures. Impoundment 1 was composed solely of the <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> while impoundments 2, 3 and 4 {{were covered with}} different types of silty covering soil {{in order to minimize}} O 2 and water intrusion into the rock. The results indicate that seasonal variations in temperature, O 2 concentration and volumetric water content in the impoundments strongly influenced As leaching. When the temperature was high and the water content low, oxidation of sulfide minerals in the rock was enhanced because of a higher air-water-rock interaction. Concentration of As in the porewater increased when it rained after a specific period of dry weather. The use of a silty covering soil influenced the concentrations of As and SO_[4]^[2 -] in the porewater although it did not affect the pH and Eh significantly. In this case, O 2 and water movement might be the rate controlling step of As leaching, that is, if there is no covering soil on the impoundment, more As will leach out from the rock. The use of a silty covering soil showed promise of reducing As leaching from the waste rock, but utilizing it alone was insufficient to effectively prevent As release from the rock. A combination of covering soil and bottom As-adsorption layer to incorporate any As released from the rock is therefore recommended...|$|E

40|$|Clay {{minerals}} play {{an important}} role in the gravitational stability of man-made rock piles by affecting geotechnical and hydrological characteristics of the material. The Goathill North rock pile at the Questa Mine in northern New Mexico has been the focus of a multi-disciplinary study to determine the effect of weathering on rock pile stability and in particular to determine if clay minerals are forming in the rock pile due to surface weathering. The results of x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses indicate the clay minerals found within the fine-grained soil matrix of the rock pile are of hydrothermal origins and did not detect any neoformation of clay minerals. The foremost mechanism for an increase in clay minerals within the rock pile is the physical break down of <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> fragments to release hydrothermal clay minerals. The hydrothermal clay minerals within the rock pile show evidence of weathering by the dehydration of smectite from 2 -water to 1 -water interlayers within the clay mineral structure.

Most of As and Pb were incorporated in the residual or crystalline phase although significant amounts were also determined to be exchangeable, with carbonates and with Fe-Mn oxides. Under oxic conditions, As and Pb showed similar leaching behaviors at similar pH values, a higher mobilization in the acidic and alkaline regions and a minimum at circumneutral pH. The absence of DO restricted the oxidation of sulfide minerals that also contained significant quantities of As resulting in a lower As release under these conditions. Strongly reducing conditions favored the release of As by the reductive dissolution of Fe-Mn oxides and prevention of carbonate precipitation while the same conditions immobilized Pb because of its re-precipitation under reducing conditions.

30|$|The {{volcanic}} ash {{is characterized by}} abundant <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> fragments with different degrees of alteration and hydrothermally precipitated minerals. Juvenile material such as pumice, scoria, or glass shard was {{not found in the}} {{volcanic ash}}, whereas partly altered fragments consisting of primary igneous minerals (plagioclase, orthopyroxene, titanomagnetite, and feldspars), volcanic glass, and alteration minerals are common. Therefore, we conclude that the 2014 Ontake eruption was a non-juvenile eruption. Not all feldspars in the ash originate from fresh volcanic rock: Some were derived from the alteration zones. Plagioclase, anorthoclase, and alkali feldspar that coexist with volcanic glass in the partly altered volcanic rock fragments originate from fresh volcanic rocks, whereas K-feldspar and albite contained in the altered fragments of silica mineral–K-feldspar ± albite ± garnet ± biotite association were derived from hydrothermal alteration. Other than the remnant primary minerals, the volcanic ash contains quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, kaolin-group mineral, alunite, anhydrite, gypsum, pyrophyllite, muscovite, chlorite, K-feldspar, biotite, rutile, garnet, pyrite, and smectite. The mineral assemblage is typical of hydrothermal alteration zones in magmatic-hydrothermal systems under subduction zone volcanoes (Rye et al. 1992; Hedenquist and Lowenstern 1994). The mineral assemblages therefore indicate that the volcanic ash was derived from a subvolcanic hydrothermal system developed beneath the edifice of Ontake volcano.|$|E

40|$|Construction of tunnels in Hokkaido, Japan often excavates rocks {{containing}} substantial {{amounts of}} arsenic (As) and boron (B). When these rocks {{are exposed to the}} environment, As and B are leached out that could potentially contaminate the surrounding soil and groundwater. Natural geologic materials contain minerals like Al-/Feoxyhydroxides/oxides that have As and B adsorption capabilities. Because these materials are widespread and readily available, they could be utilized in the mitigation of As and B leached out from these sources. This paper describes the ability of three natural geologic materials (i. e., pumiceous tuffs, partly-weathered volcanic ashes and coastal marine sediments) to sequester As and B from aqueous solutions and the actual leachate of a <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock.</b> The adsorption of As fitted well with either the Langmuir or Freundlich isotherm while that of B followed the Henry-type model (linear). Among the samples, those containing substantial amorphous Al and Fe exhibited higher As adsorption. However, the distribution coefficient of B only had a moderate positive correlation with these amorphous phases. The best adsorbent among these natural geologic materials was utilized in the adsorption layer of the column experiments. Adsorption of As was more effective the thicker the adsorption layer, but this retardation was only temporary due to significant changes in the pH. In contrast, the adsorption layer only retarded the migration of B to a limited extent...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the sedimentological and mineralogical properties of a debris flow deposit west of Cayambe Volcanic Complex, an ice-clad edifice in Ecuador. The deposit exhibits a matrix facies containing up to 16 wt% of clays. However, the stratigraphic {{relationship of the}} deposit {{with respect to the}} Canguahua Formation, a widespread indurated volcaniclastic material in the Ecuadorian inter-Andean Valley, and the deposit alteration mineralogy differ depending on location. Thus, two different deposits are identified. The Rio Granobles debris flow deposit (similar to 1 km(3)) is characterised by the alteration mineral assemblage smectite + jarosite, and sulphur isotopic analyses point to a supergene hydrothermal alteration environment. This deposit probably derives from a debris avalanche initiated before 14 - 21 ka by collapse of a <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> mass from the volcano summit. In contrast, the alteration mineralogy of the second debris flow deposit, which may itself comprise more than one unit, is dominated by halloysite + smectite and relates to a shallower and more recent (3200 m) volcanic soils. Our study reinforces the significance of hydrothermal alteration in weakening volcano flanks and in favouring rapid transformation of a volcanic debris avalanche into a clay-rich debris flow. It also demonstrates that mineralogical analysis provides crucial information for resolving the origin of a debris flow deposit in volcanic terrains.

40|$|Volcanic landslides, {{including}} flank and sector collapses, {{constitute a}} major hazard {{in many parts}} of the world. While composite volcanoes are innately unstable, the presence of a hydrothermal system maintained by a magmatic source at depth is recognized as a key factor increasing the risk of failure. This relates to the formation of <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> masses within the core and upper flanks of the volcano which leads to heterogeneous distribution of rock strength properties and pore fluid pressures. Here an emphasis is placed on acid crater lakes perched high on active volcanoes. By acting as a trap for magmatic heat and gas flows, these lakes localize extreme acid attack on their surrounds, thereby creating a source of instability. We outline how acid crater lakes form in relation to magmatic hydrothermal systems hosted within composite volcanoes, and describe the associated hydrothermal alteration and its relationships to flank instability. The sustainability of a volcanic slope is partly governed by the degree of rock alteration, which in turn reflects the time-integrated flux of acidic gases (SO 2 and HCl) released from the subsurface magmatic source. Transient or longer-term changes in pore fluid pressure linked to hydrothermal system activity also readily affect the slope stability of composite volcanoes. Such fluctuations can be initiated by both magmatic and external non-magmatic processes such as major rainfall events and regional seismicity.

Initially, experiments were carried out to minimize systematic errors arising from preferred orientation of particles as well as micro-absorption. The precision of the proposed method was tested by independent replicate sample-preparation and analyses. The closeness of the replicate phase-determinations showed that random within-laboratory errors were comparatively small. Expressed as chemical compositions, the quantitative results are in good agreement with the major oxide concentrations determined by X-ray fluorescence.

Hierarchical cluster analysis led to the discrimination of several mineralogically distinct alteration-induced assemblages. These mineral assemblages are characteristic of specific zones of alteration.

Detailed comparison of the calc–silicate (zeolites and prehnite) mineral distributions of the Lopra- 1 / 1 A sequence with those from other regions indicates that this sequence exhibits consistently longer down-hole intervals for secondary mineral species than reported elsewhere. When compared to measured down-hole temperatures reported in other hydrothermally altered regions, the results suggest that the Lopra- 1 / 1 A mineral progression formed under conditions typical of low temperature hydrothermal systems that form shortly after eruption of thick basaltic piles. Maximum temperatures achieved at the 3500 m level of the well were at or below 200 °C. The implied geothermal gradient was less than 50 °C/km. An analysis of prehnite – fluid composition relationships was also conducted in order to determine if results compatible with the paragenetic sequence study could be obtained from thermodynamic constraints. In this case, thelimiting temperature for prehnite formation in equilibrium with albite–quartz–calcite–laumontite (the mineral assemblage {{at the bottom of the}} hole) was determined for a range of fluid compositions. The resulting calculations suggest temperatures of formation of prehnite in the range of 140 °C to 205 °C, a conclusion which is broadly consistent with those reached from study of the parageneticrelationships.

The volume of altered rock records the total mass of volatiles expelled. An analysis of the Pittsmont Dome at the porphyry copper system at Butte, Montana provides an example. The moles of hydrogen ion consumed during alteration are calculated from the mineralogy of unaltered and altered rock. Published composition estimates are used to determine the concentration of reactable hydrogen ion in the magmatic fluid. Diffusion from the vein to a reaction front {{at the edge of the}} halo surrounding it constrains the rate of hydrogen ion loss from the vein. Semi-analytic and finite difference simulations of alteration halo formation show how the radius of the pervasively altered zone and the steepness of the taper beyond that zone depend on the rate of volatile expulsion; the faster the fluid velocity, the less steep the taper. Data from the Pittsmont Dome suggest 23 to 30 billion tons of magmatic fluid was expelled over a period of less than 20 years.

To mitigate this problem, this paper evaluated a combined neutralization-adsorption system that used readily available and cheap reagents like calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and partly-weathered volcanic ash. Batch neutralization experiments showed that CaCO 3 {{was effective in}} raising the pH of the leachate around neutral while the batch adsorption experiments illustrated that the volcanic ash sample collected near the tunnel project area was highly capable of adsorbing arsenate (As[V]), Pb, Cu and Zn. Under column conditions, the amount of hazardous elements released from the rock increased by several folds and their breakthrough curves had flushing-out trends. The mechanisms of As and heavy metals release probably include the dissolution of soluble phases and pyrite oxidation. Addition of CaCO 3 in the column experiments based on estimates from the batch results underestimated the amount of neutralizer needed to adjust the effluent pH to around 8, resulting only in slight increase of the pH. Nevertheless, the presence of CaCO 3 drastically reduced the amount of hazardous elements released from the altered rock especially during {{the initial stages of}} the column experiments. Combining neutralization and adsorption effectively reduced the amount of As and heavy metals in the effluent throughout the duration of the column experiments, which is attributed to the slight neutralizing effect of volcanic ash that raised the pH around circumneutral as well as its rich Al and Fe oxyhydroxide/oxide contents. The combined system immobilized the hazardous elements through a combination of co-precipitation and adsorption reactions and showed potential as an alternative method for the disposal of altered rocks producing acidic leachate...|$|E

40|$|David Green {{has shown}} {{us that the}} {{geochemistry}} of basaltic volcanoes is largely governed by mantle processes. However, Kilauea volcano, {{one of the most}} active volcanoes on Earth, also records interaction with its crustal rocks. Kilauea is built on a 6 km thick crustal basement of 100 Ma oceanic crust [1] overlain by 8 - 10 km of young lavas (< 1 Ma) from the adjacent growing shield volcano, Mauna Loa. The contribution of these basaltic basement rocks on the geochemistry of Kilauea magma was thought to be negligible based on major, trace element and Pb, Nd and Sr isotope analyses of historical lavas from this volcano [2]. New oxygen isotope results provide evidence for extensive exchange between Kilauea magmas and the volcano’s basement. This exchange is documented by analyses of basalt matrix material and olivine-matrix pairs for historical lavas. The matrix oxygen isotope ratios are lower and the disequilibrium between olivine and matrix is greatest following summit explosions and collapses in 1790 and 1924. The source of this contamination {{is not likely to be}} shallow because blocks from the 1924 explosions (derived from depths < 400 m) have relatively high O isotope ratios (5. 5 per mil). In contrast, lavas from the volcano’s deeper (2 - 3 km) and hotter interior (at least 300 °C) have much lower O isotope ratios (1. 7 - 2. 3 per mil). These deeper rocks are more appropriate for lowering O matrix ratios following summit collapses via assimilation of <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock.</b> The positive correlation between Pb and O isotopes is consistent with Mauna Loa basement rocks being contaminants for recent Kilauea lavas.

The order of the spherical harmonics m, and hence the three-dimensional structure of the convective flow, cannot be determined by the stability analysis because of the degeneracy of the linear solution. The three-dimensional structure of the convective flow is determined by removing the degeneracy through the nonlinear effect of the temperature-dependent water viscosity. Three different convection solutions are found. However, the three-dimensional structures of these solutions are exactly the same and axisymmetric after an appropriate rotational transformation. The stability criterion is most effectively viewed as a requirement that the product of permeability and square of planetesimal radius exceed a quantity mainly dependent on central temperature. In this way, the criterion applies to planetesimals independent of the specific identification of the short-lived radionuclide responsible for early heating or its concentration. Evaluation of the criterion in this form leads to the conclusion that hydrothermal convection is likely in carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies heated sufficiently to melt the ice and raise the water temperature by tens to a hundred degrees Celsius. Weakly nonlinear convection in the planetesimals has two regions of hot upwelling water providing significant volumes of <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock.</b> (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the mobilization and speciation of arsenic (As) found in <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rock</b> under oxic column conditions. The altered rock sample {{was obtained from}} a tunnel project located in the Nakakoshi area of Hokkaido, Japan, whose geology is represented by slate, shale and sandstone. This area underwent silicification, pyritization and argillic alteration resulting in As-enrichment of the rock. Results of the column experiments show that the infiltration rate, bulk density and rock bed thickness affected the duration of water residence, which in turn influenced the pH of the rock-water system. Coexisting ions most notably calcium (Ca 2 +) at amounts greater than ca. 50 mg/L retarded the mobilization of As. Mobilization of As from the rock with time occurred in two stages: stage 1 (weeks 1 - 20) with higher As leaching and stage 2 (weeks 20 - 76) characterized by nearly constant As release. In addition, pore water As concentrations revealed that the columns developed into two regions: the top half {{where most of the}} leaching occurred and the bottom part dominated by adsorption. Thus, the mechanisms controlling the mobilization of As from the rock is a combination of {{one or more of the}} following processes: dissolution of soluble As-bearing fractions, pyrite oxidation and adsorption reactions. Arsenite (As[III]) was the dominant species in the effluent at the start of the experiment in columns with shorter water residence time and lower pH conditions (< 8). On the other hand, arsenate (As[V]) was the major inorganic species released from the rock at higher pH (8 - 9. 5) and when the system was close to equilibrium. Speciation of As with depth also indicated that As[III] disappeared around the bottom half of the columns, probably as a result of adsorption and/or oxidation. Arsenic speciation is partially controlled by the pH dependent adsorption of As species. The important adsorbent phases in the rock included Fe-Al oxides/oxyhydroxides, clay minerals and organic matter, which permitted the columns to attenuate additional As loadings including As[III]. Implications of these results on the design of a novel disposal method for these altered rocks include the enhancement of As adsorption through the addition of natural or artificial adsorbents and the utilization of a covering soil with low permeability to minimize rainwater infiltration into the rock...|$|E
30|$|The {{application}} of spectral image processing methods to ASTER data for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper mineralization and related host rock {{has been investigated}} in the southeastern segment of the Urumieh-Dokhtar volcanic belt of Iran (Pour and Hashim 2012 b). Spectral transform approaches, namely principal component analysis, band ratio and minimum noise fraction were used for mapping <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rocks</b> and lithological units at regional scale. Spectral mapping methods, including spectral angle mapper, linear spectral unmixing, matched filtering and mixture tuned matched filtering were applied to differentiate hydrothermal alteration zones associated with porphyry copper mineralization such as phyllic, argillic and propylitic mineral assemblages. Spectral transform methods enhanced <b>hydrothermally</b> <b>altered</b> <b>rocks</b> associated with the known porphyry copper deposits and new identified prospects using shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER. These methods showed the discrimination of quartz rich igneous rocks from the magmatic background and the boundary between igneous and sedimentary rocks using the thermal infrared (TIR) bands of ASTER at regional scale. Spectral mapping methods distinguished the sericitically- and argillically-altered rocks (the phyllic and argillic alteration zones) that surrounded by discontinuous to extensive zones of propylitized rocks (the propylitic alteration zone) using SWIR bands of ASTER at both regional and district scales. Results {{have proven to be}} effective, and in accordance with the results of field surveying, spectral reflectance measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.|$|R
