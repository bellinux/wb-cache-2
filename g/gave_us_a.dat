25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E

Forum, so I knew we were onto something with that one.|$|E
500|$|The 1924–25 All Blacks' Invincibles tour {{included}} a Test against France. The teams {{met at the}} Stade des Ponts Jumeaux in Toulouse on 18 January 1925. Although French rugby had improved since 1906, the All Blacks still won 306, with France scoring two tries. All Blacks' captain Cliff Porter said of France [...] "Your forwards <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> lot of bother. Your three-quarters were not so good." ...|$|E

500|$|Clark {{recalls that}} [...] "Paul Fox <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> tiny budget ... and {{we set out}} to do a full-blooded drama on location. Budgets were really tiny, and we shot for ten days and brought the film in for about 8,000 pounds." [...] Unusually for a BBC {{television}} drama of the 1970s, each instalment was filmed entirely on location using 16 mm film. As a result, the cameraman John McGlashan, who filmed the first five adaptations, was able to make use of night shoots and dark, shadowy interiors, which {{would not have been possible}} with the then-standard video-based studio interiors.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} [...] "The Last Time", the Rolling Stones' first major single, proved a turning point. Richards called it [...] "a bridge into {{thinking}} about {{writing for the}} Stones. It <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it." [...] The song {{was based on a}} traditional gospel song popularised by the Staple Singers, but the Rolling Stones' number features a distinctive guitar riff, played by Brian Jones. Prior to the emergence of Jagger/Richards as the Stones' songwriters, the band members occasionally were given collective credit under the pseudonym Nanker Phelge. Some songs attributed to Nanker Phelge have been re-attributed to Jagger/Richards.|$|E
500|$|Joe Guyon, the team's best passer, was a Chippewa Indian who {{was born}} on the White Earth Indian Reservation; his brother, Charles [...] "Wahoo" [...] Guyon, was the {{assistant}} coach. Guyon had played for Pop Warner at Carlisle, and had to sit out the 1916 season in accordance with conference transfer rules. He ran through (and over) opponents, in contrast to Strupper's dodging style. Judy Harlan said about Guyon, [...] "Once in a while the Indian would come out in Joe, such as the nights Heisman <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> white football and had us working out under the lights. That's when Guyon would give out the blood curdling war whoops." ...|$|E

We {{met him at the}} airport {{and as soon as he}} walked off of the plane and <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> big hug it was like we'd known him forever and we decided to keep him!" [...] said Bunn.

500|$|Shortly after {{changing}} {{the game from}} I5 to Ratchet & Clank, Naughty Dog asked Insomniac {{if they would be}} interested in sharing the game technology used in Naughty Dog's , asking that Insomniac in turn share with them any improvements that were made. Insomniac agreed, resulting in most of the Ratchet & Clank engine technology being developed in-house by Insomniac, but some very important renderers were those developed by Naughty Dog. Looking back on the agreement, Ted Price said that [...] "Naughty Dog's generosity <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> huge leg up and allowed us to draw the enormous vistas in the game." [...] Some years later, Ted Price clarified Insomniac's stance on engine technology while obliquely mentioning the shared renderers: ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "Letters of Transit" [...] {{the seventeenth}} best {{episode of the}} series, stating [...] "What at first seemed {{to be one of}} Fringes nutty number 19s {{turned out to be the}} episode that helped earn the series a fifth and final year. Of course, some may now {{question}} the merits of ringing out the series with a season-long story set entirely in this future dystopia ruled by oppressive Observers. But the single episode that introduced this premise was a cool jolt that opened a new front of Fringe mythology and <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> character that would have a lasting impact, Etta."

[...] Kimi Räikkönen expressed disappointment with not being able to win, but said he was [...] "very happy how the team is working" [...] and highlighted the big step forward Ferrari had made over the winter. Nico Rosberg was disappointed about the brake failure costing him second place, but added that he was very happy with the car altogether.|$|E
500|$|The band's second UK LP, The Rolling Stones No. 2, was {{released}} in January 1965 and reached No.1 in the charts. The US version {{was released}} in February as The Rolling Stones, Now! and reached No.5. The album was recorded at Chess Studios in Chicago and RCA Studios in Los Angeles. In January and February that year the band played 34 shows for around 100,000 people in Australia and New Zealand. The single [...] "The Last Time", released in February, was the first Jagger/Richards composition to reach No.1 in the UK charts; it reached No.9 in the US. It was later identified by Richards as [...] "the bridge into thinking about writing for the Stones. It <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> level of confidence; a pathway of how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1911 Rhodes {{made his}} third visit to Australia, {{this time as}} the opening partner of Jack Hobbs. The tour proved to be the [...] "absolute {{pinnacle}} of his success as a batsman", according to Rogerson. Under the captaincy of Johnny Douglas, England won the 1911–12 Test series against Australia 4–1, after losing the first Test. While the success of the tourists was attributed to their powerful bowling attack, C. B. Fry described the English victories as [...] "a succession of triumphs for Jack Hobbs and Rhodes as first wicket batsmen." [...] Pelham Warner, who was nominally captain but missed the entire series due to illness, said that in [...] "innings after innings they [...] <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> wonderful start", adding that he had run out of words to praise their contributions.|$|E

[...] He added that compared to Jack's storyline, he [...] "actually wore more grins watching the microscopic B-story with the writers, playing Marry, Boff, Kill." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that [...] "the Valentine's Day episode of 30 Rock <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> big surprise: a low-key half hour from a show known for being over the top," [...] adding that this was [...] "a pleasant surprise". He said that this episode [...] "proved that [...] could make with the funny {{no matter what the}} tone". Canning rated this episode 8.5 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Baird and Jackie {{were taken}} {{to live with the}} Birches and their son at The Dairy Cottage, which was owned by Mimi's husband, George Smith. At the age of 14 Baird was allowed to go into Liverpool city centre by herself, where she drank cappuccino coffee in the Kardomah Coffee House, {{although}} Baird and her friends called it [...] "frothy coffee". At 16, Baird started to hitch-hike to London, although her aunt never knew, as she would never have allowed it. Baird talked about the trips to London, and how relatively safe they were: [...] "Hitching was easy then. It was a way of life. Everything was becoming more free. We'd start chatting to people in the Tube station and get invited to parties. People always <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> place to stay – we were never harmed." ...|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Alison Rowat of The Herald {{felt that}} the current storylines {{indicated}} [...] "the best days of EE are over", commenting: [...] "Contrast it with the ever sprightly Coronation Street, where the scenes featuring Gail “Black Widow” McIntyre and her lucky white heather husband have been perfect soap fare. What does EastEnders have? Another murder investigation {{in a place that}} has a higher homicide rate than The Wire Baltimore. Andrew Billen of The Times refuted claims by the BBC that [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was not a [...] "gimmick" [...] but in fact proof of the soap's [...] "innovative vigour". Billen deemed the live episode a [...] "reactionary move", observing that Coronation Street had aired a live episode for its 40th anniversary in 2000. He reminded readers: [...] "live television drama is nothing new but rather harks back to the earliest days of television and, beyond them, to theatre itself." [...] The Mirror Jane Simon hoped for multiple errors during the transmission of [...] "EastEnders Live", commenting: [...] "It's time EastEnders <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> laugh." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like The Jam were my favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and stuff. It was just kind of inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E

[...] Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Biogenesis," [...] along with [...] "The Sixth Extinction" [...] and [...] "," [...] as the fifth best episode of the series, writing, [...] "it is evident that as [...] progressed, the episodes surrounding those storylines and the breaking points Mulder and Scully endured push them further and further towards total, irreversible defeat. This is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes." [...] Monica S. Kuebler from Exclaim magazine called [...] "Biogenesis", along with [...] "The Sixth Extinction" [...] and [...] "Amor Fati", one of the [...] "best" [...] episodes during the show's [...] "colonization" [...] phase.
