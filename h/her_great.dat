Brett did not want to know her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York.

5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused <b>her</b> <b>great</b> emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German feeling in Britain running high, the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly {{in part because the}} Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E

5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades were fired at Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants. In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother who suffers from respiratory disease, causing <b>her</b> <b>great</b> distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades were fired at the house. This time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid-April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|According to Lennon, the Stanley family {{once owned}} {{the whole of}} Woolton village. William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby did once own the manorial rights to Woolton but Lennon's Stanley family were from humbler origins and only came to Liverpool in the 1870s. Mimi's {{grandfather}} was born in Birmingham and <b>her</b> <b>great</b> grandfather was born in London. Mimi's father, George Ernest Stanley, {{was born in the}} Everton district of Liverpool in 1874 to William Henry Stanley and Eliza Jane Gildea. George's mother, Eliza Jane Gildea, was born in Omagh, County Tyrone, Ireland. By 1891 the Stanleys were living in Upper Frederick Street, south of the city centre, in the same inner city area of Liverpool as the family of George's future wife, Annie Millward. Mimi's mother, Annie Jane Millward, was born in Chester in 1873, to Welsh parents. George Ernest Stanley and Annie Millward were married at St Peter's Church, Liverpool on 19 November 1906. Stanley was a merchant seaman often away at sea so was absent from some census records.|$|E

In 1935, she greeted her nephew, King George V, and his wife, Queen Mary, at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations, and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington. Her last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition. Between these occasions, <b>her</b> <b>great</b> nephew, King Edward VIII, abdicated on 11 December 1936.

5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war.

Indeed, she was noted for <b>her</b> <b>great</b> skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E
