Meanwhile he is still {{struggling}} {{to deal with the}} death of his perennial personal secretary, Mrs. Landingham. Charlie insists {{that it is necessary to}} appoint a new person to fill the position, but the president is reluctant to take the step. As the episode ends, Bartlet is searching for a good pen, and realizes the full <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dependence on Mrs. Landingham.|$|E
25|$|With all the {{evidence}} pointing to him, Anderson is convicted of the murder, and sentenced to death. However, Gifford's plan begins to unfold when Andra refuses to accept {{the evidence}}, not believing that Anderson is capable of such a heinous crime. When Gifford understands the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's feelings for Anderson, he writes a note confessing to the murder, and then commits suicide.|$|E

Once the man is in place, he is very difficult to dislodge without his co-operation. With the man's weight on the woman, especially on her pelvis, the man has control of the rhythm and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thrusts, in the most sexually sensitive part of her body.|$|E

25|$|Many of his {{prints and}} {{thousands}} of unpublished sketches were found in his estate after he died. They revealed more of the true <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Because Marsh made good records of his work, often on a daily basis, {{it was easy to}} find his unpublished works and publish them. A set of prints that were acquired by William Benton from Marsh's wife are now all in the William Benton Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, and the Middendorf Gallery in Washington, D.C.|$|E
25|$|Margaret's long-absent brother, Frederick (who {{is wanted}} for naval mutiny), {{secretly}} visits their dying mother. Thornton sees Margaret and Frederick together, and assumes {{that he is}} her lover. Leonards, a man from Helstone, later recognises Frederick at the train station. They argue; Frederick pushes Leonards away, and Leonards dies shortly afterwards. When the police question Margaret about the scuffle she lies and says she was not present. As the magistrate investigate Leonards' death, Thornton knows that Margaret lied but declares the case closed to save her from possible perjury. Margaret is humbled by his deed on her behalf; she no longer only looks down on Thornton as a hard master, and begins to recognise the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character.|$|E
25|$|Progressively {{it becomes}} obvious that Bret {{was once an}} awkward, science-minded kid who brutally {{repressed}} everything authentic about himself in order to fit in. Now he goes {{through the motions of}} a hollow existence, unable to admit even to himself the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> misery. As his certainties unravel, the night does as well. A fraternity prank goes wrong and propels Bret from his comfort zone into a cross-campus adventure, where he discovers devastating truths about the house president he once idolized. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that the school and society are moving beyond the values that Bret has built his life around: while tech careers have become the hope for a dawning Information Age, his fraternity is a hated and secretly bankrupt enclave slated for demolition. With the help of a beautiful but troubled girl named Caitlin, Bret finds the strength to take a last-ditch stand in an attempt to redeem himself from years of mistakesbefore it becomes too late.|$|E

500|$|Bowie's {{songs and}} stagecraft {{brought a new}} {{dimension}} to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were [...] "noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance", biographer David Buckley wrote that [...] "Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation." [...] Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, [...] "There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie". Musicologist James Perone credited him with having [...] "brought sophistication to rock music", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work and influence. Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pervasive artistry that he had lived his life [...] "as though he were an art installation." ...|$|E

[...] He has also {{was appointed}} as board member to several companies, as a leader of several organizations affiliated with his collegiate alma mater, and as a leader in youth education in his native Chicago. [...] In 2007, Rogers was honored with the Woodrow Wilson Award from Princeton University for the breadth and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> service to many organizations. While a student at Princeton, he was captain of the 1979–80 Ivy League co-champion Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.|$|E
500|$|Many {{historians and}} {{scholars}} regard Leonardo {{as the prime}} exemplar of the [...] "Universal Genius" [...] or [...] "Renaissance Man", an individual of [...] "unquenchable curiosity" [...] and [...] "feverishly inventive imagination". According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interests were without precedent in recorded history, and [...] "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, while the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci notes that while there is much speculation regarding his life and personality, {{his view of the}} world was logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unorthodox for his time.|$|E
500|$|We {{should not}} have condescended to notice the {{senseless}} and wicked sophistry of this writer [...] had we not considered {{him as one of}} the representatives of a class of men by whom literature is more than at any former period disgraced [...] it might not be unprofitable to show how small a portion of talent and literature was necessary for carrying on the trade of sedition. [...] The few specimens which we have selected of his ethics and his criticism are more than sufficient to prove that Mr. Hazlitt's knowledge of Shakespeare and the English language is exactly {{on a par with the}} purity of his morals and the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> understanding.|$|E

Whatsername attempts to talk about Johnny's behavior, while the Extraordinary Girl dresses Tunny's wounds and Will sits on the couch, once again alone ("21 Guns"). Johnny leaves a note for Whatsername, saying he has chosen Jimmy and drugs over her. Frightened and fed up, Whatsername tells Johnny {{that he is not}} the [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] and reveals that St. Jimmy is nothing more than [...] "a figment of [...] father's rage and [...] mother's love" [...] ("Letterbomb"). She leaves him.|$|E
500|$|Jim's plan to {{consolidate}} three employee birthdays into a combined birthday party encounters several complications, and his constant adjustments incur {{the ire of}} Party Planning Committee chair Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). [...] Later, Jim discovers that no one likes his idea for a combined party, realizing the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> error when Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) mistakenly refers to him as Michael, and {{he returns to the}} original plan of having separate parties. Michael and Dwight return lightening the mood amongst the employees and for the lighting of Creed Bratton's (portrayed by the actor of the same name) birthday cobbler, with Michael expressing that he no longer has any desire to return to the wilderness and Jim expressing his relief that Michael has returned to run the office.|$|E
500|$|Keyser Söze's semi-mythical {{nature was}} {{inspired}} by Yuri, a rumored KGB mole whose existence nobody can confirm, from the spy thriller No Way Out. Kint was not originally written to be as obviously intelligent; in the script, he was, according to McQuarrie, [...] "presented as a dummy". Spacey and Singer had previously met at a screening for Public Access. Spacey requested a role in Singer's next film, and McQuarrie wrote the role of Kint specifically for him. McQuarrie said he wanted audiences to dismiss Kint as a minor character, as Spacey was not yet well-known. Spacey made it more obvious that the character is holding back information, though the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> involvement and nature of his secrets remain unrevealed. McQuarrie said that he approved of the changes, as it makes the character [...] "more fascinating".|$|E

500|$|In May 1992, {{a conference}} marking his centenary {{was held at}} the UCL Institute of Archaeology in London, co-sponsored by the Institute and the Prehistoric Society, both organisations that he had {{formerly}} headed. The proceedings of the conference were subsequently published in a 1994 volume edited by Institute director David R. Harris, The Archaeology of V. Gordon Childe: Contemporary Perspectives. Harris stated that the book was designed to [...] "demonstrate the dynamic qualities of Childe's thought, the breadth and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> scholarship, and the continuing relevance of his work to contemporary issues in archaeology." [...] In 1995, another anthology based on a conference was published. Titled Childe and Australia: Archaeology, Politics and Ideas, it was edited by Peter Gathercole, T.H. Irving, and Gregory Melleuish. Further papers would appear on the subject of Childe in ensuing years, looking at such subjects as his personal correspondences, and final resting place.|$|E
500|$|According to The Globe and Mail John Barber, Martin manages {{simultaneously}} to master and transcend the genre so that [...] "Critics applaud the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> characterizations {{and lack of}} cliché in books that are nonetheless replete with dwarves and dragons". Publishers Weekly gave favorable reviews to the first three Ice and Fire novels at their points of release, saying that A Game of Thrones had [...] "superbly developed characters, accomplished prose and sheer bloody-mindedness", that A Clash of Kings was [...] "notable particularly for the lived-in quality of [...] for the comparatively modest role of magic", and that A Storm of Swords was one [...] "of the more rewarding examples of gigantism in contemporary fantasy". However, they found that A Feast For Crows as the fourth installment [...] "sorely misses its other half. The slim pickings here are tasty, but in no way satisfying." [...] Their review for A Dance with Dragons repeated points of criticism for the fourth volume, and said that, although [...] "The new volume has a similar feel to Feast", [...] "Martin keeps it fresh by focusing on popular characters [...] notably absent from the previous book." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Mark McLeod, these postulated {{explanations of}} Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam {{at the time}} and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, {{both before and after the}} signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: [...] "Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received , or we will die for him." [...] One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: [...] "The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle.... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards." ...|$|E
