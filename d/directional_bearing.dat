40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the wolf spider Lycosa {{tarantula}} (Linnaeus 1758) have shown that homing is carried out by path integration and that, {{in the absence of}} information relative to the sun’s position or any pattern of polarized light, L. tarantula obtains information as to the angle it must turn to home through the anterior lateral eyes (ALEs). In the present study, spiders were trained to walk over a black-and-white grating and afterwards tested either over a white substratum, the same substratum used for training or the same substratum rotated 90 deg (two groups: ALEs covered and only ALEs uncovered; they were tested first without their eyes covered and then with their eyes covered). The <b>directional</b> <b>bearing</b> was measured both in training and test conditions. Under the white or the same substratum in test conditions, the <b>directional</b> <b>bearing</b> had the same mean direction and a distribution {{similar to that of the}} training sessions. When the substratum was rotated 90 deg, the <b>directional</b> <b>bearing</b> had the same mean direction but the distribution was significantly different from that of the training sessions.

50|$|Electronic support {{measures}} (ESM) or Electronic Surveillance Measures are really ELINT techniques using various Electronic Surveillance Systems, but {{the term is}} used in the specific context of tactical warfare. ESM give the information needed for electronic attack (EA) such as jamming, or <b>directional</b> <b>bearings</b> (compass angle) to a target in signals intercept such as in the HUFF-DUFF Radio Direction Finding (RDF) systems so critically important during the WW-II Battle of the Atlantic. After WW-II, the RDF originally applied in only communications was broadened into systems to also take in ELINT from radar bandwidths and lower frequency communications systems, giving birth to a family of NATO ESM systems, such as the shipboard US AN/WLR-1 - AN/WLR-6 systems and comparable airborne units. EA is also called electronic counter-measures (ECM). ESM provides information needed for electronic counter-counter measures (ECCM), such as understanding a spoofing or jamming mode so one can change one's radar characteristics to avoid them.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a cooperative collision-avoidance (CCA) scheme for intelligent transport systems. Unlike contemporary strategies, the envisioned scheme avoids flooding the considered vehicular network with high volumes of emergency messages upon accidental events. We present a cluster-based {{organization of the}} target vehicles. The cluster is based upon several criteria, which define {{the movement of the}} vehicles, namely, the <b>directional</b> <b>bearing</b> and relative velocity of each vehicle, as well as the intervehicular distance. We also design a risk-aware medium-access control (MAC) protocol to increase the responsiveness of the proposed CCA scheme. According to the order of each vehicle in its corresponding cluster, an emergency level is associated with the vehicle that signifies the risk of encountering a potential emergency scenario. To swiftly circulate the emergency notifications to collocated vehicles to mitigate the risk of chain collisions, the medium-access delay of each vehicle is set as a function of its emergency level. Due to its twofold contributions, i. e., the cluster-based and risk-conscious approaches, our adopted strategy {{is referred to as the}} cluster-based risk-aware CCA (C-RACCA) scheme. The performance of the C-RACCA system is verified through mathematical analyses and computer simulations, whose results clearly verify its effectiveness in mitigating collision risks of the vehicles arising from accidental hazards...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{foraging}} behaviour of lactating female, adult male and juvenile New Zealand (NZ) fur seals to {{compare and contrast}} their foraging strategies and assess the degree of spatial separation of their foraging habitats. Adult male fur seals are longer and heavier than lactating females, which are longer and heavier than juveniles. Trip duration {{was positively correlated with}} the distance travelled by all age/sex groups. Juveniles conducted longer trips and travelled further from the colony than males. Both juveniles and males conducted longer trips and travelled further than females, which made brief trips because they were provisioning pups. There were no seasonal differences in the behaviour of males, but females and juveniles foraged closer to the colony in summer when they were moulting and females had younger pups. Behavioural differences were recorded between lactating female, male and juvenile seals in the <b>directional</b> <b>bearing</b> from the colony, the distance travelled, the minimum size of the area that was potentially visited and the horizontal swim speed. Intra-specific foraging competition among these age/sex groups was minimal because lactating females typically used continental shelf waters and males utilised deeper waters over the shelf break, adjacent to female foraging grounds. Furthermore, juveniles used pelagic waters, up to 1000 km south of the habitats used by adults. Differences in the habitats used by females, males and juveniles were also apparent in the seafloor gradient, the SST and the surface chl a concentration, with females using regions with the highest chl a concentrations. Results from this study suggest that smaller seals cannot efficiently utilise prey in the same habitats as larger seals because smaller seals do not have the capacity to spend enough time underwater at the greater depths.

40|$|The {{relationships}} among chick feeding, size {{and type of}} prey item, and foraging {{time away from the}} brood have not been well studied in seabirds. This study investigated spatial and temporal patterns of foraging and chick-provisioning among 23 radio-tagged male common terns nesting at Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario during 1991 and 1992. Telemetry data were collected concurrently with behavioural observations from an elevated blind. Terns fitted with transmitters did not differ from controls with respect to either brood attendance, patterns of chick mortality, species and size distributions of prey delivered to offspring, or chick-provisioning rates. There was a clear separation of parental roles: males were primarily responsible for feeding chicks while females allocated more time to brood attendance. The prey species most commonly delivered to chicks by adults were rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and alewife (A/osa pseudoharengus), followed in importance by larval fish, emerald shiner (Notropis antherinoides), salmonids, and fathead minnows (Pimepha/es prome/as). The relative proportions of various fish speCies delivered to chicks by males differed over the course of each breeding season, and there was also much variability in species composition of prey between years. Sizes of prey delivered to chicks also differed between sampling periods. The modal size of fish brought to chicks during Peak 1991 was 1. 5 bill lengths, while the majority of prey in Late 1991 were small larval fish. The reverse trend occurred in 1992 when small fish were delivered to chicks predominantly during the Peak nesting period. During periods when predominantly small fish were delivered to chicks, the foraging activity of radio-tagged males was concentrated within a two kilometer radius of the colony. The observed variation in prey composition and foraging locations during the study likely reflects temporal variation in the availability of prey {{in the vicinity of the}} colony. Males delivered fish to chicks at a constant rate, while females 4 increased their feeding frequency over the first six to ten brood days. The mean length of fish delivered to chicks by adults increased significantly with increasing chick age. As a group, within each nesting period, transmittered males either foraged predominantly in the same <b>directional</b> <b>bearing</b> (north during Peak 1991, south during Late 1992), or concentrated foraging activity in the immediate vicinity of the colony (Late 1991, Peak 1992). However, individual radio-tagged males exhibited unique and predictable foraging patterns, often favouring specific locations within these areas and differing in their secondary foraging patterns. Overall, the Lake Ontario shoreline between NCB Bay" (3. 5 km south of colony) and the lift bridge canal (4 km north of colony) was the foraging area used most frequently by radiotagged males during the chick-rearing period. Foraging patterns of transmittered males at Windermere Basin are similar to patterns of peak-nesting common terns, but differ from those of late-nesters, at a nearby colony (Port Colborne, Lake Erie). Differences between the foraging patterns of late-nesting terns at these colonies likely reflect differences in annual patterns of fish availability between the two locations. No relationship was found between foraging proficiency of adults and survival of offspring. Stochastic factors, such as predation by black-crowned nightherons (Nycticorax nycticorax) and adverse weather conditions during the early stages of chick rearing, may be more important determinants of common tern breeding success than parental quality or fish availability...|$|E

Among other things, the Navy hired 'coast watchers' {{to keep an}} eye on Japanese shipping and other activities. They, naturally were much more effective if they had ships. The South China Sea was (and is today) full of pirates. Numerous bands of pirates were recruited {{to keep an eye}} on the Japanese military. One of these bands was located near Shanghai to my information, and was run by a woman, who was fairly young and quite good looking. Hence, the [...] "Dragon Lady". Reportedly, her band was quite successful, and she ran a taut ship. Another event in the strip was when the characters were supposedly setting up radio beacons, to aid in a bombing raid on the [...] "invaders" [...] base,word 'Japanese' was not used in the strip, so far as i know. This 'base' was referred to in the strip as [...] "Happy Valley". The 'sensitive' part, was that the main US Navy training base in mainland China - which was used to train the Chinese insurgent forces, was CALLED [...] "Happy Valley" [...] by those stationed there. I heard that the FBI showed up to talk to Mr. Caniff on that one. He found a boy's summer camp in his area that (coincidentally was also called [...] "Happy Valley"). This seemed to placate the FBI. US Navy personnel were stationed on the outskirts of the Gobi desert, to do radio direction finding RDF on Japanese shipping. They were hundreds of miles from anything. They reported their <b>directional</b> <b>bearings</b> 'cuts' back to the US, via HF radio to a commercial shipping company on the US west coast, who was paid to relay the traffic. The shipping company was never told where the station they were talking to was located. The Navy people thought that if the shipping company found out that they were thousands of miles away from the US, that they would 'stop listening' - convinced that they could NOT hear signals that far away. This activity was documented (to a degree) in the movie [...] "Destination Gobi", with Richard Widmark and Don Taylor. In the movie, which was made shortly after World War II, the RDF aspects were covered up, and the story line was that they were reporting the weather. That WAS true, they did report weather conditions, because their weather moved over the Pacific ocean days later, but their real, and most important task was RDF.|$|R

40|$|Space is continuous. But the {{communities}} of researchers that study the cognitive map in non-humans are strangely divided, with debate over its existence found among behaviorists but not neuroscientists. To reconcile this and other debates {{within the field of}} navigation, we return to the concept of the parallel map theory, derived from data on hippocampal function in laboratory rodents. Here the cognitive map is redefined as the integrated map, which is a construction of dual mechanisms, one based on <b>directional</b> cues (<b>bearing</b> map) and the other on positional cues (sketch map). We propose that the dual navigational mechanisms of pigeons, the navigational map and the familiar area map, could be homologous to these mammalian parallel maps; this has implications for both research paradigms. Moreover, this has implications for the lab. To create a bearing map (and hence integrated map) from extended cues requires self-movement over a large enough space to sample and model these cues at a high resolution. Thus a navigator must be able to move freely to map extended cues; only then should the weighted hierarchy of available navigation mechanisms shift in favor of the integrated map. Because of the paucity of extended cues in the lab, the flexible solutions allowed by the integrated map should be rare, despite abundant neurophysiological evidence for the existence of the machinery needed to encode and map extended cues through voluntary movement. Not only do animals need to map extended cues but they must also have sufficient information processing capacity. This may require a specific ontogeny, in which the navigator’s nervous system is exposed to naturally complex spatial contingencies, a circumstance that occurs rarely, if ever, in the lab. For example, free-ranging, flying animals must process more extended cues than walking animals and for this reason alone, the integrated map strategy may be found more reliably in some species. By taking concepts from ethology and the parallel map theory, we propose a path to directly integrating the three great experimental paradigms of navigation: the honeybee, the homing pigeon and the laboratory rodent, towards the goal of a robust, unified theory of animal navigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of patterns {{of movement and}} space use by fishes {{to the understanding of}} population dynamics, community structure and spatial population models, is being increasingly recognised. Despite this realisation, information regarding patterns of movement is rare for fishes. Two important aspects in coral reef fisheries which are affected greatly by the lack of knowledge about movements, are the uncertainties associated with high fishing pressures on spawning aggregations, and the potential use of marine protected areas as a fisheries management strategy. The main aim of this research was to determine patterns of movement and space use of a species of major fishing importance (Plectropomus leopardus, Serranidae), in relation to annual spawning aggregation events, and with respect to existing marine protected area zoning. Given the known limitations of the conventional technique for assessments of movements, i. e. external mark-release-recapture techniques, an alternative methodology, ultrasonic telemetry, was adopted to address these aspects. The first objective consisted of methodological evaluations of ultrasonic telemetry for use on P. leopardus and in coral reef fish and fisheries research in general. The second objective was to estimate home ranges and basic temporal patterns of space use by the study species. The third objective was to locate previously unknown spawning aggregation sites, estimate their minimal catchment areas, and determine patterns of participation and residence of individual fish at aggregation sites. The fourth objective was a comparison of data obtained through telemetry with comparable data collected independently using a mark-release-resighting study, and to evaluate the data obtained through both methods in relation to the existing marine protected area zoning at the study location, with considerations to the use of marine protected areas as a fisheries management tool. Preliminary assessments of ultrasonic telemetry for use on P. leopardus included the evaluation of three ultrasonic transmitter placement methods (force feeding, external attachment, and surgical body cavity insertion) in conjunction with three different fish anaesthetics (Metomidate, Phenoxyethanol, and MS- 222). The most suitable method of transmitter placement for long-term application in P. leopardus was surgical implantation into the body cavity. Attaching transmitters externally led to severe aggravation of the attachment wounds due to repeated attempts by the fish to dislodge the transmitter. Force feeding transmitters was unsuitable due to the short gastric retention times observed (18 to 216 hours). Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS- 222) was the anaesthetic chosen due to the ease of induction and maintenance of deep anaesthesia. Post-surgery recovery periods in aquaria avoided field losses due to injury-induced predation, and permitted examination of each specimen prior to release for proper closure and healing of incisions. The pilot evaluation of telemetry in the coral reef environment, and initial tracking trials indicated that manual ultrasonic tracking using visual triangulation should be conducted by taking bearings at approximately right angles (90 °) to each other, with approximate distances of 50 - 75 m between tracking vessel and estimated location of transmitter. Bearings taken at angles considerably less than 90 °, or taken at sharp angles to the prevailing wind, should be avoided. These considerations will result in minimal <b>directional</b> bias of <b>bearings</b> due to wind effects, while ensuring maximum accuracy and precision of position estimates. Observer training prior to tracking, and regular re-evaluation of bearing accuracy and precision during tracking sessions is recommended. Thirty-nine individual P. leopardus (fork length: mean = 49. 04 cm, range = 37. 6 to 67. 5 cm) were tracked successfully between 1993 and 1995. Eight of these were tracked during two subsequent field trips, resulting in 47 separate tracking sessions, comprising a total of 2, 024 fish-tracking days. Average minimum area polygon home ranges of P. leopardus differed between fish from fringing reefs (10, 458. 4 m² ± 962. 3 (SE)) and patch reefs (18, 796. 9 m² ± 3, 188. 8 (SE)). This difference was caused by differences in width of home ranges, with fringing reef home ranges being narrower than patch reef ones. Length of home ranges did not differ between reef types. Home ranges did not differ between male and female fish, and were stable within and between each tracking session (maximum 202 days between sessions). Plectropomus leopardus were day-active, predominantly using a small number of physical locations (3 - 4 positions) within their home ranges. Mean daily distance moved within home ranges was 192. 2 m ± 5. 09 (SE), with the maximum being 1121. 8 m. Patterns of space use were relatively consistent throughout the day. Position fidelity was very high at night, with very limited movements. A distinct pattern of home range use existed in relation to the prevalent current direction, with P. leopardus showing a strong preference for utilising positions located in the upcurrent portions of their home ranges. This study demonstrated, for the first time, distinct movements of P. leopardus in relation to changes in tidal currents. Thus, the observation commonly made by fishers of better catches on "run on" sides of reefs may be explained by the observed preference of upcurrent positions utilised by coral trout. Using ultrasonic telemetry, four major spawning aggregation sites of P. leopardus were detected at Lizard Island. Spawning aggregation activities displayed a lunar pattern, with peak activities during new moon periods in the southern-hemisphere spring-early summer period. Of 35 fish tracked during the spawning periods, only 31...|$|R
