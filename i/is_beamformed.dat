40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} deafness – {{a problem}} that appears when MAC protocols are designed using directional antennas. Briefly, deafness is caused when a transmitter fails to communicate to its intended receiver, because the receiver <b>is</b> <b>beamformed</b> towards a direction away from the transmitter. Existing CSMA/CA protocols rely {{on the assumption that}} congestion is the predominant cause of communication failure, and adopt backoff schemes to handle congestion. While this may be appropriate for omnidirectional antennas, for directional antennas, both deafness and congestion can be the reason for communication failures. An appropriate directional MAC protocol needs to classify the actual cause of failure, and react accordingly. This paper quantifies the impact of deafness on directional medium access control, and proposes a tone-based mechanism as one way of addressing deafness. The tone-based mechanism, ToneDMAC, assumes congestion as the default reason for communication failures, and applies a corrective measure whenever the cause is deafness. Simulation results indicate that ToneDMAC can alleviate deafness, and perform better than existing directional MAC protocols. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefit of}} using {{directional}} antennas in ad hoc networking has received increasing attention. By transmitting towards a desired direction, a node {{may be able}} to reduce wireless interference. Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) may also improve if the receiver selectively beamforms {{in the direction of the}} Signal of Interest, thereby suppressing interferences that arrive from unwanted directions. However, selective beamforming introduces new problems in wireless medium access control (MAC). One such problem is deafness, caused when a node, C, is unable to communicate with another node, A, because A <b>is</b> <b>beamformed</b> in a direction away from C. Node C may misclassify the absence of a reply from node A as a sign of network congestion. Misclassification may affect the performance of MAC and, potentially, higher layer protocols. This paper evaluates the impact of deafness on wireless medium access control. We propose a tone-based directional MAC protocol (ToneDMAC) to address this problem.

40|$|The {{radiation}} {{pattern of the}} out-of-band (oob) radiation from large arrays with nonlinear hardware {{is different from the}} {{radiation pattern}} of the beamformed inband signal. This is the main difference between the oob radiation from large arrays and from well-studied legacy systems. Beamforming might focus the oob radiation in certain directions but also significantly reduce the total power that has to be transmitted. For cost and power-consumption reasons, large arrays might have to be built from low-complexity hardware without advanced precompensation for linearization, which increases the relative amount of oob radiation. Given that large arrays will be used in future base stations, a correct understanding of the oob radiation is crucial to specify appropriate linearity requirements for the hardware. We show that the oob radiation from large arrays varies little between coherence times; it is isotropic in many cases; and, when it <b>is</b> <b>beamformed,</b> it is directed towards the served user in a very narrow beam with an array gain equal to or less than that of the in-band signal. We draw the conclusion that, compared to legacy systems, less stringent linearity requirements can be used in many systems with large arrays by virtue of the lower transmit power needed to upkeep the same received signal-to-noise ratio...|$|E
40|$|A geoacoustic {{inversion}} technique for high-frequency (12 kHz) multibeam sonar data {{is presented as}} a means to classify the seafloor sediment in shallow water (40 - 300 m). The inversion makes use of backscattered data at a variety of grazing angles to estimate mean grain size. The need for sediment type and the large amounts of multibeam data being collected with the Naval Oceanographic Office's Simrad EM 121 A systems, have fostered the development of algorithms to process the EM 121 A acoustic backscatter into maps of sediment type. The APL-UW (Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington) backscattering model is used with simulated annealing to invert for six geoacoustic parameters. For the inversion, three of the parameters are constrained according to empirical correlations with mean grain size, which is introduced as an unconstrained parameter. The four unconstrained (free) parameters are mean grain size, sediment volume interaction, and two seafloor roughness parameters. Acoustic sediment classification is performed in the Onslow Bay region off the coast of North Carolina using data from the 12 kHz Simrad EM 121 A multibeam sonar system. Raw hydrophone data <b>is</b> <b>beamformed</b> into 122 beams with a 120 -degree swath on the ocean floor, and backscattering strengths are calculated for each beam and for each ping.

40|$|Co-existing {{wireless}} systems, {{which share}} a common spectrum, need to mitigate out-of-band (OOB) radiation to avoid excessive interference. For legacy systems, OOB radiation is well understood and is commonly handled by digital precompensation techniques. When using large arrays, however, new phenomena and hardware limitations have to be considered. First, signals can be radiated directionally, which might focus the OOB radiation. Second, low-complexity hardware is used for cost reasons, which increases the relative amount of OOB radiation. Given that massive MIMO and millimeter wave communication rely on base stations {{with a large number}} of antennas, the spatial behavior of OOB radiation from large arrays will have significant implications for the hardware requirements of future base stations. We show that, if the OOB radiation <b>is</b> <b>beamformed,</b> its array gain is never larger than that of the in-band signal. In many cases, the OOB radiation is close to isotropic even when the in-band signal is highly directive. With the same total radiated power, the OOB radiation from large arrays is therefore never more severe than from a legacy system with the same adjacent-channel-leakage ratio. Further, the OOB radiation is less detrimental than from a legacy system since the high array gain of the in-band signal allows large arrays to radiate less total power than legacy systems. We also show how OOB radiation from large arrays varies with location in static propagation environments and how these effects vanish when averaged over the small-scale fading. Since a higher relative amount of OOB radiation can be tolerated for large arrays, the linearity requirement can be relaxed as compared to legacy systems. Specifically, less stringent linearity requirements on each transmitter makes it possible to build large arrays from low-complexity hardware...|$|E
