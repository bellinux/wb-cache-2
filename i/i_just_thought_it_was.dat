500|$|In March 2000, Van Morrison {{told the}} Irish rock {{magazine}} Hot Press {{about the impact}} that Freewheelin made on him: [...] "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens {{the whole thing up}} ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|The dark, ironic {{lyrics of}} [...] "Today", {{describing}} {{a day when}} Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation. Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is [...] "downright pretty as rock ballads go" [...] but that [...] "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks." [...] Corgan told Rolling Stone that [...] "I was really suicidal... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can't get any worse." [...] Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of [...] "Today" [...] and [...] "Disarm" [...] to [...] "ripping [...] guts out." [...] They played the song live {{for the first time}} on September 20, 1993 on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{recalled}} his {{first encounter with}} Dylan's music {{in an interview in}} 2000: [...] "I think I heard [...] in a record shop in Smith Street. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it... The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965. One of the songs on the album held a unique fascination for Morrison and he soon started performing [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in small clubs and pubs as a solo artist (without Them).|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Daniel Chun, his fourth writing credit of the series. It was directed by then-showrunner Paul Lieberstein, his sixth directing credit of the series. The episode marked the first appearance of Will Ferrell's four-episode arc on the series and {{is also one of}} series star, Carell's last episodes as a regular on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Steve Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, [...] "The Inner Circle", to make Carell's transition easier. Carell had decided to leave the series, because [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for my character to go". Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell's last season, because he is [...] "a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell’s swan song". He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the 2004 film, [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and I took him to Crazy Horse. And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I was up there, I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé {{was trying to be}} [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
500|$|... "Goodbye, Michael" [...] {{was written}} by series {{developer}} and executive producer Greg Daniels, his 10th writing credit of the series. The episode was directed by Paul Feig, marking his 14th credit for the series. On June 28, 2010, {{it was confirmed that}} the seventh season of The Office would be Steve Carell's last. He had previously announced this while being interviewed on BBC Radio. [...] "I just think it's time... I want to fulfill my contract. When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons, and this coming year is my seventh. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for my character to go," [...] Carell was quoted as saying. In January 2011, it was announced that Carell would exit the show early, four episodes {{before the end of the}} season. A few weeks after this announcement came the news that Will Ferrell, who previously starred alongside Carell in , had signed on to appear in a four-episode arc as a Dunder Mifflin branch manager who temporarily takes Michael Scott's position in Scranton. To help ease the transition, Ferrell appeared in Carell's final episodes as well as one additional episode after he departs.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this decision, the Tennessee Supreme Court {{reversed}} the conviction on a technicality (that the jury should have fixed {{the amount of}} the fine), and the case was not retried. During the trial, Butler told reporters: [...] "I never had any idea my bill would make a fuss. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would become a law, and that everybody would abide by it and that we wouldn't hear any more of evolution in Tennessee." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, The Guardian {{published}} an article with a headline reading [...] "The Cure's original drummer asks to rejoin band." [...] However, Tolhurst called the article [...] "a little misleading" [...] saying:I have not asked RS to rejoin the Cure! I have my thing, he has his. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be fun to play the old songs together again especially as Michael and I {{had a great time}} playing the TIB songs this March in Europe.|$|R

I didn`t really think of teaching as a profession for me. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would pay the rent so I could do what I {{really wanted to do}} which was to sing and play ragtime piano in the piano bars.

500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If you follow the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Obama, Helle Thorning-Schmidt and David Cameron—the {{respective}} {{leaders of}} USA, Denmark and the UK faced criticism {{on social media}} that they had behaved inappropriately after posing for a [...] "selfie" [...] which was taken using Thorning-Schmidt's mobile phone. Defending her actions, Thorning-Schmidt said, [...] "There were lots of pictures taken that day, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bit fun. Maybe it also shows that when we meet heads of state and government, we too are just people who have fun." [...] Cameron said he was being polite when Thorning-Schmidt asked him {{to take part in}} the picture.|$|E
5000|$|... "Skinny Genes" [...] was mischievously {{inspired}} lyrically by an irritating but sexy boy. Doolittle {{described the}} song as having very light and happy but thoughtful lyrics, saying: [...] "I {{think about what}} I want to say, when I write songs." [...] Leonie Cooper of The Guardian described the song as having [...] "tell-it-like-it-is-lyrics". Doolittle explained [...] "Skinny Genes" [...] to BBC Radio's Steve Lamacq:The single is something I made up in my head. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be quite a funny scenario where you didn't like someone, if they were really annoying, but {{you had a good}} time under the sheets.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, the [...] "Secret Invasion" [...] storyline {{revealed}} that, {{with the}} exception of some flashback scenes, all of Jessica Drew's appearances in New Avengers {{over the past four years}} were actually made by a Skrull imposter. Writer Bendis said he had this planned since New Avengers #1. [...] You can go back to issue #1 and see hints. ... Now you know why the Spider-Woman series didn't happen. We <b>thought</b> about doing <b>it</b> and having her revealed as a Skrull in the first issue of her series. ... I wrote it, but in the end <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> wasn't selling somebody what they thought you were selling them.|$|R
5000|$|Dalelv {{reportedly}} regretted {{following that}} advice: [...] "I can't blame anyone else here but me, because nobody {{forced me to}} say it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wish <b>I</b> hadn't taken that advice". In {{an interview with the}} CNN, she said [...] "That was my biggest regret... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would all go away". She added: [...] "I took their advice but after I left the public prosecutor's office I was crying. I felt it was almost as bad as what had happened because I had to go against everything I believed and I believed in telling the truth". When the case did go to court, she reverted to her initial allegation of having been raped.|$|R

"When I ran the race," [...] Stallard said in Winning, [...] "I didn't think {{anything}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{something that would}} be taken up by others. I thought that, when the point had been proved, the NCU would be only too pleased to find that they'd got a bit of activity. It had all been above board. The police had never seen one, of course, but I just told them it was in conformity with international practice and races of this type were organised in all different countries and they had no queries at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Malone {{was picked}} in that season's Australian squad {{to play the}} West Indies for the third Test at Adelaide, {{replacing}} Terry Alderman, but was 12th man. He was discussed as a possibility for the 1982 tour of New Zealand. He did not tour, and announced his retirement from first class cricket. His final game was a one day match against Victoria where Malone took 3-19 off seven overs. Malone said [...] "I felt I was struggling {{to get into the}} Shield team and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to retire. I have no qualms about my decision and I could not have finished off on a better note by getting a wicket on the last ball I bowled." ...|$|E

Pickler says she first {{decided to go}} vegetarian for health reasons, but a TV ad that vegetarian Pamela Anderson did for animal rights group PETA piqued her curiosity. [...] "One night I couldn't sleep and I was up and just Googling random stuff and I'm like, 'Hmmm, PETA.' I saw all the videos and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> horrible. It's animal cruelty. A {{lot of it has}} to do with knowing what happens to the animals and it really bothered me and so I will not eat meat."

Paltrow and Martin have two children together: daughter Apple Blythe Alison Martin (b. 2004) and son Moses Bruce Anthony Martin (b. 2006). Paltrow explained Apple's unusual first name on Oprah, saying: [...] "It sounded so sweet and it conjured such a lovely picture for me – you know, apples are so sweet and they're wholesome and it's biblical – and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> sounded so lovely and ... clean!
