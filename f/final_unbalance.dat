30|$|The {{value of}} RE is usually {{provided}} by the system operator requirements but not always. The value affects all the matrix elements in (20) and (21) except for Ẑ_E and Ẑ_C, and the <b>final</b> <b>unbalance</b> factor can strongly {{be influenced by the}} length of the appropriate section (RE value is not dependent on the line length). Shorter lines (T 3 is the shortest one of all sections) can strongly be influenced by value of RE as depicted in Fig.  7.|$|E
30|$|Increasing {{electricity}} consumption {{is reflected in}} an increasing need to transmit higher and higher amounts of energy and a permanent expansion of existing transmission system. Land requirements and investments in a new part of transmission system can be greatly reduced by multi-circuit transmission lines on the same tower [1]. The lines can go {{side by side in}} their entire length or only in their part and transmission system becomes more and more interconnected. Line conductors on the same tower are placed close to each other, and currents flowing through them are affected by each other’s mutual impedances [2, 3]. Mutual impedances primarily depend on distances between conductors [4]. The distances are not the same between all conductors, and current unbalance arises in all affected lines [5]. <b>Final</b> value of <b>unbalance</b> can also be affected by other technical aspects such as the asymmetrical loads [6] or series compensation [7]. Unbalance is a complex problem of entire transmission system, and its reduction must also be solved in a complex way.|$|R
