5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in <b>her</b> <b>murder</b> investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} <b>her</b> <b>murder.</b> After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's family {{opposed the}} fictionalisation of <b>her</b> <b>murder,</b> though {{protests against the}} film were {{abandoned}} after it received financial backing from the New South Wales Film and Television Office. Blackrock was filmed {{over a period of}} two weeks at locations including Stockton, where Leigh was murdered, a decision that was opposed by local residents who said that memories of the murder were still fresh. While the film was never marketed as being based on a true story, numerous comparisons between the murder and the film were made, and many viewers believed it to be a factual account of the murder.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the {{allegations}} regarding the News of the World continued to receive {{coverage in the}} broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on BBC Radio 4) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered Millie Dowler had been hacked, and evidence for <b>her</b> <b>murder</b> enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage. Grant became something of a spokesman against Murdoch's News Corporation, culminating in a performance on BBC television's Question Time in July 2011.|$|E

5|$|Amaral {{was himself}} an arguido in {{relation}} to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano.

Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of <b>her</b> <b>murder</b> after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|Brian Joyce, the {{director}} of Newcastle's Freewheels Theatre in Education, approached playwright Nick Enright, encouraging him to create a play that explored themes around the 1989 {{rape and murder of}} Leigh Leigh in Stockton, a beach area of Newcastle.
