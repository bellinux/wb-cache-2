5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E
5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E

In his final years, he spurned and attacked Calvinism and organized religion generally. He was said to be agnostic.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} and analyse how the involvement of relatives is conditioned in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> from different critical perspectives. Gender perspectives, discourse analysis and intersectional theory are applied, based on social constructionist ontology. The thesis comprises three qualitative papers and data are based on ethnographically-focused fieldwork in three municipal <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of formal/informal interviews, participating observations and the analysis of documents. Based on gender perspectives, the routines and reasonings among nursing staff were studied and thematically analysed in relation to how these conditioned the involvement of relatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daily caring activities (I). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second study (II), <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff were interviewed in groups to describe, discursively analyse and identify <b>the</b> biopolitical meaning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> “involvement discourse” that was collectively constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speech of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff concerning <b>the</b> involvement of relatives. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last study (III), interviews with relatives were thematically analysed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of intersectional theory about their involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>The</b> findings show that the conditions for relatives’ involvement were dynamic and constantly in re-negotiation, but also conservative and inflexible. This placed relatives in both privileged and unprivileged social positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> which were relevant for their involvement. The relatives {{were considered to be}} “visitors”, which conditioned the characteristics and levels of involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> care of the residents and was linked to gendered notions of the division of labor, both within the groups of relatives and between nursing staff and relatives (I). The involvement of relatives was conditioned by the biopolitics of an “involvement discourse” that prevailed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> This built upon family-oriented rhetorics and metaphors that upheld and legitimised notions about relatives. The relatives were considered to be members of <b>the</b> “old” family <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> “new” family represented by <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff (II). <b>The</b> relatives described how they were positioned in a betweenship, squeezed between different competing social musts from the older family members, <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> as institutions and <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff (III). Inverting the prevailing picture of the involvement of relatives would make it possible to consider <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff as pedagogical, professional and caring “visitors” <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> for <b>the</b> benefit of the residents and their relatives. This could be achieved through a constructive change management which emphasises <b>the</b> learning of <b>nursing</b> staff, their responsibility and the emotions of relatives, along with a focus on alternative notions of involvement, where relatives are included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of quality of care in Swedish <b>nursing</b> <b>homes...</b>|$|R

25|$|On the October 3, 2009 {{episode of}} NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, McCaskill spoke about a {{vacation}} {{early in her}} career as a lawyer, where she was a contestant on High Rollers. McCaskill would reign as champion for four days, and later sold several of her prizes to pay off her student loan debt. In April 2002, McCaskill married St. Louis businessman Joseph Shepard. Shepard lent $1.6 million to McCaskill's 2004 gubernatorial campaign and also had business interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> industry. Because as state auditor McCaskill was responsible for auditing the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which regulates the state's nursing home system, Shepard's financial interests in the industry became an issue during the 2004 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
500|$|Nursing Homes: A second {{aspect to}} {{reimbursement}} {{pertains to the}} nursing home. In many cases, patients who are transferred {{to a nursing home}} from a hospital will have a portion of their nursing home stay reimbursed by Medicare. In these cases, Medicare is paying for some kind of rehabilitative care. Medicare will not reimburse any room and board coverage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> for patients on hospice.

500|$|However, the courts' role in {{protecting}} substantive legitimate expectations was clearly {{established by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999). The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her [...] "home for life". The Court granted the application for review {{on the ground that}} the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> as promised by the local authority. It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned, courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it (such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case). As regards substantive legitimate expectations, courts would decide whether cases lie [...] "... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field", or are those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". In the first situation, the public authority [...] "is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, when assessing a case in the second situation, the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy.|$|E
