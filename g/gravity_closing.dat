In the case of usual gauge field theories, there are well-known criteria to ensure their consistency at the quantum level, for example, the validity of the SlavnovTaylor identities.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{emergency}} aircraft control uses {{at least one}} engine and lateral fuel transfer that allows a pilot to regain control over an aircraft under emergency conditions. Where aircraft propulsion is available only through engines {{on one side of}} the aircraft, lateral fuel transfer provides means by which the center of gravity of the aircraft can be moved over to the wing associated with the operating engine, thus inducing a moment that balances the moment from the remaining engine, allowing the pilot to regain control over the aircraft. By implementing the present invention in flight control programming associated with a flight control computer (FCC), control of the aircraft under emergency conditions can be linked to the yoke or autopilot knob of the aircraft. Additionally, the center of gravity of the aircraft can be shifted in order to effect maneuvers and turns by spacing such center of <b>gravity</b> either <b>closer</b> to or farther away from the propelling engine or engines. In an alternative embodiment, aircraft having a third engine associated with the tail section or otherwise are accommodated and implemented by the present invention by appropriately shifting the center of gravity of the aircraft.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this work is {{to solve the problem}} of packing a set of {{shipments}} (various cuboid boxes) into containers of various shapes without wasting loading space. All the boxes have to be loaded and few are identical. As it is the case for all the packing problems, the packing has to satisfy geometry constraints: the items cannot overlap and have to lie entirely inside the bins. The richness of our application is to manage additional and common constraints: the bin weight capacity, the rotations of the boxes, the stability and the fragility of the boxes and the uniformity of the weight distribution inside the ULDs. The last constraint is crucial in air transportation: when ULDs are packed inside the airplane, the centre of gravity is computed assuming each ULD has a centre of <b>gravity</b> <b>close</b> to the geometrical centre of its basis. This type of constraints can be adapted to road transportation for the axle weight limits, which plays a key role since the weigh-in-motion systems become more common...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} {{intimate}} connection between (super-) <b>gravity</b> <b>close</b> to a spacelike singularity (the "BKL-limit") {{and the theory}} of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras. We show that in this limit the gravitational theory can be reformulated in terms of billiard motion in a region of hyperbolic space, revealing that the dynamics is completely determined by a (possibly infinite) sequence of reflections, which are elements of a Lorentzian Coxeter group. Such Coxeter groups are the Weyl groups of infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody algebras, suggesting that these algebras yield symmetries of gravitational theories. Our presentation is aimed to be a self-contained and comprehensive treatment of the subject, with all the relevant mathematical background material introduced and explained in detail. We also review attempts at making the infinite-dimensional symmetries manifest, {{through the construction of}} a geodesic sigma model based on a Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebra. An explicit example is provided for the case of the hyperbolic algebra E 10, which is conjectured to be an underlying symmetry of M-theory.
