BioPSE can be envisioned as a "computational workbench," in which a scientist can design and modify simulations interactively via a dataflow programming model. As opposed to the typical "o#-line" simulation mode (in which the scientist manually sets input parameters, computes results, visualizes the results via a separate visualization package, and then starts again at the beginning), BIoPSE "closes the loop" and allows interactive steering of the design, computation, and visualization phases of a simulation.

40|$|Non-crimp fabric (NCF) {{composites}} due {{to their}} excellent performance and relatively low cost have become an attractive alternative for aerospace, marine and even automotive applications. One {{of the features of}} the NCF composite is that it is an inherently multiscale material. Each layer due to stitching is divided in fiber bundles. On the microscale each bundle with orientation φ is a UD composite with a certain fiber content V fφ and the homogenized bundle properties may be calculated using micromechanics expressions for long fiber composites. On the mesoscale the bundle is considered as homogeneous transversely isotropic material surrounded by matrix and other bundles of the same or different orientation. A mesoscale characteristic of the composite is bundle content V b φ in the composite. Combining (multiplying) these two volume contents, V fφ and V bφ, average content of fibers in laminate with certain orientation, V faφ, can be obtained.

40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} by vertebrates {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and important plant–animal mutualisms, involving an enormous diversity of fruiting plants and frugivorous animals. Even though plant reproduction depends largely on seed dispersal, evolutionary ecologists have been unable to link co-occurring traits in fruits with differences in behavior, physiology, and morphology of fruit-eating vertebrates. Hence, the origin and maintenance of fruit diversity remains largely unexplained. Using a multivariate phylogenetic comparative test with unbiased estimates of odor and color in <b>figs,</b> we <b>demonstrate</b> that fruit traits evolve in concert and as predicted by differences in the behavior, physiology (perceptive ability) and morphology of their frugivorous seed dispersers. The correlated evolution of traits results in the convergence of general appearance of fruits in species that share disperser types.
