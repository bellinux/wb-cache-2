500|$|Competing at the 2008 US Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, Dix {{qualified}} for the 2008 Summer Olympics in both the 100 and 200m events. After recording a personal-best-equaling 9.93seconds in the 100m semifinals, he took second place behind Tyson Gay with a wind-assisted 9.80seconds.

The 200m favorite Gay suffered an injury in the qualifying rounds, and Dix and Crawford both finished the 200m final with 19.86seconds, with Dix elected the winner by a photo finish. After signing a sponsorship deal with Nike worth around $1,000,000 a year, described by his agent as [...] "the largest deal ever for a track athlete <b>just</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of college", Dix stated that his aims for the Olympics were personal bests in the individual sprints and a gold in the relay race.|$|E

It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was <b>just</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out.</b> But I still think it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was <b>just</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ...

2500|$|Skinny Puppy {{is noted}} for {{theatrical}} and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music, especially in an ambitious period that spanned their Head Trauma (1987-1988), VIVIsectVI (1988), Too Dark Park (1990), and Last Rights (1992) tours. Ogre {{has been critical}} of the bands early performances, telling Spin magazine in 1992 that [...] "I would do things on stage that would blow-they just wouldn't work". [...] Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy's performances, Ogre once remarked that [...] "our shows combine images with theater. It works better than <b>just</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> and doing a horror magic routine".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the fall}} {{campaign}} the Democrats hammered away at other issues, charging that Eisenhower had supposedly left our defenses in a weakened state, allowing the Soviets to pull {{ahead in the}} missile and space races. [...] This charge was to be repeated in the 1960 election and eventually proven false during the succeeding Kennedy administration. [...] Worst of all, for the GOP, the economy was only then <b>just</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of a brief, but sharp recession {{that began in the}} summer of 1957. [...] By the spring of 1958, industrial production had declined 14 percent and corporate profits fell 25 percent, resulting in unemployment peaking at 7.5 percent. [...] President Eisenhower's popularity, in turn, as measured by the Gallup poll tumbled from 79 percent in early 1957 to his lowest point ever of 52 percent in November 1958. [...] Tracking polls had shown that with the launching of Sputnik in October 1957, which seemingly indicated that the U.S. was behind the Soviets technologically, the Democrats popularity exceeded that of the GOP. [...] Aggravating this trend in the Deep South was the Republican Administration's stand in enforcing desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas that same year. [...] Further, when the average voter was asked by the Gallup Poll what his or her impression was of the Republican Party, the answers were [...] "selfish and rich" [...] and the [...] "businessman's party", while the Democrats were viewed as representing the middle class.|$|E

6000|$|This is a tolerably fair {{specimen}} {{of the success}} to which travellers, and the porters, and waiters, who [...] "speak English," [...] attain to, {{in their attempts to}} understand one another. In fact, the attempts of these domestic linguists to speak English are sometimes still more unfortunate than their attempts to understand it. One of them, in talking to Mr. George, said [...] "No, yes," [...] for no, sir. Another told Rollo that the dinner would be ready in fiveteen minutes, and a very worthy landlord, in commenting on the pleasant weather, said that the time was very agregable.

2500|$|Countertransference is {{a common}} problem in {{clinical}} settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their client’s pathology is [...] "self-evident". Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics {{during the course of}} therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients’ sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the [...] "newbie". Individuals <b>just</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, psychoeducation, and bibliotherapy for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years. Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles {{in the rest of the}} relationship blurs, a [...] "bleed-through" [...] problem has occurred. Therapists need to help clients resolve distress and deal with any underlying problems that led to the initial bleed-through.|$|E

It’s a label that works very much on artistic purity, it’s not one that takes and steers the artists in various ways of making the hit record. They just look at you for what your worth is in terms of the music that you present to them. They seem to become involved based on what they hear <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the speakers, not what you look like, what you’re image is. It’s <b>just</b> what’s <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of the speakers. If they can relate to that, then you can be a part of the Nothing organization. It’s a very respective and eclectic bunch of people that Trent has put together. He’s the man responsible for the signing on his label.|$|R

This construction was {{at about the}} same time his uncle Sir Maurice Denys (d. 1563) was rebuilding nearby Siston Court. The house was built on a natural promontory, probably originally selected for its defensible position, converted into an artificial plateau. It was rebuilt in 1750 by Berkeley's descendant Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt. It is situated about 1 1/2 miles south of the parish church of St. Michael, Stoke Gifford, and its parkland has now been intersected by the M32 motorway from which the present house of 1750, painted yellow, is a very prominent sight.|$|R

In 2014, Mason won the Soap Extra Award for Most Topical Storyline for Chris' coward punch storyline with Josh Willis. The character's inclusion in Neighbours and his storyline has received a positive reaction from the public, television critics and LGBT websites. Chris's <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> episode, which was broadcast on 10 August 2010, was seen by 679,000 viewers in Australia. David Knox of Citysearch Melbourne said that the inclusion of Chris in the show is [...] "a positive step with its juvenile audience". Knox added that following the [...] "gay kiss scandal" [...] on Home and Away, [...] "the test for Neighbours will be not <b>just</b> the <b>coming</b> <b>out,</b> but whether he remains in the show after this storyline subsides". Of Chris, SX News said [...] "One could simply dismiss the gay character as simply just another plot line, but there's no denying its significance, especially with a show as enduring and mainstream as Neighbours. If anything, it's a small reflection of the changing attitudes in society". They also praised Neighbours for focusing on Chris's <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> {{and the issue of}} homophobia, instead of letting Chris [...] "explode out of the closet and leave Ramsay Street glittering in sequins".|$|R

The game used the same graphics system as Magic Carpet, and as Magic Carpet evolved, Creations graphics were backwards engineered. An idea being explored was the possibility of linking Creation and Magic Carpet together: Magic Carpet would have had the player be able to jump into the water, and it would detect whether Creation was installed and load it if so, with the world being based on the Magic Carpet one the player had <b>just</b> left. <b>Coming</b> <b>out</b> of the water would send the player back.|$|R
