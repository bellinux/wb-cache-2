In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack.

One way they did this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big <b>Huge</b> Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E

2500|$|Following the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Gen.

Furthermore, the Confederate Congress held <b>Huger</b> accountable for the defeat at Roanoke Island.
