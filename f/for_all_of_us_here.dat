Speeches were given by his friends, {{and one on}} behalf of the Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. Those who could not get into the church due to overcrowding stood in the street with candles. Morley's friend said, [...] "This is the second time he was {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time, but <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> today he will be in the right place at the right time, which is a very special place in all of our hearts." [...] Livingstone said, [...] "David Morley was well known and well loved in London's lesbian and gay community." ...|$|E
5000|$|You know as Tony Kubek {{once said}} about Mickey Mantle [...] "Just {{as he was}} {{learning}} to say hello, he was saying goodbye!" [...] This {{is kind of the}} way we feel here at CBS Sports. It doesn't seem possible that our four years as the caretaker of the [...] "National Pastime" [...] are over, but here we are...saying goodbye. And in that short time, not only did we have probably one of the greatest World Series ever between Atlanta and Minnesota, the seven gamer, we had also had arguably, one of the greatest World Seriesgames the other night. And folks, how about this one tonight!? In all, and you're looking at them now, a lot of memories...a lot of good memories! And we hoped that you cherish these pictures and these sounds as much as we enjoyed bringing them right into your homes. Time to say goodbye, but knowing full well...that the grand ol' game will never say goodbye! It's just keeps rolling up...the memories! <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> at CBS Sports, I'm Pat O'Brien, thank you...for watching and...goodnight everybody! Host Pat O'Brien at the conclusion of CBS' coverage of the Game 6 of 1993 World Series and its four-year-long coverage of Major League Baseball as a whole.|$|E
5000|$|A {{federal lawsuit}} blamed MTC's South Texas prison's closure on [...] "abysmal mismanagement." [...] Prisoners responded to flooded toilets, rodents, {{overcrowding}} {{and the absence}} of basic services by engaging in all-out riot at the Willacy County Correctional Center in February 2015. Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates cited inadequate medical care and other difficulties for their refusal to comply with orders at the facility that had contracted with the FBOP to house low-risk, non-U.S. citizen inmates at the CAR prison. Initially, they simply refused to do routine chores or to eat breakfast. Then inmates burned some of the prison's massive, tent-like domed housing units. The FBOP terminated their MTC contract and Willacy County three weeks later and their action closed the prison. In a lawsuit filed in early December, officials with the county, which had revenues as high as $2.7 million a year from the prison operation under its arrangement with the FBOP and for-profit prison operator Management and Training Corp, claimed MTC failed to properly [...] "oversee, manage, and repair" [...] the facility and [...] "turned {{a blind eye to the}} enormous problems that plagued the Prison from its inception." [...] TheWillacy difficulties extended back several years. Before obtaining the CAR contract, the tent prison was an immigrant detention center that was alleged to harbor chronic sexual assault, physical abuse, and medical neglect. In 2011, months after immigration officials ended their contract with MTC, federal prison officials decided to send immigrants convicted of crimes (typically for criminal re-entry) to Willacy. The Texas ACLU had long alleged that private prison contractors running institutions such as Willacy chronically cut corners in order to boost shareholder profits. That invariably led to medical under-staffing and extreme cost cutting putting both prisoners and staff at risk. In 2014, the group documented complaints inside Willacy that caused it to be palpably dangerous. A prisoner said, [...] "They have a lot of people in here. Sometimes it smells. It's too many people. Some people even talk about burning this place down. They just don't have enough space <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here.</b> Sometimes it makes me go crazy." [...] The pleadings said that its inmates dealt with conditions so intolerable that some were forced to stay in solitary confinement, tensions growing higher inside as the problems escalated. MTC only posted a solitary guard to oversee each housing pod on each shift. [...] "The unacceptable conditions caused by mismanagement and its failure to take remediate them led to the riot on February 20, 2015." [...] Ultimately, this forced the prison to be vacated. It was declared [...] "uninhabitable" [...] by the BOP, due to MTC's failures. All 400 employees of the prison were discharged. The pleadings further claim MTC routinely failed to alert government officials about its problems there.|$|E

As you all know, just 1 year ago, Japan was hit by a series of {{earthquakes}} with a destructive strength we have not experienced in centuries. Sadly, many lives were lost {{as a result of these}} disasters. The subsequent nuclear incidents also contributed to major disruptions to daily activities <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>here</b> in Japan. I was afraid that under these circumstances, we could not expect many participants to attend this conference. I was also anxious as to whether distinguished scholars would be willing to accept our invitations to join us and give plenary talks. Unexpectedly, and very happily for us, most speakers I asked to give plenary or invited talks kindly accepted our invitation. Eventually, we secured 11 plenary speakers and 5 invited speakers, all of them important players in fields related to language evolution. Furthermore, we have more than 300 registered participants, making it one of the largest conferences in the history of Evolang! This is the 9 th Evolang conference, and our view of the language evolution field has been gradually changing. As a consequence, we took a number of new steps to mak...|$|E
