2500|$|From the {{wreckage}} of the museum, a sentinel begins to form. While Wolverine tries to stop the sentinel from maturing, he is thrown into the ocean. Shortly after, Wolverine swims on to Utopia and tells the mutant children that they need to leave. Cyclops tells the students to fight together and that they can beat the sentinel, but Wolverine objects to using children to fight battles. Cyclops doesn't listen and begins to prepare the students for combat. Shortly after Wolverine returns with a detonator to blow up Utopia and orders all remaining people on the island to evacuate. Cyclops and Wolverine's frustration with each other come to a head when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey saying that she never loved Wolverine and always feared him. Wolverine replies [...] "And if she were here right now, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would be more frightened of?" [...] The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel and as Wolverine claws into Cyclops visor, the students reappear on the battlefield to help them fight the sentinel. In the morning, Cyclops and Wolverine stand victorious with the students all living, but Wolverine cannot continue watching Cyclops use children as soldiers to fight these battles. Wolverine announces his departure from Utopia and indicates he will take any mutant on the island who wants to leave with him. While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides {{to stay out of the}} others business.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is so {{much more}} {{beautiful}} in the crescent, Mrs. Kendal?' said Genevieve, in the most wakeful manner.|$|E
60|$|After a little, Joan {{arrived and}} was brought in. She saw the rack, {{she saw the}} attendants, and the same picture which I had been seeing must have risen in her mind; but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> quailed, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> shuddered? No, {{there was no sign}} of that sort. She {{straightened}} herself up, and there was a slight curl of scorn about her lip; but as for fear, she showed not a vestige of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, of course, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> would say!" [...] exclaimed the big gentleman. [...] "Now I {{hope you}} are {{satisfied}} that I was right." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jake {{told him}} and he nodded. [...] "I made it half a point more to port, but this compass swivels rather wildly. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> bound?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now tell me, {{my little}} pet. When {{we saw that}} woman at Martigny, how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> carried it off? Did you see what she decided on in a moment?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Charming! {{he said in}} a finical sweet voice, {{showing his}} white teeth and {{blinking}} his eyes pleasantly. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was? Quite charming! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is EXCLUSIVE?" [...] I asked Hilda as we strolled on {{towards the}} stern, {{out of the}} spoilt child's hearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mrs. Norton said Jack was {{not invited}} to Sir Harry Griffin's because {{his father was a}} stock-jobber. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was right, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clarence is handsome, but worthless," [...] she {{continued}} in her sprightly way. [...] "I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> so very pretty, Mr. Hopper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a little}} {{difficult}} to follow, and Mr. Touchett considered it for a while. At last he said: [...] "Isabel's a sweet young thing; but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> so good as that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes--it's all right, Mr. Corwin; {{glad you}} did," [...] said Demorest, kindly but half nervously. [...] "And you saw Mrs. Demorest? Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> see her, and how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> was looking? As pretty as ever, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{nothing like}} it, sir,' replied Mr Lillyvick solemnly. 'How do you think,' whispered the collector, drawing him aside, 'how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> looks tonight?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Kitty is {{only going}} up for French and German. Miss Leverett is so angry. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> will do to me, Gill? Expel me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dangers! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> has any disease? She {{seems to}} be a healthy child enough, I'm sure. She has a lovely color in her cheeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{may make}} bold {{to assert that}} for persevering {{sharpness}} she beats all that I ever met, even in Yorkshire;" [...] and Mr. Kantwise looked at his new friend over his shoulder, {{and shook his head}} as though lost in wonder and admiration. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she's</b> <b>done</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> can? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> {{knows what}} she wishes herself until the last moment, until it is too late?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell you, Hester," [...] he said, gravely. [...] "By the bye, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> {{is likely}} to have {{mentioned}} my name to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're right," [...] said Julius frankly. [...] "And, in any case, it's the {{original}} I'm out after. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> can be, Sir James?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> will do?" [...] asked Tom {{when his}} brother had finished. [...] "Given the {{situation}} and the woman, it is rather a curious problem." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! that at least. Some persons {{affirm that}} she is semi-ROYAL. The country is full of broken-down royalty and nobility. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> has an aristocratic air?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Frank! oh, Blazes," [...] said Willie sadly, [...] "has money told on you so fearfully already? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> {{would give}} you up {{for the sake of}} Auberly's dross?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't tell," [...] {{he would}} say; [...] "it worries {{me out of}} my life. There'll be a scandal, and that'll do him no good. I shan't say {{anything}} to him. There might be nothing in it. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>She's</b> very artistic, they tell me. What? Oh, you're a 'regular Juley! Well, I don't know; I expect the worst. This is what comes of having no children. I knew how it would be from the first. They never told me they didn't mean to have any children--nobody tells me anything!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you must}} take me home, please," [...] said she. [...] "It was selfish of me. Only Mademoiselle Idiale is such a {{wonderful}} person. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> will want you every night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{there were}} any fairies, Patty would have been sure they had done {{something}} to her bed-cover, for when she proudly unrolled it, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> saw? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, no, {{she would}} not be quite prostrated,' murmured Swithin, recollecting himself. 'He was unkind to her in many ways. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> will go away from Welland?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When my Lady saw it, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> did? After {{looking on}} it for a bit, she put her arms round your wife's neck and kissed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not take my wife, sir? Indeed I shall. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{suppose that}} I {{would go away}} and leave my wife a {{pensioner}} on your bounty? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> would wish to desert her husband? I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> know your daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've scruples that I shouldn't have had, and you've {{ideas that}} I shouldn't have had either. You say Isabel {{wants to be}} free, and that her being rich will keep her from marrying for money. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she's</b> a girl to do that?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In December, popular US teen website Pop Dust called [...] "Want U Back" [...] the 25th Best Song of 2012. They {{wrote about}} it saying [...] "An entire {{timeline}} of Stockholm Syndrome in three-and-a-half minutes: Who is this manic muppet, and why is she grunting? Does she know he doesn’t want her back? At least she’s honest about her brattiness though, that’s refreshing. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she’s</b> in on the joke? Huh, it’s over already? OK, maybe just one more listen. Wait, why can’t I get her voice out of my head? Rimembah ol the things that <b>you</b> an’ oi <b>did</b> fuhst? No, stop {{looking at me like}} that, I’m just doing my Cher Lloyd impression".|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{could bear}} that better, but what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> asks of me now?--to give my little Aurelia, my {{beautiful}} darling, to that madman in the dark!" ...|$|E
6000|$|THE NEWSPAPER MAN. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> {{would give}} me a few words on How It Feels to be a Widow? Rather a good title for an article, isnt it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Marilda {{is always}} well. Rude health, her mother calls it. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> has sent you, Wilmet? A darling little watch! {{just like this}} one of mine!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know exactly. It seems {{odd that}} she should want to spend all her evening alone, and {{that she should}} have so many long letters to write. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> quite understands that you would like her to come down with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my mother,--yes; and you {{may tell}} me too, if you please, that Captain Culpepper was there. I do love my mother dearly; but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> could make up for your absence?" [...] And his voice was very tender, and so were his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Still Lady Annabel {{continued}} sighing deeply: {{at length}} {{she looked up}} and said, 'Does <b>she</b> love me? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> after all, <b>she</b> loves me?' ...|$|R
