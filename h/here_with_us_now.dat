40|$|Response to Townsend et al. | Korf {{radiological}} {{findings indicate}} disease {{that is currently}} present, whereas incidental genomic findings indicate disease that may some day be present. In fact, some of the radiological incidental findings do not diagnose disease; some are false positives {{that could lead to}} unnecessary invasive procedures. The time to discuss such incidental findings in radiology is when the clinician receives the radiology report, and is able to interpret the report in light of the patient’s clinical status, personality, and life experience. I posit that {{the same is true for}} genomic incidental findings, recognizing that the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations apply to a very narrow list of highly penetrant, well-annotated, and medically actionable findings. Townsend et al. 1 also raised the point that the working group did not seek input from consumers (patients). This possibility was considered, but it was difficult to know who actually speaks for the general public on this issue. We ultimately decided to begin the discussion with input from scientific and medical experts, realizing that the recommendations would serve as a reference point for many perspectives. Townsend et al. 1 suggest that the recommendations be withdrawn and revised. I do not believe that they should be withdrawn, but as we stated in the report, I anticipate that they will be refined and revised in response to additional input and evidence. I especially agree with them that further research on patient perspectives and decision making should be encouraged. The working group felt, however, that genome sequencing is <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now</b> and that some statement was needed to provide a guideline to laboratories and clinicians actively struggling with this question. I hope that the recommendations will come to be seen in that light...|$|E
