40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the issues in}} handling excess <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> {{in the region of}} Slovenian Istria. The reason for the studied subject was the planning of the trunk road Koper - Dragonja, for which a study of <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> handling was conducted. In this study, the main obstacle in defining suitable locations for disposal sites of excess <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> turned out to be encroachment on water and waterside land as well as erosion and landslide areas, which are governed by the Waters Act (ZV- 1, 2002). In fact, one or more water land areas – predominantly or torrential nature – were located on almost all potential locations for natural material disposal sites. In the thesis, we discuss the issue of <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> disposal site management and planning on water and waterside land as well as erosion and landslide areas. Initially, we presented the issue of handling excess <b>excavated</b> <b>material,</b> analysed the slope processes in Slovenian Istria and the statutory requirements related to managing and planning <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> disposal sites. We performed and analysed the interviews with selected representatives of the expert public, analysed and compared three related interventions of managing and planning <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> disposal sites, and we also conducted a spatial and technical analysis of the <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> disposal site test example in the region of Slovenian Istria in four design variations. With the help of asked hypothesis and testing of those we have shown that the induction of <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> disposal sites on water and waterside land as well as erosion and landslide areas should be based on analytical planning approach. Regulations should determine clear procedures and necessary permissions, which would at respecting the protection regimes, however, allow reflection on alternatives to landfill regulation of <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> in such areas...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the future railway link between Lyon (France) and Turin (Italy), it is proposed to use the highest part as possible of tunnel <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> as concrete aggregates. This objective will permit to prevent the excavation of new quarries, to limit the transport by road of <b>excavated</b> <b>materials,</b> and to avoid their definitive storage. Nevertheless, these <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> contain higher amounts of sulphates than those recommended by standards. The studies carried out leads to consider that several solutions can be proposed as washing materials before use, choosing appropriate cement, or using the <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> as a source of sulphates to control cement hydration...|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} {{of this research}} is formed by the availability of natural resource such as the abundance of C type <b>excavated</b> <b>material,</b> therefore the Regional Government of Sleman Regency has a right to manage the natural resource of C type <b>excavated</b> <b>material,</b> thus the Regional Government of Sleman Regency obtains an income in the form of Regional Tax. The authority of Sleman Regency to manage the natural resource of C type <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> is the realization of the prevailing of regional autonomy. By the regional authority to mange the mining activity of C type <b>excavated</b> <b>material,</b> it is expected that this mining activity can support the Regional Original Income of Sleman Regency. From this background can be drawn a question " Can the taking and the processing tax of c type <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> support the Regional Original Income of Sleman Regency?" This research is run using the empirical law research to get the primary and secondary data in the from of secondary law material and is analyzed qualitatively through the inductive thinking method. The result {{of this research is}} that the taking and the processing of C type <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> can support the regional original income of Sleman Regency. It is also experienced by the government of Purwobinangun Village, Pakem Subdistrict, Sleman Regency. The Purwobinangun Village administration obtains an income by coordinating the execution of mining activity of C type <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> in its territory. While the government of Sleman Regency obtains an income in the form of Regional Tax. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> of {{the future}} tunnel between Lyon and Turin present {{sulphate}} content higher than those recommended by current European standards. These sulphates can react with cement components and lead to damages in the concrete. Considering this specific problem and the necessity to use the <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> as aggregates, two studies were conducted. The first one focuses on <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> {{in order to assess}} the kinetic of sulphate release as a function of temperature and pH. The results highlight fast release kinetics when pH is higher than 5 and the temperature higher than 20 °C. The second one focuses on the behaviour of different mortars compositions in order to reduce or cancel any damage risk for the concrete. Considering the results, some promising solutions can thus be considered...|$|R

40|$|The 57 km length basis tunnel between St-Jean-de-Maurienne (France) and Susa (Italy) {{is a part}} of {{the future}} new railway Lyon-Turin. The works will {{generate}} about 43 Million tons of materials. To minimize the environmental impacts, the management of the <b>excavated</b> <b>material</b> become one of the basic issues of the sustainable development policy. A maximal valorisation of this material is then required. This valorisation could concern the transformation of <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> into concrete aggregates for the tunnel lining. Several studies have been carried out to evaluate the quality of the different types of materials which will be encountered into the tunnel. At this stage, 25 % of the <b>excavated</b> <b>materials</b> are supposed to be valorised as concrete aggregates. Nevertheless the excavation of one of the access tunnel also showed that some materials have a sulphate content higher than those allowed by the EN 12620 to be used as concrete aggregates. Considering the dedicated quantity, the LTF company has then decided to support a research project to find out possible solutions to use this “sulphated” material. There’s still a long road in front of LTF, but this first tests campaign is bringing the confirmation of a possible use of those kinds of material...|$|R
