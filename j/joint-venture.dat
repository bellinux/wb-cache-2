The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee {{the development and implementation of}} the Octopus card system, and was renamed as its current name of Octopus Cards Limited in 2002. Creative Star was formed as a <b>joint-venture</b> company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong—MTR Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, Kowloon Motor Bus, Citybus, and Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry. In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in the company was transferred to New World First Bus and New World First Ferry.

The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited. As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a <b>joint-venture</b> business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus. Since the Government of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited.|$|E

Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973. A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This article compares {{characteristics}} of physicians who {{have invested in}} health care business (joint ventures) to {{characteristics of}} physicians who have not, based on a survey of Florida physicians. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING. In early 1990, a survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of 1, 000 Florida physicians. Half {{were randomly selected from}} lists of <b>joint-ventured</b> physicians who had been identified as owners in a previous study by the Florida Health Care Cost Containment Board. The remaining half were assumed to be non-joint-ventured (although incomplete results from the previous study meant that some of these physicians would be joint ventured as well). We tagged survey variables with additional variables from the same year representing exogenous influences. STUDY DESIGN. The survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of physicians across specialty and geographic area, with half to identified <b>joint-ventured</b> physicians and half to a control group, some of whom were expected to be <b>joint-ventured.</b> Thus, results regarding differences would be understated. Key variables include referring versus nonreferring physician, to shed light on motivation for joint-venturing; clientele served, to see if systematic differences had implications related to access for poor or underserved persons; geographic area, to see if <b>joint-ventures</b> were undertaken to increase access in rural areas; and other practice variables such as size and type of practice. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS. Data from all received surveys were encoded and analyzed using SPSS. Incomplete surveys were also encoded so that all information would be available for possible use. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Results indicate that <b>joint-ventured</b> physicians are more likely than non-joint-ventured physicians to be referring physicians. Also, <b>joint-ventured</b> physicians report serving lower proportions of Medicaid and self-pay (uninsured) patients and higher proportions of Medicare patients. <b>Joint-ventured</b> physicians {{are also more likely to}} practice in urban areas, to practice full time, to be members of larger practices, and to practice in group practices. Further, <b>joint-ventured</b> physicians are more likely to practice in areas with high proportions of Medicare patients. CONCLUSIONS. Policymakers should continue to regard physician joint ventures as problematic, since results of this study indicate that physicians who engage in a joint venture almost always have the ability to refer patients to that joint venture due to the nature of their practices. Results also show that joint ventures are associated with decreased access: that is, they provide care to lower proportions of poor and underserved patients and rural patients than their non-joint ventured counterparts...|$|R
5|$|The {{company was}} bought by BSA in 1961 {{at a cost of}} £8.5million and became known in legal terms as BSA-Churchill Machine Tools Ltd. In October 1962 H G Sturgeon, OBE, {{previously}} managing director at de Havilland Aircraft, was appointed to the same position at Churchill; he moved on in 1964 to become managing director of the BSA group's Motorcycle division. In 1966 Churchill merged in a <b>joint-venture</b> agreement with Alfred Herbert and became part of Herbert-BSA Ltd, the intention being that the combined concerns would gain benefits from rationalisation and symbiosis of their activities. The general expectation – held also by the Department of Trade and Industry and the stock market – of rewards from the venture did not materialise and BSA sold its entire holding in August 1971, writing off £6.9M {{as a consequence of the}} need to have cash in hand to address issues elsewhere in its activities.|$|E
