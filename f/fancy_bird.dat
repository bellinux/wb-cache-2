50|$|Today, the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair {{as a whole}} sees over 320,000 visits {{including}} exhibitors, {{international and}} local guests. Over 6,000 animals arrive in Toronto each November, including over 4,900 head of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, and <b>fancy</b> <b>bird,</b> and over 900 horses and ponies, plus a display of crops and vegetables, educational exhibits, and feature attractions. The latter include the Burnbrae Food & Lifestyle Stage, which hosts local and international chef challenges, food sampling, and {{a wide variety of}} entertaining and decorating demonstrations during the day. Evening events include craft beer and cider competitions and Royal Champions Day, where guests can sample wine, cheese, and jams; the President's Choice Animal Theatre showcasing animals at work and play, including sheepherding, goats on the go, Spirit of the Horse, rabbit jumping, and President's Choice Superdogs; and the Royal Winter Gallery, which hosts top artists who demonstrate their different styles and techniques along with the opportunity for guests to learn to draw animals. The Royal Horse Show is a gala event that has been a cornerstone of the fair since its inception.|$|E

60|$|Evidence of {{the evil}} effects of close interbreeding can most readily be {{acquired}} {{in the case of}} animals, such as fowls, pigeons, etc., which propagate quickly, and, from being kept in the same place, are exposed to the same conditions. Now I have inquired of very many breeders of these birds, and I have hitherto not met with a single man who was not thoroughly convinced that an occasional cross with another strain of the same sub-variety was absolutely necessary. Most breeders of highly improved or <b>fancy</b> <b>birds</b> value their own strain, and are most unwilling, at the risk, in their opinion, of deterioration, to make a cross. The purchase of a first-rate bird of another strain is expensive, and exchanges are troublesome; yet all breeders, as far as I can hear, excepting those who keep large stocks at different places for the sake of crossing, are driven after a time to take this step.|$|R

6000|$|What man has {{effected}} within {{recent times}} in England by methodical selection is clearly shown by our exhibitions of improved quadrupeds and <b>fancy</b> <b>birds.</b> With respect to cattle, sheep, and pigs, we owe their great improvement {{to a long}} series of well-known names--Bakewell, Coiling, Ellman, Bates, Jonas Webb, Lords Leicester and Western, Fisher Hobbs, and others. Agricultural writers are unanimous on the power of selection: any number of statements to this effect could be quoted; a few will suffice. Youatt, a sagacious and experienced observer, writes (20/2. 'On Sheep' 1838 page 60.) the principle of selection is [...] "that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether." [...] A great breeder of Shorthorns (20/3. Mr. J. Wright on Shorthorn Cattle in 'Journal of Royal Agricult. Soc.' volume 7 pages 208, 209.) says, [...] "In the anatomy of the shoulder modern breeders have made great improvement on the Ketton shorthorns by correcting the defect in the knuckle or shoulder-joint, and by laying the top of the shoulder more snugly in the crop, and thereby filling up the hollow behind it...The eye has its fashion at different periods: at one time the eye high and outstanding from the head, and at another time the sleepy eye sunk into the head; but these extremes have merged into the medium of a full, clear and prominent eye with a placid look." ...|$|R

It {{was one of the}} most painful sights I ever saw, and I know I felt pretty nearly as much cut up at it as I do now. I hate to see dumb animals suffer. There is a sort of uncomplaining misery about them that appeals to one, at any rate appeals to me, infinitely. These poor fellows are suffering too, you will say. Yes, but they have their consolation. They promise themselves that as soon as they get into Paris they will join a corps and take vengeance on those who have hurt them. They may think, and perhaps with reason, that when the trouble is over, they will find their cottages still standing, and will take up life again as they left it.

60|$|The most {{curious fact}} is the perfect {{gradation}} {{in the size of}} the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is shown in (Plate 81) Figure 1, and the smallest in Figure 3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Figure 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Figure 4. The beak of Cactornis is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth sub-group, Camarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.

30|$|Some {{specific}} {{combinations of}} clinical data with imaging results and other findings can strongly support specific ILD diagnoses. A younger patient with nodular changes along bronchovascular structures and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on HRCT imaging is highly {{likely to have}} a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, and the presence of a significant lymphocytosis on a BAL cell count determination would be highly supportive of this diagnosis. A patient with clearly abnormal autoimmune serologies and either a NSIP or UIP pattern on HRCT imaging is likely to have CTD-ILD and may have a specific CTD diagnosis such as rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma that can be detected and confirmed via peripheral blood serologic testing. A patient with a significant exposure history to potential organic antigens (e.g. <b>bird</b> <b>fancier</b> or farmer) with a HRCT findings of upper lung field dominant centrilobular ground glass nodules, acute or subacute onset of symptoms (e.g. dyspnea, myalgias) is quite {{likely to have a}}cute HP, and this diagnosis is strongly supported by the findings of significant BAL lymphocytosis. Similarly, a patient with such an exposure history plus a subacute or chronic symptom onset and a HRCT that shows ground glass opacities or fibrotic changes with extensive mosaic attenuation due to air-trapping is likely to have chronic HP. Lastly, an older patient who presents with subacute or chronic disease onset and has bibasilar Velcro crackles on chest auscultation is highly likely to have IPF as their specific ILD diagnosis, and this diagnosis can be confidently confirmed if the HRCT shows a typical UIP pattern (peripheral and basilar predominance of fibrotic changes with reticulation and honeycomb change (Figure  1) and very little or no ground glass opacities) and alternative etiologies are lacking (e.g. presence of CTD, asbestosis, drug reaction with fibrosis).|$|R
5000|$|The {{remaining}} land-birds form a most singular {{group of}} finches, {{related to each}} other in the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage: there are thirteen species, which Mr. Gould has divided into four subgroups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so is the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group Cactornis, lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of Cactornis, the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of finches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater number, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two exceptions) are brown. The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr. Gould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus Geospiza is shown in Fig. 1, and the smallest in Fig. 3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Fig. 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks.

6000|$|Mark's nineteenth {{birthday}} rose in grey mist, slowly {{dropped its}} veil to the grass, and shone clear and glistening. He woke early. From his window {{he could see}} nothing in the steep park but the soft blue-grey, balloon-shaped oaks suspended one above the other among the round-topped boulders. It was in early morning that he always got his strongest feeling of wanting to model things; then and after dark, when, for want of light, it was no use. This morning he had the craving badly, {{and the sense of}} not knowing how weighed down his spirit. His drawings, his models--they were all so bad, so fumbly. If only this had been his twenty-first birthday, and he had his money, and could do what he liked. He would not stay in England. He would be off to Athens, or Rome, or even to Paris, and work till he COULD do something. And in his holidays he would study animals and birds in wild countries where there were plenty of them, and you could watch them in their haunts. It was stupid having to stay in a place like Oxford; but at the thought of what Oxford meant, his roaming <b>fancy,</b> like a <b>bird</b> hypnotized by a hawk, fluttered, stayed suspended, and dived back to earth. And that feeling of wanting to make things suddenly left him. It was as though he had woken up, his real self; then--lost that self again. Very quietly he made his way downstairs. The garden door was not shuttered, not even locked--it must have been forgotten overnight. Last night! He had never thought he would feel like this when she came--so bewildered, and confused; drawn towards her, but by something held back. And he felt impatient, angry with himself, almost with her. Why could he not be just simply happy, as this morning was happy? He got his field-glasses and searched the meadow that led down to the river. Yes, there were several rabbits out. With the white marguerites and the dew cobwebs, it was all moon-flowery and white; and the rabbits being there made it perfect. He wanted one badly to model from, and for a moment was tempted to get his rook rifle--but what was the good of a dead rabbit--besides, they looked so happy! He put the glasses down and went towards his greenhouse to get a drawing block, thinking to sit on the wall and make a sort of Midsummer Night's Dream sketch of flowers and rabbits. Someone was there, bending down and doing something to his creatures. Who had the cheek? Why, it was Sylvia--in her dressing-gown! He grew hot, then cold, with anger. He could not bear anyone in that holy place! It was hateful to have his things even looked at; and she--she seemed to be fingering them. He pulled the door open with a jerk, and said: [...] "What are you doing?" [...] He was indeed so stirred by righteous wrath that he hardly noticed the gasp she gave, and the collapse of her figure against the wall. She ran past him, and vanished without a word. He went up to his creatures and saw that she had placed on the head of each one of them a little sprig of jessamine flower. Why! It was idiotic! He could see nothing at first but the ludicrousness of flowers on the heads of his beasts! Then the desperation of this attempt to imagine something graceful, something that would give him pleasure touched him; for he saw now that this was a birthday decoration. From that it was only a second before he was horrified with himself. Poor little Sylvia! What a brute he was! She had plucked all that jessamine, hung out of her window and risked falling to get hold of it; and she had woken up early and come down in her dressing-gown just to do something that she thought he would like! Horrible--what he had done! Now, when it was too late, he saw, only too clearly, her startled white face and quivering lips, and the way she had shrunk against the wall. How pretty she had looked in her dressing-gown with her hair all about her, frightened like that! He would do anything now to make up to her for having been such a perfect beast! The feeling, always a little with him, that he must look after her--dating, no doubt, from days when he had protected her from the bulls that were not there; and the feeling of her being so sweet and decent to him always; and some other feeling too--all these suddenly reached poignant climax. He simply must make it up to her! He ran back into the house and stole upstairs. Outside her room he listened with all his might, but could hear nothing; then tapped softly with one nail, and, putting his mouth to the keyhole, whispered: [...] "Sylvia!" [...] Again and again he whispered her name. He even tried the handle, meaning to open the door an inch, but it was bolted. Once he thought he heard a noise like sobbing, and this made him still more wretched. At last he gave it up; she would not come, would not be consoled. He deserved it, he knew, but it was very hard. And dreadfully dispirited he went up to his room, took a bit of paper, and tried to write: ...|$|R
