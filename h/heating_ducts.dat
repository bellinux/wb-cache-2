5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's <b>heating</b> <b>ducts.</b> During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

50|$|Slab-on-grade or {{floating}} slab foundations are a structural engineering practice whereby the concrete slab {{that is to}} serve as the foundation for the structure is formed from a mold set into the ground. The concrete is then placed into the mold, leaving no space between the ground and the structure.

40|$|AbstractEarth {{air heat}} {{exchanger}} (EAHE) systems are insufficient to meet the thermal comfort requirements in winter conditions. The low heating potential of such systems can be improved by integrating the system with solar air <b>heating</b> <b>duct</b> (SAHD). The aim {{of this paper is}} to present a model to estimate the heating potential for EAHE system with and without SAHD. The model is generated using TRNSYS 17 simulation tool and validated against experimental investigation on an experimental set-up in Ajmer, India. The experiment was done during the winter season, where the system was evaluated for different inlet flow velocities, length and depth of buried pipe. From the experimentation, it was observed that the depth of 3. 7 [*]m is sufficient for pipe burial and the 34 [*]m length of pipe is sufficient to get optimum EAHE outlet temperature. It is also observed that increase in flow velocity results in drop in EAHE outlet temperature, while room temperature is found to increase for higher velocities (5 [*]m/s). The COP of the system also increased up to 6. 304 when assisted with solar air <b>heating</b> <b>duct.</b> The results obtained from the experiment data are in good agreement with simulated results within the variation of up to 7. 9 %...|$|R

50|$|Duct tape, {{sometimes}} called duck tape, is cloth- or scrim-backed pressure-sensitive tape, often coated with polyethylene.

One variation is black gaffer tape, which is designed to be non-reflective and cleanly removed, unlike standard duct tape. Another variation is heat-resistant foil (not cloth) duct tape useful for sealing heating and cooling ducts, produced because standard duct tape fails quickly when used on <b>heating</b> <b>ducts.</b> Duct tape is generally silvery gray, but also available in other colors and even printed designs.|$|E

5000|$|Services: Technological {{advances}} in heating, plumbing, lighting, communications, and elevators were all added into the White House {{during its first}} century-and-a-half. When the White House was constructed it had no indoor plumbing, on-site running water, fire fighting systems, electricity, or communications systems. Many of these were cut through major structural supports, including reducing wooden beams from 14 to 2 inches thickness.

50|$|Since {{warm air}} rises, basements are {{typically}} cooler {{than the rest}} of the house. In summer, this makes basements damp, due to the higher relative humidity.

A well-defined central heating system may minimize this requirement. <b>Heating</b> <b>ducts</b> typically run in the ceiling of the basement (since there is not an empty floor below to run the ducts). Ducts extending from the ceiling down to the floor help heat the cold floors of the basement. Older or cheaper systems may simply have the heating vent in the ceiling of the basement.|$|E

The bumpers were also bigger (and heavier), and there were new, blocky taillights at the rear. The Van also underwent the same facelift, although its delicate, high-mounted taillights still remained unchanged. The facelift also marked the introduction of a diesel-engined model (appearing in November), which provided a useful boost to the Florian's sales.

After the foursome square off Betty opens the safe (the combination written on her hand), but there is no will there, so she and Marc get the idea that the coveted document might be somewhere in Fey's secret love dungeon, thus giving the foursome the same idea, prompting Marc to tell Betty that she has something on her glasses, and then tosses them to the floor. He gives Henry a push, and grabs Wilhelmina. They run off and lock Henry and Betty in the office. As Henry decides that he and Betty should crawl through the building's <b>heating</b> <b>ducts</b> to get to the secret room, Wilhelmina is offended that she never knew about this place and that she was never invited there. In the dungeon, Marc finds the will that states that Wilhelmina would only get a share, but only after she marries Bradford. Meanwhile, {{in another part of the}} building, Henry falls through a grate and practically lands in L'Amanda's lustful arms. He distracts her long enough for Betty to make her escape, then he breaks free from L'Amanda's embrace.
