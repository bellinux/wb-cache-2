5|$|Yankees' offseason {{began in}} November 2008 with {{control over their}} {{organization}} shifting from long-time owner George Steinbrenner to his son Hal Steinbrenner. Notable player departures included Mike Mussina—who announced his retirement on November 20, 2008—as well as Bobby Abreu, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> and Carl Pavano, who all left as free agents. Notable free agent acquisitions included starting pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett, and first baseman Mark Teixeira. Another major addition was outfielder Nick Swisher, acquired in a trade with the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Bonds' trainer, Greg Anderson and BALCO head Victor Conte (also {{connected}} to <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> and Canseco), were not subpoenaed in California by the House Committee for investigation.|$|E
25|$|The Rays had {{discussions with}} free agents for a {{designated}} hitter, including <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> Bobby Abreu and Milton Bradley. They also considered re-signing Baldelli {{as a full-time}} DH. However, on January 5, 2009, they signed ex-Phillie left fielder Pat Burrell to a two-year deal worth $16 million.|$|E
50|$|On August 8, Justin and Melvin homered in {{the same}} game for the fifth time, setting a new Major League record for brothers. The Uptons {{previously}} shared the record of four with two pairs of brothers: Vladimir and Wilton Guerrero, and <b>Jason</b> and Jeremy <b>Giambi.</b>|$|R

25|$|Oakland Athletics {{general manager}} Billy Beane is upset by his team's {{loss to the}} New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the {{impending}} departure of star players Johnny Damon, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002, but must overcome Oakland's limited payroll.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Jose Canseco {{released}} a tell-all book, , about {{his experience with}} steroids in his career. In the book, Canseco named several other players, including Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, Juan Gonzalez and <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> as steroid users. The book caused great controversy, {{and most of these}} players have claimed Canseco's implications to be false, though McGwire and Giambi have since admitted to using PEDs, and Palmeiro has tested positive.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 offseason, the A's traded {{promising}} young star OF Carlos González, closer Huston Street and starting pitcher Greg Smith for Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies. On January 6, 2009, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> signed a one-year, $4.6 {{million contract with}} a 2nd year option. Giambi said {{he was glad to}} be back as he put on his old number 16. Also signed were infielders Orlando Cabrera of the Chicago White Sox and Nomar Garciaparra of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The first half of the season the team played relatively poor, but finished the second half strong, yet still posting a losing record. Holliday was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for prospects and Giambi was released in August after spending time on the DL.|$|E
25|$|Alumni {{and former}} {{students}} have {{also participated in}} the world of sports. <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> Evan Longoria, Troy Tulowitzki, Harold Reynolds, Jered Weaver, and Steve Trachsel have all been selected to play in the Major League Baseball All Stars games. Matt Duffy won the World Series with the 2014 San Francisco Giants and continues to play third base for the Giants. Golfer Mark O'Meara (BA 1980) won the Masters Tournament and The Open Championship.

25|$|The {{month of}} May {{ushered in a}} new era for the Dodgers as the sale of the team by Frank McCourt to Guggenheim Baseball Management was finalized. The Dodgers then won their first game under the new {{management}} that night against the Rockies. Ted Lilly worked six strong innings and the Dodgers built a 7–0 lead thanks to homers by Dee Gordon (the first of his career) and Andre Ethier and then held on to win 7–6 after the bullpen allowed the Rockies to catch up. Javy Guerra picked up his eighth save to preserve the win. The Dodgers lost the final game of the series against the Rockies, 8–5, when <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> hit a walk-off three-run homer against Scott Elbert. Jerry Hairston, Jr. fell a double short of the cycle in the opener of a series against the Chicago Cubs on May 4 but the Dodgers still lost 5–4. Chris Capuano pitched seven scoreless innings the next day and the Dodgers ended their brief two-game losing streak with a 5–1 win. Another costly blown save by Javy Guerra cost the Dodgers in the finale, which they lost 4–3 when Jamey Wright walked in the winning run in the 11th inning.|$|E
500|$|Longoria drew {{a record}} nine million votes for his selection, over second-place {{finisher}} Jermaine Dye. <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> finished in third after {{a highly publicized}} [...] "Support the 'Stache" [...] campaign. Brian Roberts finished in fourth, followed by José Guillén. Hart accumulated eight million votes, the second highest vote total in the competition's history. Hart joined teammates outfielder Ryan Braun and pitcher Ben Sheets. Finishing in a close second was New York Mets third baseman David Wright, who eventually made the team {{as a replacement for}} injured Chicago Cubs outfielder Alfonso Soriano.|$|E
500|$|Ramirez began 2009 at {{a highly}} {{productive}} pace as well. Through May 7, he was batting [...]348 with 6 {{home runs and}} 20 RBI. But on that date, Ramirez was suspended 50 games for violating the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program established by MLB and the MLB Players Association in 2004. In the announcement by MLB, Ramirez was suspended for unspecified violation of the agreement section 8.G.2. Shortly afterward, Ramirez stated that a physician had unknowingly prescribed a banned medication. After consulting with the players association, Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension. According to an ESPN report, the drug used by Ramirez was human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a women's fertility drug typically used by steroid users to restart their body's natural testosterone production as they come off a steroid cycle. It is similar to Clomid, the drug <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> and others used as clients of BALCO. Testing revealed artificial testosterone, too. As a condition for returning from the suspension, Ramirez was subject to three additional drug tests per year {{in addition to the}} minimum of two per player.|$|E
500|$|On April 26, 2003, Huff {{had four}} hits in a 10–7 {{victory over the}} Baltimore Orioles. After playing mostly first and third base in April, he took over from George Lombard as the Devil Rays' right fielder for the {{remainder}} of the season on April 29. On May 3, he had the first multihomer game of his career by hitting two two-run home runs against Adam Bernero in an 8–6 victory over the Tigers. He had four hits on June 4 in a 5–2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. In the first game of a doubleheader on June 17, Huff had four RBI in an 11–2 victory over the Yankees. On July 2, he had all four Devil Rays' RBI and hit a three-run home run against Pedro Martínez in a 5–4 loss to the Red Sox. On September 3, he hit a three-run home run against Freddy García and had four RBI in a 7–0 victory over the Seattle Mariners. On September 6, he stole home plate in a 74 victory over the Oakland Athletics. On September 23, he had four hits and hit a home run against Josh Towers in an 8–5 loss to the Blue Jays. In 162 games (tied for second in the AL with Miguel Tejada behind Hideki Matsui's 163), he batted [...]311 (ninth) with 47 doubles (third behind Garret Anderson's and Vernon Wells's 49), 34 home runs (ninth), and 107 RBI (tied for eighth with <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi).</b> Huff's single-season totals in hits, doubles, home runs, and RBI have been matched by eleven players in major league history as of 2012. He was tied for 24th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting along with Esteban Loaiza and Jason Varitek. Defensively, he tied with Tim Salmon for the lead in errors by AL right fielders with six.|$|E
500|$|Before the 2008 season, Huff {{switched}} {{his uniform}} number from 19 to 17 {{in honor of}} his former teammate Joe Kennedy, who died during the offseason. He angered fans in the offseason when he called Baltimore a [...] "horse----" [...] town when compared to Tampa, but he regained fan support {{by the end of the}} year by posting one of his best seasons. He was the Orioles' designated hitter for most of the season, although he was moved to third base at the end of August following an injury to Melvin Mora. On April 2, he hit a two-run home run against Matt Garza and a game-winning two-run double against Al Reyes in a 96 victory over Tampa Bay. On April 8, he had four hits and four RBI in an 81 victory over the Rangers. On July 3, he had three hits, three RBI, and two home runs against Kyle Davies in a 107 loss to the Royals. He was named AL Player of the Week from June 30 to July 6 after hitting [...]345 with three home runs and nine RBIs. On August 27, he had three hits and three RBI, including a two-run home run against Lance Broadway in an 113 victory over the White Sox. Two days later, he had two hits, including a three-run home run against Andy Sonnanstine in a 109 loss to Tampa Bay. He was named the Player of the Week again from August 25–31 after batting [...]478 with two home runs and seven RBI. He hit a grand slam against Juan Rincón on September 8 in a 143 victory over Cleveland. In 154 games, Huff batted [...]304 with 182 hits (tied with Nick Markakis for 10th in the league), 48 doubles (tied with Markakis for third in the league behind Dustin Pedroia's 54 and Brian Roberts's 51), 33 home runs (tied for eighth with <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> and Josh Hamilton), and 108 RBI (sixth). He finished 16th in AL MVP voting and was named [...] "Most Valuable Oriole" [...] by Baltimore sportswriters. He won the Silver Slugger Award for DH and the Edgar Martínez Award, becoming the first Oriole to win the award since Tommy Davis in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, a major scandal arose {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that a company called BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), owned by Victor Conte, had been producing so-called [...] "designer steroids", (specifically [...] "the clear" [...] and [...] "the cream") which are steroids that could not be detected through drug tests at that time. In addition, the company had connections to several San Francisco Bay Area sports trainers and athletes, including the trainers of <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> and Barry Bonds. This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports. Among the many athletes who have been linked to BALCO are Olympic sprinters Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones, Olympic shot-putter C. J. Hunter, and Major League Baseball players <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> and Barry Bonds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nutrition}} center BALCO {{was accused}} of distributing steroids to many star players, most notably Barry Bonds and <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi.</b> Baseball has attempted to toughen its drug policy, beginning a plan of random tests to players. Players such as Ryan Franklin and others were handed suspensions as short as ten days. [...] However, a Congressional panel continued {{to argue that the}} penalties were not tough enough, and took action.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, Hart {{teamed up}} with Cory McCormack, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> Benji Madden and Joel Madden to create Las Vegas nightclub [...] "Wasted Space". The club was {{designed}} by Hart, McCormack and Zeff Design. Wasted Space was voted Best New Bar in Vegas 2008. Also in 2008, Hart released [...] "Inked: The book" [...] which covered individuals stories behind their tattoos, including Carey's own story and his father's Tom Hart. In late 2008 Hart & Huntington's Cabo store was closed.|$|E
2500|$|... 3rd Baseman Evan Longoria {{was named}} to the American League All-Star roster on July 10. This meant that {{it would be the first}} time the Rays would ever send three players to the All-Star Game. Longoria was voted into the roster by the All-Star Final Vote, where fans vote for one of five players for each league to be the final players {{selected}} for the All-Star Game. The chance to vote began on July 6 after the initial All-Star lineups were announced. Longoria was reported to have received over 9 million votes out of 47.8 million total votes cast. He won over Jermaine Dye, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> Brian Roberts, and José Guillén.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Canseco {{admitted}} to using anabolic steroids with Jorge Delgado, Damaso Moreno and Manuel Collado in a tell-all book, [...] Canseco also claimed {{that up to}} 85% of major league players took steroids, a figure disputed {{by many in the}} game. In the book, Canseco specifically identified former teammates Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> Iván Rodríguez and Juan González as fellow steroid users, and admitted that he injected them. Most of the players named in the book initially denied steroid use, though Giambi {{admitted to}} steroid use in testimony before a grand jury investigating the BALCO case and on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted publicly to using steroids.|$|E
2500|$|This {{period in}} Oakland history {{featured}} splendid performances from {{a trio of}} young starting pitchers: right-hander Tim Hudson and left-handers Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. Between 1999 and 2006, the so-called [...] "Big Three" [...] helped the Athletics to emerge into a perennial powerhouse in the American League West, combining for a collective record of 261–131. They gave the Athletics a 1–2–3 punch to add to talented infielders and potent hitters, such as first baseman <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> shortstop Miguel Tejada, and third baseman Eric Chavez. Giambi was named American League MVP in 2000, and Tejada won an MVP Award of his own in 2002, a year which also saw Zito win 23 games and the Cy Young Award.|$|E
2500|$|Former Yankee {{third baseman}} Scott Brosius was notorious for not {{responding}} {{immediately to the}} roll call, as other players on the diamond would. Sometimes he would even wait {{as long as a}} minute to respond, getting a kick out of the persistence of the Creatures. In Hideki Matsui's first game at the Stadium in 2003, the chant of [...] "MAT-SU-I!" [...] went on for approximately two minutes, because {{he did not know what}} was going on or how to react. In a 2009 press conference, former Yankees first baseman <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> said that [...] "The biggest thing I miss is (the Bleacher Creatures') roll call. There's no doubt about it, it's the best thing in baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chain's {{image has}} also made it popular in more {{non-traditional}} ways. For example, In-N-Out is still considered acceptable in some areas with a strong opposition to corporate food restaurants, such as McDonald's. Local business leaders in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf district said they opposed every other fast food chain except In-N-Out, {{because they wanted to}} maintain the flavor of family-owned, decades-old businesses in the area, with one saying locals would ordinarily [...] "be up in arms about a fast-food operation coming to Fisherman's Wharf," [...] but [...] "this is different." [...] California native and Colorado Rockies player <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> would often visit In-N-Out Burger when on the West Coast with his former team, the New York Yankees. He said he tried to open an In-N-Out Burger restaurant in New York, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
2500|$|Rodriguez hit his 549th {{home run}} in a September 3, 2008 game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The {{opposing}} manager objected that the ball was foul, {{and for the first}} time in MLB history, instant replay (a process officially introduced a few days earlier) was used to review the play and uphold the umpires' ruling. [...] He was one of only four batters in the AL to have at least 18 home runs and 18 stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with Torii Hunter, Ian Kinsler, and Grady Sizemore. Rodriguez hit a home run every 14.6 at-bats in 2008, the second best ratio on the team behind <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi.</b> Rodriguez played 138 games during the 2008 season with a [...]302 average, 35 home runs, 103 RBI, and an AL best [...]573 slugging percentage.|$|E
2500|$|Clemens has {{received}} criticism for receiving special treatment from {{the teams that}} sign him. While playing for Houston, Clemens was not obliged to travel with the team on road trips {{if he was not}} pitching. His 2007 contract with the New York Yankees had a [...] "family plan" [...] clause that stipulated that he not be required to go on road trips in which he was not scheduled to pitch and allowed him to leave the team between starts to be with his family. These perks were publicly criticized by Yankee reliever Kyle Farnsworth. Most of Clemens' teammates, however, did not complain of such perks because of Clemens' success on the mound and valuable presence in the clubhouse. Yankee teammate <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> spoke for such players when he said, [...] "I'd carry his bags for him, just as long as he is on the mound." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{unsuccessful}} {{nature of}} the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez's sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006, Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the New York Post Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi.</b> Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname [...] "The Cooler" [...] among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves. According to Yankee manager Joe Torre's 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname [...] "A-Fraud" [...] from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands. [...] "It was [...] in front of him", Torre later said of the nickname. [...] "A lot of that stuff {{that went on in}} the clubhouse was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff", he explained.|$|E
2500|$|After the Yankees {{failed to}} make the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1993, General Manager Brian Cashman made clear that there would be offseason changes. [...] Mike Mussina retired from {{baseball}} on November 20, 2008. [...] Infielder Wilson Betemit was traded to the Chicago White Sox in a trade for Nick Swisher on November 13, 2008. [...] The Yankees declined options on first baseman <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi</b> and starting pitcher Carl Pavano. [...] Giambi went on to sign a one-year deal with the Oakland Athletics on January 1, 2009, and Pavano signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Indians on January 6, 2009. Right fielder Bobby Abreu signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and catcher Iván Rodríguez signed a one-year pact with the Houston Astros. From those departures, the Yankees shed nearly $89million from their payroll, enabling them to spend money to fix their team. Furthermore, the Yankees non-tendered the contracts of Chris Britton and Justin Christian, allowing them to become free agents; Britton signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres and Christian signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Jose Canseco {{published}} , admitting steroid {{usage and}} claiming {{that it was}} prevalent throughout major league baseball. When the United States Congress decided to investigate the use of steroids in the sport, some of the game's most prominent players came under scrutiny for possibly using steroids. These include Barry Bonds, <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> and Mark McGwire. Other players, such as Canseco and Gary Sheffield, have admitted to have either knowingly (in Canseco's case) or not (Sheffield's) using steroids. In confidential testimony to the BALCO Grand Jury (that was later leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle), Giambi also admitted steroid use. He later {{held a press conference}} in which he appeared to affirm this admission, without actually saying the words. And after an appearance before Congress where he (unlike McGwire) emphatically denied using steroids, [...] "period", slugger Rafael Palmeiro became the first major star to be suspended (10 days) on August 1, 2005 for violating Major League Baseball's newly strengthened ban on controlled substances, including steroids, adopted on August 7, 2002, starting in the 2003 season. Many lesser players (mostly from the minor leagues) have tested positive for use, as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Indians {{entered the}} 2013 season {{following}} an active offseason {{that resulted in}} a dramatic roster turnover. [...] Key acquisitions included free agent 1B/OF Nick Swisher and CF Michael Bourn. The Indians also added prized right handed pitching prospect Trevor Bauer, OF Drew Stubbs, and relief pitchers Bryan Shaw & [...] Matt Albers in a three-way trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds that sent RF Shin-Soo Choo to the Reds, and Tony Sipp to the Arizona Diamondbacks Other notable additions included utility man Mike Aviles, catcher Yan Gomes, designated hitter <b>Jason</b> <b>Giambi,</b> and starting pitcher Scott Kazmir. [...] The 2013 Indians were able to increase their win total by 24 over 2012 (from 68 to 92), finishing in second place behind Detroit by one game in the Central Division, and securing the number one seed in the American League Wild Card standings. [...] This marked the Indians' first time in postseason play since 2007. [...] The 2013 season ended for the Indians on October 2, losing 4–0 to the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2013 AL Wild Card Game. [...] The turnaround from 2012 also led to Francona winning the 2013 American League Manager of the Year Award.|$|E
