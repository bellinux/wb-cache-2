5|$|After David II's death, Robert II, {{the first}} of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was {{followed}} in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the regnal name Robert III. During Robert III's reign (1390–1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother, Robert Stewart, <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Albany. After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Albany) of his elder son, David, <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future James I, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Albany; and later his son Murdoch.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was born}} at Schloss Rosenau, near Coburg, Germany, the second son of Ernest III, <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and his first wife, Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Albert's future wife, Victoria, was born earlier {{in the same year}} with the {{assistance}} of the same midwife. Albert was baptised into the Lutheran Evangelical Church on 19 September 1819 in the Marble Hall at Schloss Rosenau with water taken from the local river, the Itz. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld; his maternal grandfather, the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg; the Emperor of Austria; the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Teschen; and Emanuel, Count of Mensdorff-Pouilly. In 1825, Albert's great-uncle, Frederick IV, <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, died. His death led to a realignment of Saxon duchies the following year and Albert's father became the first reigning <b>duke</b> <b>of</b> Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.|$|E

5|$|As {{the eldest}} son of the British sovereign, he was {{automatically}} <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Cornwall and <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Rothesay at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Saxony. He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester on 8 December 1841, Earl of Dublin on 17 January 1850, a Knight of the Garter on 9 November 1858, and a Knight of the Thistle on 24 May 1867. In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in favour of his younger brother, Prince Alfred.|$|E
5|$|At The Hague, Charles {{had a brief}} {{affair with}} Lucy Walter, who later falsely claimed that they had {{secretly}} married.

5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York; William, the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Clarence and the <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. The <b>Duke</b> <b>of</b> York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E
