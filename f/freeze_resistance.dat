In this work castor oil (CO) and palm olein (PO) polyols were synthesized and partially used as renewable feedstock for the manufacturing of polyurethane plasticizing resin for printing ink applications. The chemical structure of the prepared polyols and polyurethanes were characterized using IR spectra and GPC and their solubility in common solvents was tested.

Here, we assessed the acclimation potential of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) during winter. We specifically asked (i) how do beech populations growing in contrasting climates {{differ in their}} maximum <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance,</b> (ii) do differences result from genetic differentiation or phenotypic plasticity to preceding temperatures and (iii) is beech at risk of freezing damage in winter across its distribution range. We investigated the genetic and environmental components of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in buds of adult beech trees from three different populations along a natural large temperature gradient in north-western Switzerland, including the site holding the cold temperature record in Switzerland. <b>Freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of leaf primordia in buds varied significantly among populations, with LT 50 values (lethal temperature for 50 % of samples) ranging from − 25 to − 40  °C, correlating with midwinter temperatures of the site of origin. Cambial meristems and the pith of shoots showed high <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in all three populations, with only a trend to lower <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> at the warmer site. After hardening samples at − 6  °C for 5 days, <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of leaf primordia increased in all provenances by up to 4. 5  K. After additional hardening at − 15  °C for 3 days, all leaf primordia were freezing resistant to − 40  °C. We demonstrate that <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of F. sylvatica has a high ability to acclimate to temperature changes in winter, whereas the genetic differentiation of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> among populations seems negligible over this small geographic scale but large climatic gradient. In contrast to the assumption made {{in most of the}} species distribution models, we suggest that absolute minimum temperature in winter is unlikely to shape the cold range limit of beech.

40|$|Assessing {{freezing}} community {{response and}} whether <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> {{is related to}} other functional traits is essential for understanding alpine community assemblages, particularly in Mediterranean environments where plants are exposed to freezing temperatures and summer droughts. Thus, we characterized the leaf <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of 42 plant species in 38 plots at Sierra de Guadarrama (Spain) by measuring their ice nucleation temperature, freezing point (FP), and low-temperature damage (LT 50), as well as determining their <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> mechanisms (i. e., tolerance or avoidance). The community response to freezing was estimated for each plot as community weighted means (CWMs) and functional diversity, and we assessed their relative importance with altitude. We established the relationships between <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance,</b> growth forms, and four key plant functional traits (i. e., plant height, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and seed mass). There was {{a wide range of}} <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> responses and more than in other alpine habitats. At the community level, the CWMs of FP and LT 50 responded negatively to altitude, whereas the functional diversity of both traits increased with altitude. The proportion of freezing-tolerant species also increased with altitude. The ranges of FP and LT 50 varied among growth forms, and only the leaf dry matter content correlated negatively with freezing-resistance traits. Summer freezing events represent important abiotic filters for assemblies of Mediterranean high mountain communities, as suggested by the CWMs. However, a concomitant summer drought constraint may also explain the high <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of species that thrive in these areas and the lower functional diversity of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> traits at lower altitudes.

40|$|A current {{problem for}} {{aquaculture}} of salmonid fish in Atlantic Canada is the susceptibility of these fish to cold water temperatures and ice. The development of freeze resistant salmon, therefore, would extend {{the range of}} salmon sea-pen aquaculture in Atlantic Canada. Previous attempts at producing freeze resistant transgenic salmon by introducing the type I antifreeze protein (AFP) gene from winter flounder have yielded much optimism (Fletcher et al., 1988). The AFP activity in the resulting transgenic salmon, however, was too low to confer <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> to the fish (Hew et al., 1992). One possible reason for {{this may be due}} to the lack of an enzyme in salmon necessary to cleave the proAFP form of the type I AFP to produce the fully active mature protein.

40|$|The {{rainbow smelt}} (Osmerus mordax) {{is a small}} {{anadromous}} fish that actively feeds under the ice at temperatures as low as the freeze point of seawater. Freezing is avoided through the production of both non-colligative antifreeze protein (AFP) and glycerol that acts in a colligative manner. Glycerol is constantly lost across the gills and skin, thus glycerol production must continue on a sustained basis at low winter temperatures. AFP begins to accumulate in early fall while water temperatures are still high. Glycerol production is triggered when water temperatures decrease to about 5 20 C. Glycerol levels rapidly increase with carbon flow from dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glycerol 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) to glycerol. Glucose/glycogen serves as the initial carbon source for glycerol accumulation with amino acids contributing thereafter. The period of glycerol accumulation is associated with increases in GPDH mRNA and PEPCK mRNA followed by elevations in protein synthesis and enzyme activities. Plasma glycerol levels may reach in excess of 500 mM in winter. The high <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> allows rainbow smelt to invade water of low temperature and forage for food. The lower the temperature, the higher the glycerol must be, and the higher the glycerol the greater the loss to the environment through diffusion. During the winter, rainbow smelt feed upon protein rich invertebrates with glycerol production being fueled in part by dietary amino acids via the gluconeogenic pathway. At winter temperatures, glycerol is quantitatively more important than AFP in providing <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> of blood; however, the importance of AFPs to other tissues {{is yet to be}} assessed. Glycerol levels rapidly plummet in the spring when water temperature is still close to 0 20 C. During this period, <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> must be provided by AFP alone. Overall, the phenomenon of glycerol production by rainbow smelt reveals an elegant connection of biochemistry to ecology that allows this species to exploit an otherwise unavailable food resource.

Across all five species tested from three functional groups, the mean temperature at which all leaves were damaged (T 100) significantly (P[*]=[*] 0. 016) increased from − 9. 6 to − 8. 5 [*]°C under elevated CO 2 [*], and a similar marginally significant (P[*]=[*] 0. 079) reduction was observed for the mean temperature that caused 50 % leaf damage (T 50), from − 6. 7 to − 6. 0 [*]°C. The mean temperature at which initial leaf damage was observed (T 0) was not significantly influenced by elevated CO 2 [*]. Although concentrations of soluble sugars (+ 25 %,P [*]=[*] 0. 042), starch (+ 53 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 001), and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC, + 40 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 001) were significantly higher under elevated CO 2 [*], leaf <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> actually decreased under elevated CO 2 [*].

Franco) was investigated at about ten-day intervals from summer {{until the following}} spring. Tissues from growing twigs collected before development of dormancy had no <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> and were killed immediately after subcooling. Tissues {{at the base of}} inner bud scales and in the pith of stems at the base of buds were among the last to harden in autumn. Pith parenchyma and pith rays of the interfascicular region of the bud trace and the transfusion tissue in needles were most susceptible to injury after development of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Abaxial mesophyll was more susceptible to injury than adaxial mesophyll of hardened needles. The cortex was more resistant than other tissues during development of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> but parenchyma of the pith lost <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> more slowly and was more resistant after growth processes resumed in the spring. The phloem-cambium region of the stem lost <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> earlier and became more susceptible to injury than other tissues of the twig after midwinter 0 Survival of the vegetative apex depended on the ability of its water to subcool. Heat of fusion of water on freezing produced a sharp exotherm that was a precise index of the temperature at death and <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of the vegetative apex. Prolonged subfreezing temperatures after development of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in late autumn increased hardiness of twigs beyond that induced by the natural environment 6 Both formation of ice in the pith of stems enclosed by coriaceous bud scales, and artificial dehydration reduced water content and promoted subcooling and <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of vegetative apices. Moisture content was reduced from 200 to 70 percent on a dry weight basis after three days at _ 90 C in early February and <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of apices increased 0 0 0 from - 16 C to - 20 C when cooled at 1 C per minute 0 These findings suggested that diffusion of water from the protoplasm to sites of extracellular ice, and not low temperature, was the direct cause of hardening at subfreezing temperatures 0 The basic freezing curve for Douglas-fir is characteristic of plant tissues in general but was modified by exotherms associated with freezing and death of vegetative apices from November until April. A decline n length of the plateau after the second subcooling temperature during hardening, and increase in length of the plateau during loss of hardiness reflected probable seasonal change in quantity of intracellular water. Unhardened tissues survived freezing of extracellular water but were injured before intracellular water was completely frozen. Hardened tissues, on the other hand, were not injured until after most of the intracellular water was frozen and the cooling rate of the stem returned to normal. Observations suggested a definite relationship between time of acquisition and loss of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> and number of days to bud burst after March 31. Trees which developed <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> earliest in fall broke buds earliest in spring. Trees which broke buds latest in spring were also those which were the last to deharden, Ready availability of potassium appears to enhance early development and loss of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Trees with the highest content of potassium in the current season's foliage burst buds earliest and those with the lowest content of potassium were the last to burst buds. Night temperatures of 20 C delayed but did not prevent loss of hardiness when day temperatures were 250 C in March. However, continuous temperature of 2 ° C failed to reharden twigs that had lost <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> at 25 ° C.

40|$|The {{inheritance}} of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in interspecific F 1 hybrid families of Eucalyptus encompassing 27 different species combinations {{and a range}} of levels of hardiness was examined. <b>Freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> was assessed by determining the temperatures required to cause either 30 % (T 30), 40 % (T 40), or 50 % (T 50) leakage of electrolytes from excised leaf discs subjected to artificial freezing. Highly significant variation in <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> occurred between species; the maximum difference between parents in any specific combination was over 9 °C (E. gunnii x E. globulus). <b>Freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> was inherited in a predominantly additive manner in interspecific hybrids, although there was a tendency towards partial dominance toward the more sensitive species in some combinations (e. g., E. nitens x E.

Genomewide gene expression analysis and Northern analysis of different freeze-resistant and freeze-sensitive strains have now revealed a correlation between <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> and the aquaporin genes AQY 1 and AQY 2. Deletion of these genes in a laboratory strain rendered yeast cells more sensitive to freezing, while overexpression of the respective genes, as well as heterologous expression of the human aquaporin gene hAQP 1, improved freeze tolerance. These findings support a role for plasma membrane water transport activity in determination of freeze tolerance in yeast. This {{appears to be the}} first clear physiological function identified for microbial aquaporins. We suggest that a rapid, osmotically driven efflux of water during the freezing process reduces intracellular ice crystal formation and resulting cell damage. Aquaporin overexpression also improved maintenance of the viability of industrial yeast strains, both in cell suspensions and in small doughs stored frozen or submitted to freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, an aquaporin overexpression transformant could be selected based on its improved freeze-thaw resistance without the need for a selectable marker gene. Since aquaporin overexpression does not seem to affect the growth and fermentation characteristics of yeast, these results open new perspectives for the successful development of freeze-resistant baker's yeast strains for use in frozen dough applications. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} shown a huge growth in the market of {{industrial}} baker's yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), {{with the need for}} strains affording better performance in prefrozen dough. Evidence suggests that during the freezing process, cells can suffer biochemical damage caused by osmotic stress. Nevertheless, the involvement of ion-responsive transcriptional factors and pathways in conferring <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> has not yet been examined. Here, we have investigated the role of the salt-responsive calcineurin-Crz 1 p pathway in mediating tolerance to freezing by industrial baker's yeast. Overexpression of CRZ 1 in the industrial HS 13 strain increased both salt and freeze tolerance and improved the leavening ability of baker's yeast in high-sugar dough. Moreover, engineered cells were able to produce more gas during fermentation of prefrozen dough than the parental strain. Similar effects were observed for overexpression of TdCRZ 1, the homologue to CRZ 1 in Torulaspora delbrueckii, suggesting that expression of calcineurin-Crz 1 p target genes can alleviate the harmful effects of ionic stress during freezing. However, overexpression of STZ and FTZ, two unrelated Arabidopsis thaliana genes encoding Cys 2 /His 2 -type zinc finger proteins, also conferred <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> in yeast. Furthermore, experiments with Δcnb 1 and Δcrz 1 mutants failed to show a freeze-sensitive phenotype, even in cells pretreated with NaCl.

40|$|Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) are an {{anadromous}} species {{from the family}} Osmeridae that inhabit inshore waters along the North American Atlantic coastline.

However, their main method of <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> appears to come from the production and accumulation of high levels of glycerol (200 - 400 mM), which lowers the freezing point of the blood via normal colligative means (Ewart & Fletcher, 1990; Raymond, 1992).

40|$|Although much {{correlative}} {{evidence is}} available, the precise determinants of <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are largely unknown. Genome-wide gene expression analyses of freeze-resistant and -sensitive strains have previously revealed {{a correlation between}} <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> and expression of aquaporin encoding genes 1. This relationship was confirmed by deletion and overexpression of AQY 1 and AQY 2, reducing and enhancing yeast freeze tolerance, respectively. Rapid osmotically driven water efflux upon freezing was suggested to reduce intracellular ice crystal formation and resulting cell damage. Aquaporin overexpression also improved maintenance of viability of industrial strains, without affecting commercially important characteristics. Unfortunately, further testing of the aquaporin overexpression strains in industrial conditions revealed no improvement of freeze tolerance {{in comparison with the}} control strain. We now show that the difference in freezing rate is apparently responsible for the discrepancy between these results. Application of different cooling rates indicate that at high cooling rates aquaporin overexpression significantly improves survival while at low cooling rates the effect is much less pronounced. Differences in cultivation conditions as well as thawing rate do not seem to influence freeze tolerance in the conditions tested. Mazur and co-workers have postulated that survival after freezing is mainly affected by two factors -cellular dehydration and intracellular ice crystal formation- oppositely depending on the cooling velocity 2. In accordance with this so-called two-factor hypothesis of freezing injury, we suggest that water permeability is limiting, and therefore aquaporin function advantageous, mainly in rapid freezing conditions. This finding probably hampers the use of aquaporin-mediated improvement of freeze tolerance for the development of freeze-resistant baker's yeast strains for frozen dough applications. References: 1.

40|$|In frozen dough {{applications}} a prefermentation {{period during}} {{the preparation of}} the dough is unavoidable and might also be important to obtain bread with a good texture. A major disadvantage of the prefermentation period is that it is associated with a rapid loss of the <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> of the yeast cells. A major goal for the development of new baker's yeast strains for use in frozen dough applications is the availability of strains that maintain a better <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> during the prefermentation period. We have isolated mutants that retain a better stress resistance during the initiation of fermentation. Some of these showed the same growth rate and fermentation capacity as the wild type cells. These mutants are called 'fil', for deficient in fermentation induced loss of stress resistance. First we used laboratory strains and heat stress treatment, given shortly after the initiation of fermentation, as the selection protocol. The first two mutants isolated in this way were affected in the glucose-activation mechanism of the Ras-cAMP pathway. The fil 1 mutant had a partially inactivating point mutation in CYR 1, the gene encoding adenylate cyclase, while fil 2 contained a nonsense mutation in GPR 1. GPR 1 encodes a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family which acts as a putative glucose receptor for activation of the Ras-cAMP pathway. In a next step we isolated fil mutants directly in industrial strains using repetitive freeze treatment of doughs as selection protocol. Surviving yeast strains were tested individually for maintenance of fermentation capacity after freeze treatment in laboratory conditions and also for the best performing strains in frozen doughs prepared with yeast cultivated on a pilot scale. The most promising mutant, AT 25, displayed under all conditions a better maintenance of gassing power during freeze-storage. It was not affected in other commercially important properties and will now be characterised extensively at the biochemical and molecular level. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

The tetraploid germplasm {{of this species}} constitutes an underexploited source of genetic variation. This variation has great potential for bahiagrass improvement because {{of the possibility of}} fixing superior hybrids by manipulating apomixis. Physiological and genetic variables that might {{have a major impact on}} the process of improving this species were studied. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the transmission of apomixis through generations, and estimate the genetic variability for growth habit, cool-season growth, and <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> resulting from hybridization of sexual and apomictic F 1 clones. Additionally, estimates were made on the seasonal biomass yields and nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation and the genetic variability for the rate of root depth development, root mass and root length density among these novel F 1 hybrids. The relationship between root development and nitrogen uptake from deep soil layers, and the relationship between biomass yields and root characteristics were also determined. Approximately 20 % of the F 1 and F 2 were classified as apomictic. Eleven percent of the F 1 but only 3 % of the F 2 were classified as highly apomictic. This variable expressivity might be caused by the genetic background or epigenetic variation. The genetic variation observed for growth habit, cool-season growth, and <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance</b> remained relatively constant between the F 1 and F 2. Apomicitc F 1 hybrids accumulated more nitrogen and phosphorus in spring and produced higher cool-season and annual biomass yields compared to common bahiagrass cultivars. Little genetic variation was observed for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in foliage among these hybrids. Genetic variation for rate of root depth development was observed among hybrids. Higher rates of root depth development resulted in faster access and uptake of nitrogen, and higher root and shoot mass. Variation for root length density was found among apomictic hybrids during the second growing season. No relationship was found between root length density or root mass, and above-ground biomass production. The fertilization rate did not affect root mass or root length density. Root activity might play an important role in nutrient uptake and biomass production...|$|E

However, there is little information {{about whether or not}} <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> is conserved across phylogenies, and whether conservatism of physiological traits could explain conservatism of realized climatic niches. Here, we compared the phylogenetical lability of realized climatic niche, foliar <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> and four morphological leaf traits that are generally considered to be adaptations to frost resistance in the Chilean species of Myrceugenia, which grows {{in a wide range of}} habitats. 2. We estimated the predicted niche occupancy profiles with respect to minimum temperature (minT) of all species. We measured foliar <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> (using chlorophyll fluorescence), leaf size, leaf mass per area (LMA), stomatal and trichome densities of 10 individuals per species. Finally, we estimated phylogenetic signal, and we performed independent contrast analyses among all variables. 3. We found that both foliar <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> and minT were subject to a significant phylogenetic signal, but the former had a stronger signal. We also detected a significant, but weak correlation between them (r = 0. 49, Pone tail = 0. 04). Morphological traits evolved independent of any phylogenetic effect. 4. Synthesis. Our results show that <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> evolved in association with temperature niche, but with some delay that could result from phylogenetic inertia. Our results also show that morphological leaf traits are more labile than realized climatic niche and frost tolerance and that the formers probably evolved in association with microhabitat preferences.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of spring freezing events for alpine species distribution, few studies have analysed the response of alpine shrub species to early spring freezes. It is also not known how snow cover gradients influence the process of de-hardening between individuals {{of the same species}} and their vulnerability to early spring frosts. We analysed early spring <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> for the buds of eight alpine Ericaceae shrubs growing at 1 m snow depth at treeline in the Swiss Alps. Moreover, buds of Rhododendron ferrugineum and Loiseleuria procumbens were analysed for <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> and sugar content along a snow depth gradient. The LT 50 (lethal temperature for 50 % of samples) of the eight species ranged from − 25. 1 ± 1. 6 °C (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) to − 11. 1 ± 1. 2 °C (Vaccinium uliginosum), with differences being related to the phenological stage in addition to shrub preferences for contrasting snow cover microsites. Although the effect of snow depth on the <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> of plants was not significant, samples collected from 1 m to 1. 5 m snow depth tended to be more vulnerable to freezing, particularly L. procumbens. Buds collected at shallower snow depths had higher sugar concentrations, indicative of their stronger physiological hardening. Consequently, we conclude that differences in snow cover may significantly affect the physiological hardening of plants during the onset of spring. Individuals growing at less than 0. 5 m snow cover are hardier, i. e., show moderately higher <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> than individuals from snow banks. Snow cover is a highly important aspect of climate change, and <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in alpine plants with respect to snow conditions can be a relevant driver of plant responses to climate change.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{expression}} of the group 3 late embryogenesis abundant abscisic acid-regulated gene (HVA 1) to cold treatment has been studied in winter barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedling tissue. The cDNA clone (pHVA 1) encoding this late embryogenesis abundant protein {{was used as a}} hybridization probe to detect the corresponding mRNA. Expression of the HVA 1 gene was determined after the tissue had been subjected to a regimen of 2 °C exposure (cold acclimation), followed by a return to 25 °C growth conditions (deacclimation). Accumulation of HVA 1 mRNA occurred upon cold acclimation of the tissue and disappeared as early as 2 hours after exposure to deacclimation conditions. A comparison of the response to cold acclimation and deacclimation was made between seedling tissue of a freeze-resistant and less freeze-resistant cultivar. In both cultivars, the HVA 1 gene was expressed and modulated by cold treatment. Within 2 hours of deacclimation HVA 1 mRNA was no longer detectable in either cultivar independently of <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance.</b> The level of expression of HVA 1 appeared to be greater in the less freeze-resistant cultivar (Winter Malt) ...|$|E
40|$|Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) {{accumulate}} {{high levels}} of glycerol and moderate levels of trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) that lower the colligative freezing point of the serum and thereby contribute to seasonal <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance.</b> In the current study, the possibility that {{one or both of}} these compounds might also have a chaperoning role at low temperatures in smelt was investigated by studying their effects on the smelt antifreeze protein (AFP). Activity of the AFP in the presence of physiological levels of TMAO and glycerol was observed by means of ice crystal morphology and measured as thermal hysteresis. Ice crystals in AFP solutions were not visibly modi 01 ed by either compound and TMAO at 25 and 50 mM had no appreciable effect on hysteresis; however, glycerol at 250 and 500 mM increased hysteresis. An equiosmolar level of NaCl was not as effective as glycerol in enhancing hysteresis, suggesting that osmolarity had little or no role. Although cross-linking experiments showed dimerization of AFP to be unchanged in the presence of glycerol, circular dichroism and intrinsic 02 uorescence analyses revealed enhanced protein folding. As glycerol enhances the folding and consequent activity of smelt AFP, protein chaperoning appears to be an endogenous role of glycerol in this vertebrate species.

40|$|Silicon (Si) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements found in the earth's crust, but is mostly inert and only slightly soluble. Agriculture activity tends to remove large quantities of Si from soil. Sugarcane is known to absorb more Si than any other mineral nutrient, accumulating approximately 380 kg ha- 1 of Si, in a 12 -month old crop. Sugarcane (plant growth and development) responses to silicon fertilization have been documented in some areas of the world, and applications on commercial fields are routine in certain areas. The reason for this plant response or yield increase is not fully understood, but several mechanisms have been proposed. Some studies indicate that sugarcane yield responses to silicon may be associated with induced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as disease and pest resistance, Al, Mn and Fe toxicity alleviation, increased P availability, reduced lodging, improved leaf and stalk erectness, <b>freeze</b> <b>resistance,</b> and improvement in plant water economy. This review covers the relationship of silicon to sugarcane crop production, including recommendations on how to best manage silicon in soils and plants, silicon interactions with others elements, and laboratory methodology for determining silicon in the soil, plant and fertilizer. In addition, a future research agenda for silicon in sugarcane is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change will}} {{increase}} autumn air temperature, while photoperiod decrease will remain unaffected. We assessed {{the effect of}} increased autumn air temperature on timing and development of cold acclimation and <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in Eastern white pine (EWP, Pinus strobus) under field conditions. For this purpose we simulated projected warmer temperatures for southern Ontario in a Temperature Free-Air-Controlled Enhancement (T-FACE) experiment and exposed EWP seedlings to ambient (Control) or elevated temperature (ET, + 1. 5 °C/+ 3 °C during day/night). Photosynthetic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, photoprotective pigments, leaf non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), and cold hardiness were assessed over two consecutive autumns. Nighttime temperature below 10 °C and photoperiod below 12 h initiated downregulation of assimilation in both treatments. When temperature further decreased to 0 °C and photoperiod became shorter than 10 h, downregulation of the light reactions and upregulation of photoprotective mechanisms occurred in both treatments. While ET seedlings did not delay {{the timing of the}} downregulation of assimilation, stomatal conductance in ET seedlings was decreased by 20 - 30 % between August and early October. In both treatments leaf NSC composition changed considerably during autumn but differences between Control and ET seedlings were not significant. Similarly, development of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> was induced by exposure to low temperature during autumn, but the timing was not delayed in ET seedlings compared to Control seedlings. Our results indicate that EWP is most sensitive to temperature changes during October and November when downregulation of photosynthesis, enhancement of photoprotection, synthesis of cold-associated NSCs and development of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> occur. However, we also conclude that the timing of the development of <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> in EWP seedlings is not affected by moderate temperature increases used in our field experiments...|$|R

40|$|Rapid wilting of cabbage leaves (Brassica capitata L.), {{induced by}} {{excision}} of the shoot, induced as rapid and high {{a degree of}} <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance</b> as a similar period of hardening at low temperature. Maximum hardening in the leaf was generally associated with the maximum growth rate. On the other hand, exposure of the excised shoot to low temperature while immersed in aerated water failed to harden the plants. In the absence of light, abrupt wilting at room or low temperature induced little or no hardening. With the available equipment, which required the absence of light, freezing temperatures induced little or no hardening above that obtained by nonfreezing low temperature. In fact, the plant frozen at moderate temperatures showed a gradual but steady decrease in <b>freezing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Since these experiments were performed with plants grown in pots, and since they eventually became pot-bound, the results may not apply equally to field-grown plants...|$|R
