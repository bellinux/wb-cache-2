40|$|The soil {{dissipation}} of the herbicide <b>isoxaben</b> was {{studied in}} field trials in Belgium in winter cereals treated with green manure, cow manure or pig slurry before sowing. Wheat was sown and the soil sprayed with 125 g <b>isoxaben</b> ha- 1 in October. Soil samples were analysed by GLC. <b>Isoxaben</b> dissipated with first-order kinetics {{over the first}} 6 months with half-lives of 2. 9, 4. 0, 4. 8 and 6. 6 months in unamended plots, and plots treated with green manure, cow manure and pig slurry respectively. The organic fertilizer treatments thus increased the <b>isoxaben</b> soil persistence. After 6 months, the organic fertilizer effect was less pronounced, leading to <b>isoxaben</b> soil concentrations in all treatments becoming similarly low. <b>Isoxaben</b> at 75 g ha- 1 applied to winter wheat or barley in the spring gave dissipation half-lives of 2. 1 and 2. 4 months, leading to <b>isoxaben</b> soil residues {{at the beginning of}} August of 15 - 21 p. p. b., similar to levels resulting from the autumn application. The <b>isoxaben</b> soil residues remaining after harvest would be too low to damage a rotational crop. The rates of <b>isoxaben</b> soil dissipation were greater {{in the spring and summer}} seasons than during the winter.

The main <b>isoxaben</b> soil metabolite was demethoxyisoxaben (N-[3 -(1 -ethyl- 1 -methylpropyl) isoxazol- 5 -yl]- 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxybenzamide), i. e., the monodemethoxylation product of <b>isoxaben.</b> 5 -Isoxazolone(3 -(1 -ethyl- 1 -methylpropyl) isoxazolin- 5 -one) was the second main <b>isoxaben</b> metabolite. When 5 -aminoisoxazole(5 -amino- 3 -(1 -ethyl- 1 -methylpropyl) isoxazole) was detected in soil, it always was at very low concentrations. It never accumulated in soil; 4 months before winter wheat harvest, {{it could not be}} detected in soil. Benzamides 2, 6 -dimethoxybenzamide and 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxybenzamide and 2, 6 -dimethoxybenzoic acid also were detected in soil. Organic fertilizer treatments increased <b>isoxaben</b> soil persistence. At the crop's end, their effects, however, progressively disappeared, the soil residues of <b>isoxaben</b> and of its metabolites becoming very low and similar in the organic fertilizer treated and untreated plots. 5 -Aminoisoxazole was not detected.

Herbicide losses from plant containers in runoff water may pose risks to surface and groundwater supplies. Sphagnum pear is a frequently used rooting medium. Limited information {{exists on the}} fate of herbicides applied to pear. The leaching of two commonly used chemicals in Europe by the containerized ornamental plant industry, <b>isoxaben</b> and BAS 479 14 H, was measured. Herbicides were applied to 1 -yr-old conifers (Juniperus communis, cv. Repanda [common juniper]) grown in pots containing sphagnum pear. The isoxaben-treated pots were placed on 1 - by 1 -m lysimeters that were buried in the center of replicated field plots. Pots were also placed in subirrigated sandbeds to determine herbicide dissipation and movement in irrigation water. With overhead irrigation, <b>isoxaben</b> had a half-life of 2 mo in the 0 - to 5 -cm depth of the pear container. More than 96 % of applied <b>isoxaben</b> was recovered in the 0 - to 5 -cm depth. Less than 4 % of the amount applied was found in the 5 - to 10 -cm depth, and none was detected in the 10 - to 15 -cm depth. No <b>isoxaben</b> residues were detected in water percolating through the field lysimeters. In subirrigated sandbeds, no <b>isoxaben</b> was detected in the water rising by capillary tension. Most of the applied <b>isoxaben</b> was found in the 0 - to 5 -cm layer of the pear container, where its half-life was also 2 mo. Similar results were observed in containers treated with BAS 479 14 H, which had a half-life of 1. 2 mo. The high organic matter content of the pear medium strongly sorbed both <b>isoxaben</b> and BAS 479 14 H, and these herbicides remained primarily in the near-surface zone of the pear containers.

The MOA of <b>isoxaben</b> is inhibition of cellulose synthesis (HRAC class L), while florasulam inhibits Acetolactate Synthase (ALS) and is {{a representative of the}} HRAC class B. It is known that florasulam works through uptake by green leaves. <b>Isoxaben</b> is a herbicide with soil activity and with a very low activity when foliar applied, except on some species in the cruciferae family. GF- 145 is intended to be applied in the autumn in cereals (wheat, barley, rye, triticale) for the control of ALS resistant volunteer oil seed rape and annual dicotyledonous weeds including Matricaria spp., Stellaria media, Papaver rhoeas, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Myosotis arvensis, Lamium spp., Galium aparine, Veronica spp. and others when applied at early post-emergence from BBCH 10 to 13 of the crop.

The expected 5 -aminoisoxazol 7 (5 -amino- 3 -(1 [...] ethyl- 1 -methylpropyl) isoxazol) was not generated, except in very low amounts when high acid concentrations were used. In separate hydrolysis trials made in similar aqueous acid conditions, {{it was observed}} that the 5 -aminoisoxazol 7 and 5 -isoxazolinone 3 were not transformed. The 5 -isoxazolinone 3 formed by <b>isoxaben</b> 1 acid hydrolysis thus was the first generated product, and was not formed by the consecutive nucleophilic substitution of 5 -amino-isoxazol 7 which would have been formed in a first step. This unexpected 5 -amino C-N bond cleavage by nucleophilic attack of H 2 O at the 5 -C of the isoxazol ring of <b>isoxaben</b> 1 -instead of the usual amide CO-N bond cleavage- probably is due to the positive charge existing at the 5 -C atom of the isoxazol ring. The acid hydrolysis pathway observed for <b>isoxaben</b> 1 also is the main soil metabolism pathway.

How cortical microtubules become aligned is unclear. The literature indicates that biophysical forces, transmitted by the organized cellulose component of the cell wall, provide a spatial cue to orient cortical microtubules.

Although structure and architecture of the walls have been studied extensively, knowledge regarding the mechanisms required to generate the complexity and control dynamic changes of the walls is limited. In order to improve our understanding, this study employs a combination of genetic, molecular and biochemical methods to characterize the functions of three candidate genes, At 1 g 65610, At 3 g 44990 and At 1 g 07260. They encode a putative membrane-bound endo- 1, 4 -β-glucanase (KORRIGAN 2), a putative xyloglucan endo-transferase/hydrolase (XTH 31) and a putative UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT 71 C 3) from Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression of the candidate genes changes in response to treatment with the cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor <b>isoxaben.</b> Plants with loss of gene activity of the target genes show only subtle growth phenotypes under standard growth conditions.

40|$|Plant cell walls {{form the}} first barrier during {{exposure}} to biotic and abiotic stresses and are constantly remodelled during developmental and growth processes. Thus, {{it is conceivable}} that a dedicated monitoring system perceives changes in cell wall integrity and initiates a coordinated set of responses. Currently, there is only limited knowledge on how this system functions. Recent findings have suggested that cell wall damage (CWD) caused by chemical or genetic inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis and pathogen attack triggers a canonical set of overlapping responses. These include ectopic deposition of lignin, increases in production of jasmonic (JA) and salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, reactive oxygen species (ROS), callose deposition, transcriptional activation of stress response mechanisms and changes in cell wall composition and structure. <b>Isoxaben</b> is a chemical inhibitor of cellulose biosynthesis that induces CWD. Microarray-based gene expression profiling has previously identified several genes whose expression is transiently induced in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings exposed to <b>isoxaben.</b> In the work presented here, the function of two of these genes, ATL 2 and AT 5 G 43450, was characterized. To achieve this, loss of function knock-out lines for each gene were used in phenotypical analyses based on the isoxaben-induced responses. Additionally, molecular tools were developed to study the global expression pattern and sub-cellular localization of ATL 2 and AT 5 G 43450, and complementation constructs for atl 2 and at 5 g 43450 were generated as well. ATL 2 was found to be involved in regulation of JA biosynthesis and lignin deposition in response to cellulose biosynthesis inhibition. Global gene expression pattern analysis using promoter-reporter constructs showed that ATL 2 is expressed in most of the plant tissues in seedlings and adult plants. AT 5 G 43450 was suggested to be involved in inhibition of cell elongation upon <b>isoxaben</b> addition. at 5 g 43450 seedlings exhibited reduced sensitivity to inhibition of cell elongation caused by <b>isoxaben.</b> In accordance with this observation, at 5 g 43450 lines expressing the full-length genomic AT 5 G 43450 exhibited wild-type levels of cell elongation inhibition. AT 5 G 43450 was found to localize to the nucleus and cytosol, as determined by using an AT 5 G 43450 ::CITRINE translational fusion protein {{under the control of the}} constitutive promoter 35 S. Furthermore, by using a cell cycle marker line containing a CYCB 1; 1 ::GUS reporter, <b>isoxaben</b> was shown to inhibit cell cycle progression 6 h after the start of the treatment. Interestingly, providing osmotic support suppressed the <b>isoxaben</b> effect, as CYCB 1; 1 ::GUS activity levels were not changed under these conditions. Similarly, the addition of MeJA counteracted the isoxaben-induced cell cycle inhibition as well. Moreover, ATL 2 and AT 5 G 43450 were found to be involved in cell cycle regulation since atl 2 and at 5 g 43450 containing the same reporter construct exhibited stronger activity levels of CYCB 1; 1 ::GUS compared to the control. In particular, ATL 2 was found to be involved in the MeJA modulation of cell cycle progression since CYCB 1; 1 ::GUS activity levels substantially increased in atl 2 after addition of MeJA. Together, these results show that ATL 2 and AT 5 G 43450 are involved in the isoxaben-induced CWD response and are negative regulators of cell cycle progression. Imperial Users onl...|$|E

Though parallels {{have been found to}} the cell wall integrity signalling pathway in yeast, it is clear that a more detailed study in plants is necessary to understand the process in detail. Classical induction of CWD (pathogens, stress, foraging animals) is often local, or overlaps with other response systems and has rarely been studied specifically. Treating Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with <b>isoxaben</b> (a specific CESA 3 and 6 inhibitor) allows the induction of highly specific CWD in growing tissues. Cross-referencing the genes which respond to <b>isoxaben</b> induced CWD with publically available tissue expression data allow identification of genes of interest. Based on this analysis, 108 genes were identified, and KO insertion lines isolated to assign a biological function to the individual candidate gene. 24 of these genes have been characterised both with and without CWD induction in this PhD. Genes of particular interest were picked using a FTIR clustering method. This method identified genes for which the insertions changed the response to <b>isoxaben</b> and genes which have a different cell wall composition from the outset.

Cell wall analysis shows that thaxtomin A reduces crystalline cellulose, and increases pectins and hemicellulose in the cell wall. Treatment with thaxtomin A also changes the expression of genes involved in primary and secondary cellulose synthesis as well as genes associated with pectin metabolism and cell wall remodelling, in a manner nearly identical to <b>isoxaben.</b> In addition, it induces the expression of several defence-related genes and leads to callose deposition. Defects in cellulose synthesis cause ectopic lignification phenotypes in A. thaliana, and it is shown that lignification is also triggered by thaxtomin A, although in a pattern different from <b>isoxaben.</b> Spinning disc confocal microscopy further reveals that thaxtomin A depletes cellulose synthase complexes from the plasma membrane and results in the accumulation of these particles in a small microtubule-associated compartment.

CESA 3 can interact with CESA 5 in vitro, and green fluorescent protein-tagged CESA 5, CESA 3, and CESA 10 proteins move in a linear, unidirectional fashion around the cytoplasmic column of the cell, parallel with the surface of the seed, in a pattern similar to that of cortical microtubules. Consistent with this movement, cytological evidence suggests that the mucilage is coiled around the columella and unwinds during mucilage extrusion to form a linear ray. Mutations in CESA 5 and CESA 3 affect the speed of mucilage extrusion and mucilage adherence. These findings imply that cellulose fibrils are synthesized in an ordered helical array around the columella, providing a distinct structure to the mucilage that is important for both mucilage extrusion and adherence...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the cell wall has {{a major impact on}} plant growth and development, and alteration of cell wall structural components is often detrimental to biomass production. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these negative effects are largely unknown. Arabidopsis thaliana plants with altered pectin composition, due to either the expression of a fungal polygalacturonase (35 S:AnPGII plants) or a mutation in the QUASIMODO 2 gene that encodes a putative pectin methyl-transferase (qua 2 - 1 plants), display severe growth defects. Here we show that expression of AtPRX 71, encoding a class III peroxidase, strongly increases in 35 S:AnPGII and qua 2 - 1 plants, as well as in response to treatments with the cellulose synthase inhibitor <b>isoxaben,</b> which also impairs cell wall integrity. Analysis of atprx 71 loss-of-function mutants and of plants overexpressing AtPRX 71 indicates that this gene negatively influences Arabidopsis growth at different stages of development, likely limiting cell expansion. The atprx 71 - 1 mutation partially suppresses the dwarf phenotype of qua 2 - 1, suggesting that AtPRX 71 contributes to the growth defects observed in plants undergoing cell wall damage. Furthermore, AtPRX 71 appears to promote the production of reactive oxygen species in qua 2 - 1 plants as well as in plants treated with <b>isoxaben.</b> We propose that AtPRX 71 contributes to strengthen cell walls, therefore restricting cell expansion, during both normal growth and in response to cell wall damage...|$|E
40|$|A central {{problem in}} plant biology is how cell {{expansion}} is coordinated with wall synthesis. We have studied growth and wall deposition in epidermal cells of dark-grown Arabidopsis hypocotyls. Cells elongated in a biphasic pattern, slowly first and rapidly thereafter. The growth acceleration was initiated at the hypocotyl base and propagated acropetally. Using transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we analyzed walls in slowly and rapidly growing cells in 4 -d-old dark-grown seedlings. We observed thick walls in slowly growing cells and thin walls in rapidly growing cells, {{which indicates that}} the rate of cell wall synthesis was not coupled to the cell elongation rate. The thick walls showed a polylamellated architecture, whereas polysaccharides in thin walls were axially oriented. Interestingly, innermost cellulose microfibrils were transversely oriented in both slowly and rapidly growing cells. This suggested that transversely deposited microfibrils reoriented in deeper layers of the expanding wall. No growth acceleration, only slow growth, was observed in the cellulose synthase mutant cesA 6 prc 1 - 1 or in seedlings, which had been treated with the cellulose synthesis inhibitor <b>isoxaben.</b> In these seedlings, innermost microfibrils were transversely oriented and not randomized as has been reported for other cellulose-deficient mutants or following treatment with dichlorobenzonitrile. Interestingly, <b>isoxaben</b> treatment after the initiation of the growth acceleration in the hypocotyl did not affect subsequent cell elongation. Together, these results show that rapid cell elongation, which involves extensive remodeling of the cell wall polymer network, depends on normal cellulose deposition during the slow growth phase...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{factors that}} influence cytoskeletal organization we screened for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants that show hypersensitivity to the microtubule destabilizing drug oryzalin. We cloned the genes corresponding {{to two of the}} 131 mutant lines obtained. The genes encoded mutant alleles of PROCUSTE 1 and KORRIGAN, which both encode proteins that have previously been implicated in cellulose synthesis. Analysis of microtubules in the mutants revealed that both mutants have altered orientation of root cortical microtubules. Similarly, <b>isoxaben,</b> an inhibitor of cellulose synthesis, also altered the orientation of cortical microtubules while exogenous cellulose degradation did not. Thus, our results substantiate that proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis influence cytoskeletal organization and indicate that this influence on cortical microtubule stability and orientation is correlated with cellulose synthesis rather than the integrity of the cell wall...|$|E
40|$|On-farm biopurification {{systems were}} {{developed}} to remove pesticides from contaminated water generated at the farmyard. An important process in the system's efficiency is the sorption of pesticides to the substrates used in the biopurification systems. The composition and type of material present in the biobed are crucial for retention of chemicals. This study investigated the sorption of linuron, isoproturon, metalaxyl, <b>isoxaben,</b> bentazon and lenacil on substrates commonly used in a biopurification system, i. e. cow manure, straw, willow chopping, soil, coconut chips, garden waste compost, and peat mix. Linear, Freundlich. and Langmuir sorption isotherms were fitted to the obtained data. The best fit was obtained with the Freundlich model. More immobile pesticides (i. e. linuron and <b>isoxaben)</b> tended to associate with the organic substrate, while more mobile pesticides partition in the water (i. e. bentazon). According to sorption capacity, the substrates {{could be classified as}} peat mix > compost, coco chips, straw > cow manure, willow chopping > sandy loam soil. Sorption capacity was positively correlated with the organic carbon content, CaO and the cation exchange capacity. Furthermore, no significant differences in sorption could be found between technical and formulated isoproturon and bentazon, Moreover, the individual sorption coefficient K-d was additive, which means that individual sorption coefficients can be used to calculate the sorption coefficients of a mixture of substrates. What concerns the mutual interaction of pesticides it could be observed that the sorption of linuron and metalaxyl was significantly lower in combination with isoproturon and bentazon, while the latter pesticides were not influenced by the presence of linuron and metalaxyl. As guidelines, firstly, it could be stated that using the most sorbing materials such as peat mix, might significantly increase the biopurification systems efficiency. Secondly, the treatment of very mobile pesticides, such as bentazon, should be taken with care as these will easily leach through the system. Additional chemical treatment might be necessary for these type of pesticides. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea L.) is a stoloniferous, {{perennial}} weed that persists in lawn turf. Variable ground ivy response to postemergence broadleaf herbicides is common. A recent {{survey found that}} 40 % of lawn care service providers encountered ground ivy populations having a variable response to herbicides, and that 79 % used 2, 4 -D either alone or in combination with another herbicide to control ground ivy. With {{the widespread use of}} 2, 4 -D on turf sites, the development of 2, 4 -D-tolerant ground ivy is a possibility. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) the response of ground ivy populations to 2, 4 -D and triclopyr application, (2) 2, 4 -D absorption and translocation in 2, 4 -D-tolerant and -susceptible ecotypes, (3) whether differential 2, 4 -D absorption contributes to 2, 4 -D tolerance, and (4) nitrogen fertility programming, and preemergence and postemergence herbicide applications for ground ivy control. ^ Ground ivy was sampled from eight U. S. states and one Canadian province. Ground ivy populations showed a highly variable response to foliar 2, 4 -D application, but less variable response to foliar triclopyr application. NE ground ivy was tolerant of 2, 4 -D whereas the OH ground ivy was susceptible. The 2, 4 -D-susceptible OH population absorbed more foliar-applied 14 C- 2, 4 -D than the 2, 4 -D-tolerant NE population. While total translocation of applied 14 C was similar for both populations, the OH population translocated slightly more towards the apical meristem of the primary stolon. Neither the addition of a nonionic surfactant to foliar applications of 2, 4 -D nor exposure of the roots to 2, 4 -D could negate the variation in response to 2, 4 -D found between these two populations. Nitrogen fertilizer applications reduced ground ivy encroachment while encouraging high turf density. The preemergence herbicide, <b>isoxaben,</b> limited ground ivy spread. The postemergence herbicides, triclopyr or 2, 4 -D, when applied at the highest labeled rate, controlled ground ivy acceptably. ^ Ground ivy populations vary in their response to 2, 4 -D. However, differential foliar absorption of 2, 4 -D apparently cannot explain this variation. Using the three approaches of proper nitrogen fertility programming, <b>isoxaben</b> application, and 2, 4 -D or triclopyr application, lawncare service providers could achieve improved ground ivy control. ...|$|E
40|$|Common scab, a {{bacterial}} disease of potato causes significant losses to the Australian potato industry through rejected seed and/or increased processing costs. Disease symptoms caused by plant pathogenic Streptomyces sp., {{are attributable to}} a key phytotoxin it produces, namely thaxtomin A. The development of resistance to this disease, thrqugh selection of somaclonal varieties tolerant to thaxtomin A is a current key industry supported program. However, mechanisms relating to resistance and patterns of toxicity produced by thaxtomin A are not well understood and represent the key objectives of this project. The {{purpose of this study}} was to initially assess the impact of thaxtomin A on various plants and plant cell systems from an electrophysiological, morphological and pathological perspective. The effect of thaxtomin A in combination with various auxin sources and analogues was also examined. Further work aimed to quantify resistance to thaxtomin A within mutant strains of potato plants and calli, and whether any specific change to a known thaxtomin A susceptible gene may be responsible for altered levels of resistance to thaxtomin A. Electrophysiological data obtained using ion-selective microelectrode ion flux estimation (the MIFE) technique showed that interaction between plant and toxin was characterised by a rapid and short-lived Ca 2 + influx and activation of the plasma membrane proton pump. Thaxtomin A was more effective in young, physiologically active tissues (root elongation zone or pollen tube apex), suggesting higher density of thaxtomin A-binding sites in these regions. This provided the first evidence that thaxtomin A triggers an early signalling cascade, which may be crucial in plantpathogen interactions. Glasshouse trials showed that foliar application of sublethal concentrations of 2, 4 -D sprays on potato foliage reduced severity and occurrence of common scab. Lenticel numbers, lenticel external dimensions and periderm structure (key features critical to S. scabiei entry and penetration into a tuber) were generally not changed by 2, 4 -D sprays, suggesting no direct effect of 2, 4 -D on these morphological structures. In contrast, tubers harvested from 2, 4 -D treated plants had a decreased sensitivity to th xtomin A compared with the controls, which may explain enhanced resistance. This suggests an indirect effect of 2, 4 -D impacting on the toxin, thaxtomin A, rather than morphological changes to the developing tuber. Further experimental evidence confirmed an interaction between thaxtomin A and auxin. fuhibition of tomato pollen tube growth by thaxtomin A was ameliorated by addition of NAA. Also, auxin/auxin transport inhibitor sensitive 'ucu 2 - 2 /gi 2 'A. thaliana mutant showed significantly greater sensitivity to thaxtomin A, observed as root growth suppression, increased rates of necrosis (chlorosis), plant death, and more severely altered W flux profiles (electrophysiological data) in the mutant compared to the wild-type. Moreover, inhibition root growth assays with the thaxtomin A-resistant 'txr I' A. thaliana mutant showed a 3 fold increase in resistance to the polar auxin transport inhibitor, 1 -NPA, suggesting an interaction between thaxtomin A and the auxin efflux carrier associated with the NP A binding 'protein. Cross-resistances to 1 -NPA and <b>isoxaben</b> of 'txrl' and the <b>isoxaben</b> resistant 'ixr 1 'A. thaliana mutant suggests a similarity of function between <b>isoxaben</b> and thaxtomin A, and also 'txrl' and 'ixrl '. The 'txrl' gene homolog from potato has been successfully cloned and sequenced from a series of mutant potato lines, selected for resistance to thaxtomin A. Compared with the parent (control) there were no mutations within the 'txr 1 ' gene examined suggesting the resistance phenotype is due to some other genetic change. These studies have contributed to a better understanding of mechanisms of toxicity of thaxtomin A in plant cells and advanced our knowledge of pathogen: host interactions within the common scab disease pathosystem...|$|E
40|$|The Pesticide Contamination Prevention Act (Food and Agricultural Code [FAC] {{sections}} 13141 et seq.) {{was passed}} in 1985 to prevent further pesticide pollution of ground water which {{may be used for}} drinking water supplies. FAC section 13149 specifies the conditions under which a pesticide is considered “found ” in ground water or soil, and thus subject to formal review as specified. As originally adopted, FAC subsection 13149 (d) specified that a finding of a pesticide shall be verified by a second analytical method or a second analytical laboratory approved by the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR). However, the law was amended by Senate Bill 810 in 1995 to allow a finding of a pesticide in ground water or soil to be based on a single analytical method conducted by a single analytical laboratory, if the analytical method provides unequivocal identification of a chemical.

The present {{study was designed to}} examine the improved enzymatic saccharification efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass of tobacco plants expressing AtCESA 3 ixr 1 - 2. Three-month-old AtCESA 3 ixr 1 - 2 transgenic and wild-type tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L. variety Samsun NN) were grown in the presence and absence of <b>isoxaben.</b> Biomass obtained from leaf, stem, and root tissues were analyzed for enzymatic saccharification rates. During enzymatic saccharification, 45 % and 25 % more sugar was released from transgenic leaf and stem samples, respectively, when compared to the wild-type samples. This gain in saccharification efficiency was achieved without chemical or heat pretreatment. Additionally, leaf and stem biomass from transgenic AtCESA 3 ixr 1 - 2 requires a reduced amount of enzyme for saccharification compared to biomass from wild-type plants. From a practical standpoint, a similar strategy could be employed to introduce the mutated CESA into energy crops like poplar and switchgrass to improve the efficiency of biomass conversion...|$|E
40|$|Perturbation of {{cellulose}} synthesis in plants triggers stress responses, including growth retardation, {{mediated by the}} cell wall integrity-sensing receptor-like kinase (RLK) THESEUS 1 (THE 1). The analysis of two alleles carrying T-DNA insertions at comparable positions has led to conflicting conclusions concerning the impact of THE 1 signaling on growth. Here we confirm that, unlike the 1 - 3 and other the 1 alleles in which cellular responses to genetic or pharmacological inhibition {{of cellulose}} synthesis are attenuated, the 1 - 4 showed enhanced responses, including growth inhibition, ectopic lignification, and stress gene expression. Both the 1 - 3 and the 1 - 4 express a transcript encoding a predicted membrane-associated truncated protein lacking the kinase domain. However, the 1 - 3, {{in contrast to the}} 1 - 4, strongly expresses antisense transcripts, which are expected to prevent the expression of the truncated protein as suggested by the genetic interactions between the two alleles. Seedlings overexpressing such a truncated protein react to <b>isoxaben</b> treatment similarly to the 1 - 4 and the full-length THE overexpressor. We conclude that the 1 - 4 is a hypermorphic allele; that THE 1 signaling upon cell wall damage has a negative impact on cell expansion; and that caution is required when interpreting the phenotypic effects of T-DNA insertions in RLK genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of cellulose microfibrils requires {{the presence of}} a membrane-bound endo- 1, 4 -beta-D-glucanase, KORRIGAN 1 (KOR 1). Although the exact biochemical role of KOR 1 in cellulose synthesis is unknown, we used the protein as a marker to explore the potential involvement of subcellular transport processes in cellulose synthesis. Using immunofluorescence and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -KOR 1 fusion that complemented the phenotype conferred by the kor 1 - 1 mutant, we investigated the distribution of KOR 1 in epidermal cells in the root meristem. KOR 1 was localized in intracellular compartments corresponding to a heterogeneous population of organelles, which comprised the Golgi apparatus, FM 4 - 64 -labeled compartments referred to as early endosomes, and, in the case of GFP-KOR 1, the tonoplast. Inhibition of cellulose synthesis by <b>isoxaben</b> promoted a net redistribution of GFP-KOR 1 toward a homogeneous population of compartments, distinct from early endosomes, which were concentrated close to the plasma membrane facing the root surface. A redistribution of GFP-KOR 1 away from early endosomes was also observed in the same cells at later stages of cell elongation. A subpopulation of GFP-KOR 1 -containing compartments followed trajectories along the plasma membrane, and this motility required intact microtubules. These observations demonstrate that the deposition of cellulose, like chitin synthesis in yeast, involves the regulated intracellular cycling of at least one enzyme required for its synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Nursery {{cultural}} practices {{have been shown}} to greatly influence the morphological and physiological condition of the seedlings- and ultimately their field performance potential. One such practice is the use of herbicides to control weeds in the nursery bed and thus reduce competition. Therefore, the use of herbicides should allow the production of better quality seedlings. However, while herbicides may control the weeds, they may also have an adverse effect {{on the quality of the}} seedlings. The phytotoxicity of most modern herbicides is caused by their disruption of plant metabolism. Herbicides disrupt plant growth and development, and occasionally lead to injury or death, depending upon the intensity of the effect. Thus it is unwise to use herbicides that damage the crop. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of herbicides used in forest nurseries on seedling quality. This project was initiated by COFORD in 1997 to address some of these problems. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior (L.)), beech (Fagus sylvatica (L.)), sycamore (Acerpseudoplatanus (L.)), and oak (Quercus robur (L.)) were selected as test species because they are some of the most important tree species used in Irish forestry today.
