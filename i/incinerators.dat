5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and <b>incinerators</b> using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and <b>incinerators,</b> which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E

5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as <b>incinerators</b> require constant levels of waste to operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing <b>incinerators</b> {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, the Illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve the unlawful disposal of garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level <b>incinerators,</b> was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, a {{gas-fired}} <b>incinerator</b> {{was built}} {{on one side of}} the property. The remainder of the property was used for non-combustible waste such as appliances and metal. The <b>incinerator</b> was forced to shut down in the 1970s because of environmental concerns about the untreated smoke from the <b>incinerator's</b> furnace. With the closure of the <b>incinerator,</b> the site was converted to the transfer station that is there now.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{treats the}} design of a {{municipal}} solid waste <b>incinerator</b> suited to the semiarid regions with northern Nigeria and Niger Republic in West Africa as the study area. Proximate and ultimate analyses results from the solid waste were used as basis for calculations, using standard formulas and correlations. The calorific value of the solid waste samples in the study area is not high enough to sustain an incineration process and it ranges from 5. 024 MJ/kg to 5. 867 MJ/kg. For these types of low calorific value fuels, the parallel flow concept was found to be the appropriate type of <b>incinerator.</b> The solid waste to be fed in the <b>incinerator</b> needs to be mixed with 50 % of supplementary fuel in the form of readily available bagasse to make it up to the required lower calorific value. Major characteristics of the designed municipal solid waste <b>incinerator</b> were: total volume of <b>incinerator</b> chamber: 82. 5 m 3, length of the <b>incinerator</b> bed: 11 m; width of the <b>incinerator</b> bed: 3 m and height of the <b>incinerator</b> chamber: 2. 5 m, while the suitable adiabatic flame temperature was found to be 1, 587 K...|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most modern <b>incinerators</b> {{operating}} in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear.|$|E

The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or bleeding from their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby <b>incinerators,</b> and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} modern <b>incinerators</b> minimises PCDD/F {{formation}} by optimising {{the stability of}} the thermal process. To comply with the EU emission limit of 0.1ng I-TEQ/m3 modern <b>incinerators</b> operate in conditions minimising dioxin formation and are equipped with pollution control devices which catch the low amounts produced. Recent information is showing for example that dioxin levels in populations near <b>incinerators</b> in Lisbon and Madeira have not risen since the plants began operating in 1999 and 2002 respectively.|$|E
25|$|The next largest {{sources of}} dioxin in the EPA {{inventory}} are medical and municipal waste <b>incinerators.</b> Various {{studies have been}} conducted that reach contradictory results. For instance a study of commercial-scale <b>incinerators</b> showed no relationship between the PVC content of the waste and dioxin emissions. Other studies have shown a clear correlation between dioxin formation and chloride content and indicate that PVC is a significant contributor to the formation of both dioxin and PCB in <b>incinerators.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Europe, {{with the}} ban on {{landfilling}} untreated waste, scores of <b>incinerators</b> have {{been built in the}} last decade, with more under construction. Recently, a number of municipal governments have begun the process of contracting for the construction and operation of <b>incinerators.</b> In Europe, some of the electricity generated from waste is deemed to be from a 'Renewable Energy Source (RES) and is thus eligible for tax credits if privately operated. Also, some <b>incinerators</b> in Europe are equipped with waste recovery, allowing the reuse of ferrous and non-ferrous materials found in landfills. A prominent example is the AEB Waste Fired Power Plant.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{improvement}} in U.S. dioxin emissions has been for large-scale municipal waste <b>incinerators.</b> As of the year 2000, although small-scale <b>incinerators</b> (those with a daily capacity of less than 250 tons) processed only 9% of the total waste combusted, these produced 83% of the dioxins and furans emitted by municipal waste combustion.|$|E
