5000|$|Currently <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals</b> on {{the market}} {{are listed in the}} TSCA Inventory. Though tasked with {{protecting}} the public from dangerous and potentially carcinogenic substances, some 62,000 chemicals were never tested by the EPA because they were [...] "grandfathered in and statutorily not considered an [...] "unreasonable risk." [...] Without testing, TSCA grandfathered the use of these chemicals into TSCA's list of [...] "existing" [...] (as opposed to [...] "new") chemicals. For <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> manufacturers need to generate and report data on risk, manufacturing and processing, adverse health effects, published and unpublished health and safety studies, and [...] "substantial risks." [...] to the EPA Also, manufacturers need to report their chemicals’ significant new use rules (SNURs), but this triggers a further Pre-Manufacturing Notice (PMN) process of <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> The PMN screening system gives the EPA little support for gathering information about <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which constitute the vast amount of chemicals in commerce. Yet, under section 4, the EPA has the authority to require manufacturers to test <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> but in each case the EPA must make several formal findings, the first of which is subject to judicial review under the [...] "substantial evidence" [...] standard. In particular, the requirement that the EPA determine that the chemical [...] "may present an unreasonable risk" [...] creates a regulatory Catch-22 as such a determination requires much of the very data that the EPA cannot access or cause to be generated without first making the determination.|$|E

Additionally, there are 3,000 high production volume (HPV) chemicals, produced or imported in quantities exceeding one million pounds per year These HPV chemicals only constitute one third of <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals,</b> but their high volumes raise concern about the lack of basic hazard information. Many environmental groups, such as Natural Resources Defense Council, complain that the EPA is nearly powerless to take regulatory action against dangerous chemicals, even those known to cause cancer or other serious health effects.|$|E
5000|$|The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is a United States law, {{passed by}} the United States Congress in 1976 and {{administered}} by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, that regulates {{the introduction of new}} or already <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals.</b> When the TSCA was put into place, all <b>existing</b> <b>chemicals</b> were considered to be safe for use and subsequently grandfathered in. Its three main objectives are to assess and regulate new commercial chemicals before they enter the market, to regulate chemicals already existing in 1976 that posed an [...] "unreasonable risk to health or to the environment", as for example PCB's, lead, mercury and radon, and to regulate these chemicals' distribution and use.|$|E
