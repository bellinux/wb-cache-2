5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her {{to prepare the}} oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E

On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a big monument <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> jungle near the village of Bumisegoro. He was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C. Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate.|$|E
5|$|The green rosella {{generally}} breeds at {{two years}} of age, though younger birds may pair up and look for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1m (3ft) <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tree trunk anywhere up to 30m (100ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a eucalypt such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash (E. regnans), or myrtle beech.

5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forest, {{but may also}} be in the clouds, in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E

Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding, which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. Gum leaves are occasionally added as well. The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. The first egg averages around 47 or 48mm long and 37mm in diameter (2 × 1.4in). The second egg is around 2mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day. Later both parents help to raise the chicks. The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy. Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28–31days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging. Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching, and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.|$|E

Fortunately for Stauskas, his backup, Isaiah Canaan, {{was in a}} simultaneous slump, going 3-for-20 in the same games. However, Stauskas had a left knee contusion on November 23 against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was sidelined {{for the second half}} and the subsequent three-game road trip. He missed only one game and returned to the lineup on November 27 in limited minutes off the bench. [...] On December 1, Stauskas and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103–91. The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States (28 games going back to the prior season) and the worst start in NBA history (tied with the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets at 0–18). Stauskas went scoreless in 4 consecutive appearances between December 16 and 22. He then did not play on December 23 when the 76ers played against the Milwaukee Bucks. When the 76ers defeated the Phoenix Suns in new point guard Ish Smith's first game with the team for their second win of the season (snapping a 12-game losing streak and a 23-game road losing streak) on December 26, Stauskas was coming off the bench and contributed 17 points. As Stauskas endured an up and down season, he became Kendall Marshall's father's target of blame for Marshall's lack of playing time on January 2. That night against the Los Angeles Clippers, Stauskas posted 18 points on 6–8 three point shooting. Stauskas returned to the starting lineup for the 76ers on January 4 against the Timberwolves for the 76ers 4th win of the season. However, he was injured in overtime of the January 15 contest against the Chicago Bulls and missed three games before returning to the lineup on January 25 against the Boston Celtics. Stauskas scored 18 points again on March 15 against the Brooklyn Nets. Stauskas established a new career high on March 18 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, scoring 23 points.|$|E
