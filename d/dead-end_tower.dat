5000|$|An anchor portal or H-frame {{tower is}} a [...] {{structure}} supporting {{overhead power lines}} in a switchyard. Their static function {{is similar to a}} <b>dead-end</b> <b>tower.</b> Anchor portals are almost always steel-tube or steel-framework constructions.|$|E
50|$|A {{special kind}} of a <b>dead-end</b> <b>tower</b> is a {{termination}} pylon. Also called a terminal tower. It is used when the overhead power line terminates, and is connected to substation equipment, or transitions to underground cable.For voltages below 30 kV also pylon transformers are used.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>dead-end</b> <b>tower</b> (also anchor tower, anchor pylon) is a fully {{self-supporting}} structure used in construction of overhead power lines. A dead-end transmission tower uses horizontal strain insulators {{and where the}} conductors mechanically terminate. Dead-end towers may be used at a substation as a transition to a [...] "slack span" [...] entering the equipment, when the circuit changes to a buried cable, when a transmission line changes direction {{by more than a}} few degrees, or just once in a while to limit the extent of a catastrophic collapse.Since dead-end towers require more material and are heavier and costlier than suspension towers, it is uneconomic to build a line with only {{self-supporting structure}}s.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dead-end</b> <b>towers</b> may be {{constructed}} {{of the same}} materials as other structures of the line. They may be steel or aluminum lattice structures, tubular steel, concrete, or wood poles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dead-end</b> <b>towers</b> {{are also}} {{employed}} at branch points as branch pylons. A tower {{at which the}} power line runs further as overhead line and as underground cable is a branch tower for a cable branch.|$|R
50|$|Dead-end towers {{are used}} at regular {{intervals}} in a long transmission line to limit the cascading tower failures that might occur after a conductor failure. An in-line <b>dead-end</b> <b>tower</b> will have two sets of strain insulators supporting the lines in either direction, with the lines connected by a jumper between the two segments. Dead-end towers can resist unbalanced forces due to line weight and tension, contrasted with suspension towers which mostly just support the conductor weight and have relatively low capacity for unbalanced load. Dead-end towers may use earth anchor cables {{to compensate for the}} asymmetric attachment of the conductors. They are often used when the power line must cross a large gap, such as a railway line, river, or valley.|$|E
50|$|Overhead line {{crossings}} of roads, railway lines, and small- and medium-sized watercourses do not normally require special construction. However, {{in the first}} years of overhead line building a scaffold under the line was required, when a railway line or a road was crossed. Later in Germany and some other countries on each end of a powerline crossing of a state-operated railway a <b>dead-end</b> <b>tower</b> was required, which can still be seen on some old power lines. For overhead line {{crossings of}} motorways the pylons must be rebuilt before they wear out, because these demand additional maintenance. If local conditions are appropriate, an overhead line can be implemented by way of a valley bridge. For example, the Koersch valley bridge near Esslingen, Germany carries the 110 kV, three-phase line of the EnBW AG with 2 circuits. Because of the danger of short circuits from falling objects, undercrossings are typically avoided.|$|E
40|$|Background of {{the project}} Health, safety and the {{environment}} (HSE) is Statnett´s nr. 1 priority and Statnett has a zero vision towards accidents. Unfortunately, Statnett and their entrepreneurs experience accidents each year. With an increasing activity level towards 2020, it is natural to estimate {{that the number of}} accidents will increase in line with the activity. It can therefore be interesting to study new technologies with high potential to reduce risk, if it is rapidly implemented. Goals There were three goals with this thesis. The first was to identify robotic technologies, available now or within a five-year period with potential for use in Statnett. The second goal was to identify dangerous operations performed by Statnett or Statnett´s entrepreneurs. The third goal was to provide a recommendation of which robotic technologies that can both execute the identified operations and reduce the risks of the operations. General information about the thesis This report was made as a master thesis {{at the end of a}} five-year study towards a Master's Degree in science at Norwegian University of Life Science(NMBU). The study was performed between January and May 2016, and represent 30 ECTS. The thesis is written under collaboration between Statnett and NMBU. Method This thesis is based on literature study, interviews, observations and data analysis. Results The main outcome was the following: •	There are many types of robotic technologies with different abilities and potential for implementation in Statnett and Statnett´s entrepreneurs, all with a high level of technology readiness(TRL) or already in use. There are however limitations with every type of robotic technologies, e. g. many of the line suspended robotic devices have problems crossing suspension towers and there is actually only one that is supposedly able to cross <b>dead-end</b> <b>towers.</b> •	There is no doubt that Statnett and their entrepreneurs perform dangerous operations. Many high risk operations are identified, but there are still reasons to believe that even more could be found. All of the identified operations contain different factors of risk. Some of the risk factors have led to tragic accidents ending with death or severe illness. The biggest identified risk factors are working with helicopter and working at height. •	There are several robotic technologies with the possibility to both perform and reduce the risk of some of the dangerous operations identified in this thesis. Recommendation for further work Based on the robotic technology with the highest potential to both execute operations and reduce the operations risks, eleven technologies are recommended for further research and development towards permanent implementation in specific operations...|$|R
