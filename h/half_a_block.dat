5|$|Though {{unsigned}} at this point, NY96 {{begins at}} the eastbound onramp to NY17 at exit64 on Southside Drive across the Susquehanna River from the Tioga County village of Owego.

NY434 continues east along Southside Drive while NY96, now fully signed, turns north onto Court Street and crosses the Susquehanna River. On {{the opposite side of}} the river, NY96 intersects Front Street. The configuration of NY96 between Front Street and East Main Street is unorthodox in that NY96 splits at Front Street to follow a one-way couplet around the Tioga County Courthouse to Main Street, where both streets terminate. NY96 turns onto Main Street for <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> to North Avenue, where it resumes its northward path. The route shares the parallel one-way streets with NY17C, which enters Owego from the west via Main Street and leaves via Front Street to the east.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{alignment}} of US 75 before the North Freeway was built left downtown Houston {{to the northwest}} on Main Street, turning north at Airline Drive, and then northwest along the present {{alignment of}} I-45, then known as Stuebner Airline Road, Shepherd Drive, and East Montgomery Road. The freeway replacement was authorized in stages between May 1945 and June 1952, when the Texas Transportation Commission adopted plans for a freeway all the way between Houston and Dallas. The North Freeway name was adopted in 1956; an unsuccessful proposal in 1965 would have renamed it the Dallas Freeway. The first short piece of the freeway to open crossed Buffalo Bayou, connecting the two one-way pairs from {{the north end of}} the Gulf Freeway with the south end of Houston Avenue. This was opened on December 12, 1955, and allowed US 75 to bypass its run on Main Street; it included interchanges with Allen Parkway and Memorial Drive. The next piece near downtown opened on July 24, 1962, leaving the 1955 freeway in the Allen Parkway interchange, passing east of Houston Avenue, and connected to an already-built portion at I-610. The six-lane Pierce Elevated, which occupies <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> on the southwest side of Pierce Street, required the acquisition of a number of commercial properties; the cost prevented the full block from being used. This portion opened on August 18, 1967, connecting the Gulf and North Freeways and bypassing the [...] "four-street distribution system", which remains in its original form to this day.|$|E
