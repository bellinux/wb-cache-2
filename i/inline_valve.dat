40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new non-intrusive methodology for testing the seal quality of <b>inline</b> stop <b>valves.</b> An <b>inline</b> stop <b>valve</b> {{is a common}} element of the water supply system, both in large diameter transmission pipelines and in distribution networks. A good quality valve seal is essential for executing an isolation procedure. The proposed technique uses an artificially generated hydraulic transient to test the valve seal. The valve resistance coefficient, {{the diameter of the}} orifice that is equivalent to the open area of the valve and the discharge rate through the valve are derived based on the reflection of the transient wave from the closed valve. The method provides a quick and inexpensive way of identifying <b>inline</b> stop <b>valves</b> that fail to seal and allows operators to rate their condition without internal access to the pipe.

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of sleeve valves: inline, angle pattern and {{downflow}} pattern. <b>Inline</b> sleeve <b>valve</b> {{can be installed}} in the pipeline or {{at the end of}} the pipeline for free discharge. <b>Inline</b> sleeve <b>valve</b> have an inlet section which allows upstream media to flow into an outer annular area. The flow then takes a 90° turn through the sleeve and collides with flow from the opposite side dissipating the energy. The flow then travels downstream through an exit spool on the downstream end. The angle pattern sleeve valve is installed at a 90° bend in place of an elbow. Angle pattern sleeve valves employ a similar design as the <b>inline</b> sleeve <b>valve</b> by creating an outer annular area to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow. The difference is that the flow direction after passing through the sleeve changes by 90°. Downflow pattern sleeve valves are installed at the end of a pipeline and discharge into sumps, reservoirs, stilling wells or tanks. Unlike inline and angle pattern the discharge of a downflow pattern is outward and is not contained by the valve itself.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{different}} aspects of failure management in urban water supply systems are discussed. As assets are getting older, the number of pipe failures is increasing and an efficient failure management strategy becomes important. Two types of failure management strategies can be applied: proactive asset condition assessment and reactive failure detection and location. Currently available condition assessment techniques cannot be extensively applied in water supply systems due to high cost and slow speed of inspection. Existing failure detection and location approaches do not allow for quick reaction to failures. Automatic failure monitoring and systematic asset condition assessment methods are presented in this thesis. Due to the different topology and hydraulic characteristics of the transmission (pipelines) and distribution (network) components of a water supply system, separate failure detection and location techniques are proposed. For both pipeline and network cases, two types of failures are considered - sudden pipe ruptures and breaks that develop {{over a longer period}} of time. For the pipeline case, a periodical leak diagnosis system based on transient response difference monitoring, is presented together with a burst monitoring, detection and location system, which is designed for rapid reaction to sudden pipeline ruptures. A single continuous pressure monitoring station is sufficient to detect and locate a failure along the whole length of a pipeline. For the network case, two continuous failure monitoring approaches are developed, which are based on steady-state (first method) and unsteady-state (second method) analysis. Continuous monitoring of the pressure is performed at a number of locations within the network. The optimal placement of pressure monitoring stations, limits of burst sizes that will be detected, uncertainty of the results and implementation aspects are discussed for both approaches. A transient-analysis-based low-cost, long-range nondestructive pipe condition assessment technique is presented that can be used as a proactive failure management tool and for rehabilitation planning in water transmission pipelines. A comparative evaluation of different pipeline sections can be made and critical sections with a high degree of deterioration can be identified. Finally, a transient-based methodology is presented, which is designed to test the seal quality of <b>inline</b> <b>valves</b> that are used to isolate pipe failures. The techniques presented in this thesis contribute to different points in the pipe asset management cycle and can improve reliability, availability, safety and efficiency of the urban water supply...|$|R

40|$|Several medical {{conditions}} require {{the administration of}} intravenous (IV) fluids,but limitations of mass, volume, shelf-life, transportation, and local resources can restrict the availability of these important fluids. Such limitations are expected in long-duration space exploration missions and in remote or austere places on Earth. This design uses regular drinking water that is pumped through two filters to produce, in minutes, sterile, ultrapure water that meets the stringent quality standards of the United States Pharmacopeia for Water for Injection (Total Bacteria, Conductivity, Endo - toxins, Total Organic Carbon). The device weighs 2. 2 lb (1 kg) and is 10 in. long, 5 in. wide, and 3 in. high (25, 13, and 7. 5 cm, respectively) in its storage configuration. This handheld device produces one liter of medical-grade water in 21 minutes. Total production capacity for this innovation {{is expected to be}} in the hundreds of liters. The device contains one battery powered electric mini-pump. Alternatively, a manually powered pump can be attached and used. Drinking water enters the device from a source water bag, flows through two filters, and final sterile production water exits into a sealed, medical-grade collection bag. The collection bag contains pre-placed crystalline salts to mix with product water to form isotonic intravenous medical solutions. Alternatively, a hypertonic salt solution can be injected into a filled bag. The filled collection bag is detached from the device and is ready for use or storage. This device currently contains one collection bag, but a manifold of several pre-attached bags or replacement of single collection bags under sterile needle technique is possible for the production of multiple liters. The entire system will be flushed, sealed, and radiation-sterilized. Operation of the device is easy and requires minimal training. Drinking water is placed into the collection bag. <b>Inline</b> stopcock flow <b>valves</b> at the source and collection bags are opened, and the mini-pump is turned on by a switch to begin fluid flow. When the collection bag is completely filled with the medical- grade water, the pump can be turned off. The pump is designed so it cannot pump air, and overfilling of the collection bag with fluid is avoided by placing an equal amount of water in the source bag. Backflow is avoided by <b>inline</b> check <b>valves.</b> The filled collection bag is disconnected from its tubing and is ready for use. The source bag can be refilled for production of multiple liters, or the source bag can be replaced with an input tube that can be placed in a larger potable water source if the device is attended. The device functions in all orientations independent of any gravity fields. In addition to creating IV fluids, the device produces medical-grade water, which can be used for mixing with medications for injection, reconstituting freeze-dried blood products for injection, or for wound hydration or irrigation. Potential worldwide use is expected with medical activities in environments that have limited resources, storage, or resupply such as in military field operations, humanitarian relief efforts, submarines, commercial cruise ships, etc...|$|R

40|$|The ECS and the {{anti-ice}} {{systems are}} two of the energy consumers for an aircraft; they absorb together two times the sum of the power of all the other systems (electrical, mechanical and hydraulic). More efficient ECSs and a more efficient anti-ice sub-systems would reduce the aircraft fuel consumption increasing the operative radius of the vehicle and also increasing the maximum useful load. The anti-ice sub-system is not only a key energy consumer {{but it is also a}} system critical for the flight safety: a failure of this system means a mission abort and the landing on the nearest airport. This thesis presents the results of several mathematical models which have been developed to study the performance of the aforementioned systems and the strategies to reduce their impacts on the aircraft fuel consumption. The models have been developed using AMEsim and Simulink. In particular a mathematical model, which describes the behavior of the <b>inline</b> pneumatic <b>valves,</b> have been created. The model uses the fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical differential equations to simulate the dynamic behavior of the valves. The mathematical model reproduces the results of the experimental tests within their uncertainty. The validated model has been used to explore the behavior of the valve and its own subcomponents proposing two possible solutions to increase the operative range of the valves and to decrease the influence of the pressure and temperature on the regulated pressure. The second detailed mathematical model created calculates the performance of the plate and wavy fins compact heat exchangers. The model, based on the work of Kays & London, includes some improvements related to the description heat exchanger geometry and related to the empirical correlations used to calculate the number of Stanton. The tests performed on three different heat exchangers have been used to validated the developed model; the mathematical model is able to predict the performance of the performance of the HXs with an accuracy compatible with most the industrial applications. The developed detailed models have been used to simulate the behavior of the system where they are installed. The behavior of an anti-ice system at extreme high bleed air temperature has been analyzed. An innovative architecture for anti-ice system is studied and the benefits on aircraft fuel consumption for a standard day mission are shown. The performance of an reverse Brayton-Joule cycle has been analyzed and a new possible control strategy based on a line installed in series to the air cycle machine is proposed. The limits of the proposed architecture are exposed studying the case of a system used to cool some electronic equipment. The benefits of the use of a reverse Brayton-Joule system which does not use the air bled from the engine (bleedless approach) are detailed with particular attention to the gain in terms of fuel penalty. The thesis ends with the results of the VCS simulations. Some technical solutions to fit a fixed displacement compressor architecture into an aircraft are explained; the solutions are oriented to increase the reliability of the compressor avoiding a continuous switch on and off even with low heat loads. A variable displacement compressor improves the overall efficiency of the system on a full mission profile (high COP in the cruise phase). Two strategies, one for passenger compartments and one for electronic cooling, which are able to expand the working envelope (in terms of minimum heat load) of the variable displacement compressor architecture are proposed...|$|R
