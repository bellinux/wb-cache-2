40|$|Human-friendly {{interactive}} features are preferred for domestic service robots. Humans {{prefer to use}} verbal communication in order to convey instructions to peers. Those voice instructions often include uncertain terms such as “little” and “far”. Therefore, the ability to quantify such information is mandatory for human-friendly service robots. The meaning of such voice instructions depends {{on the environment and}} the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the user. Therefore, this paper proposes a method in order to interpret the ambiguities in user instructions based on the environment and the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the user. The actual <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the user is identified by analyzing the pointing gestures accompanied with the voice instructions since pointing gestures can be used in order to express the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the user. A module called the motion intention switcher (MIS) has been introduced in order to switch the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the robot based on the arrangement of the environment and the point referred by the gesture. Experiments have been carried out in an artificially-created domestic environment. According to the experimental results, the behavior of the MIS is effective in identifying the actual <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the user and switching the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> the robot. Moreover, the proposed concept is capable of enhancing the uncertain information evaluation ability of robots...|$|R
