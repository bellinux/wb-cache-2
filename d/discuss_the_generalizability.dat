We empirically study whether users are successfully securing their client computers when using wireless networks. Automated techniques are used that scan users’ machines after they associate with a university wireless network. This determines whether a firewall is being used and what TCP ports are open. Results show that over 9 % of 3, 331 unique computers scanned were not using a properly configured firewall. In addition, almost 9 % had at least one TCP port open, with almost 6 % having open ports with significant security implications.

30|$|Despite the {{extraordinarily}} high {{ownership concentration}} widely observed in emerging market firms {{as a result}} of institutional voids, there is little research on how this high ownership concentration affects the exporting behavior of emerging market firms. From principal–agent and institutional perspectives, we hypothesize that high ownership concentration has a negative relationship with export intensity, because, in emerging markets, highly concentrated ownership bridges the interests of owners (principals) and managers (agents) so that principals must be prudent in exploring risky international markets. Moreover, we hypothesize that export country diversification strengthens the relationship between ownership concentration and export intensity, because broad geographic dispersion increases risk exposure and principal-agent problems. Empirical analysis based on a panel dataset for publicly listed firms in Peru from 2005 to 2014 supports the hypotheses. The study highlights the risk aversion attitude activated by ownership concentration, an attitude that protects emerging market firms from overconfidently exploring international business opportunities. The study extends the conventional literature on the interface between ownership concentration and international business in an emerging market context. We also <b>discuss</b> <b>the</b> <b>generalizability</b> of the findings to other emerging markets, e.g. China.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of asthma, and the morbidity, adverse events, mortality and healthcare utilisation of asthmatic patients vary widely among racial/ethnic and other socio-demographic groups. Debates over {{the meanings of}} race and ethnicity and the strategic need to resolve health inequalities have prompted extensive recommendations for reporting and analyzing racial/ethnic and demographic information in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review {{to determine the extent to}} which race/ethnicity, socio-economic status and other demographic variables are analyzed and reported in publications from randomized controlled trials of asthma interventions. Randomized controlled trials of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting ?-agonists in asthmatic patients were identified by systematically searching 12 electronic bibliographic databases. We identified peer-reviewed papers reporting 87 relevant trials published during 1985 – 2006, from which we extracted data on patients' race/ethnicity, ancestry, gender, socio-economic variables and geographical attributes. The proportion of the papers reporting the race/ethnicity of their participants was lower than would be expected by chance and has recently declined. None of the papers included race/ethnicity or gender in statistical analyses or reported socio-economic variables, ancestry, or genetic data for their participants, and few <b>discussed</b> <b>the</b> <b>generalizability</b> of their findings. The frequency of reporting race/ethnicity was statistically significantly lower in trials conducted in the UK than in the US, but 23 of the 87 papers did not identify countries. Despite extensive recommendations in the literature, guidance from health agencies on analyzing and reporting demographic data in clinical trials still appears inconsistent and vague. There remains a need to improve guidance on the representation and analysis of minority populations in asthma clinical trials, in order to encourage transparent reporting of population selection, analysis approaches, and trial generalizability. To assist this process, asthma clinical trials should be based on clear hypotheses that link both to existing demographic evidence and to demographic healthcare goals. <br/...|$|R

Specifically, three datasets that differ in factors such as cultural backgrounds of stimuli (music) and subjects (annotators), stimulus types and annotation methods are evaluated and the results suggested that cross-cultural and cross-dataset predictions of both valence and arousal values could achieve comparable performance to within-dataset predictions. We also <b>discuss</b> how <b>the</b> <b>generalizability</b> of regression models can be affected by dataset characteristics.

40|$|In {{addition}} to wireless telephony boom, a similar exponential increasing trend in wireless data service-for example, {{short message service}} (SMS) – is visible as technology advances. We develop a structural model to examine user demand for voice and SMS services. Specifically, we measure the own- and the cross-price elasticities of these services. The cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because marketing activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are substitutes or complements. The research context poses significant econometric challenges due to three-part tariffs, and sequential discrete plan choice and continuous quantity choice decisions. Using detailed individual consumption data of more than 6000 customers, we find that SMS and voice services are small substitutes. A 10 % increase {{in the price of}} voice minutes will induce about 0. 8 % increase in the demand for SMS. The own price elasticity of voice is also low, to the order of approximately- 0. 1.

40|$|The {{development}} of culturally and linguistically appropriate measurement {{is necessary to}} enable accurate assessment of preschool children’s interpersonal competence and behavioral difficulties. This need is most pressing for children from Hispanic backgrounds, who currently represent the fastest growing population of U. S. children. The present study investigated {{the psychometric properties of}} a Spanish and English version of the Penn Interactive Peer Play Scale (PIPPS; Fantuzzo et al., 1995) when employed with Spanish- and English-speaking teachers and students in an urban, Southeastern community. Psychometrically sound structures were obtained with the Spanish translation of the PIPPS in support of the three original dimensions named Play Interaction, Play Disruption, and Play Disconnection, which were derived from studies of African American preschool children in lower income, Northeastern communities. Concurrent validity was supported by significant correlationsbetween the three Spanish PIPPS constructs and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Significant group differences in class-room peer play interactions were also detected for children’s gender and ethnicity. The independent emergence of comparable Spanish and English PIPPS factor structures across two distinct regional samples provides initial support for use of this measure in research with Hispanic preschool children from low-income backgrounds.

40|$|As machine {{learning}} (ML) systems emerge in end-user applications, learning algorithms and classifiers {{will need to}} be robust to an increasingly unpredictable operating environment. In many cases, the parameters governing a learning system cannot be optimized for every user scenario, nor can users typically manipulate parameters defined in the space and terminology of ML. Conventional approaches to user-oriented ML systems have typically hidden this complexity from users by automating parameter adjustment. We propose a new paradigm, in which model and algorithm parameters are exposed directly to end-users with intuitive labels, suitable for applications where parameters cannot be automatically optimized or where there is additional motivation – such as creative flexibility – to expose, rather than fix or automatically adapt, learning parameters. In our CHI 2008 paper, we introduced and evaluated MySong, a system that uses a Hidden Markov Model to generate chords to accompany a vocal melody. The present paper formally describes the learning underlying MySong and discusses the mechanisms by which MySong‟s learning parameters are exposed to users, as a case study in making ML systems user-configurable.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{feasibility}} of choiceless control in determining perceptions of control, influence, responsibility, and helplessness over outcomes. After reviewing and critiquing some traditional theories and research that exist in the control literature, a new conceptualization of control is presented. Based on research by Nickels et al. (2005), an extended research design was proposed and tested, which examined the separate effects of actual control, choice, and predictability. The present findings show significantly higher ratings of perceived influence under conditions in which individuals made their own choice (whether voluntary or involuntary) between options that made a difference (actual control) in a failed outcome that was predicted. Whereas perceived control ratings were significantly higher with actual control, feelings of responsibility over the outcome were significantly higher when actual control was combined with a voluntary choice. Although feelings of helplessness were not significantly affected, ratings of frustration over the outcome were significantly higher when actual control was combined with the prediction that a failed outcome would occur.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the communicative use of family homes within the daily life of a rural community. As an ethnography of communicative behavior, the nature and functions of the home as a medium of communication are explored within a specified social context so that the social and cultural influences which shape its use and interpretation may be examined. The study explores the structure of rules, roles, values, customs and beliefs which organize how homes are used, how they are evaluated, and how they come to assume meaning within this frame of reference. It was hypothesized that family homes, as media of social communication, function as artifacts of and instruments for the structure of social relations that prevail within the community that employs them. Research was directed, therefore, to examining the role of family homes in the expression of patterns of association and differentiation through which social identity and the community 2 ̆ 7 s system of social status are negotiated, marked and maintained. ^ The study draws on fourteen months of fieldwork, during which family homes were investigated as complex, multi-modal systems of communicative activity. Patterns of household maintenance, rules and customs in the use of household and community space, comparisons of house size and layout, traditions in the acquisition and use of furnishings, and patterns in taste preferences are each examined as integrated aspects of this system of communication. ^ In this way a structure of shared values, standards and traditions is described which is shown to regulate the conduct and interpretation of activity in this sphere at a variety of levels. While previous research has emphasized the home 2 ̆ 7 s value as an index of social class, this study finds that households are, in this insular community, devoted centrally to the expression of a family 2 ̆ 7 s social orientation and moral repute. Processes of status comparison are muted, while homes serve to mark and maintain interdependent networks of kinship and affiliation through which social life is ordered and personal identity is defined.
