Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power {{for a short period of}} time to open it, and only low power to hold it.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Incremental {{threshold}} loading (ITL) {{is a test}} of inspiratory muscle performance {{which is}} usually performed by breathing through a weighted inspiratory plunger, the load on the inspiratory muscles being increased by externally adding weights to the intake valve. This is not a true threshold device and may be inaccurate. This method was compared with a true threshold device consisting of a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> which only opens to supply air at a predetermined negative mouth pressure. METHODS [...] Six naive, normal subjects (three men and three women) aged 22 - 24 years underwent three tests using each system. The inspiratory loads were increased every minute by equivalent amounts, - 10 cm H 2 O with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> and by 50 g with the weighted plunger, until the subjects could not inspire or sustain inspiration for a full minute. Six experienced subjects (four men and two women) aged 23 - 41 years were subsequently randomised to perform ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> twice with the breathing pattern fixed and twice free. RESULTS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> generated a more accurate mouth pressure response and was less variable at higher loads than the weighted plunger. The work performed (expressed as the pressure-time product) was less with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> but was more reproducible. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> was not influenced by controlling the breathing pattern of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> has several features that make it superior to the weighted plunger as a device for ITL. It generates a more accurate mouth pressure response which is less variable at higher loads. Increases in load are smoother and quicker to introduce. ITL with the <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> is not influenced by varying breathing patterns and does not require any external regulation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> {{are vital}} pieces of {{equipment}} which {{have been widely used}} in a variety of industries. Fault detection methods of <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> play important role for improving their reliability and maintenance efficiency due to their high failure rates in the field.

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} {{is the main}} power source for most {{agricultural}} vehicles. The control of diesel engine emissions is an important global issue. Fuel injection control systems directly affect fuel efficiency and emissions of diesel engines. Deterioration faults, such as rack deformation, <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> failure, and rack-travel sensor malfunction, are possibly in the fuel injection module of electronic diesel control (EDC) systems. Among these faults, <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> failure {{is most likely to}} occur for in-use diesel engines.
