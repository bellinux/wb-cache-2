5|$|In 1992, Joe McEwen of Sire Records {{began to}} pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and Shawn Colvin to Sire, had been <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> since hearing the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape. At the urging of Gary Louris, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal {{required}} two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.|$|E
5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He {{had always}} been <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them,</b> and now followed {{the example of a}} recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian High Command and the United States Air Force {{agreed on}} 29 May 1974 {{that there would}} be {{established}} nine collocated operating bases (COB) in Norway, including Flesland. This involved establishing nine air stations which in case of crisis and war could act as forward operating bases for about six hundred US aircraft. In addition to ground support for the aircraft and crew, it involved the stationing of spare parts, ammunition and fuel. The COBs were completed in 1985. By 1993 the US was no longer <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> and Flesland lost this status from 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{house at}} Avenida 3 Ote 201 {{in the city}} of Puebla belonged to Pedro de Carvajal, who was a wealthy and {{respected}} man. However, he lost his young wife as she gave birth to their second child, a boy. When his daughter turned 15, there were many interested suitors but she was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> One day a monster appeared at a party in the city provoking terror. The monster went to the Carvajal house and ate the younger son, who was playing out front of the house. Pedro offered a large reward for the capture of the beast. One young man, who wanted the hand of Pedro’s daughter, appeared at another festival, bearing the head of the beast. It is said that this young man gained noble title and the hand of the daughter as a reward.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} set during Brown's 1970s {{adolescence}} in Châteauguay, {{a suburb of}} Montreal. [...] Chester—"Chet" [...] for short—is a thin, long-haired teenager who is awkward, introverted, and better able to express himself through drawing than speaking. [...] He constantly and inexplicably turns away girls, {{even though he is}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> and they in him. Except in his imagination, Chet has difficulty expressing affection even for his mother. [...] She talks to Chet and his younger brother Gord about issues that embarrass them, and the religious teaching she has instilled in them has rendered Chet unable to bring himself to swear, for which he is teased and goaded at school.|$|E

The next day things end abruptly when Liz finds a picture of her great-aunt in his apartment and they learn that they are related.|$|E
500|$|One {{film critic}} {{described}} the numerous influences: [...] "From his infelicitous name to his physical clumsiness, Norville Barnes is a Preston Sturges hero {{trapped in a}} Frank Capra story, and never should that twain meet, especially not {{in a world that}} seems to have been created by Fritz Lang – the mechanistic monstrousness of the mailroom contrasted with the Bauhaus gigantism of the corporate offices perfectly matches the boss-labour split in Metropolis (1927)." [...] An interviewer proposed that the characters represent capitalism versus labour economics. Joel Coen replied: [...] "Maybe the characters do embody those grand themes you mentioned, but that question is independent of whether or not we're <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> – and we're not." [...] The Hudsucker Proxy presents various narrative motifs pertaining to the Rota Fortunae and visual motifs concerning the shape of circles. This includes Moses' monologue at the beginning, the Hudsucker Clock, Mussburger's wristwatch, the inventions of both the hula hoop and frisbee, as well as Norville and Amy's conversation about Karma.|$|E
500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E

2500|$|With the {{completion}} of her second novel, The Feast of All Saints (1979), American author Anne Rice started her research for another, which she planned to set during the French Revolution with a violinist as its protagonist. Rice, however, changed her mind when she read about castrated opera singers and a Naples conservatory during her research, and became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>them,</b> seeing potential in how the Italian society viewed them as less than men, yet flocked to their opera performances. Rice did historical research for Cry to Heaven: W.J. Henderson's Early History of Singing provided the foundation for how Guido taught singing, and in Vernon Lee's Studies in the 18th Century in Italy, she read about Achilles en Sciro by Metastasio, which she later used for Tonio's debut in Rome. A 1972 recording [...] "Baroque Venice, Music of Gabrieli, Bassano, Monteverdi" [...] directly inspired Tonio's musical experience at San Marco, while Alessandro Scarlatti's The Garden of Love inspired the duet of Tonio and Christina—the {{only part of the}} novel written to music. For the settings, she relied on her travels to Venice and Rome a few years earlier, and read the diary of German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe detailing his trip to Naples, although she found a lack of material on the conservatories.|$|E
