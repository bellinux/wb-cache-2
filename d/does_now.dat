5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop it. While he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it <b>does</b> <b>now.</b> Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|When US12 was {{designated}} in Michigan on November 11, 1926, {{along with the}} other original US Highways, it ran along a more northerly course. It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state, the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail, a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area. It entered from Indiana as it <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor–St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo, Battle Creek and Jackson. In the Ann Arbor area, it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown. In the 1940s and 1950s, sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways. Starting in 1959, these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94, and in January 1962, US12 was shifted to replace US Highway112 (US112). That highway, when it {{was designated}} in 1926 replaced the original M-23 along the Chicago Road. Later, US112 replaced the first M-151 when the former was extended to New Buffalo in the mid-1930s. Since 1962, the highway has remained relatively unchanged aside from minor truncations in the city of Detroit. US112 previously had two business loops, both of which were renumbered Business US12 (Bus. US12) in 1962. In 2010, the Niles business loop was decommissioned, but the one in Ypsilanti remains. One section of the former US112 was renumbered US112S for a few years in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|If {{nuclear power}} use is to expand significantly, nuclear {{facilities}} {{will have to}} be made extremely safe from attacks that could release massive quantities of radioactivity into the community. New reactor designs have features of passive safety, such as the flooding of the reactor core without active intervention by reactor operators. But these safety measures have generally been developed and studied with respect to accidents, not to the deliberate reactor attack by a terrorist group. However, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission <b>does</b> <b>now</b> also require new reactor license applications to consider security during the design stage.|$|E
25|$|For some time, the Regiment of Artillery {{commanded}} a significantly {{larger share of}} the Army's personnel than it <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> as it was also responsible for air defense artillery and some aviation assets.

The arm is now focused on field artillery, and supplies regiments and batteries to each of the operational commands. The home of the Regiment is in Nashik, Maharashtra, where their headquarters is located along with the service's museum. The School of Artillery of the Indian Army is located nearby in Devlali.|$|E

25|$|SH-67 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} on May 21, 1936, {{serving in the}} same capacity—connecting US 75 to US 64 south of Tulsa—as it <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> though with a much different route. The original SH-67 began at US-75 in Mounds (US-75 at the time using the present-day route of US-75ALT) and continuing east through far southern Tulsa County, reaching US-64 south of Bixby. The first extension to SH-67 occurred just over one month into the highway's life, on June 23, 1936. This extended the designation north along US-75 to Sapulpa. From here, it ran concurrent with US-66 out of town, splitting from US-66 to follow present-day SH-33 (which at this time followed SH-51 en route to downtown Tulsa) and {{coming to an end}} in Drumright.|$|E
25|$|Further {{expansion}} of US 1 Alternate occurred {{as a result}} of Interstate highway construction. The alternate route was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with I-695 when that interchange was constructed between 1956 and 1958. This interchange included all of the ramps {{on the east side of}} the interchange, but on the west side it also included ramps from southbound US 1 Alternate to westbound I-695, from southbound US 1 Alternate to eastbound I-695, and from eastbound I-695 to Sulphur Spring Road, which passed closer to the Interstate than it <b>does</b> <b>now.</b> The I-695–US 1 Alternate interchange was reduced to its present ramps after the I-95–I-695 interchange, including that interchange's ramp to relocated Sulphur Spring Road, was completed in 1971. Most of the Caton Avenue portion of US 1 Alternate was expanded to a divided highway in 1972 in conjunction with the completion of the western half of I-95's interchange with US 1 Alternate. The eastern half of the I-95 interchange was completed in 1977 when I-95 was extended east to Russell Street.|$|E
25|$|The PLA Navy {{was ranked}} in 1987 {{as the third}} largest navy in the world, {{although}} naval personnel had comprised only 12 percent of PLA strength. In 1987 the Navy consisted (as it <b>does</b> <b>now)</b> of the naval headquarters in Beijing; three fleet commands – the North Sea Fleet, based at Qingdao, Shandong; the East Sea Fleet, based at Ningbo; and the South Sea Fleet, based at Zhanjiang, Guangdong – and about 2,000 ships. The 350,000-person Navy included Naval Air Force units of 34,000 men, the Coastal Defense Forces of 38,000, and the Marine Corps of 56,500. Navy Headquarters, which controlled the three fleet commands, was subordinate to the PLA General Staff Department. In 1987, China's 1,500km coastline was protected by more than 100 diesel-powered Romeo- and Whiskey-class submarines, which could remain at sea only a limited time. Inside this protective ring and within range of shore-based aircraft were destroyers and frigates mounting Styx anti-ship missiles, depth-charge projectors, and guns up to 130mm. Any invader penetrating the destroyer and frigate protection would have been swarmed by almost 900 fast-attack craft. Stormy weather limited the range of these small boats, however, and curtailed air support. Behind the inner ring were Coastal Defense Force personnel operating naval shore batteries of Styx missiles and guns, backed by ground force units deployed in depth.|$|E

This included her critically acclaimed autobiography, The Story of My Life, published by Cassell in London, in three volumes. The book was reviewed by Virginia Woolf, who felt it was too familiarizing of the royal family. She stated that [...] "suppose that among the autumn books of 2034 is Prometheus Unbound, by George the Sixth, or Wuthering Heights, by Elizabeth the Second, what will be the effect upon their loyal subjects?

500|$|... "My part is done," [...] Rhodes {{wrote to}} Maund, soon after {{reaching}} Cape Town; [...] "the charter is granted supporting Rudd Concession and granting us the interior... We {{have the whole}} thing recognised by the Queen and even if eventually we had any difficulty with king [...] the Home people would now always recognise us in possession of the minerals they quite understand that savage potentates frequently repudiate." [...] A few weeks later, he wrote to Maund again: with the royal charter in place, [...] "whatever [...] <b>does</b> <b>now</b> will not affect {{the fact that when}} there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country". On 29 October 1889, nearly a year to the day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.|$|E
