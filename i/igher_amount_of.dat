One of the alternative energy is bio fuel, {{and one of the}} bio fuel types is bio ethanol. The purpose of this research is to determine the best factors and level combination on bio ethanol fermentation process, in order to made bio ethanol with higher content. Cassava is used as the raw material of bio ethanol making process. This research was conducted using Two Levels Full Factorial Design method. Factors which are studied are the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> urea fertilizer NPK (fertilizer) type, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> NPK, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> yeast, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> alpha amylase enzyme, and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> glucoamylase enzyme. Data was analyzed using ANOVA test, main effect plot, and interaction effect plot. As a result, type <b>of</b> NPK, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> NPK, <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> alpha amylase enzyme, and <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> glucoamylase enzyme are factors that {{have a significant effect on}} the bio ethanol fermentation process.
