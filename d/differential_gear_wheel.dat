40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for the two-dimensional scanning of a surface {{by means of a}} light beam and a mirror (4) rotatable about two axes perpendicular to each other. One axis is an optical axis (A-A) along which a light beam emitted by a light source runs. The rotating movements of the mirror (4) are caused by two drive motors (1, 2), whereby the rotating movement of the mirror is transferred onto the optical axis (A-A) perpendicular to the standing axis (B-B) via a <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> (5). The <b>differential</b> <b>gear</b> (5) has two intermeshing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> (10, 11). The mirror (4) is arranged in a mirror holder (3) connected to a hollow shaft rotatable about the axis (B-B).

5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a <b>wheeled</b> vehicle with <b>differential</b> <b>gears</b> that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> the diameter of each <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and how these <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were properly positioned.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{powerful}} horse mill for four horses; probably English ponies, as modern heavy horses were not yet fully bred in the 1830s. Each of the four heavy oak beams connecting the central axle to the four horse shafts runs from beside the axle to the under-surface of the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and crosses the other three in a grid pattern between the axle and <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> thus supporting the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> and creating a rigid structure at the same time. They project for many feet beyond the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and require wooden stretchers to stabilise them. From the ends of these beams hang the horse shafts. The bottom ends of these shafts are quite low, which may indicate the use of ponies rather than early heavy horses.|$|R

25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> A large horizontal <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road <b>wheels.</b> Two small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|R
