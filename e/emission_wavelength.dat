25|$|Two-color microarrays or two-channel microarrays are {{typically}} hybridized with cDNA prepared from two samples {{to be compared}} (e.g. diseased tissue versus healthy tissue) and that are labeled with two different fluorophores. Fluorescent dyes commonly used for cDNA labeling include Cy3, which has a fluorescence <b>emission</b> <b>wavelength</b> of 570nm (corresponding to the green part of the light spectrum), and Cy5 with a fluorescence <b>emission</b> <b>wavelength</b> of 670nm (corresponding to the red part of the light spectrum). The two Cy-labeled cDNA samples are mixed and hybridized to a single microarray that is then scanned in a microarray scanner to visualize fluorescence of the two fluorophores after excitation with a laser beam of a defined wavelength. Relative intensities of each fluorophore may then be used in ratio-based analysis to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes.|$|E

Pyrene self associates in membrane and then excited pyrene excites other pyrene. Before fusion, {{the majority of the}} emission is excimer emission. After fusion, the distance between probes increases and the ratio of excimer emission decreases.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide range}} of fluorophores {{can be used as}} labels in flow cytometry. Fluorophores, or simply [...] "fluors", are {{typically}} attached to an antibody that recognizes a target feature on or in the cell; they may also be attached to a chemical entity with affinity for the cell membrane or another cellular structure. Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and <b>emission</b> <b>wavelength,</b> and the emission spectra often overlap. Consequently, the combination of labels which can be used depends on the wavelength of the lamp(s) or laser(s) used to excite the fluorochromes and on the detectors available. The maximum number of distinguishable fluorescent labels is thought to be 17 or 18, and this level of complexity necessitates laborious optimization to limit artifacts, as well as complex deconvolution algorithms to separate overlapping spectra. Flow cytometry uses fluorescence as a quantitative tool; the utmost sensitivity of flow cytometry is unmatched by other fluorescent detection platforms such as confocal microscopy. Absolute fluorescence sensitivity is generally lower in confocal microscopy because out-of-focus signals are rejected by the confocal optical system and because the image is built up serially from individual measurements at every location across the cell, reducing the amount of time available to collect signal.|$|E
