The struggle between these two sometimes overlapping factions ended, at least temporarily, with the resignation of Douglas and the succession of Woodrow S.

After twenty years in office, a centrist-bureaucratic ideology dominated the party and the anti-statist decentralist in the Saskatchewan CCF was in retreat.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} in which probabilistic insurance, as proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979), is compared both with full <b>insurance</b> and <b>no</b> <b>insurance.</b> The experimental results conform to the intuitive prediction that risk-averse agents who are indifferent between full <b>insurance</b> and <b>no</b> <b>insurance,</b> will prefer full insurance to probabilistic insurance and probabilistic <b>insurance</b> to <b>no</b> <b>insurance.</b> The first conclusion is incompatible with the predictions of expected utility theory, and the second with Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory. We also show that Loomes and Sudgen's regret theory can easily accommodate these intuitive results.

50|$|Buarque {{is also a}} {{proposer}} of {{an alternative}} class analysis of modern capitalist societies. According to him, in modern capitalism, the increasing substitution of human labour for automated machines tends to make employed workers a privileged caste, while a new layer of “excluded” people - those who have no jobs, no <b>insurance,</b> <b>no</b> health care - is formed, whose members are the real victims of social inequality. As this new underclass, however, {{does not have the}} ability to effectively counter its exploitation by capitalism, Buarque’s thought constantly tends towards some kind of substitutionism, in which political action by wide masses is replaced by government or institutional action on their behalf.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{going into}} medicine, I earned an MBA and worked to {{maximize}} profits for several different companies. I {{believe in the}} free market system. But for-profit companies aren’t the answer to our state’s mental health crisis.Here’s why: A for-profit company puts profitability, rather than high quality patient care, atop its list of priorities. This undermines the goal of providing innovative health care to the mentally ill.In a free market system, for-profit companies succeed or fail based {{on their ability to}} provide what customers want. If enough customers refuse to do business with a company - because of poor quality products, or inferior customer service - market pressures force that company to respond.But as “customers,” our state’s mentally ill do not have free market power. They are in desperate need of immediate care. They cannot choose to take their business elsewhere, or wait until the quality of service improves. They have no <b>insurance,</b> <b>no</b> money, and - without an ombudsman to help them - no voice and no options.They must rely on the state to provide the care they need.|$|E
