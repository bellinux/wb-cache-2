5|$|A major Brundage {{investment}} was Chicago's La Salle Hotel, {{which had been}} built in 1908. Located {{in the heart of}} The Loop and the city's financial district, Brundage first leased it in 1940, later purchasing <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it. As Brundage made a home there during his time as IOC president, the hotel became famous in international sports as his residence. He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed <b>it</b> <b>when</b> the purchaser failed to make required payments.|$|E

It is so, and may become a vice, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> leads us to wish evil {{to those who have}} offended us. <b>It</b> is resentment <b>when</b> <b>it</b> prompts us to meet and repay evil by evil. <b>It</b> is vengeance <b>when</b> <b>it</b> impels us to crush those who have injured us. <b>It</b> is vindictiveness <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is seeking out ingeniously and laboriously means and instruments to give pain to those who have thwarted us. Already sin has entered." ...|$|R
5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the futility of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge <b>it</b> <b>when</b> divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E

5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect <b>it</b> <b>when</b> searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E

5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably to protect <b>it</b> <b>when</b> searching for {{food on the}} sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it.|$|E

It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, feeling that they were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E

The first published account of Yosemite Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20, 1854, issue of the Mariposa Chronicle, establishing the modern spelling of Yosemite. Bunnell described his awestruck impressions of the valley in his book, The Discovery of the Yosemite, published in 1892.|$|E

While Giselle is not being marketed as one of the Disney Princesses, Enchanted merchandise was made available in various outlets with Adams' animated likeness being used on all Giselle merchandise.

She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E
