40|$|Introduction. Inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{glans penis}} defined as {{balanitis}} or balanoposthitis constitute a disease in which <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> conservative treatment is not sufficient. Objective. To present <b>the</b> therapeutic efficacy <b>of</b> magneto-LED therapy in the treatment, and {{to present a}} patient with inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glans penis. Case report. The patient, 68 years old with inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glans penis <b>of</b> 2 – 4 years duration, was previously treated with various methods of local therapy without effect. As {{a result of a}} 32 -week long magneto-LED therapy cycle, complete resolution of skin lesions with subsidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burning sensation during urination and reduced swelling and inflammatory erythema <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glans, as well as disappearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white coating and unpleasant smell, was achieved. Conclusions. Magneto-LED therapy is an efficient method of treatment of inflammatory lesions and <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glans penis...|$|R

5|$|The lakes of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by differential <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape.

The resulting depressions in the landscape later filled with water, becoming the lakes of today.|$|E
5|$|The site {{is at the}} top of a Carboniferous Limestone ridge on the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. It forms part of the Black Down Pericline where the limestone has been exposed because of <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overlying Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate. The soil depth varies considerably, owing to the slope within the site and the effects of its exposure to the wind.|$|E
5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in the years since, with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to the <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway's shoulders. In mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional importance as a through route for commuters traveling {{to and from the}} village of Malone.|$|E

5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and esophagus, such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> esophagus and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E

5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

40|$|To {{diagnose}} {{a probable}} case of rheumatoid arthritis in a mummified female {{body from the}} 16 th century and to backdate the first clinical diagnosis, entering the diatribe regarding <b>the</b> ancientness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. METHODS: Image techniques such as normal X-ray, X-ray by mammography, total body CT and high resolution CT were used. Microscopic examination by stereomicroscopy was performed. Samples of tissue were submitted to histology. These data and <b>the</b> review <b>of</b> past literary references, of artistic representations and of paleopathological cases provided an interesting contribution to reconstruct <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. RESULTS: <b>The</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> "Braids Lady" showed all <b>the</b> "stigmata" <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. The left hand revealed large <b>erosions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metacarpophalangeal joints <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> third and the fourth fingers, volar metacarpophalangeal subluxation <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> third and the fourth fingers and lateral deviation <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> fingers.

5|$|Weather {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down the rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances. During rains precipitation, the water droplets absorb and dissolve carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. This causes the rainwater to be slightly acidic, which aids the erosive properties of water. The released sediment and chemicals are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain), and sodium and chloride ions (salt) deposited in the seas/oceans. The sediment may reform in time and by geological forces into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather {{plays a major role in}} <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the southern Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category4 status by 0600UTC on September 14. As it gradually {{turned to the}} north, southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane. An eyewall replacement cycle, along with dry air and restricted outflow, contributed to the weakening. By late on September 14 the weakening trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined, and Ivan was expected to restrengthen slightly over an area of warmer water temperatures. The eye diameter expanded to 60miles (95km/h), though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry air continued to increase. As Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, Hurricane Hunters reported <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern portion of the eyewall, and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening. At around 0650UTC on September 16, Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama with an intensity of 120mph (195km/h); the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border. Its landfall {{was accompanied by a}} 10–15feet (3–4.5m) storm surge from Destin, Florida westward to Mobile Bay.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) the sea was retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{forest fire}} on the erosion by rainsplash and sheet erosion was mainly {{examined}} based on the field survey in Kutai National Park. Lowering values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground surface (depth <b>of</b> <b>erosion)</b> against exposed tree roots as datable references were measured at each corner point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> survey plot and the erosion rate (mm/yr) was calculated. The erosion rate is different between the unburnt area and the burnt area. <b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unburnt area is small, being 0. 13 to 0. 35 mm/yr. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burnt area is 2. 30 to 4. 65 mm/yr. The forest fire accelerates <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>erosion</b> on <b>the</b> ground surface. This reason may be burning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vegetation cover and the soil organic matter including litter, increasing susceptibility of soil to rainsplash and sheet <b>erosion,</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overland flow due to low infiltration rate on the slopes and so forth. The old charcoal layer was found out in <b>the</b> soil composed <b>of</b> sediment from <b>the</b> upper slope around <b>the</b> camp sites <b>of</b> km 45, 24 and 9.
