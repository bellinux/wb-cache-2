Looking back I'll make bold and say that if Allen had had the chance of bowling with Titmus in partnership the result could very well have gone the other way.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s a concept engine called the Bricklin-Turner Rotary Vee was tested. The Rotary Vee {{is similar in}} {{configuration}} to the elbow steam engine. Piston pairs connect as solid V shaped members, with each <b>end</b> <b>floating</b> {{in a pair of}} rotating cylinders clusters. The rotating cylinder cluster pairs are set with their axes at a wide V angle. The pistons in each cylinder cluster move parallel to each other instead of a radial direction, This engine design has not gone into production. The Rotary Vee was intended to power the Bricklin SV-1.|$|R

5000|$|Rimbaud expounded {{the same}} ideas in his poem [...] "Le bateau ivre" [...] ("The Drunken Boat"). This hundred-line poem tells {{the tale of}} a boat that breaks free of human society when its {{handlers}} are killed by [...] "Redskins" [...] (Peaux-Rouges). At first thinking that it is drifting where it pleases, the boat soon realizes that it is being guided by and to the [...] "poem of the sea". It sees visions both magnificent ("the awakening blue and yellow of singing phosphorescence", [...] "l'éveil jaune et bleu des phosphores chanteurs") and disgusting ("nets where in the reeds an entire Leviathan was rotting" [...] "nasses / Où pourrit dans les joncs tout un Léviathan). It <b>ends</b> <b>floating</b> and washed clean, wishing only to sink and become one with the sea.|$|R

50|$|In {{a similar}} way, {{one end of}} the charge {{trapping}} cell can be erased by placing the erasing field at one end or the other of the channel, allowing the other <b>end</b> to <b>float</b> as shown in Figure 3. Band-to-band Hot Hole Erase creates holes that are trapped locally some of which recombine with electrons to remove the charge from that end of the charge trap.|$|R
50|$|Floating Clouds (Ukigumo) is a 1955 {{black-and-white}} Japanese film drama {{directed by}} Mikio Naruse. It {{is based on}} a novel with the same name by Japanese author and poet Fumiko Hayashi, written just before she died in 1951. The novel is set after World War II and contains the common post-war theme of wandering; the female main character struggles to find where she belongs in post-war Japan, and <b>ends</b> up <b>floating</b> endlessly about.|$|R

5000|$|The beach itself {{became an}} {{enormous}} supply dump and two field hospitals were established, one at either <b>end.</b> Four <b>floating</b> jetties were quickly constructed for the landing of stores, later replaced in July by a permanent structure known as [...] "Watson's Pier". The volume of stores quickly overflowed onto the adjacent beaches; firstly onto [...] "Brighton Beach" [...] {{to the south}} of the cove and later onto North Beach beyond Ari Burnu. Three wireless radio stations were established on the beach to maintain contact with the fleet.|$|R

50|$|In 1992 MS Mcleod {{decided to}} divest {{themselves}} of their {{investment in the}} company, and with no local buyer in the offing and the company again facing closure or a fire sale to a multinational, a public float was devised. While the core shareholding {{was intended to be}} taken up by the growers themselves and by staff, it was feared that the capital raised would be insufficient and so a share and option package was offered publicly. In the <b>end</b> the <b>float</b> was oversubscribed and the new company performed strongly.|$|R
50|$|Marine debris is human-created {{waste that}} <b>ends</b> up <b>floating</b> in the sea. Oceanic debris tends to {{accumulate}} at {{the centre of}} gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. Eighty percent of all known marine debris is plastic - a component that has been rapidly accumulating {{since the end of}} World War II. Plastics accumulate because they don't biodegrade as many other substances do; while they will photodegrade on exposure to the sun, they do so only under dry conditions, as water inhibits this process.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} round of the Island Challenge, Claw went first. On Bronte and Harriet's turns, she easily managed to get across. Sting also managed to knock a die from Abbey's hands and they made Rachael fall off twice, losing 6 points from their score. As Claw put more dice on, Abbey knocked off a die by mistake from their {{collected}} dice. Later, another die was knocked off by Bronte. Harriet passed it to Bronte, but unaware of this, she took it back to the start. Once the time was up, Claw achieved to transport 11 dice, but with the two falls, their total was reduced to 5. On Sting's turn, the members were getting across the pontoons easily, but Claw were having troubles with their boulders and did not achieve a hit. Harriet even got tangled up in the boulders and fell off her own platform as Shya was crossing. In the last few seconds, Michael was having trouble untying a die from the start, while another die from the <b>end</b> <b>floated</b> away. When the time was up, Sting had achieved 13 dice, winning the challenge and the advantage for Janardan in the second round. When choosing which role to play as in the second round, Janardan said that 'throwing boulders at Brandon was tempting', but decided to choose with running across the pontoons.|$|R
5000|$|... 6. As the Road Runner {{traverses}} another road, the Coyote {{is shown}} at {{the top edge of}} a cliff, getting ready to drop an anvil. Another dart takes out a third of the cliff's edge and two more darts pepper the <b>floating</b> <b>end.</b> Wile E. jumps onto the [...] "secure" [...] main cliff, but the entire cliff falls down. The Coyote pulls himself on top of the anvil to avoid getting bonked on the head with it. The anvil smashes through the ground, followed by Wile E. and the <b>floating</b> <b>end</b> of the cliff with the two darts. The Coyote covers his face with his ears to prepare for the worst, but instead of exploding the darts unfurl into [...] "THE" [...] and [...] "END". Wile E. pokes one eye out at both of them and laughs deeply.|$|R
50|$|As it is a pre-alpha, the {{prototype}} is rather limited; Mario can only walk both ways and jump, and no powerups exist. He cannot slide or swim, {{but it would}} appear that these abilities would have been implemented had development continued. Enemies are also not programmed correctly; they disappear when Mario ends up above them, suggesting incomplete stomping attempts. Enemies also cannot harm Mario, and are stopped in their tracks if touched, even if it means <b>ending</b> up <b>floating</b> in the air. Mario also can't die when he falls into a pit. Instead, he floats on it.|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} wind power industry is the branch of electric energy production from renewable sources which is most intensively developed in EU countries. At present, {{there is a tendency}} to install larger-power wind turbines at larger distances from the seashore, on relatively deep waters. Consequently, technological solutions for new supporting structures intended for deeper water regions are undergoing rapid development now. Various design types are proposed and analysed, starting from gravitational supports (GBS), through monopiles and 3 D frame structures (jackets, tripods), and <b>ending</b> with <b>floating</b> and submerged supports anchored to the seabed by flexible connectors, including TLP type solutions...|$|R

Megatron took Omega to Earth, and attacked the Autobots, until Starscream took control of the giant, planning to use him to conquer Cybertron. Before Omega took off, Optimus Prime managed to place a plasma dynamic thruster on him, causing him to uncontrollably and endlessly transwarp across the universe.|$|R

50|$|Water first {{enters the}} National Water Carrier through a several hundred meter long {{pipeline}} which is submerged under {{the northern part}} of Sea of Galilee. The water passes into a reservoir on the shore and then travels on to a pumping station. The pipeline is made up of nine pipes which are joined by an internal cable threaded through them. Each of these pipes includes twelve concrete pipes, each five meters long and three meters wide. As these pipes were cast, they were encased in steel pipes, sealed at the <b>ends</b> and <b>floated</b> out onto the lake. A winged star-shaped cap is mounted in a vertical section of the underwater pipe to allow water to be taken in from all directions.|$|R
