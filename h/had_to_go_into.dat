5|$|On 20 June, Prinzess Wilhelm {{arrived in}} the Philippines; Diederichs now had a force of five warships: Prinzess Wilhelm, Kaiser, Irene, Kaiserin Augusta, and Cormoran. After her arrival, Prinzess Wilhelm {{proceeded}} to Mariveles to replenish her coal supplies and receive new crewmen from the transport Darmstadt. On 9 August, the American squadron in the Bay ordered the neutral warships in the harbor to leave the bombardment zone, and so Prinzess Wilhelm and the other German ships went to Mariveles. Following {{the fall of the}} city, most of the German ships departed the Philippines; only Prinzess Wilhelm remained on station to protect German nationals in the islands. She was replaced by Arcona in October. In mid-November, Kaiser ran aground and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> drydock for repairs; Diederichs therefore made Prinzess Wilhelm his flagship. The ship remained in Asia for only a few more months, returning to European waters in 1899.|$|E
25|$|Leggio and his faction emerged victorious, and he {{eventually}} {{took his place}} on the Sicilian Mafia Commission. However, the increase in violence in Corleone, coupled with the Ciaculli massacre in Palermo relating to a separate Mafia War, had inspired a crackdown against the Mafia in 1963, meaning Leggio and his associates <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hiding.|$|E

This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a darkened room somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.|$|E

25|$|Magdeburg {{managed to}} remain in the league, {{finishing}} twelfth, and averaging 4,500 spectators, but in June 2002 the club <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> receivership. This led to the club's relegation to tier IV, and almost all players left the club and 1. FC Magdeburg had to manage the next season with players from their youth department and their reserves. This young team finished tenth in the Oberliga Nordost-Süd and won the Saxony-Anhalt-Cup for a fifth time. Despite this negative development, average attendance stayed at the same level.|$|E
25|$|Mihail's mother Ecaterina (1819–1891), also a boyaress, {{descended from}} the Cantacuzino family through a Moldavian offshoot, and claimed {{ownership}} of an estate in Pașcani. Despite her generous dowry, the family faced bankruptcy and, during Mihail's infancy, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> real estate as landlords. She had eight other children with Iancu, six of whom survived into adulthood: Eufrosina m. Greceanu (1837–1870), a homemaker and courtesan; Ioan (1839–1914), a career soldier and father of writer Elena Văcărescu; Maria m. Fălcoianu (1841–1912); Ecaterina m. Lahovary (1846–1917); Alexandrina m. Darvary (1851–1899); Constantin (1850–1899). Claymoor's cousins also included Theodor C. Văcărescu, the diplomat.|$|E
25|$|At {{the players}} auction on 19 January 2010, Mumbai Indians bought just one player - hard-hitting Trinidadian all-rounder Kieron Pollard - for a sum of $750,000. Pollard, {{who had a}} base price of $200,000, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a secret tie-breaker as four {{franchise}}s bid {{the maximum amount of}} $750,000 for him. Although the actual amount of the bid by the Mumbai Indians was undisclosed, reports claim that the franchise bid as much as $2.75 million in the tie-breaker. However, according to IPL regulations, Pollard would be paid only the actual bidding amount {{with the rest of the}} money going into the IPL kitty.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the {{offensive}} soon met with heavy Soviet resistance, especially from some ad-hoc ground {{units of the}} Soviet Northern Fleet. The 2nd Mountain Division could not advance into the Rybachy Peninsula, and already {{at the start of}} July <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the defensive in this sector. Further south, after a heavy Soviet counterattack, the Germans resumed their offensive to the east to reach the Litsa River, with joint forces from both divisions. With the element of surprise lost, the Germans were only able to establish a small bridgehead over the river. After a heavy Soviet counterattack on 7 July, Dietl requested more reinforcements, but he received only a motorized machine-gun battalion from Norway.|$|E
25|$|MGM {{had bought}} the film rights to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 smash Broadway hit The Women in 1937. Many writers had, unsuccessfully, taken a stab at a {{screenplay}} version. The studio handed it to Loos and veteran scriptwriter Jane Murfin, and three weeks later Loos handed Cukor a script that he loved. Unfortunately the censorship board did not. They insisted on changing more than 80 lines, and the film <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> production. Loos was apprehensive, but Cukor insisted she do the changes on set, among his all-star bevy of leading ladies. Loos made immediate friends with Paulette Goddard, who was surprisingly well-read. She also had Aldous and Maria Huxley as houseguests, and encouraged Huxley to stay in California and continue to write there. When World War II began in September 1939, Loos convinced Huxley {{that it would be}} safer for his family if they stayed in the United States rather than returning to England, and she got him a job adapting screenplays at MGM.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the San Antonio Spurs for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again {{achieved}} a 60–22 record, with Avery Johnson winning NBA Coach of the Year honors. In the playoffs, they swept the Memphis Grizzlies, leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of Dirk Nowitzki and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the Phoenix Suns in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006 in the US Airways Center in Phoenix, and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history.|$|E

25|$|Infante Francisco {{returned}} to Madrid with his family. From then on they lived {{at their own}} residence, the Palace of San Juan, built in 1815 by Ferdinand VII, near the park of El Retiro. They also had a house {{in close proximity to}} the Royal Palace at No 40 La Luna street. On 29 January 1844, Luisa Carlotta died suddenly of measles, aged 39. Widowed, Francisco de Paula continued living at the palace of San Juan. He wished to remarry and made a proposal to his sister-in-law and niece Princess Maria Carolina of the Two Sicilies, but the project did not come to fruition. He renewed his efforts in his plan to marry his nieces to his two sons, but was not successful. However, under pressure of French diplomacy, Maria Cristina, who personally disliked his nephew Francisco de Asis, agreed to sanction the marriage of her daughter Queen Isabella to her cousin. Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France, was chosen as Infanta Luisa Fernanda's husband. The rejected Infante Don Enrique was involved in a conspiracy and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> exile.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 {{there had}} been plans to send great part of the Uruguayan MLN Tupamaros, the Chilean Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) and the Bolivian Revolutionary Army (ELN) to fight {{alongside}} the ERP and Montoneros in Argentina, but the plans failed to materialize due to the military coup. Furthermore, by 1976 Operation Condor, which had already centralized information from South American intelligence agencies for years, was at its height. Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened again, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hiding or seek refuge in a third country. Chilean General Carlos Prats had already been assassinated by the Chilean DINA in Buenos Aires in 1974, {{with the help of}} former DINA agents Michael Townley and Enrique Arancibia. Cuban diplomats were also assassinated in Buenos Aires in the infamous Automotores Orletti torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship, managed by the Grupo de Tareas 18, headed by Aníbal Gordon, previously convicted for armed robbery, and answered directly to the General Commandant of the SIDE, Otto Paladino. Automotores Orletti was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. One of the survivors, José Luis Bertazzo, who was detained for two months there, identified Chileans, Uruguayans, Paraguayans and Bolivians among the prisoners. These captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hiding, {{waiting for}} things to calm down and delegating {{leadership}} to General Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, who later assumed partial guilt for Duca's killing; Stelescu, who soon became Codreanu's adversary {{as head of the}} Crusade of Romanianism, later alleged that he had been given refuge by a cousin of Magda Lupescu, Carol's mistress, implying that the Guard was becoming corrupt ("She was a person adverse to your action. How did you get along so well?"). Codreanu's resurgence brought arrest and prosecution under the martial law imposed in the country; he was acquitted yet again. Despite Codreanu's attacks on the elite as hopelessly corrupt and self-serving, at his trial in 1934 a number of respected politicians like Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu testified for Codreanu as character witnesses. The Iron Guard did have some links to the Nazi Party's foreign office under Alfred Rosenberg, but in 1933–34 the Romanian fascist that was the main beneficiary of financial support from Rosenberg was Codreanu's rival Octavian Goga who lacked Codreanu's mass following and thus was more biddable. A further issue for the Nazis was concern over Codreanu's statements that Romania had too many minorities for its own good, which led to fears that Codreanu might persecute the volksdeutsch minority if he came to power. But the connections between the NSDAP and the Iron Guard, as limited as they were, did add to the Legion's appeal as the Iron Guard was associated in the public mind with the apparently dynamic and successful society of Nazi Germany.|$|E

In 1562, early in her reign, Elizabeth passed a law {{in the form of}} An Act Against Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts (5 Eliz. I c. 16). This demanded the death penalty, but only where harm had been caused; lesser offences were punishable by a term of imprisonment. The Act provided that anyone who should [...] "use, practise, or exercise any Witchcraft, Enchantment, Charm, or Sorcery, whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroyed", was guilty of a felony without benefit of clergy, and was to be put to death.|$|E
500|$|Also, {{with such}} a long, narrow hull came a {{consequent}} penchant for bending, {{which led to the}} challenge of adequate hull strength, especially longitudinal strength.
