A typographical <b>facsimile</b> appeared between 1868 and 1872. In 1889–1890 a photographic <b>facsimile</b> of the entire manuscript was made and published by Cozza-Luzi, in three volumes. Another <b>facsimile</b> of the New Testament text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan. As a result, the Codex became widely available.|$|E

5000|$|Sometime in 1856, Theodule Deveria, an Egyptologist at the Louvre, had the {{opportunity}} to examine the <b>facsimiles</b> published as part of the Book of Abraham. His interpretation, juxtaposed with Smith's interpretation, was published in T. B. H. Stenhouse's book The Rocky Mountain Saints: A Full and Complete History of the Mormons in 1873. Additionally, later in 1912, Reverend Franklin S. Spalding sent copies of the three <b>facsimiles</b> to eight Egyptologists and Semitists soliciting their interpretation of the <b>facsimiles,</b> the results of which were published in Spalding's work Joseph Smith, Jr. As a Translator. Deveria, and each of the eight scholars immediately recognized the <b>facsimiles</b> as portions of ordinary funerary documents, and some harshly condemned Joseph Smith's interpretation, as shown below: ...|$|R

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour <b>facsimile</b> of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new <b>facsimile.</b> After each page was photographed, a single-page <b>facsimile</b> was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full <b>facsimile</b> and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E

5|$|Distribution of Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{so light}} that Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1850 claimed {{it had never}} existed, noting that none had been found. The first known copy turned up in 1859 with a second found in 1874. A type <b>facsimile</b> of a copy held by the British Museum, edited and {{introduced}} by Richard Herne Shepherd, was published as a limited edition in 1884. Another copy of Tamerlane and Other Poems was published in a 1941 <b>facsimile</b> by Thomas Ollive Mabbott, who provided the introduction; his correction and additions to this are found in a subsequent publication.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the Swiss {{publisher}} Urs Graf Verlag Bern {{produced the}} first <b>facsimile</b> of the Book of Kells. The {{majority of the}} pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, but the edition also featured forty-eight colour reproductions, including all the full-page decorations. Under licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, Thames and Hudson produced a second <b>facsimile</b> edition in 1974. This edition included all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a representative section of the ornamentation of the text pages, together with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour, with photography by John Kennedy, Green Studio, Dublin.|$|E

5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. <b>Facsimile</b> reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement that the new building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E

5|$|Scholz saw the {{manuscript}} in 1845, and Paul de Lagarde in 1853, {{but they did}} not decipher it. The lower text of the codex was deciphered, transcribed, and edited by Tregelles in 1861.

The hand-written letters are smaller than the type. Tregelles included one page of typographical <b>facsimile</b> in this edition.
