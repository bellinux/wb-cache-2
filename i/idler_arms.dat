50|$|Both the M107 and M110 {{are based}} on a common chassis, which {{features}} five road wheels {{on either side of the}} chassis, <b>idler</b> <b>arms</b> attached to torsion bars, tracks driven from the front by a 450 hp General Motors turbo supercharged diesel with the turbocharger connected to the supercharger by a steel pencil sized “quill” shaft. The engine and transmission are mounted in the front right, with the driver to its left. The engine had an attached hydraulic pump used to traverse the turret with a manual backup hand crank.|$|E
50|$|The {{idler arm}} {{supports}} {{the end of}} the center link on the passenger's side of the vehicle. The idler arm bolts to the vehicle's frame or subframe. Generally, an idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center link at the proper height. <b>Idler</b> <b>arms</b> are generally more vulnerable to wear than Pitman arms because of the pivot function built into them. If the idler arm is fitted with grease fittings, these should be lubricated with a grease gun at each oil change.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the contrast enhancement of images within a ghost-imaging system {{by use of}} nonlocal phase filters. We use parametric down-conversion as the two-photon light source and two separated phase modulators, in the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>arms</b> which represent different phase filters and objects, respectively. We obtain edge enhanced images as {{a direct consequence of}} the quantum correlations in the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the down-converted photon pairs. For phase objects, with differently orientated edges, we show a violation of a Bell-type inequality for an OAM subspace, thereby unambiguously revealing the quantum nature of our ghost-imaging arrangement...|$|E

50|$|Donor for {{the future}} custom became Harley Davidson HD Rocker C of 2008. The project is {{equipped}} with a hydraulic clutch linkage and suspension B-17 PD “Black Widow”. In addition, ICM craftsmen installed unilateral <b>idler</b> <b>arm</b> War Eagle and progressive suspension Air Tail.|$|R
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four tie rods, one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the tie rods), an <b>idler</b> <b>arm</b> on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the <b>idler</b> <b>arm</b> on the passenger side. The inner tie rods are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and outer tie rods. All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
40|$|We report orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) and angle correlations between signal and idler photons observed when the nonlinear crystal used in spontaneous parametric down-conversion is illuminated by a non-fundamental Gaussian pump beam. We introduce a π-phase step to the transverse profile of the pump, before it impinges on the crystal to create a phase-flipped Gaussian mode, which is a close approximation to an HG 10 Hermite–Gaussian-like beam. The correlations in OAM and angular position are then measured holographically using two separate spatial light modulators in the signal and <b>idler</b> <b>arms.</b> We show {{the transfer of the}} OAM spectrum of the pump to the down-converted fields, manifested as a redistribution in the OAM correlations consistent with OAM conservation. This corresponds to a modulation of the angular position correlations consistent with the Fourier relationship between the OAM and angle...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{drag link}} connects the pitman {{arm to the}} {{steering}} arm, or in some applications it connects to the tie rod assembly. Unlike a center link, the drag link does not connect to an <b>idler</b> <b>arm,</b> and has no inner tie rod ends attached to it. On some applications the drag link swings from the front {{to the rear of}} the vehicle. On these applications the drag link connects to the steering arm located at the wheel. In some Jeep applications, the drag link will swing from right to left on the vehicle and will connect to the steering arm at the wheel. Drag links can be a solid one-piece design or an adjustable design. Many drag links have replaceable or rebuildable ends. [...] " ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} milestone 1941 Clipper {{rode the}} senior wheelbase of 127 in {{and used the}} One Twenty's [...] straight eight, but produced 125 bhp (five more than the One Twenty). Despite the familiar engine, few Clipper parts were interchangeable with other models. The chassis was entirely new: a double-drop frame allowed a lower floor without reducing road clearance. The engine was mounted well forward and the rear shocks were angled to assist the traditional Packard fifth shock in controlling side-sway. The front suspension was entirely new, since the lower frame eliminated the need for Packard's traditional long torque arms. A double-link connection between the Pitman arm and steering brackets, with a cross bar and <b>idler</b> <b>arm</b> and two cross tubes, controlled wheel movement.|$|R
50|$|The Pitman arm is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) sector shaft, it converts the angular motion of the sector shaft into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} sector shaft and supports the drag link or center link with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag (or center) link, causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The <b>idler</b> <b>arm</b> is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or drag link at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|R
50|$|Greenamyer {{built the}} Starfighter by {{collecting}} and putting together myriad parts over a 13-year period. The cockpit side panels and some control column bearings of the Red Baron {{came from the}} very first production F-104A, which crashed in Palmdale, California 22 years earlier. The tail of the Red Baron, minus stabilizers, came from a junkyard in Ontario, California. The stabilizers and some nose wheel parts were from scrap piles in Tucson and Homestead, Florida. The <b>idler</b> <b>arm</b> for the elevator controls, the ejection seat rails and some electrical relays came from an F-104 that crashed and burned at Edwards Air Force Base {{on the edge of the}} Mojave Desert. Greenamyer got his throttle quadrant from a Tennessee flying buff he met at the Reno Air Races. The trunnion mounts for the nose gear, some of the cooling-system valves and a few relays on the Red Baron came from a 25-ton pile of junk that Greenamyer bought at Eglin Air Force Base. In a swap with NASA, he obtained the nose of a Lockheed NF-104A, with its reaction controls. The all-important J79-GE-10 engine was obtained from the US Navy.|$|R
5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened <b>idler</b> crank <b>arm,</b> an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did not proceed any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|R
5000|$|On October 24, 1977, Greenamyer, {{flying a}} {{modified}} F-104 Starfighter [...] "Red Baron" [...] (N104RB), set a FAI Class C-1 Group III 3 km speed record of 988.26 mph, which still stands. An earlier attempt on October 2, 1976 yielded a higher time (1010 mph), but one timing camera didn't work on one run, meaning the record couldn't be certified.

40|$|Mechanical {{tensioners}} {{are widely}} used in belt drive systems of automotive engines. They act to maintain a minimum tension in the slack span and to decrease transverse belt vibrations. They are composed of an <b>idler</b> pulley, an <b>arm</b> lever and a torsional springThe paper deals with the modeling of the dynamic behaviour of a tensioner. First an experimental investigation permits the characterisation of the tensioner: it is subjected to a force-deflection test carried out using a specific experimental set-up equipped with an electrodynamic shaker. The hysteretic loops are measured for several deflection amplitudes and forcing frequencies. Then, the experimental characterization permits identifying the parameters required by the original hysteretic model, and classical models like the Dahl’s model. The last part {{is devoted to the}} comparison of the hysteretic loops given by the tested models and the experiment...|$|R
6000|$|W---- {{had brought}} with him a spy-glass. It was old and of little value, {{but it was an}} heir-loom of the family. It came from the Hall at C----n, and had become {{historical}} for its service in detecting deer, in the lake, {{during the early years of}} the settlement. This glass had disappeared. No inquiry could recover it. [...] "Send for Désirée," [...] said the consul. Désirée came, received her orders, and in half an hour the glass was restored. There was an oversight in not getting a passport, when we were about to quit Havre. The office hours were over, and the steam-boat could not wait. [...] "Were is Désirée?" [...] Désirée was made acquainted with the difficulty, and the passport was obtained. [...] "Désirée, où est Désirée?" [...] cried some one in the crowd, that had assembled to see the Camilla start for England, the day after our arrival. [...] "Here is an Englishman who is too late to get his passport viséd," [...] said this person to Désirée, so near me that I heard it all; [...] "the boat goes in ten minutes--what is to be done?"--"Ma foi--it is too late!" [...] "Try, ma bonne--it's a pity he should lose his passage--voici." [...] The Englishman gave his fee. Désirée looked about her, and then taking the <b>idler</b> by the <b>arm,</b> she hurried him through the crowd, this way and that way, ending by putting him aboard without any passport at all. [...] "It is too late to get one," [...] she said; [...] "and they can but send you back." [...] He passed undetected. France has a plenty of these managing females, though Désirée is one of the cleverest of them all. I understood this woman had passed a year or two in England, expressly to fit herself for her present occupation, by learning the language.|$|R
