5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E
5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, Destination Moon was produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel – a feat that {{had yet to be}} achieved – with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. During the story's serialisation, Hergé established Studios Hergé, a Brussels-based team of cartoonists to aid him on the project. Hergé concluded the story arc begun in this volume with Explorers on the Moon, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book, but have expressed mixed views of the narrative.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white tail appeared in print {{for the first}} time in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E

5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect streamline the player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E
5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle.

Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flood. The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E

5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
5|$|Cabeza de Vaca {{is thought}} to have been the first European to sight the bay in the early 16th century, {{evidenced}} by the descriptions in his logs that match the <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area. In 1766, Spaniard Diego Ortiz Parrilla {{is believed to be the}} first European to explore the bay. He named it Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic), but it was later changed to Copano, after the port of Copano was officially opened in 1785 on the northwestern shore. The port later served as a strategically important locale during the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, and was the site of a settlement that is now completely abandoned. The town of St. Mary's of Aransas was founded southwest of Copano and thrived as a port and wood mart, until numerous shipwrecks caused by the bay's hidden reefs concluded its use in 1875. Like Copano, it is now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Civil and {{criminal}} cases commenced after its completion, as was intended. In an uncommon case, heard at the Castellania in 1774, was when an intersex person, 17-year-old Rosa Mifsud from Luqa, petitioned for a sex change by wearing as a man, {{instead of the}} female clothing worn ever since born. Two medical experts were appointed by the court to perform an examination. This case gives <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use of experts in the field, similar to the late modern period. The examiners were the Physician-in-Chief (during the British period {{was replaced by the}} Chief Government Medical Officer) and a senior surgeon, both working at the Sacra Infermeria. The Grandmaster took the decision for Mifsud to wear only men clothes from then on. The decision was taken to the court of appeals, which appointed other seven medical experts that agreed with the observations of the previous two experts.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Ocean Software ported {{the game}} to home gaming systems, {{including}} the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems, the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version. Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format. The Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory. The Amiga and Atari ST versions {{are one of the}} few games to use the Trojan Light Gun. In developing the Amiga conversion, the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics, pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them. Programmer Damien Stones spent four months on the ZX Spectrum version. He kept the graphical <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backgrounds simple to allow for more action in the foreground. Taking into account the system's lower capabilities compared to the arcade hardware, Stones designed {{the game to}} handle a large number of on-screen sprites. In 2005, Space Gun was included in the compilation title Taito Legends for the PlayStation 2, personal computer and Xbox.|$|E

Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child was performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and {{on the basis of these}} details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.|$|E
