40|$|Segmented vortex flaps were {{suggested}} {{as a means}} of delaying the vortex spill-over causing thrust loss over the outboard region of single-panel flaps. Also proposed was hinge-line setback for exploiting leading-edge suction in conjunction with vortex flaps to improve the overall thrust per unit flap area. These two concepts in combination were tested on a 60 -deg cropped delta wing model. Significant improvement in <b>flap</b> <b>efficiency</b> was indicated by a reduction of the flap/wing area from 11. 4 % of single-panel flap to 6. 3 % of a two segment delta flap design, with no lift/drag penalty at lift coefficients between 0. 5 and 0. 7. The more efficient vortex flap arrangement of this study should benefit the performance attainable with flaps of given area on wings of moderate leading-edge sweep...|$|E
40|$|Results for th <b>flap</b> <b>efficiency</b> and flap heating of the NASA X- 24 {{lifting body}} vehicle are presented. Several Mach numbers, flap {{deflection}} angles, angles of attack and Reynolds numbers are considered. Perfect gas flows with constant temperature at wall, equilibrium flow with radiation adiabatic wall and non-equilibrium flow with fully catalytic and finite catalytic wall are studied. The influence of viscous effects is investigated by comparing Euler with laminar and turbulent Navier-Stokes solutions for several flap geometries. The {{accuracy of the}} solutions is supported by comparing the numerical results with computations from other sources and also with wind tunnel measurements. Viscous and real gas effects play a dominant role for large flap deflection angles. Both viscous interaction parameters tested do not allow to collapse the data in one curve concerning flap heating. Navier-Stokes results do not correlate with Holden's predictions. Maximum inviscid...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the bending rigidity of a flexible heaving wing on its propulsive performance in a two-dimensional imposed parallel flow is investigated in the inviscid limit. Potential flow theory is {{used to describe the}} flow over the flapping wing. The vortical wake of the wing is accounted for by the shedding of point vortices with unsteady intensity from the wing's trailing edge. The trailing-edge flapping amplitude is shown to be maximal for a discrete set of values of the rigidity, at which a resonance occurs between the forcing frequency and a natural frequency of the system. A quantitative comparison of the position of these resonances with linear stability analysis results is presented. Such resonances induce maximum values of the mean developed thrust and power input. The <b>flapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> is also shown to be greatly enhanced by flexibility. Comment: 21 pages, 13 figures, to appear in Physics of Fluid...|$|R
40|$|Swimming {{fish and}} flying insects use the {{flapping}} of fins and wings to generate thrust. In contrast, microscopic organisms typically deform their appendages in a wavelike fashion. Since a flapping motion with two {{degrees of freedom}} is able, in theory, to produce net forces from a time-periodic actuation at all Reynolds number, we compute in this paper the optimal flapping kinematics of a rigid spheroid in a Stokes flow. The hydrodynamics for the force generation and energetics of the flapping motion is solved exactly. We then compute analytically the gradient of a <b>flapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the space of all flapping gaits and employ it to derive numerically the optimal flapping kinematics {{as a function of the}} shape of the flapper and the amplitude of the motion. The kinematics of optimal flapping are observed to depend weakly on the flapper shape and are very similar to the figure-eight motion observed in the motion of insect wings. Our results suggest that flapping could be a exploited experimentally as a propulsion mechanism valid across the whole range of Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|All animals flap {{their wings}} in powered flight to provide both lift and thrust, yet few human-engineered designs do so. When {{combined}} with flexible wing surfaces, the resulting unsteady fluid flows and interactions in flapping flight can be complex to describe, understand, and model. Here, a simple modified actuator disk {{is used in}} a quasi-steady description of the net aerodynamic lift forces on several species of bat whose wakes are measured with time-resolved PIV. The model appears to capture the time-averaged and instantaneous lift forces on the wings and body, and {{could be used as}} basis for comparing <b>flapping</b> flight <b>efficiency</b> of different animal species and micro air vehicle designs...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to study the shock wave boundary layer interaction {{and its impact on the}} aerodynamics of a hypersonic flight configuration. Tests have been carried out in the hypersonic wind tunnel H 2 K of the German Aerospace Center in a broad range of incidence and flap angle with a particular focus on the high angle case. A model made of carbon reinforced plastic was used for the tests. The low thermal conductivity allowed simultaneous surface temperature measurements using an IR camera parallel to force measurements. Additionally Schlieren and oil flow techniques were applied to visualize the flow around the model and the constant shear stress topology on the model surface. It has been noticed that at certain combinations of angle of attack and flap angle the shock configuration on the flaps changes completely. All four measurement techniques, i. e. force measurements, IR thermography, oil flow visualization and Schlieren pictures confirmed this result and thus clearly confirmed the influence of the shock boundary layer interaction on the <b>flap</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the pitching moment behavior of the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|In {{the frame}} of EXPERT project DLR is proposing a flight {{experiment}} on shock-wave boundary-layer interaction (SWBLI) with shear-layer reattachment on control surfaces to improve our understanding about <b>flap</b> <b>efficiency</b> and heating due to high temperature 3 D effects, radiation-cooling effects, transition, turbulence (unsteadiness) and strong viscous hypersonic interaction. The objective of the present work is applying CFD to estimate for the most critical flight condition the maximal aerothermodynamic loads on the capsule surface, with a special emphasis on the flaps and their surrounding. The very important questions to be answered {{for the design of}} the flaps are the determination of the magnitude and location of the maximum temperatures with respect to the vehicle surface and its corresponding internal structure. The CFD results for temperature, heat flux and surface pressure calculated for the selected critical flight condition show that the proposed concept for the instrumentation of both flaps and the capsule surfaces underneath the flaps is, generally in agreement with preliminary studies, but properties of TPS material on the flaps cavity flange should be enhanced to meet technical feasibility...|$|E
40|$|Hovering means {{stationary}} flight at zero net forward speed, {{which can}} be achieved by animals through muscle powered flapping flight. Small bats capable of hovering typically do so with a downstroke in an inclined stroke plane, and with an aerodynamically active outer wing during the upstroke. The magnitude and time history of aerodynamic forces should be reflected by vorticity shed into the wake. We thus expect hovering bats to generate a characteristic wake, but this has until now never been studied. Here we trained nectar-feeding bats, Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, to hover at a feeder and using time-resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in conjunction with high-speed kinematic analysis we show that hovering nectar-feeding bats produce a series of bilateral stacked vortex loops. Vortex visualizations suggest that the downstroke produces the majority of the weight support, but that the upstroke contributes positively to the lift production. However, the relative contributions from downstroke and upstroke could not be determined {{on the basis of the}} wake, because wake elements from down- and upstroke mix and interact. We also use a modified actuator disc model to estimate lift force, power and <b>flap</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Based on our quantitative wake-induced velocities, the model accounts for weight support well (108 %). Estimates of aerodynamic efficiency suggest hovering flight is less efficient than forward flapping flight, while the overall energy conversion efficiency (mechanical power output/metabolic power) was estimated at 13 %...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{results for}} the X- 38 vehicle, shape 3. 1 and 8. 3 are {{presented}} and discussed. For shape 3. 1 the present report {{is a continuation of}} previous numerical studies carried out at DLR and therefore dedicated to explain and/or clarify specific problems found during those investigations. <b>Flap</b> and aileron <b>efficiency</b> are analyzed with respect to the geometry adopted for the flap, at several Mach numbers and under flight as well as wind tunnel flow conditions. For shape 8. 3 the goal of the present study is to demonstrate the ability of CFD to rebuild the experimental investigation carried out for this shape in the S- 3 Modane wind tunnel. Aerodynamic coefficients, <b>flap</b> and aileron <b>efficiencies</b> as well as a flow documentation are presented for M= 6 and alpha= 40 Â°. The results of the present investigation could not explain the differences found between data obtained from CFD and data obtained for the shape 3. 1 in the Langley wind tunnel. However, a good agreement between the numerical results and the aerodynamic data base (ADB) is found for both, <b>flap</b> and aileron <b>efficiency,</b> at the investigated flow conditions even though ADB was defined for flight Reynolds number with turbulent boundary layer. Also, the CFD results for shape 8. 3 are in good agreement with the data obtained for this shape in the Modane wind tunnel. The present investigation clearly demonstrates that for viscous dominated problems a good experimental/numerical correlation is achieved when not only the same physics but also the same degree of geometrical representation of the configuration is employed for both simulations. In most cases the numerical experimental discrepancies arising by the geometrical simplifications of the CFD configurations are larger than the discrepancies found due to CFD numerical accuracy and/or lack of physical modeling...|$|R
40|$|Many small passerines {{regularly}} fly slowly when catching prey, {{flying in}} cluttered environments or landing on a perch or nest. While flying slowly, passerines generate {{most of the}} flight forces during the downstroke, and have a 'feathered upstroke' during which they make their wing inactive by retracting it close to the body and by spreading the primary wing feathers. How this flight mode relates aerodynamically to the cruising flight and so-called 'normal hovering' as used in hummingbirds is not yet known. Here, we present time-resolved fluid dynamics data in combination with wingbeat kinematics data for three pied flycatchers flying {{across a range of}} speeds from near hovering to their calculated minimum power speed. Flycatchers are adapted to low speed flight, which they habitually use when catching insects on the wing. From the wake dynamics data, we constructed average wingbeat wakes and determined the time-resolved flight forces, the time-resolved downwash distributions and the resulting lift-to-drag ratios, span <b>efficiencies</b> and <b>flap</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> During the downstroke, slow-flying flycatchers generate a single-vortex loop wake, which is much more similar to that generated by birds at cruising flight speeds than it is to the double loop vortex wake in hovering hummingbirds. This wake structure results in a relatively high downwash behind the body, which {{can be explained by the}} relatively active tail in flycatchers. As a result of this, slow-flying flycatchers have a span efficiency which is similar to that of the birds in cruising flight and which can be assumed to be higher than in hovering hummingbirds. During the upstroke, the wings of slowly flying flycatchers generated no significant forces, but the body-tail configuration added 23 per cent to weight support. This is strikingly similar to the 25 per cent weight support generated by the wing upstroke in hovering hummingbirds. Thus, for slow-flying passerines, the upstroke cannot be regarded as inactive, and the tail may be of importance for flight efficiency and possibly manoeuvrability...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews a {{combined}} numerical and experimental {{activity on the}} Shuttle Orbiter, first performed at NASA Langley within the OEX workshop and subsequently at ESA, {{as part of the}} AGARD FDP WG 18 activities. The study at Langley was undertaken to resolve the pitch up anomaly observed during the entry of the first flight of the Shuttle Orbiter. The facilities used at NASA Langley were the 15 -in. Mach 6, the 20 -in, Mach 6, the 31 -in. Mach 10 and the 20 -in. Mach 6 CF 4 facility. The paper focuses on the high Mach, high altitude portion of the first entry of the Shuttle where the vehicle exhibited a nose-up pitching moment relative to pre-flight prediction of (Delta C(sub m)) = 0 03. In order to study the relative contribution of compressibility, viscous interaction and real gas effects on basic body pitching moment and <b>flap</b> <b>efficiency,</b> an experimental study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} Mach, Reynolds and ratio of specific heats at NASA. At high Mach, a decrease of gamma occurs in the shock layer due to high temperature effects. The primary effect of this lower specific heat ratio is a decrease of the pressure on the aft windward expansion surface of the Orbiter causing the nose-up pitching moment. Testing in the heavy gas, Mach 6 CF 4 tunnel, gave a good simulation of high temperature effects...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flapping</b> wing <b>efficiency</b> {{is limited}} by flow {{separation}} effects. The time dependent development of a leading edge vortex (LEV) during rapid pitch-up motion of a retreating helicopter roter blade is known as dynamic stall vortex. Movement of this vortex along the airfoil upper surface first increases lift but later the vortex lifts off the airfoil surface causing streng drag rise, severe nose-down pitching moments, and possibly negative aerodynamic damping. Very similar effects can be observed on flapping airfoils and wings experiencing combined plunging (heaving) motion and pitching motion. With increasing plunge amplitude the flow on the flapping wing starts to separate and concentrated dynamic stall vortices may develop on both upper and lower wing surfaces. Under these conditions it is shown that wing propulsion efficiency is considerably reduced. Recent investigations of dynamic stall control have shown that a streng vortex may be avoided by appropriate airfoil deformation. lt will be shown in the present paper that with dynamic airfoil deformation the propulsion efficiency can be improved considerably. The validity of the numerical calcu lations is first tested against existing data from literature...|$|R

For the vehicle forebody the effects of grid resolution on surface temperature distribution is provided by the assumption of full and partial catalytic wall behaviour. Finally, the scaling effects are investigated by comparing the obtained CFD results with those of the X- 38 aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic databases.

40|$|The {{conventional}} Mini and Large scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle systems span {{anywhere from}} approximately 12 inches to 12 feet; endowing them with larger propulsion systems, batteries/fuel-tanks, {{which in turn}} provide ample power reserves for long-endurance flights, powerful actuators, on-board avionics, wireless telemetry etc. The limitations thus imposed become apparent when shifting to Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and trying to equip them with equal or near-equal flight endurance, processing, sensing and communication capabilities, as their larger scale cousins. The conventional MAV as outlined by The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a vehicle that can have a maximum dimension of 6 inches and weighs no more than 100 grams. Under these tight constraints, the footprint, weight and power reserves available to on-board avionics and actuators is drastically reduced; the flight time and payload capability of MAVs take a massive plummet in keeping with these stringent size constraints. However, the demand for micro flying robots is increasing rapidly. The applications that have emerged over the years for MAVs include search&rescue operations for trapped victims in natural disaster succumbed urban areas; search&reconnaissance in biological, radiation, natural disaster/hazard succumbed/prone areas; patrolling&securing home/office/building premises/urban areas. VTOL capable rotary and fixed wing flying vehicles do not scale down to micro sized levels, owing to the severe loss in aerodynamic efficiency associated with low Reynolds number physics on conventional airfoils; whereas, present {{state of the art}} in flapping wing designs lack in {{one or more of the}} minimum qualities required from an MAV: Appreciable flight time, appreciable payload capacity for on-board sensors/telemetry and 6 DoF hovering/VTOL performance. This PhD. work is directed towards overcoming these limitations. Firstly, this PhD thesis presents the advent of a novel Quad-Wing MAV configuration (called the QV). The Four-Wing configuration is capable of performing all 6 DoF flight maneuvers including VTOL. The thesis presents the design, conception, simulation study and finally hardware design/development of the MAV. Secondly, this PhD thesis proves and demonstrates significant improvement in on-board Energy-Harvesting resulting in increased flight times and payload capacities of the order of even 200 %- 400 % and more. Thirdly, this PhD thesis defines a new actuation principle called, Fixed Frequency, Variable Amplitude (FiFVA). It is demonstrated that by the use of passive elastic members on wing joints, a further significant increase in energy efficiency and consequently reduction in input power requirements is observed. An actuation efficiency increase of over 100 % in many cases is possible. The natural evolution of actuation development led to invention of two novel actuation systems to illustrate the FiFVA actuation principle and consequently show energy savings and <b>flapping</b> <b>efficiency</b> improvement. Lastly, but not in the least, the PhD thesis presents supplementary work in the design, development of two novel Micro Architecture and Control (MARC) avionics platforms (autopilots) for the application of demonstrating flight control and communication capability on-board the Four-Wing Flapping prototype. The design of a novel passive feathering mechanism aimed to improve lift/thrust performance of flapping motion is also presented.

40|$|In current wing design, {{multiple}} flaps {{are incorporated}} into the trailing edge to allow mixing {{of high and low}} pressure sides to reduce flow separation. These <b>flaps</b> reduce the <b>efficiency</b> by adding weight and complexity to the aircraft. A single hinged flap would reduce these inefficiencies but is more susceptible to flow separation. Active flow control is a means by which the fluid flow over a body is deliberately altered and can be altered such that it becomes less likely to separate from the object. By energizing the flow, the degree of separation of the flow can be controlled, and this inherently controls lift. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators are a form of active flow control. These actuators are created by asymmetrically aligning two electrodes and adding a dielectric layer between the electrodes. When the electrodes are electrically connected, ionized air (plasma) travels from the exposed electrode towards the covered electrode. Collisions occur between the plasma and neutral air over the body, and momentum is transferred to the neutral air, effectively energizing it. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the lift enhancement and flow control authority that multiple DBD plasma actuators have on a high-lift airfoil when compared to the flow exhibited by non...|$|R
40|$|An {{original}} {{concept is}} proposed to enhance heat transfer and mixing quality performances by using flexible vortex generators (FVGs) for a static mixer configuration. The role of free elastic flaps oscillations onÂ the mixing process and heat transfer in a two-dimensional laminar flow is numerically investigated. The computational domain {{consists of four}} distant FVGs mounted on two opposite walls. Two cases are studiedÂ depending on the Reynolds numbers (based on the bulk velocity and the channel height) set to 1000 and 1850. FVGs efficiencies are compared to the corresponding cases with rigid vortex generators (RVGs). Â In the flexible cases, flaps oscillations increase the velocity gradients and generate an unsteady laminar flow with complex coherent vortices detaching {{from the tip of}} the <b>flaps.</b> The mixing <b>efficiency</b> is quantified by the transport of a passive scalar through the channel. It is shown that oscillations in the elastic cases enhance the mixture quality up to 98 % relative to that in the rigid cases. The heat transfer enhancement is also investigated showing up to a 96 % increase in the Colburn factor, 56 % increase in thermal performance factor and 134 % increase in the overall heat transfer. As the FVGs oscillate freely without any additional external force other than that exerted by the flow itself, the implementation of such a technique shows a great potential for the performance enhancement of multifunctional heat exchangers/reactors...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the first fossil remains centuries ago, man has been fascinated by the existence of pterosaurs, likely the most efficient and effective flyers ever to inhabit our planet. These agile flyers exploited their membrane wings in a sophisticated manner for flight control and propulsion. The flapping gait is a complex combination of motions that sustains an animal in the air and propels it forward at a sustainable energy cost. In this aerodynamic study, we identify the main motions of the wings of a well-preserved specimen of Anhanguera piscator. We describe a methodology designed to handle the com-plex wing kinematics. Because the detailed wing shape can not be inferred from fossils, simplifying assumptions are made to define the wing geometry. We describe an unsteady three-dimensional vortex-lattice code that captures the main aerodynamic effects of flap-ping flight. We couple this code with a binary genetic algorithm to optimize wing motions of increasing complexity under a set of biological constraints. Identification of the most important motions is key to understanding flapping flight in general and consequently to pterosaur flight and the design of efficient man-made or-nithopters. Analysis of the simulations allowed us to characterize the effect of each joint motion on propulsive <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Flapping</b> at the shoulder and pitch rotation at the wrist are critical for propulsive efficiency, and propulsive efficiencies above 80 % can be achieved. However, the optimization did not find an efficiency advantage for the sweeping motions. When accounting for the inertial forces, the required actuated power can increase by about 17 %, for our estimate of wing mass distribution. We also studied the sensitivity of the opti-mizer solutions to the weight and flight speed estimates, and to the shape of the planform. These different cases lead to changes in the joint motions, with a slight impact on propulsive efficiency. Nomenclatur...|$|R
40|$|Many fish depend {{primarily}} on their tail beat for propulsion. Such a tail is commonly modeled as a two-dimensional flapping foil. Here we demonstrate a novel experimental setup {{of such a}} foil that heaves and pitches in a soap film. The vortical flow field generated by the foil correlates with thickness variations in the soap film, which appear as interference fringes when the film is illuminated with a monochromatic light source (we used a high-frequency SOX lamp). These interference fringes are subsequently captured with high-speed video (500 Hz) and this allows us to study the unsteady vortical field of a flapping foil. The main advantage of our approach is that the flow fields are time and space resolved and can be obtained time-efficiently. The foil is driven by a flapping mechanism that is optimized for studying both fish swimming and insect flight {{inside and outside the}} behavioral envelope. The mechanism generates sinusoidal heave and pitch kinematics, pre-described by the non-dimensional heave amplitude (0 - 6), the pitch amplitude (0 degrees- 90 degrees), the phase difference between pitch and heave (0 degrees- 360 degrees), and the dimensionless wavelength of the foil (3 - 18). We obtained this wide range of wavelengths for a foil 4 mm long by minimizing the soap film speed (0. 25 m s(- 1)) and maximizing the flapping frequency range (4 - 25 Hz). The Reynolds number of the foil is of order 1, 000 throughout this range. The resulting setup enables an effective assessment of vortex wake topology as a function of <b>flapping</b> kinematics. The <b>efficiency</b> of the method is further improved by carefully eliminating background noise in the visualization (e. g., reflections of the mechanism). This is done by placing mirrors at an angle behind the translucent film such that the camera views the much more distant and out-of-focus reflections of the black laboratory wall. The resulting high-quality flow visualizations require minimal image processing for flow interpretation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our setup by visualizing the vortex dynamics of the flapping foil as a function of pitch amplitude by assessing the symmetry of the vortical wake...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the natural}} flying and {{swimming}} creatures, the application of flapping wings has attracted {{a great deal of}} attention from the scientific community in recent years. On one hand, flapping wings are expected to replace conventional rotor systems to build Micro and Nano Aerial Vehicles (MAVs and NAVs) operating at low Reynolds number while on the other hand they are also being investigated for the role of power generation in conjunction with conventional rotary wind turbines. For the development of MAVs/NAVs and understanding of unsteady aerodynamics, the current thesis fills the gaps in the current state of the flapping wing aerodynamics research. Firstly, at Reynolds number Re = 20000, the effect of large amplitude motions on the plunging airfoil propulsion is investigated with both two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) Navier-Stokes (NS) simulations. For a given plunging frequency, it is shown that increasing the amplitude of plunging airfoil motion causes the flow to be chaotic. From 3 D simulations, it is shown that the chaotic force generation is not an artefact of 2 D assumption. Secondly, the effect of airfoil shape (thickness and camber) variation on thrust and <b>efficiency</b> of a <b>flapping</b> airfoil at Reynolds number 200, 2000, 20000 and 2 Ã 106 is assessed with 2 D NS and Unsteady Panel Method (UPM) simulations. It is found that for different Reynolds numbers, there exists an optimum thickness of symmetric airfoil section for maximum thrust and propulsive efficiency. The role of leading edge vortices is shown to be key to the observed performance variation. It is also shown that varying camber does not provide any benefit in terms of thrust or propulsive <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Flapping</b> airfoils can also be exploited to function as power generators, NS simulations are performed to study different configurations of flapping airfoils as power generators which include single and two foils in tandem arrangement with prescribed sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal flapping motions at Re = 20000. Also, a numerical strategy is developed to model a fully flow-driven flapping foil power generator by utilising the aero-elastic response to the lift and moment acting on it. It is found that non-sinusoidal motion produces around 20 % more power than the sinusoidal counterpart and the fully flow-driven simulation results show the practicality of flapping wing power generators...|$|R
