25|$|The {{training}} at Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy is designed {{in such a}} way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of our country. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the ISRO's Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, University of Twente/ITC Netherlands and in Wildlife Management from the Wildlife Institute of India. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, SAARC Forestry Centre, <b>Forest</b> <b>Survey</b> of India, Wildlife Institute of India, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.|$|E

40|$|A {{handheld}} mobile {{laser scanning}} (HMLS) approach to <b>forest</b> inventory <b>surveying</b> allows virtual reconstructions of forest stands and extraction of key structural parameters {{from beneath the}} canopy, significantly reducing survey time when compared against static laser scan and fieldwork methods. A proof of concept test application demonstrated the ability of this technique to successfully extract diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem position compared against a concurrent terrestrial laser scan (TLS) survey. When stems with DBH > 10 cm are examined, an HMLS to TLS modelling success rate of 91 % was achieved with the {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) of the DBH and stem position being 1. 5 cm and 2. 1 cm respectively. The HMLS approach gave a survey coverage time per surveyor of 50 m 2 /min compared with 0. 85 m 2 /min for the TLS instrument and 0. 43 m 2 /min for the field study. This powerful tool has potential applications in <b>forest</b> <b>surveying</b> by providing much larger data sets at reduced operational costs to current survey methods.
