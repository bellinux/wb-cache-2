The <b>emotional</b> <b>impact</b> on Olga, aged only 12, was traumatic, and her eldest brother, the new Tsar Nicholas II, was propelled into a role for which in Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.|$|E
5|$|Like Hitler, Goebbels practiced {{his public}} {{speaking}} skills {{in front of}} a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum <b>emotional</b> <b>impact.</b> He usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.|$|E

30|$|CE {{interviews}} were conducted with four clinical experts, and 61 people, 32 % of whom had T 2 DM, participated in the focus groups. Analyses identified two major areas of obesity impacts: weight-related physical signs/symptoms, and <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts.</b> The most frequently reported physical signs/symptoms were feeling tired (74 %), shortness of breath (69 %), and joint pain (64 %). The most often reported <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> included poor self-image (72 %) and depression (51 %). Twelve signs/symptoms were identified during item generation and included on the preliminary measure. Twelve adults with overweight/obesity, who were not part of the focus groups, participated in CD. After the CD, a validation-ready, 10 -item WRSSM measure was generated.|$|R
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more <b>emotional</b> <b>impact.</b> Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired <b>emotional</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest <b>emotional</b> <b>impact</b> on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E

The present study first examined emotional responses to early design sketches, and how these responses could be used to check if the <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> of their early sketches were observed in a combinative way of cognitive-linguistic and physiological approaches. Based on the findings of the empirical study, we further discussed how the emotional differences of product images would be generated by product forms.

5|$|Originally {{intended}} to be a full-length opera, Twice was composed between 1994 and 1996, undergoing substantial reworking before Turnage found a form with which he was satisfied. It was first performed in 1997 when it was put on both in the concert hall and in the opera house. The critical reception has been generally favourable, with several authors commenting positively about the instrumental writing and <b>emotional</b> <b>impact</b> of the work, though some critics see limitations in the libretto, find the mood of the work too unrelenting or note the great demands that the vocal writing provides for the soloist.|$|E
5|$|When the Gulf War {{started on}} January 16, 1991, Jennings began a {{marathon}} anchoring stint {{to cover the}} story, spending 20 of the first 48 hours of the war on-air, and leading ABC News to its highest-ever ratings. After interrupting regular Saturday morning cartoons on January 19 to broadcast a military briefing from Saudi Arabia, Jennings and ABC became concerned about the <b>emotional</b> <b>impact</b> of the war coverage on children. Out of that concern, Jennings hosted a 90-minute special, War in the Gulf: Answering Children's Questions the next Saturday morning; the program featured Jennings, ABC correspondents, and American military personnel answering phoned-in questions and explaining the war to young viewers.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the <b>emotional</b> <b>impact</b> of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E

5|$|Victor's death {{scene was}} filmed outside The Bridge Hotel and pub at Shawford railway bridge, {{next to the}} River Itchen, Hampshire, on 21 July 2000. The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big <b>emotional</b> <b>impact</b> upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was too concerned with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E
5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an <b>emotional</b> <b>impact.</b> This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) specific patient-derived {{and reported}} symptom tools are critical steps toward evaluating {{the outcomes of}} new therapies for CF. MethodsWe conducted 25 in-depth qualitative interviews using the Day Reconstruction Method and 9 cognitive interviews at two CF programs, the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed, and then coded and analyzed for themes relating to pulmonary symptoms and related psychosocial impacts. ResultsSix pulmonary symptoms were identified as central to CF: cough, sputum production, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, and fever. <b>Emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> included frustration, sadness/depression, irritability, worry, difficulty sleeping; while activity impacts included time spent sitting or lying down, reduction of usual activities, and missing school or work. In all, 8 symptom items, 4 <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> items, and 4 activity impacts were selected for inclusion on a new daily diary. We also assessed triggers for seeking care. ConclusionsUsing a qualitative inductive methodology, we have obtained patient centered data regarding pulmonary symptoms and burdens and have created a novel patient reported outcome measure for CF. Future studies will assess {{the validity of the}} instruments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many users join online health {{communities}} (OHC) {{to obtain}} information and seek social support. Understanding the <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> of participation on patients and their informal caregivers is important for OHC managers. Ethnographical observations, interviews, and questionnaires have reported benefits from online health communities, but these approaches are too costly to adopt for large-scale analyses of <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts.</b> A computational approach using machine learning and text mining techniques is demonstrated {{using data from the}} American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online forum of nearly a half million posts. This approach automatically estimates the sentiment of forum posts, discovers sentiment change patterns in CSN members, and allows investigation of factors that affect the sentiment change. This first study of sentiment benefits and dynamics in a large-scale health-related electronic community finds that an estimated 75 %– 85 % of CSN forum participants change their sentiment in a positive direction through online interactions with other community members. Two new features, Name and Slang, not previously used in sentiment analysis, facilitate identifying positive sentiment in posts. This work establishes foundational concepts for further studies of sentiment impact of OHC participation and provides insight useful for the design of new OHC’s or enhancement of existing OHCs in providing better emotional support to their members.

40|$|This sound {{recording}} {{of a music}} performance illustrates some {{of the social and}} emotional aspects embodied in the creation and performance of these songs. "'They Change Us': The social and <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> on music facilitators of engaging in music and singing with asylum seekers"The literature on the social and emotional wellbeing of community musicians who engage with marginalised groups with complex mental health issues such as refugees, is relatively scarce. The Scattered People is a collective of volunteer musicians, music facilitators, and community development workers who engage, through musical activities, with asylum seekers and refugees who have experienced detention in Australia. This discussion focuses on key examples of social and emotional distress for community music facilitators through their interactions with asylum seekers. The community musicians explained the circumstances that had significant impacts on their wellbeing in terms of (i) their engagement with people in a detention centre, and (ii) the happiness and concerns linked to the asylum seekers they came across. Our paper presents the second author’s reflections on two songs from the Scattered People repertoire, which were created and performed as the embodiment of these social and <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts.</b> Our aim is to ensure that this important aspect of community music, which has been thus far neglected, receives more attention...|$|R
40|$|Using {{qualitative}} {{social research}} methods {{at the farm}} family level, this paper considers the social impacts of drought on two purposefully-selected villages in Fars Province, Iran. It examines the experience of drought on different types of farm families, specifically the less vulnerable, the resource poor, and the very resource poor. Our results show that all three groups experienced economic impacts of drought, but more importantly they all suffered major social impacts as well. The less-vulnerable families sought diversified sources of income in order to cope with drought. The vulnerable families (resource poor and very resource poor) were more affected by social and <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> than less-vulnerable families. The economic and social impacts that were experienced included: reduced household income; shortage of alternative income sources: increased workload; conflict of water access and water use; food insecurity, shortages and associated malnutrition: health impacts and reduced access to health services; reduced access to education; inequitable drought relief and associated stress and conflict; rural to urban migration; impoverishment and reduced quality of life: psychological and <b>emotional</b> <b>impacts</b> including depression, frustration and alienation; changed family plans such as delaying marriage; and family and community disharmony and disintegration. Recommendations and implications for drought management policy are offered to reduce the negative social impacts of drought. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
