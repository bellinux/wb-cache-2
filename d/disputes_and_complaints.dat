30|$|In the cyber world, {{there are}} two types of {{measures}} for rating: non-computational and computational (Zacharia et al. 2000). A non-computational rating is not a numerical value; instead, it keeps a record of all the activities associated with that evaluation. A famous example of a non-computational rating system is the Better Business Bureau Online, whose primary responsibilities are handling <b>disputes</b> <b>and</b> tracking <b>complaints</b> (Azari et al. 2003). In contrast, a computational rating is calculated based on the evaluations from all evaluators. For the computational rating, {{there are two}} types of rating systems: content-and user-driven. Content-driven systems (i.e., WikiTrust) use automated content analysis to derive ratings by comparing contributed content with the truth. The content is more reliable if it is less frequently modified. However, there are several limitations to content-driven rating systems. The ratings are calculated automatically and are nontransparent to users; therefore, the users’ belief in rating scores is affected as they do not understand the internal calculation process. Additionally, such systems rely on raters’ proactive content verification. If users do not provide feedback, rating reliability becomes misleading.|$|R

The international law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher took on the cross-border <b>dispute</b> <b>and</b> filed a <b>complaint</b> in Federal court against Edenred. The case was settled out of court. While the precise terms of the resolution remain confidential by mutual agreement, it has been reported as “a legal victory for RedBall Project”. Perschke said that he views the resolution as favorable because it was based on terms that respect his intellectual property rights. In 2015, Perschke accused Shell Oil Company to have used his concept of the RedBall project in a global print ad campaign. The accusation on artistic copyright infringement received media attention. [...] The ad campaign was ended, and the case was settled out of court.|$|R

5000|$|The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) {{program was}} enacted in 1974 by {{president}} Gerald Ford through the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and took effect in January 1975. It had bipartisan support, reportedly because liberal legislators shared {{its goal of}} extinguishing poverty and [...] "urban blight" [...] and conservative legislators appreciated the control it placed {{in the hands of}} private investors and the reduction it made {{in the role of the}} United States government. Cities automatically qualified for the grant if they met the requirements, but were required to submit allocation reports (showing to whom and where the money was spent) and quarterly reports to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD's records were <b>disputed,</b> <b>and</b> there were <b>complaints</b> that Southern cities, in particular, spent grant money in affluent neighborhoods. CDBG funds were distributed in such a way as to generate a bias against older (declining) frostbelt cities, cities that were losing population to the sunbelt.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides new {{empirical evidence}} {{which shows that}} environmental activism has been increasing in China since the early 1990 s. It explains why participation has increased and why it varies across provinces. It examines the potential emergence of environmental movements and shows the utility of applying social movement theories to studying participation more broadly. Finally, It shows how participation makes a difference in policy outcomes. Both qualitative and quantitative methods, including a statistical analysis of ten years of environmental data, an examination of 125 <b>disputes</b> <b>and</b> over 100 interviews in China, are {{used to examine the}} dominant modes of citizen participation; these include direct citizen protests, the <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>and</b> <b>complaint</b> systems, state-mobilized campaigns, and environmental social organizations. New political opportunities for citizen activism have opened up because authorities have encouraged participation. Authorities need participation to achieve policy goals, however this need is in constant tension with the desire to control it. While political opportunities have allowed for greater participation, they remain limiting factors to the emergence of traditional movements. Grievances, mobilizational structures, and framing processes, also are factors in determining patterns of participation. The Chinese regime has become more responsive to citizen environmental grievances and since the 1980 s, there has been a "sophistication" of state-society relations. This, however, does not represent a significant change in the principals guiding the Chinese state. This research illustrates how political opportunity structures in reforming, one-party, corporatist countries like China differ from such structures in freer states. It shows how the Chinese State's approaches have largely worked in containing widespread social unrest. Authorities have encouraged participation in some channels but limited it in others. They utilize the familiar tools of repression and suppression as well as new tools, including regulations, institutions, and processes, through which they shape, channel, and control participation. On the other hand, citizens have taken advantage of opportunities. In some areas, they have established primarily autonomous environmental groups, practice "civil politics," and have created a vibrant conservation proto-movement. Proto-movements exhibit many of the attributes of traditional social movements, and can be precursors to them, but remain constrained by limited political opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Access {{to justice}} is {{fundamental}} to ensuring that core values of our community are translated into practice. Those values include the rule of law, fairness, and equity. Access to justice works to ensure that citizens are treated fairly by government; it supports social cohesion and a common commitment to the life and institutions of the community; and it encourages economic prosperity by providing a reliable mechanism through which citizens can resolve their disputes. Yet the practical capacity of many citizens {{to gain access to}} justice is diminishing, and the gap between the Victorian community’s needs, and the justice system’s ability to meet those needs, is growing. The Review found a great deal of goodwill and dedication among institutions and service providers – people committed to doing their best to serve the growing needs and expectations of the Victorian community – despite the significant challenges in the justice system, including the legal assistance sector. Unfortunately, some important enablers of the system are weak: {{there is a lack of}} data, poor technology in many parts of the system, under-resourcing of legal assistance and related services, and services that are not sufficiently integrated. The justice system is comprised of inter-connected components – users, the courts <b>and</b> tribunals, <b>dispute</b> resolution <b>and</b> <b>complaints</b> bodies, publicly-funded legal assistance providers, private practitioners, and administrators. This system is under stress. Stress in one part of the system has an influence on others. It is with a keen sense of gratitude to the workers and volunteers who keep the system going, and an understanding of the seriousness of the needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged Victorians, that the Review makes recommendations to improve the services provided to meet Victorians’ legal needs, and maximise the efficiency with which public resources are used.  ...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} civil <b>disputes</b> <b>and</b> <b>complaints</b> {{regarding}} {{the negative effects}} of blasting vibration on buildings around the blasting site. By considering the effect of blasting vibration on a human body as a process of energy transfer and conversion, the human body absorbed blasting vibration energy (ABVE) index has been developed for comfort evaluation. Using dynamic monitoring and theoretical analysis, the elevation amplification effect and selective amplification effect on different frequency components of the ABVE have been investigated. The elevation amplification factor and selective amplification coefficients on different frequency components of the ABVE index for a typical 4 -storey brick and concrete building have been determined. Based on the results, the magnitude and frequency components of the ABVE index in different parts especially in different storeys for the typical building have been determined. According to the characteristics of human body’s response to vibrations of different frequencies, the frequency-based weighting method of ABVE index has been simplified. By calculating the combined effect of vibrations from all directions, the total human body ABVE and its frequency components at different floors of the building can be determined accurately. This can be used to evaluate the human body comfort against blasting vibration at different floors...|$|E
