5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
25|$|Most hobs are single-thread hobs, but double-, and triple-thread hobs {{increase}} production rates. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they are not}} as accurate as single-thread hobs.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the EDS system {{naturally}} {{creates a}} field in the track in front and {{to the rear of}} the lift magnets, which acts against the magnets and creates magnetic drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds (This is one of the reasons why JR abandoned a purely repulsive system and adopted the sidewall levitation system.) At higher speeds other modes of drag dominate.|$|E
50|$|The Blower Bentley was born, more {{powerful}} than the 6½ Litre despite lacking the two additional cylinders. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Blower Bentleys consumed 4 litres of fuel per minute at full speed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> textures may {{not appear}} as sharp {{if they are}} {{included}} in the edge detection, and it must be applied before rendering the HUD elements of a game, lest it affect them too.|$|R
50|$|The Smith Carbine <b>was</b> {{unique in}} <b>that</b> it broke {{apart in the}} middle for loading and it used rubber {{cartridges}} which sealed the gases in the breech. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these cartridges <b>were</b> difficult to remove.|$|R
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but the <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, {{with the result that}} round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic spawners: {{a type of}} {{broadcast}} spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually pelagic fish such as tuna and sardines. Some demersal fish leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly coral reef fish such as parrotfish and wrasses. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> mortality is high, {{because they can be}} eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around coral reefs can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex breeding behaviours including sex changes, harems, leks and territoriality. See also: Coral reef fish.|$|E
25|$|Type III has {{relatively}} high early strength. Its typical compound composition is: 57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 1.3% free CaO. This cement {{is similar to}} type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a specific surface area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day compressive strength equal to the seven-day compressive strength of types I and II. Its seven-day compressive strength is almost equal to 28-day compressive strengths of types I and II. The only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly {{less than that of}} types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.|$|E
50|$|The Philadelphia Flyers {{become the}} first team to wear long pants. The idea was to create a more {{streamlined}} uniform with lighter padding, thus making the players faster. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the players hit the boards faster after being bodychecked.|$|R
50|$|Android Central's Andrew Martonik {{likes the}} Shield Tablet, praising its {{speakers}} and the Twitch streaming ability. The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the tablet <b>is</b> heavier than its competitor (390g to the Nexus 7's 290g) {{and it may}} be too expensive for some (the tablet is $299 to $399, the controller is $59, and the cover is $39). The Shield Tablet K1 released in late 2015 comes without a charger or stylus.|$|R
50|$|These {{batteries}} {{could allow}} electric cars to travel 500 miles before recharging. Replacing the liquid electrodes could {{only take a}} few minutes while recharging batteries takes much longer. These batteries don't have the problems of short circuits and overheating. The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> nanoparticles degrade quickly, the technology is new and needs more development, they need to focus on cheaper production, and refilling stations would cost a lot to build.|$|R
500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Adam B. Vary {{wrote that}} Beyoncé was [...] "at her peak — in voice, in looks, in taste in opulent wedding gowns". A Rolling Stones critic commented Beyoncé was looking {{stunning}} in a bridal suite, {{adding that the}} most disarming thing about the clip is that she sings directly to the camera. The review concludes that, [...] "the video hits all of its marks perfectly, conveying all of the nuances in the lyrics while providing a lovely, memorable visual." [...] The Washington Posts Sarah Anne Hughes wrote Beyoncé is [...] "extravagantly dressed" [...] in the video adding that the only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no dance {{in the tradition of}} [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008). Kara Warner of MTV News called [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", [...] "as different as night and day" [...] adding that the same thing happened with their music videos. Werner further praised Beyoncé [...] "gorgeous" [...] dress and added that it [...] "will likely land on a few style blogs soon, given its embroidered and jeweled details, not to mention the silk bows and ruching on the sides". A writer of The Huffington Post described the video as a transition to the one for [...] "Run the World". Cristina Everett of Daily News noted that the look of satisfaction and hapinness on her face make the video the best revenge for her ex-lover. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan noted that Beyoncé was looking [...] "makeup-commercial-flawless". He also wrote that if country singer Kellie Pickler remade the video shot-for-shot, it would never leave CMT rotation for it is [...] "a perfect CMT video".|$|E
500|$|The PC port {{was also}} well-received. Lee Buchanan of PC Gamer US praised [...] "the {{spectacular}} visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've {{seen on a}} computer", and he noted that [...] " [...] damage is depicted beautifully". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player [...] "can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction". Although he found the game too easy [...] "even at the toughest difficulty level", he found {{this to be a}} minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, [...] "Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations." [...] Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game [...] "a great simulation" [...] of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are [...] "convulsive and realistic". He believed that the game [...] "has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives", and he considered the car damage to be [...] "especially marvelous—and unprecedented for this sort of game". However, he found that its [...] "useful life span is surprisingly short" [...] and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, [...] "Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the camera zooms out so little that {{it can be difficult to}} see nearby cars.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} became controversial for offending {{some members}} of the gay community. Australian AIDS pioneer Ron Penny regretted the fact this occurred:The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Grim Reaper became identified with gay men rather than as the Reaper. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> what we had unintentionally produced - belief by some <b>that</b> the Reaper <b>was</b> people with HIV infection, rather than the Reaper harvesting the dead.I think there's never been anything on television or any media that has ever matched it in terms of impact, but no advertising can <b>be</b> without some <b>downside,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> never intended. But it at least made people aware and probably did change sexual practices of heterosexuals.|$|R
500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I <b>was</b> published and I got a readership, ... <b>downside</b> ... <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|R
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{it had not been}} tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|R
2500|$|Forward stance: Suitable {{for most}} purposes, both feet are angled forward. Frequently the leading foot is angled roughly 15° to 21° and the {{trailing}} foot at 0° to 10°. A <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a rider's balance is notably different when riding in reverse {{compared to their}} forward stance. [...] This can be compensated for by learning how to ride backwards with this stance, also known as riding [...] "switch", or by choosing another stance such as Duck, or Flat stance. As riders become more experienced, they can experiment with different [...] "stances" [...] to feel {{what is best for}} them.|$|E
2500|$|There is no flash {{produced}} so material {{savings are}} between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|E
2500|$|Multi-choice procedure. [...] A softer option, {{when the}} parties {{do not wish}} to commit {{themselves}} to a more dramatic termination procedure, the deadlock can often provide for a series of options, one of which the parties must agree on, if the deadlock cannot be resolved. [...] The benefit of an open textured clause like this is that, when faced with the draconian consequences of the next step, the parties are thought to be better able to compromise. [...] The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the parties are truly at loggerheads, it usually requires a third party adjudicator (often an arbitrator) to impose one of the options upon them.|$|E
50|$|Integrating {{the lens}} {{within the body}} of the camera had both {{positive}} and negative effects. On the positive side, it meant the optical nodal point of the camera was close to the centre of gravity, which could make operation easier and more instinctive when used on movable camera mounts such as pedestals. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> lens manufacturers <b>were</b> limited to which lenses they could adapt to fit to the camera. This made the 2001 less attractive for outside broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|The Baal Shem Tov (1698-1760), {{founder of}} the revivalist Hasidic movement, brought a mystical soul-dimension to the {{traditional}} Talmudic notions of the Tinuk Shenishba, and the Am ha-aretz (uneducated-boorish-rustic Jews). While the former terms derive from the pre-eminent status of Torah study in Rabbinic Jewish culture, their <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the 17-18th century Eastern Europe in which Hasidism emerged, their elitist notions contributed to the physical and spiritual hardship and dissenfranchisement of the common Jewish folk from deeper Jewish affiliation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{technique is}} applying only projective transformation to the images for each eye (simulating {{rotation of the}} eye). The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> this approach cannot {{take into account the}} translation (changes in position) of the head. And the rotation can only happen around the axis of the eyeball, instead of the neck, which is the true axis for head rotation. When applied multiple times to a single frame, this causes [...] "positional judder", because position is not updated with every frame.|$|R
2500|$|The exact {{choice of}} engine systems remains {{somewhat}} controversial at this point. The concept was originally for an integrated power system (IPS) based on in-hull permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMMs), with Advanced Induction Motors (AIM) {{as a possible}} backup solution. The design was shifted to the AIM system in February 2005 {{in order to meet}} scheduled milestones; PMM technical issues were subsequently fixed, but the program has moved on. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> AIM technology has a heavier motor, requires more space, requires a [...] "separate controller" [...] to be developed to meet noise requirements, and produces one-third the amount of voltage. On the other hand, these very differences will force time and cost penalties from design and construction changes if the program wishes to [...] "design AIM out" [...] … ...|$|E
2500|$|Albuquerque has {{expanded}} greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During {{those years of}} expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post 1940s areas. These older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four to six lane roads in a 1mile(1.61km) grid. Each 1square mile(2.59km²) is divided into four [...] neighborhoods by smaller roads set 0.5miles(0.8km) between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from {{the worst of the}} noise and lights on the major roads. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{it is virtually impossible to}} go anywhere from home without driving.|$|E
2500|$|XM also {{provided}} data {{services such as}} weather information for pilots and weather spotters through its Sirius XM Weather & Emergency datacasting service. This up to the minute weather information could be displayed in the cockpit of an aircraft equipped with a satellite weather receiver. Unlike weather radar, which relies on the aircraft's own equipment, the satellite service could give a pilot information about weather anywhere in USA and Canada. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the various weather streams (radar, cloud coverage, lightning, forecast, TAF, FA, etc...) took around 15 minutes to complete the data download, meaning that the information can be somewhat out-of-date {{by the time it}} is shown. In-cockpit radar and lightning receivers returned truly realtime information, but they cost thousands of dollars, did not provide forecasts, nor did they provide complete weather reports. FAA Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) were also available and shown. [...] Certain aircraft had the XM radio service provided to the aircraft's audio system, which allowed passengers to listen to XM radio while flying.|$|E
50|$|The Reservisor was {{installed}} in American's Boston reservation office in February 1946. After a one-year trial, they found <b>that</b> the office <b>was</b> handling 200 more passengers a day, with 20 fewer operators. One <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the electrical relay contacts would get dirty and required constant cleaning. And although it did help solve the availability issues, this made {{the rest of the}} booking task - collecting passenger information and recording the sale - that much more of a problem <b>that</b> needed to <b>be</b> solved.|$|R
5000|$|Against the {{background}} of the developments in Europe, CRC was able to persuade the Canadian government to develop the system into a fully-fledged service. In August 1978 the Canadian Department of Communications publicly launched it as Telidon, a [...] "second generation" [...] videotex/teletext service, and committed to a four-year development plan to encourage rollout. Compared to the European systems, Telidon offered real graphics, as opposed to block-mosaic character graphics. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it required much more advanced decoders, typically featuring Zilog Z80 or Motorola 6809 processors.|$|R
50|$|With a {{total of}} 31 entrants, {{including}} {{a large number of}} European teams, the ACO considered the race a success. The only <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> BMW, who had initially entered their BMW V12 LMs, did not show up for the race. However, the ACO and Don Panoz pushed ahead with their plans and announced the American Le Mans Series for 1999. IMSA, whose own racing series was faltering, decided to take instead take over as sanctioning body for the new American Le Mans Series.|$|R
2500|$|Arriving at the Boarding House of Mystery, Howard and Beverly {{encounter}} Cain and Abel, {{the latter}} {{with a rock}} stuck in his head that allows him only moments of lucidity. [...] There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being tight again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, The Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber's own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. [...] The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> everyone staying in the place gets their every wish, so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him. One tenant, a writer named Mr. Gommorah (a parody of Spider Jerusalem), takes Beverly and Howard {{to be on the}} Iprah Show with the topic [...] "Why Women Give It to Men Who Don't Get It", guest starring Dr. Phlip. [...] Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse. [...] Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. [...] Deuteronomy is a creature half id and half superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. [...] Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). [...] Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. [...] Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell. He is eventually freed by Yah, a being who claims to be [...] "God". A few years later he was reunited with his parents and brother at a baseball game in Dakvorlde.|$|E
2500|$|Once in place, {{the first}} task of an {{administrator}} is to make proposals to achieve the administration objectives. These {{should be given to}} the registrar and unsecured creditors within 10 weeks, followed by a creditor vote to approve the plans by simple majority. If creditors do not approve the court may make an order as it sees fit. However, before then under Schedule B1, paragraph 59 the administrator can do 'anything necessary or expedient for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company'. In Re Transbus International Ltd Lawrence Collins J made the point that the rules on administration were intended to be [...] "a more flexible, cheaper and comparatively informal alternative to liquidation" [...] and so with regard to doing what is expedient [...] "the fewer applications which need to be made to the court the better." [...] This means that an administrator can sell the whole assets of a company immediately, making the eventual creditors' meeting redundant. Because of this and out of court appointments, since 2002, [...] "pre-packaged administrations" [...] became increasingly popular. Typically the company directors negotiate with their bank, and a prospective administrator, to sell the business to a buyer immediately after entering administration. Often to the company's directors are the buyers. The perceived benefits of this practice, originating in the 1980s in the United States, is that a quick sale without hiring lawyers and expending time or business assets through formalities, can be effected to keep the business running and employees in their jobs. The potential <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> because a deal is already agreed among the controlling interested parties (directors, insolvency practitioners and the major secured creditor) before broader consultation, unsecured creditors are given no voice, and will recover almost none of their debts. In Re Kayley Vending Ltd, which concerned an in-court appointed administrator, HH Judge Cooke held that a court will ensure that applicants for a prepack administration provide enough information for a court to conclude that the scheme is not being used to unduly disadvantage unsecured creditors. Moreover, while the costs of arranging the prepack before entering administration will count for the purpose of administrator's expenses, it is less likely to do so if the business is sold to the former management. Here the sale of a cigarette vending machine business was to the company's competitors, and so the deal was sufficiently [...] "arm's length" [...] to raise no concern. In their conduct of meetings, the Court of Appeal made clear in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Maxwell that administrators appointed out of court will be scrutinised in the way they treat unsecured creditors. Here the administrator did not treat the Revenue as having sufficient votes against the company's management buyout proposal, but the court substituted its judgment and stated the number of votes allowed should take account of events all the way in the run up to the meeting, including in this case the Revenue's amended claim for unlawful tax deductions to the managers' trust funds and loans to directors.|$|E
50|$|Competitive {{swimming}} wetsuits {{are made}} of the most expanded foam; {{they have to be}} very flexible to allow the swimmer unrestricted movement. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they are quite fragile.|$|E
50|$|Holden's superpowers are {{the result}} of an alien {{artifact}} merging with his nervous system. Whenever he experiences physical trauma, he feels no pain but instead stores the pain, which he can then direct via touch into someone else. Enough pain can kill a person with no physical trace, making Carver an ideal assassin for Tao's purposes. Holden has little control over his power and causes pain to anybody who touches him. Another <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he <b>is</b> also incapable of feeling anything else, though a combination of pain and pleasure during sex can make him feel pleasure.|$|R
5000|$|For launch, {{the missile}} seeker was slaved to the launch aircraft's radar (Ferranti AIRPASS in the Lightning and GEC AI.18 in the Sea Vixen) until lock was {{achieved}} and the weapons was launched, leaving the interceptor free to acquire another target. A <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the missile <b>was</b> highly toxic (due {{to either the}} Magpie rocket motor or the ammonia coolant) and RAF armourers had to wear some form of CRBN protection to safely mount the missile onto an aircraft. [...] "Unlike modern 1990s missiles, ... Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} to this design, {{compared to the}} {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) MAR, was twofold. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> far cheaper to build, as the only component built on a large scale were the phase shifters, which were relatively inexpensive compared to the active modules of the MAR. The other <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it dramatically reduced the wiring complexity as the shifters were wired in vertical rows instead of individually. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the system could no longer produce multiple beams, which <b>is</b> the capability <b>that</b> allowed the MAR to handle multiple functions of tracking and discrimination. In comparison, the MSR was really useful only for short-range tracking.|$|R
