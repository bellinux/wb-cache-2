50|$|With this {{electrophysiological}} approach, proteoliposomes, membrane vesicles, or membrane fragments {{containing the}} channel or transporter of interest are adsorbed to a lipid monolayer painted over a functionalized electrode. This electrode {{consists of a}} <b>glass</b> <b>support,</b> a chromium layer, a gold layer, and an octadecyl mercaptane monolayer. Because the painted membrane {{is supported by the}} electrode, it is called a solid-supported membrane. It {{is important to note that}} mechanical perturbations, which usually destroy a biological lipid membrane, do not influence the life-time of an SSM. The capacitive electrode (composed of the SSM and the absorbed vesicles) is so mechanically stable that solutions may be rapidly exchanged at its surface. This property allows the application of rapid substrate/ligand concentration jumps to investigate the electrogenic activity of the protein of interest, measured via capacitive coupling between the vesicles and the electrode.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} sodium {{content of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> on the {{crystallinity}} of sputtered TiO 2 films and photocatalytic breakdown of ethanol has been studied. It {{was found that the}} activity of the as-deposited (amorphous) films does not depend on the type of support used. The chemical composition of the <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> does influence the activity of annealed films. When using soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> sodium diffuses into the film upon annealing, suppressing anatase crystallization and decreasing its photocatalytic activity. To decrease the influence of sodium, soda-lime glass coated with an e-beam evaporated SiO 2 barrier layer was used with good result. A reduced sodium concentration in the film leads to well crystallized anatase after annealing. An increased photocatalytic activity was observed for these films...|$|E
40|$|An aryl {{diisocyanate}} {{has been}} used to attach an appropriately protected 2 '-deoxyribonucleoside bearing a free 3 '-hydroxyl group, to a long chain alkylamine controlled pore <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> via a urethane moiety, in a simple two step procedure. This obviates the need for the preparation and short column chromatographic purification of the 21 -deoxyribonucleoside- 31 - 0 -succinates required for preparation of the widely used succinyl linked supports. The greater stability of the urethane bond compared to an ester bond led to substantially higher yields of oligodeoxyribonucleotides prepared by the solid phase phosphotriester method. More than twenty oligodeoxy-ribonucleotides have already been synthesized on the <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> bearing the new linkage...|$|E
40|$|A {{compound}} imager {{consists of}} two or more individual chips, each with at least one line array of sensors thereupon. Each chip has a <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> plate attached to the side from which light reaches the line arrays. The chips are butted together end-to-end to make large line arrays of sensors. Because of imperfections in cutting, the butted surfaces define a gap. Light entering in the region of the gap is either lost or falls on an individual imager other than the one for which it is intended. This results in vignetting and/or crosstalk near the butted region. The gap is filled with an epoxy resin or other similar material which, when hardened, has an index of referaction near that of the <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> plate...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{simple method}} {{combining}} magnetic field and microparticles {{has been designed}} for assembling, locating and grafting permanent microfilaments onto a silanised glass surface. Filaments orthogonal to a <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> are implemented by assembling magnetic carboxylatex particles under magnetic field. They exhibit an aspect ratio up to 14. Carboxyl moieties on beads and silanised glass are activated using the carbodiimide method. A further reaction with long chain diamines allows the formation of permanent filaments covalently anchored onto the <b>glass</b> <b>support.</b> Grafted microfilaments can withstand intense washing with detergent solutions under ultrasound. 500 mm diameter filament spots are formed using ferromagnetic tips connected to an electromagnet. After their formation, filaments can be actuated by an external magnetic field: their orientation is tunable in real time within a 2 pi solid angle. Filaments can be biofunctionalised in order to perform biomolecular recognition on the support. We show that nucleic acid probes immobilised onto these filaments hybridize with labelled oligonucleotide targets. Due to an increase of the specific surface, the fluorescence signal of targets is 3 -fold higher with filaments than with a planar <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> biofunctionalised with the same oligonucleotides. Our methodology thus provides {{an easy way to}} create filaments usable for both actuation and biodetection onto a planar support. We expect our strategy to be compatible with the formation of nanofilaments using nanoparticles...|$|E

40|$|Combinations of TiO 2 photocatalysts {{and various}} {{adsorbents}} {{have been widely}} studied for the adsorption and photocatalytic decomposition of gaseous pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Herein, a TiO 2 -zeolite-porous glass composite was prepared using melt-quenching and partial sintering, hydrothermal treatment, and drop coating for preparation of the porous <b>glass</b> <b>support</b> and X-zeolite and their combination with TiO 2, respectively. The obtained composite comprised anatase phase TiO 2, X-zeolite, and the porous <b>glass</b> <b>support,</b> which were combined at the micro to nanometer scales. The composite had a relatively high specific surface area of approximately 25 m 2 /g and exhibited a good adsorption capacity for 2 -propanol. These data indicated that utilization of this particular phase-separated glass as the support was appropriate {{for the formation of}} the bulk photocatalyst-adsorbent composite. Importantly, the photocatalytic decomposition of adsorbed 2 -propanol proceeded under UV light irradiation. The 2 -propanol was oxidized to acetone and then trapped by the X-zeolite rather than being released to the atmosphere. Consequently, it was demonstrated that the micrometer-scaled combination of TiO 2 and zeolite in the bulk form is very useful for achieving both the removal of gaseous organic pollutants and decreasing the emission of harmful intermediates...|$|E
