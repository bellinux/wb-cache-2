40|$|Abstract A four {{degree of}} freedom {{thermally}} actuated MEMS microgripper is presented in this paper. Each jaw of the microgripper has independent x and y degrees of freedom. These extra degrees of freedom give the gripper added dexterity for manipulating microparts. The motion of each <b>gripper</b> <b>jaw</b> is provided by a two {{degree of freedom}} compliant mechanism {{which is based on}} a ve bar rigid link mechanism. This gripper also introduces a novel thermal microactuator design that is capable of bi-directional actuation giving it a greater range of motion than previous thermal actuator designs. The actuator provides a total range of motion of 12. 7 m and a maximum force of 1. 9 mN. Also, since this microgripper is based on a compliant mechanism, deformable object tracking can be used to provide force as well as position feedback for the gripper. This combination of an increased number of degrees of freedom and increased sensory feedback provides a level of dexterity that has not been previously available in microassembly.

One set of sample was prepared by polymerization of silicone rubber with CIPs and silicone oil, while the other set obtained by filling the ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4 HCO 3), CIPs and silicone oils. Both set of samples were manufactured under isotropic condition and their microstructures was characterized by XRD and EFSEM.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Steel {{foundries}} are {{in great}} need of automation as current operations involve many hazardous manual tasks. Automating foundry operations is very challenging {{due to the}} variety of tasks that must be performed on physical objects that vary significantly in size, shape, and weight. This thesis focuses on robotically automating the material handling operation in the foundry by designing an underactuated parallel <b>jaw</b> robotic <b>gripper</b> that can handle a variety of foundry products regardless of their shape. This design is driven by a linear underactuated system composed {{of a series of}} coupled hydraulic pistons that enable the gripper to securely grasp objects by conforming to their shape.

30|$|The finger design {{approach}} for realizing the handling an object including assembly {{have been studied}} long time. Most pioneering research of gripper design was done by Mason [9]. He formulated a planar pose problem and found a pushing plan to move a polygonal object to a specified goal position and orientation. This concept has become underlying of the self-alignment mechanism on sensor-less gripper. Causey and Quinn summarized gripper design guidelines [10] and mentioned the importance of grasped part alignment {{as well as the}} importance of part deformation avoidance for increasing reliability. Zhang and Goldberg proposed unique parallel-jaw grippers that can align an n-sided polygonal part in the vertical plane as the jaw close [11]. They also proposed a numerical algorithm to design optimal <b>gripper</b> <b>jaws</b> [12]. Hirata et al. proposed design of handling device for caging and aligning small circular objects [13]. By designing the triangular finger tips, their hand can grasp a small object robustly at a unique position of the tips. Although these conventional studies solve the problem of self-alignment of a part with gripper, the problem of alignment with other part is not considered. On the other hand, our proposed hollowed finger can align centers of a part and another part. The capability of self-alignment between two parts by using the hollowed finger is our original.|$|R
