40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{importance}} of household credit in the transmission of monetary policy and in explaining the positive correlation between money and credit services over the business cycle.

There is an explicit financial sector with firms specializing in the production of credit services. Second, the financial sector also contains financial intermediaries who provide <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>accounts</b> for households and loanable funds to credit producers. It is shown that monetary injections in this set-up can generate a liquidity effect which positively influences the availability of household credit services and real activity. Furthermore, the model predicts that monetary injections actually lower the real cost of consumption, thus resolving a difficulty with recent liquidity effect models. The potential quantitative importance of this monetary transmission mechanism is analyzed. Housing; Housing - Finance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{monetary}} explanation of two business cycle regularities: (i) business and household investment are positively correlated and procyclical and (ii) household investment tends to lead business investment. We construct a general equilibrium framework that explicitly incorporates a credit sector where real resources are employed {{in the production of}} costly household and business credit services. Financial intermediaries provide <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>accounts</b> to households and loanable funds for credit producers. It is shown that liquidity effects from asymmetric monetary injections to the financial sector increase the availability of consumer and business credit services. The relative strength of these liquidity effects on business and household spending can provide a mechanism which captures both the direction and timing of their corresponding investments expenditures over the cycle. Furthermore, explaining these observations with a household credit channel also resolves some problematic predictions of existing liquidity effect models. Investments...|$|R

40|$|How far can shoe-leather go in {{explaining}} the welfare cost of inflation? Using {{a unique set of}} microeconomic data on households, we estimate the parameters of the demand for money derived from a generalized Baumol-Tobin model. Our data set contains information on average holdings of cash, on deposits and other <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>accounts,</b> on the number of trips to the bank, on the size of withdrawals and on the ownership and use of ATM cards. We model the adoption of new transaction technologies and use these estimates to correct for the selectivity bias induced by some households choosing to hold no <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> assets and some to use an ATM card. The interest rate and expenditure flow elasticities of the demand for cash are close to the theoretical values implied by standard inventory models. However, we find significant differences between the individuals with an ATM card and those without. The estimates of the demand for cash allow us to calculate a measure of the welfare cost of inflation analogous to Bailey's triangle, but based on a rigorous microeconometric framework. The welfare cost of inflation varies considerably within the population, but never turns out to be very large (about 0. 1 percent of consumption or less). Our results are robust to various changes in the specification. In addition to the main results based on the average stock of cash held, we provide some evidence {{based on the number of}} trips to the bank and on the average withdrawals that confirm our basic findings. demand for money, financial innovation, welfare cost of inflation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and solves {{a general}} finite horizon trade credit economic ordering policy for an inventory model with deteriorating items under inflation and time value of money when shortages are not allowed. The time horizon {{is divided into}} different cycles {{each of which has}} its own demand rate and its own trade credit period offered from the supplier to his retailer so that the retailer should pay his supplier before or {{after the end of the}} permissible trade credit of that cycle. Up to the end of the trade credit of a cycle, the retailer is free of charge, but he is charged on an interest for those items not being sold before this end. The retailer can also earn the interest of the money from the generated sales revenue in any cycle by depositing such revenue into an <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>account.</b> The objective of the retailer is then to minimize his net total relevant costs. A closed form of this net total cost is derived and the resulting model is solved. Then rigorous mathematical methods are used to show that, under some seemingly possible conditions, there exist a unique vector of the relevant decision variables that solve the underlying inventory system. A numerical example which shows the applicability of the theoretical results is given.

In this world monetary policy and bank regulations have welfare effects. A main result is that Friedman's (1969) optimum quantity of money rule continues to hold in this setting. It does so because a non-zero interest rate distorts the composition of consumption. The general result is translated into results on the optimum rate of expansion of the supply of base money under different assumptions. We also study optimum reserve requirements on banks...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} understanding {{the psychological and}} behavioral causes of poverty. It also uses insights into the resultant behaviors that affect those that live in poverty to create solutions that leverage behavior for more effective poverty alleviation. First, I use a laboratory experiment to investigate a possible psychological determinant of sub-optimal decision-making, stress. There exists evidence that poverty causes stress, and mixed evidence for the effect of stress on economic decision-making. Contrary to evidence collected in the developed world, I find no evidence for the effect of social or physical stress on economic decision-making among urban poor in Nairobi Kenya. Next, I use a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of a novel savings mechanism based {{on the concept of}} prize-linked savings. I exploit people's love for gambling to create and test a new savings mechanism that allows people to earn savings interest probabilistically. I find that participants prefer prize-linked savings <b>accounts</b> to <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>accounts,</b> despite the fact that prize-linked savings accounts paid less in expectation. I also find that relative to a control group, participants assigned to prize-linked savings saved significantly more money overall. My results highlight the need to understand and harness the psychological underpinnings of poverty in order to develop solutions to alleviate it. On one side, more work {{needs to be done to}} understand if the neurobiological and psychological effects of stress lead to sub-optimal decision-making. In addition, we should continue to use these insights to develop novel products and mechanisms that can help those escape this global problem...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the growing body of {{literature}} on the impact of corporate governance on debt contracting by examining if better governance is associated with access to <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> debt. The paper aims to explore whether no-debt companies have governance structures that are qualitatively different to debt companies within a market with a distinct corporate finance structure, such as Australia. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is portioned into two stages. The first stage focuses on univariate analysis which includes descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The second stage introduces multivariate analysis, in the form of a probit regression model, to test the relationship between corporate governance and access to <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> debt. Findings – The results suggest that companies with higher levels of corporate governance are more likely to access <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> debt relative to no-debt companies. However, the unexpected finding is that only resource companies that implement higher governance are more likely to access <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> debt. The core driver is that resource companies with no-debt have systematically lower governance than all other companies. Research limitations/implications – The cross – sectional design of the study is limited in its ability to shed light on the question of causality. One potential avenue is to develop an event study around the timing of governance and debt access changes. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the extant literature by investigating the relationship between governance and access to <b>interest</b> <b>bearing</b> debt in the understudied Australian debt market...|$|R
