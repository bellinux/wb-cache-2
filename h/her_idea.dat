5|$|In spring 1907, Ethel Hedgeman led {{efforts to}} create a sisterhood at Howard University. Howard faculty member Ethal Robinson {{encouraged}} Hedgeman by relating her own observances of sorority life at the Women's College at Brown University, {{even though she was}} not a member of any sorority while a student at Brown. Hedgeman was also inspired by her mentors at Howard. To implement <b>her</b> <b>idea,</b> Hedgeman began recruiting interested classmates during the summer of 1907.|$|E
5|$|Though Lieder {{herself has}} not {{specified}} a new {{date for the}} object's return, many groups have taken up <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> and cited their own dates. One frequently cited date was December 21, 2012. This date had many apocalyptic associations, {{as it was the}} end of a cycle (baktun) in the long count in the Mayan calendar. Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012. Despite that date having passed, many websites still contend that Nibiru/Planet X is en route to Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about <b>her</b> <b>idea.</b> Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the couple that most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{concepts}} {{have also}} been criticized more broadly. Economist Tyler Cowen has criticized <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure, and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development. For example, although <b>her</b> <b>ideas</b> of planning were praised at times as [...] "universal", they are now thought inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million (as has happened many times in developing nations). Such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of New York, where Jacobs developed many of <b>her</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains that it was <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred {{because she wanted to}} do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E

Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him over the death of wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was <b>her</b> <b>idea.</b> Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E

25|$|Genes are cogs in the machine, not gods in the sky. They are {{switched}} {{on and off}} throughout life, by external as well as internal events, {{their job is to}} absorb information from the environment at least as often as to transmit it from the past. Genes do more than carry information; they respond to experience. Susan Mineka illustrated this concept exceedingly well with <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> of prepared learning in monkeys, where she found the predisposition of genes largely affected the acquisition of fear responses to certain stimuli. Lab-reared monkeys, through vicarious experience, were easily able to acquire a fear response to a snake, but not a flower. Nature provides the instinct, and elements of nurture depend on whether the instinct is expressed.|$|E

The meeting was held in Washington, D.C. in 1888, and attracted delegates from the United States and Europe. Although Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony supported the idea of an international suffrage association, little was accomplished until Sewell's presentation at the NWSA's meeting in March 1888. <b>Her</b> <b>idea</b> was to form national and international councils of women's groups that would to bring women together for regular gatherings to discuss various topics beyond suffrage. Forty-nine delegates representing fifty-three national women's organizations approved the establishment of a fifteen-member committee that included Clara Barton, Frances Willard, Antoinette Brown Blackwell, Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Stone, and Sewall.|$|E

25|$|Willimantic Boom Box Parade: Willimantic has {{received}} {{national and international}} attention for its annual Boom Box Parade. Back in 1986, with the local Windham High School marching Band having disbanded, local parade fan Kathleen Clark approached the local radio station WILI {{with the idea of}} a people’s parade. She offered her collection of vintage marching music records to the radio station with <b>her</b> <b>idea</b> that they play these patriotic marches throughout the duration of the parade. Parade goers were encouraged to bring their Boom Box radios and tune into 1400 AM. The parade was a hit, and its unique notion of having no live music has drawn the attention of CBS Evening News and the Washington Post, among others. The parade Grand Marshal is WILI radio host and local celebrity Wayne Norman. Parade participation is equally as important as parade attendance, with the vast majority of parade participants being individual citizens or local citizens groups who simply wish to share their creativity and national pride with spectators. Other cities from Madison, WI and Lubbock, TX, to Newfane, NY and Bullhead City, AZ, have had Boom Box Parades, but none have endured or been as large as Willimantic's.|$|E
25|$|Sherine first {{proposed}} {{the campaign in}} June 2008 in a guardian.co.uk Comment is Free blog post, Atheists – gimme five in the Guardian. She expressed her frustration that the Christian organisation JesusSaid.org was allowed to use bus advertising to promote the web address of a website that said that all non-Christians would burn in hell for all eternity. Sherine called on atheists to counter this kind of evangelical advertising by donating five pounds towards a positive philosophical advert. <b>Her</b> <b>idea</b> was taken up by political blogger Jon Worth, {{who went on to}} set up a PledgeBank page. The PledgeBank page closed on 31 July 2008, having received 877 of the 4,679 pledges necessary for the original target of £23,400. This event attracted some limited comment in the mainstream media early in August. Sherine then wrote a follow-up Comment is free article, Dawkin 'bout a Revolution, detailing events since the original piece. In response, the British Humanist Association offered to lend the campaign its official support and undertook to administer all donations. Sherine then asked Richard Dawkins for a quote for the campaign, at which point he offered to match the first £5,500 raised.|$|E
