It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the Council of Europe's Assembly to perform the task. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated the leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term [...] "representatives of the people" [...] and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community.</b> By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952 with extra members, but after the failure of the proposed European Defence Community the project was dropped.|$|E

The East Asian countries did not ever have religious wars, though the reasons for the conflicts between different countries varied from each other at various times in history. China, as a precocious modern country, established many mechanisms under the centralized bureaucratic system to deal with the various conflicts against the surrounding <b>political</b> <b>communities</b> or countries, in a way to avoid violence; while the “tribute system” provided other major means apart from warfare for solving conflicts in a long period.|$|R

50|$|The {{failure of}} the European Defence Community (EDC) and the <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community,</b> brought the process of European {{integration}} to a standstill in 1954. At that moment Johan Willem Beyen (Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs) took the initiative to revive an idea, based on the Ouchy Convention of 1932, he had already put forward in December 1952 and February 1953 for the <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community</b> (EPC). He proposed that the member states of the European Coal and Steel Community would develop a common market without customs duties or import quotas instead of a sector-based integration which had been the option taken by the ECSC. Beyen sent a memorandum to his Benelux colleagues Paul-Henri Spaak (Belgium) and Joseph Bech (Luxembourg) on 4 April 1955 in which he proposed his idea of a customs union.|$|E
50|$|He {{subsequently}} {{became involved}} in the creation of what would eventually become the European Union. In 1952, he was seconded by the Council of Europe to act as director of the secretariat of the constitutional committee of the ad hoc assembly tasked by the six member states of the European Coal and Steel Community to prepare plans for a <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community</b> (EPC).|$|E

(1) Schuman was not a constitutionalist who believed that the ancient states of Europe would come together by politicians writing a European version of a Philadelphia constitution.

50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community</b> (EPC) was {{proposed}} in 1952 {{as a combination}} of the existing European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the proposed European Defence Community (EDC). A draft EPC treaty, as drawn up by the ECSC assembly (now the European Parliament), would have seen a directly elected assembly ("the Peoples’ Chamber"), a senate appointed by national parliaments and a supranational executive accountable to the parliament.|$|E
50|$|Partly in {{the aim of}} {{creating}} a United States of Europe, two further Communities were proposed, again by the French.

50|$|Following on {{from the}} success of the Treaty of Paris, efforts were made to allow West Germany to rearm within the {{framework}} of a European military structure {{in the form of a}} European Defence Community.

40|$|More {{than any}} other {{politician}} in current Hungarian politics, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán refers to “east” and “west” in his public addresses as symbols of antithetical political cultures and cultural value systems. Of course, he {{is by no means}} the first Hungarian statesman to do so. From the Middle Ages, references to the Asian origins of the nation were mobilized by chroniclers and statesmen to characterize the national character and Hungary’s place in the <b>European</b> Christian <b>political</b> <b>community.</b> During the Enlightenment, the embracing of a perceived cultural hierarchy between west and east entered the Hungarian public discourse, and from the Reform Era the two intellectual streams shaped modern Hungarian identity discourse equally. This paper describes the national identity discourse that emphasizes the Asian origins of the nation through the lens of what I call “self-Orientalism. ” Whereas Orbán’s political addresses can be viewed as a continuation of the self-Orientalizing language, the examination of the ways in which he breaks from the tradition of self-Orientalism teaches even more important lessons about the viability of the reference to the east-west dichotomy in the global political arena...|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s Europe saw the {{emergence}} to two different projects, the European Free Trade Association, {{led by the}} UK, and the much more <b>political</b> <b>European</b> Economic <b>Community,</b> led by France and Germany. It has been claimed that a similar division to this persists today: On the one hand, there are those European countries, some inside and some outside of the EU, who see Europe largely as a free trade zone, and are reluctant to further integrate politically. On the other hand, there is the Eurozone, a group of countries which are committed to a common political unity.|$|R
50|$|After failed {{attempts}} at creating defence (European Defence Community) and political communities (<b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community),</b> leaders {{met at the}} Messina Conference and established the Spaak Committee which produced the Spaak report. The report was accepted at the Venice Conference (29 and 30 May 1956) where the decision was taken to organise an Intergovernmental Conference. The Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom focused on economic unity, leading to the Treaties of Rome being signed in 1957 which established the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) among the members.|$|E
50|$|The ECSC {{was created}} first. Following its {{proposal}} in 1950 in the Schuman Declaration, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany {{came together to}} sign the Treaty of Paris in 1951 which established the Community. The success of this Community led to the desire to create more, but attempts at creating a European Defence Community and a <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Community</b> failed leading to a return to economic matters. In 1957, the EAEC and EEC were created by the Treaties of Rome. They were {{to share some of}} the institutions of the ECSC but have separate executive structures.|$|E
50|$|The Treaty {{establishing}} the European Economic Community (Treaty of Rome) {{did not include}} any reference to fundamental or human rights.

The latter treaty had included rights provisions and Craig and de Búrca argue that, in light of that failure, the drafters of the EEC Treaty wished to eschew any implicitly political elements. However, the idea that the purely economic end of the new EEC Treaty would be unlikely to have any implications for fundamental rights was soon to be tested.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{whether and how}} the moral principle of legal coherence or integrity, which has recently been developed further {{as a response to}} disagreement in the national legal context, applies to European law. According to the European integrity principle, all national and European authorities should make sure their decisions cohere with the past decisions of other European and national authorities that create and implement the law of a complex but single European legal order. Only by doing so, it is argued, can the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> and legal <b>community</b> gain true authority and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} European citizens to whom all these decisions apply. Although European integrity is primarily a product of European integration, it has gradually become one of the requirements of further integration. The article suggests that the principle of European integrity would help dealing with the growing pressure for common European solutions under conditions of increasing diversity. It places disagreement at the centre of European politics, as both an incentive and a means of integration by way of comparison and self-reflectivity. It constitutes therefore the ideal instrument for a pluralist and flexible further constitutionalisation of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} boundary disputes between Qajar Persia and the emerging state of Afghanistan {{in the nineteenth}} century. It argues that disputes between these two Islamic polities were central {{to the creation of}} modern states through the territorialization of political identity, in the form of border delineation. The demarcation of territorial boundaries represented the indigenization of Western norms of statehood. Indigenous political actors increasingly understood and envisaged their <b>political</b> <b>communities</b> in terms of territorial states, reinterpreting and redeploying <b>European</b> <b>political</b> concepts in indigenous spaces. The Perso-Afghan case exemplifies the assimilation of ideas of political territoriality, central to the construction of a modern state-based international order, in Muslim regions outside direct colonial control. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the concept}} {{generally}} known as Wider Europe, the European Union has mapped out an ambitious vision of regional Neighbourhood {{that goes beyond}} cooperation to involve a significant measure of integration. Furthermore, the EU sees this new quality of regional interaction and partnership as bringing enormous gains to all involved in terms of increased stability, security and well being. The EUDIMENSIONS (Local Dimensions of a Wider <b>European</b> Neighbourhood: Developing <b>Political</b> <b>Community</b> through Practices and Discourses of Cross-Border Co-operation) research project, financed under the European Union 6 th Framework Programme, priority 7, chapter 4. 2. 1 (New Borders, New Visions of Neighbourhood), has sought to map and analyse crossborder cooperation and political contact-building between the European Union and neighbouring states, with a special emphasis {{on the development of}} civil society, economic interaction and the specific issue of gender in the crossborder relationship network. Crossborder cooperation in this respect has been understood as subject to changing political constellation and rhetoric, involving considerable tension between inclusion, or Neighbourhood (the European Union's efforts to integrate its wider neighbourhood in various forms of political and economic partnership) and exclusion, or Fortress Europe (the increasing securitisation of Europe's external borders {{in order to protect the}} community from unregulated flows of goods and people) [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Under the Hammer Flag: The Norwegian labor movement’s {{development}} of rhetorical {{literature in the}} 1930 s. This thesis has six chapters: Chapter 1 is an analysis of two contextual issues that define Arbeiderpartiets, The Norwegian Labor Party’s, pre- 1933 rhetorical framework. The first issue deals with educating the working class in general, especially the labor movement’s elected officials. Unions and local party chapters raised funds to establish socialist evening schools where among other subjects students were taught applied rhetoric and agitation. The second issue concerns the 1920 s revolutionary core of The Norwegian Labor Party. In the early 1930 s the party shed its revolutionary rhetoric and developed a pragmatic political and rhetorical platform, suitable for a parliamentary system. In this way, the party sought to include voter cohorts outside the industrial working class, its original key membership. Chapter 2 deals with the “crowd” or “masses,” the latter a metaphor coined by late 19 th century sociologists. The term and phenomenon drew from Darwinism, the “new science psychology” and its related fields: “social psychology,” “proletarian psychology” and “working class psychology. ” Labor party strategists feared crowd behavior and crowd attitudes. Most private citizens {{were not interested in}} political issues and might be likely it was feared they could come to support extreme right wing parties who also claimed the working class for themselves. In popular culture, {{as well as in the}} political discourse of the times, “mass” was mistakenly, but often synonymously used with “working class,” or at least the low end of the socioeconomic hierarchy. Spanish José Ortega y Gasset claimed that the term potentially included members from all walks of life. Most period historians study links between propaganda as used in the USSR and Nazi Germany and the smaller scale political propaganda used in Scandinavia. This study also focuses on the American sources of political propaganda. Towards the end of World War I, White House officials developed a comprehensive propaganda campaign to rally popular support for U. S. intervention on behalf of the Allies. I therefore analyze relevant American propaganda practices, in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 ’s main focus is on psychology applied in academic works that influence the contemporary political discourse. Three German language works, each quite different, triggered interest in the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> <b>communities.</b> De Man’s critique of Marxists, not Marx or socialism, and Hetzer’s heartbreaking reports from Viennese working quarters raised interest in the labor movement, as did Alf Ahlberg’s denotative adoption of Werner Sombart’s sarcastic account of the phenomenon he called “proletarian socialism. ” The two last chapters, 5 and 6, focus on handbooks and articles written by key labor movement officials to help refine persuasive power through speaker eloquence and rhetorical delivery. The terms “agitation” and “propaganda” are crucial. The 1930 s labor movement rhetoric began with “agitation”: factual and informative argumentation for party politics. Officials worried, rightfully so, that agitators were preaching into thin air, as the general electoral public was disinterested in politics. To catch their attention, enter propaganda, with German-inspired slogans, one-liners and entertainment-style rallies that stirred audience emotions and persuaded the electorate to cast their votes for The Norwegian Labor Party. </p...|$|R

This paper responds to this challenge by providing a heuristic device for delineating Settler and Indigenous Australian political ontologies and considering their interaction. It first evokes Settler and Aboriginal ontologies as respectively biopolitical (focused through life) and terrapolitical (focused through land). These ideal types help to identify important differences that inform current governance challenges. The paper discusses the entwinement of these traditions as a story of biopolitical dominance wherein Aboriginal people are governed as an “included-exclusion ” within the Australian <b>political</b> <b>community.</b> Despite the overall pattern of dominance, this same entwinement offers possibilities for exchange between biopolitics and terrapolitics, and hence for breaking the recurrent crises of Indigenous affairs...|$|R
