5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' {{and in the}} thick of the fighting, rather than in the rout that later followed.|$|E
5|$|Romanus {{died before}} 627, {{probably}} about 625. He {{drowned in the}} Mediterranean Sea off Italy while {{on a mission to}} Rome for Justus. Presumably this happened before Justus' death in 627. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dead by 633, when Paulinus of York became bishop at Rochester after fleeing Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> supportive of the sport.|$|E

5|$|John Komnenos was {{a rather}} {{unimportant}} figure in the court, and in a marginal note dating to the late 13th century, Alexios Doukas Mourtzouphlos, who briefly became emperor during Constantinople's final siege by the Fourth Crusade, was named as the real mastermind behind the coup. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> supported by a wider circle of nobles from the Komnenian era, possibly even the brothers Alexios Komnenos and David Komnenos, who later founded the Empire of Trebizond. Thus the historian Michael Angold traces the coup's inception {{to the events of}} early 1199, when Alexios III married his two daughters Irene and Anna to Alexios Palaiologos and Theodore Laskaris respectively. This marriage not only spoke of increasing confidence for the Emperor, but also provided for the imperial succession and began the establishment of a separate aristocratic power-base, which must have displeased many noble families.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} these {{so-called}} Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{on the side}} of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the most experienced of the earls, and took on a modifying role in the group. Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir, was the king's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, but at this point he took a less active part in the reform movement. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> the most aggressive. The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king's financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers. It alsoonce moreordered Gaveston to be exiled, to return only at the risk of excommunication.|$|E
5|$|Ailred of Rievaulx, a near-contemporary chronicler, {{recorded}} Edmund's {{marriage to}} {{the daughter of a}} Hungarian king, but omitted to mention the name of the king {{and the name of the}} daughter. This could not have been a daughter of King Stephen, although a sister of King Samuel Aba, as well as any other princess of the huge Árpád dynasty is a possible candidate. It is possible that Edmund's wife was named Hedwig. Edmund died shortly after the marriage, possibly during the military campaign of Andrew of Hungary in 1046. The Crowland Psalter records that Edmund died on 10 January, but not the year; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> dead by 1054, when only Edward was recalled to England by the princes' uncle, King Edward the Confessor. The king wanted to appoint his nephew as his heir, however Edward died soon after his arrival in London. With the death of Edward's son, Edgar the Ætheling (who had been proclaimed king in 1066 but was forced to swear allegiance to William the Conqueror and renounce his rights), around 1126, the male line of the House of Wessex died out. Edmund was buried in Hungary, however the exact location of his grave is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Exactly when Mellitus and {{his party}} arrived in England is unknown, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> in the country by 604, when Augustine consecrated him as bishop in the {{province}} of the East Saxons, making Mellitus the first Bishop of London after the Roman departure (London was the East Saxons' capital). The city was a logical choice for a new bishopric, as it was a hub for the southern road network. It was also a former Roman town; many of the Gregorian mission's efforts were centred in such locations. Before his consecration, Mellitus baptised Sæberht, Æthelberht's nephew, who then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht. Although Bede records that Æthelberht gave lands to support the new episcopate, a charter that claims to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a later forgery.|$|E

25|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Christopher's early life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> an adult by 919–920, and had a {{daughter}} of marriageable age in 927, hence he was probably born around 890–895. Already before his father's rise to power, he had been married to Sophia, {{the daughter of the}} wealthy patrikios Niketas, a Slav from the Peloponnese.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{his contemporaries}} at Princeton, and {{perhaps due to}} his invalid wife, Warfield never cared much for churchmanship.

25|$|We do {{not know}} the precise year in which Fearchar died. The {{traditional}} date, 1251, is based on the date given in the spurious Ane Breve Cronicle of the Erllis of Ross.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that Nyren was the player recorded as Nyland of Sussex who played for All-England against Dartford in 1759. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> living in Sussex in 1758, as he married that year at Slindon, and was not definitely resident at Hambledon until 1762.

25|$|The {{separation}} of the fourth book from the third has no ancient authority. It dates from the revival of letters, and {{is due to the}} Italian scholars of the 15th century. The fourth book consists of poems of very different quality. The first is a composition in 211 hexameters on the achievements of Messalla, and is very poor. The author is unknown; but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> not Tibullus. The poem itself was written in 31, the year of Messalla's consulship.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} that the Rescript was sent, Honorius was holed up in Ravenna by the Visigoths and was unable to prevent their Sack of Rome (410). <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> in no {{position}} to offer any relief to anyone. As for Constantine III, he was not equal to the intrigues of imperial Rome and by 411 his cause was spent.

25|$|Hillyard's {{relationship}} to the En-tout-cas company throughout the years is somewhat diffuse.

In 1929, when being involved in the construction of a golf course – a job which was given to En-tout-cas on Hillyard's recommendation –, he eventually disclosed that he was a director of En-tout-cas, thus obviously receiving income from the company.|$|E
