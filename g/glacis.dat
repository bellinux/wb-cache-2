5|$|The British {{also built}} three emplacements for breech-loading (BL) {{guns on the}} fort's <b>glacis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The outworks are {{surrounded}} by a ditch, a covertway and a <b>glacis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The caponier (rifle gallery) extends {{into the}} ditch between the rampart and <b>glacis</b> from the fort's north west corner. It is {{connected}} to the fort via a tunnel, running under the rampart from the manning parade. For blast protection and defensibility the tunnel was built with a dogleg. The caponier has rifle firing ports and was originally protected from direct artillery fire by the <b>glacis.</b> Early plans showed the caponier extending from the fort's south west, and a tunnel linking the magazine and southern guns.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{parts of}} the covertway and <b>glacis</b> were {{destroyed}} {{to make way for}} large storage tanks. Today, the lines are still more or less intact, but some parts are in a rather dilapidated state and in need of restoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{modifications}} were made between 1870 and 1875, {{when some of}} the parapets with embrasures were demolished to make way for emplacements for RML 9 inch 12 ton guns. The remainder of the fort underwent further significant changes over the following years. In the 1880s, the British considered demolishing the fort and replacing it with a larger fortification, but in 1888 it was proposed that instead of demolition, the height of the ramparts should be reduced {{to the level of the}} <b>glacis.</b> In the 1890s, gun emplacements for breech-loading (BL) guns were built on the <b>glacis,</b> while further modifications were made when parts of the structure were converted to gun crew accommodation or magazines.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, the {{development}} company MIDI plc began restoration {{work on the}} fort. Phase One of the project, which included {{the restoration of the}} piazza and the reconstruction of the ruined chapel, was completed in 2009. The second phase, including the restoration of the outer fortifications and <b>glacis,</b> was approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in 2012. The restoration of Fort Manoel together with that of the nearby Fort Tigné cost a total of €30 million.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th and 18th centuries, Valletta's fortifications were {{strengthened}} {{with the}} construction of various outworks, consisting of four counterguards along the land front, as well as a covertway and a <b>glacis.</b> The northern end of the peninsula, including Fort St. Elmo, was also enclosed in a bastioned enceinte (known as the Carafa Enceinte) in the late 1680s to prevent a landing from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Many of the fortifications at {{sea level}} have survived, though not always in their {{original}} condition. A substantial number have been built over. The Inundation was drained after World War II {{and is now the}} site of the Laguna Estate, named after the Inundation's lagoon. The <b>glacis</b> was likewise used as the foundations of the <b>Glacis</b> Estate. The flat ground of the retired batteries made them prime building spots during Gibraltar's post-war building boom, thus many of them have disappeared under recent developments. The city walls have almost entirely survived and are progressively being cleared of modern structures to restore them to something more like their original appearance. However, they are no longer at the water's edge due to extensive land reclamation. Various parts of the fortifications have been converted to civilian use. After being used for some years as a hostel for Moroccan migrant workers, the Grand Casemates Barracks have been renovated and converted into restaurants and shops. An electricity generating station was built inside the King's Bastion in the 1960s but has since been demolished and the bastion has been converted into a leisure centre.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, the Tigné Point {{peninsula}} is being redeveloped by MIDI plc. The British barracks were demolished, and high-rise apartments were built instead. In 2008, MIDI plc also restored the fort {{as part of}} the project. The alterations made by the British, such as the BL gun emplacements, were also repaired, while landscaped gardens and walkways were built on the <b>glacis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The outworks are {{surrounded}} by a faussebraye, advanced ditch, covertway, and <b>glacis.</b> In the 1720s, a gate known as Porta dei Cannoni {{was built in the}} faussebraye. The gate was enlarged by the British, and became known as Porte des Bombes. It was eventually detached from the faussebraye to facilitate the flow of traffic, and it now looks like a triumphal arch.|$|E
5|$|Work on Valperga's {{modifications}} to the lines progressed slowly, and {{by the beginning of}} the 18th century the outworks, <b>glacis</b> and enceinte facing Marsamxett were still unfinished. Works continued under a number of other engineers, including Charles François de Mondion, and the lines were largely complete when Porte des Bombes was constructed in 1721. Further alterations were made over the following decades, such as the construction of the Northern Entrenchment in the 1730s.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{primarily}} {{used as a}} prison during the interregnum and {{the early days of}} the Restoration. Concerns about a potential Dutch attack grew, however, and in 1665 King Charles II commissioned his Dutch-born master engineer, Sir Bernard de Gomme, to carry out a major scheme to improve the defences of Portsmouth, including Southsea Castle. Funding and poor organisation meant that the work did not begin until the 1680s. It included constructed an earthwork <b>glacis</b> around the castle; a new castle gate; four projecting turrets; and a redesign of the central keep. A large, stone plaque above the gatehouse entrance, bearing Charles' coat of arms, is dated 1683.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or lunette. The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and <b>glacis</b> (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels have been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a ground survey was carried out as well to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective <b>glacis</b> was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded, but the lake would turn it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the <b>glacis</b> plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority {{announced}} the probable {{discovery of the}} Acra. According to archaeologists Doron Ben-Ami, Yana Tchekhanovets and Salome Cohen, excavating the Givati parking lot adjacent to the City of David, they had unearthed a complex of rooms and fortified walls they identified as the Acra. This places it slightly south of previous suggested locations on the Ophel. Finds include fortification walls, a watchtower measuring 4 by 20 meters, and a <b>glacis.</b> Bronze arrowheads, lead sling-stones and ballista stones were unearthed at the site, stamped with a trident, the emblem of Antiochus IV Epiphanes. These are indicative of the military nature of the site and the efforts to take it. The excavation also yielded coins from the reigns of Antiochus IV through Antiochus VII, {{as well as a}} multitude of stamped Rhodian amphora handles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, low-lying casemates {{were added to}} the western and southwestern {{curtains}} to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The building technique used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and technical expertise. Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a <b>glacis</b> built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected during this phase, likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The Leopard2E {{is a major}} {{improvement}} over the M60 Patton tank, which it replaced in Spain's mechanized and armored units. Its development represented a total of 2.6million man-hours worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 2.4billion euros. This makes {{it one of the}} most expensive Leopard 2s built. Indigenous production amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at Sevilla by Santa Bárbara Sistemas. It has thicker armor on the turret and <b>glacis</b> plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank command and control system, similar to the one fitted in German Leopard 2s. The Leopard2E is expected to remain in service until 2025.|$|E
5|$|The Wheatcroft Collection, Leicestershire, UK. A private collector, Kevin Wheatcroft, {{is about}} to start a restoration/rebuild of a {{complete}} Tiger II. The project will include parts from many individual Tiger IIs, but many parts will be of new manufacture. Wheatcroft has stated that he has 70–80% of the original parts needed for a reconstruction and more parts are sourced continuously. Known and shown parts are a complete front <b>glacis</b> plate, 8.8 cm KwK 43 main armament, engine deck plates, approx. 1/3 hull (rear) in one part, a set of tracks, and approx. 2/3 of the left-side hull plate in two parts. The aim of the project is a complete Tiger II in running order.|$|E
5|$|A major {{restoration}} of Mdina's fortifications was {{undertaken in the}} 1720s by the French military engineer Charles François de Mondion, during the magistracy of António Manoel de Vilhena. L'Isle-Adam's palace, including the remaining parts of the Castellu di la Chitati, were demolished {{to make way for}} Palazzo Vilhena, while the main gate was walled up and a new city gate was built in the Baroque style. A Baroque portal was also added to the Greeks Gate. The remaining medieval towers in the land front were demolished and the Torre dello Standardo was built {{on the site of the}} Turri Mastra, while the entire western walls of the city were demolished to make way for a single casemated curtain wall known as Magazine Curtain. D'Homedes Bastion was modified with the addition of a bastionette, while traverse-like batteries were built at the extremities of the land front. The city was further protected with the construction of outworks, including a covertway, two places-of-arms and a <b>glacis.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13thcentury, new walls {{surrounding}} the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, {{with a narrow}} gap between them {{in the west and}} south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping <b>glacis</b> which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{had only}} {{relatively}} thin crenelated walls, which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments. They {{were lined with}} many tall towers for archers, but {{could not be used}} to mount cannon. Don Luis Bravo de Acuña, the governor of Gibraltar, produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory's fortifications. A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall, each named after saints, and a New Mole (later renamed the South Mole) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour. On the north side of Gibraltar, the Muralla de San Bernando (now the Grand Battery) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions. The Old Mole, stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar, provided further mountings for cannon to sweep the isthmus. A series of defensive works constructed on a <b>glacis</b> above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire. A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Señora del Rosario ("Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary"), and now as the South Bastion, it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa, now the Southport Gates. However, the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide enough troops to man them.|$|E
25|$|T-72A obr.1979g: Additional <b>glacis</b> armour with {{thickness}} of 17mm of high resistance steel.|$|E
25|$|T-55T - Modified VT-55A with {{push bar}} and splashboard across <b>glacis</b> plate in service with the NVA.|$|E
25|$|A boxy, boat-shaped vehicle, the EE-9 Cascavel has a steep frontal <b>glacis</b> which slopes upwards {{and back}} towards the {{horizontal}} hull roof, with recesses for the headlamps and a thick <b>glacis</b> plate over the driver's seat. The hull sides are nearly vertical, but also sloped inwards towards the roof. There is a low, well-rounded turret on the forward section of the hull with a long, tapered gun barrel and a triple baffle muzzle brake.|$|E
25|$|T-55T with {{towing unit}} on the <b>glacis</b> {{plate with a}} mount that {{protrudes}} over front of vehicle. Front towing unit also has a flexible 'eye' permanently fitted. NATO code: T-55T.|$|E
25|$|T-72M1 (Ob'yekt 172M-E5) – This export {{version of}} the T-72A was also built by Martin. An {{external}} difference with the Soviet original is the reduced number of KMT mounts on the lower <b>glacis</b> plate.|$|E
25|$|The entire land {{front is}} {{surrounded}} by a rock-hewn ditch, which also includes a caponier and another battery. A covertway and <b>glacis</b> were also located close to the land front, but were mostly cleared away in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{could also}} be a source of income for the military: already under the French, the {{fortress}} authorities sold off the grazing rights on the grassy areas of the <b>Glacis.</b> Due to lax supervision of grazing, however, by 1814, some of the folds were no longer recognisable as such.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{started in}} September 1941 with {{a requirement for}} a close-support vehicle based upon the M3 Stuart's chassis, but {{it was made of}} a mild steel superstructure. A 75mm Pack Howitzer was mounted on the right of the <b>glacis</b> plate of the vehicle. The gun mount was modeled from the M3 Lee's 75mm gun's mount.|$|E
25|$|The driver’s {{work area}} {{is in the}} forward compartment. The driver's hatch {{is located in the}} <b>glacis</b> above his head. With the hatch sealed the driver {{operates}} using three periscopic visual devices, the middle of which is equipped with a night-vision infrared camera from the T161. Ammunition stores are located {{on either side of the}} driver’s chair.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep is protected by a drawbridge and a fortified inner gatehouse entrance with two portcullises with a killing area between them covered by three so-called murder holes, through which the defenders could attack any intruders trapped between the two portcullises. On {{either side of the}} gatehouse are located guard houses, which were converted into prison cells in the later history of the castle. When on duty, the garrison would spend most of its time in the gatehouses. Inside the gatehouse is a lower level with a tide mill for grinding corn. The castle also included a medieval chapel, housing Castle Rushen's clock mechanism. The still functioning Castle Rushen clock is a notable landmark in Castletown, having been presented by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1597, while she controlled the island during a dispute. The outer parts of the castle is protected by a moat and a <b>glacis,</b> with the <b>glacis</b> originally extending as far as the moat around the entire land front of Castle Rushen.|$|E
25|$|The fort {{includes}} more than two kilometers of underground passages added between 1852 and 1860, with ceilings six meters thick. The fort was upgraded after the Franco-Prussian War {{as part of the}} Séré de Rivières program. A police barracks now occupies the former ditch on the west side, while a variety of buildings occupy the former <b>glacis.</b> The former casemates, barracks and magazine have been redeveloped as offices.|$|E
25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the city {{developed}} what had previously been the bastions and <b>glacis</b> into the Ringstraße, a new boulevard surrounding the historical town and a major prestige project. Former suburbs were incorporated, and the city of Vienna grew dramatically. In 1918, after World War I, Vienna became capital of the Republic of German-Austria, and then in 1919 of the First Republic of Austria.|$|E
25|$|A special Panzerkommision {{arrived on}} the Eastern Front on 20 November 1941 to assess the T-34. The Weapons Department held that Germany would have {{difficulty}} copying the T-34 as Guderian had suggested, because of the quantity of steel alloy and diesel engines required. Hence a new German medium tank was proposed, incorporating three features of the T-34: a long overhanging gun, good off-road mobility from large tracks, and sloped <b>glacis</b> armour to give greater protection with a modest thickness of armour.|$|E
25|$|Some men who {{had escaped}} from the fort {{informed}} the British of the mutiny. The Royal Maltese Regiment and the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot took positions on the <b>glacis</b> of the fort, while the guns of Fort Saint Elmo and Fort Saint Angelo were trained on Ricasoli. In a message, the mutineers demanded to be discharged and to be sent home, with money and a pardon from Villettes. They threatened to open fire on Valletta, but Villettes refused their demands and ordered them to surrender.|$|E
