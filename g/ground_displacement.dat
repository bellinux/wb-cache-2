The hospital buildings, the freeway overpasses, and the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility were situated on coarse alluvium that overlaid thousands of feet of loosely consolidated sedimentary material.

The paper discusses: (1) observed <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> after the earthquake, (2) the results of field investigations by means of borings and in situ index tests, including standard penetration tests, static cone penetration tests, and piezocone tests, (3) analyses of expected lateral displacements using two empirical models and one semiempirical model, and (4) comparisons between observed and calculated lateral ground movements. The three models provide inconsistent predictions of observed lateral <b>ground</b> <b>displacements,</b> with one method overpredicting and two methods both overpredicting and underpredicting observed lateral <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> by large amounts. Thus, it appears {{that there is a need}} for improved engineering tools for prediction of small to moderately significant lateral <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> (lateral displacements of approximately 0. 1 – 2. 5 m) at soil sites with similar ground characteristics to the case history sites presented herein...|$|R

The network consists of 7 benchmarks distributed along the main distensive fault system on the SW margin of a regional graben-shaped tectonic feature that trends in an Apenninic direction. Measurements on the network were conducted both by conventional geodetic instrumentation (EDMs, thedolites and levels) and by GPS satellite techniques. Both the expected and observed <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> have been very small so far, so that very precise techniques are required to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Various measurement techniques and procedures have been tested, in order to compare the experimental results. The difference between the values measured permits us to evaluate the deformation field. Horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> of about 1 cm per year have been detected. The analysis and the comparison between methodologies and results are the aims of this paper...|$|R

2500|$|Differential ground {{motion and}} strong shaking (MMI VIII (Severe)) was {{responsible}} for serious damage to the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility and the Sylmar Converter Station (both located close to the Upper Van Norman lake). The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, {{as well as the}} County of Los Angeles, investigated and verified that local soil conditions contributed to the <b>ground</b> <b>displacement</b> and resulting destruction.

The two facilities, located near Grapevine and Weldon canyons that channel water and debris off the Sierra Madre Mountains, are lined by steep ridges and have formed alluvial fans at their mouths. The narrow band of ground disturbances were found to have been the result of settling of the soft soil in a downhill motion. Soil liquefaction played a role within confined areas of the slide, but it was not responsible for all the motion at the site, and tectonic slip of faults in the area was also excluded as a cause.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of potential for building damage due to <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> caused by tunnelling {{is a global}} issue being faced by engineers. There is a two-way interaction between tunnelling and existing buildings; tunnel construction affects a building by inducing displacements in the soil underlying its foundation, and buildings influence tunnelling induced displacements via their weight and stiffness. Numerical analyses are widely used to investigate tunnelling {{and its impact on}} structures, however numerically predicted <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> are generally wider and shallower than those observed in practice. This paper presents a two-stage mixed empirical-numerical technique to estimate the effect of building stiffness on <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> due to tunnelling. In the first stage, greenfield soil displacements are applied to the soil model and the nodal reaction forces are recorded. In the second stage, the effect of tunnelling on a structure is evaluated by applying the recorded nodal reactions to an undeformed mesh. Results from conventional numerical analyses of the problem are compared against those obtained using the mixed empirical-numerical approach. Results demonstrate the importance of imposing realistic inputs of greenfield displacements when evaluating structural response to tunnelling...|$|R

The fault's total visible distance is little more than 9 km, but is of great interest to geologists as it has a right-angle bend in its middle part, rather than being straight or at a gentle curve. It is also remarkable in that <b>ground</b> <b>displacement</b> at the fault is up to one meter in places; however, the Tokaido Railway Line, although only 150 meters from the fault line in places, suffered no damage.|$|E
40|$|Single-phase and {{two-phase}} geothermal reservoirs {{are currently}} being exploited for power production in Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, the U. S. and elsewhere. Vertical <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> of upto 4. 5 m and horizontal <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> of up t o 0. 5 m have been observed at Wairakei, New Zealand that are clearly attributable to the resource exploitation. Similarly, vertical displacements of about 0. 13 m have been recorded at The Geysers, California. No significant <b>ground</b> <b>displacements</b> that are attributable to large-scale fluid production have been observed at Larderello, Italy and Cerro Prieto, Mexico. Observations show that subsidence due to geothermal fluid production is characterized by such features as an offset of the subsidence bowl from the main area of production, time-lag between production and subsidence and nonlinear stress-strain relationships. Several plausible conceptual models, of varying degrees of sophistication, have been proposed to explain the observed features. At present, relatively more {{is known about the}} physical mechanisms that govern subsidence than the relevant therma mechanisms.
