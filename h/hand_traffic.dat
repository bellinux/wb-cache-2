The HIV/AIDS pandemic can be both a cause and a consequence of sex <b>trafficking.</b> On one <b>hand,</b> child-prostitutes are sought by customers because they are perceived as being less likely to be HIV positive, and this demand leads to child sex trafficking. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>trafficking</b> leads to the proliferation of HIV, because victims, being vulnerable and often young/inexperienced, cannot protect themselves properly, and get infected.|$|R
50|$|A {{cloverleaf}} interchange {{is typically}} a two-level, four-way interchange where all turns across opposing traffic are handled by non-directional loop ramps. Assuming right <b>handed</b> <b>traffic,</b> to go left vehicles first cross over {{or under the}} target route, then bear right onto a sharply curved ramp that turns roughly 270 degrees, merging onto the target route from the right, and crossing the route just departed. These loop ramps produce the namesake cloverleaf shape.|$|R

Its peak haulage, on the then still extensive route network, was almost 732 million passengers, in 1943. That year, 18,000 people found work on Vienna's tramways.|$|E

50|$|The second {{national}} Swedish referendum {{was held}} on 16 October 1955. The two alternatives were to either switch to driving on the right or keep left hand driving. Voter turnout was 53.2%, and 82.9% of the votes {{were in favor of}} keeping left hand driving. Only 15.5% voted for switching to right <b>hand</b> <b>traffic.</b> 1.6% of the votes were blank votes. The Riksdag later decided to introduce right <b>hand</b> <b>traffic</b> contrary to the outcome. A bill to this effect was passed in 1963 and the switch took place on 3 September 1967 (Dagen H). The referendum was not binding and it was not stipulated on the ballot how long left hand driving should be kept.|$|E

50|$|Organized as an Iowa {{corporation}} on February 12, 1881, {{the railroad}} was built with 113 mi of track. It had 18 locomotives on its roster as it started operations, and by 1898 the H&S listed 14 locomotives. Most original H&S locomotives were 4-4-0s {{built by the}} Pittsburgh Locomotive Co. The H&S track was built connecting Humeston, Iowa westward to Shenandoah, Iowa. To the east it <b>handed</b> <b>traffic</b> off to the MI&N and, later, to the Keokuk and Western Railroad, successor to the MI&N. The H&S had enough business and was doing well enough to be acquired outright by the Burlington Route in 1901. Primary traffic {{on the line in}} the early 1900s was bituminous coal mined in southern Iowa, grains, cattle and livestock, less-than-carload merchandise, and timber products. The railroad also had a considerable passenger business up until about 1920.|$|R

40|$|Real-time object {{tracking}} {{has become}} a very important task for {{a large number of}} computer vision and robotic applications. The tracking function must be robust, de-spite of the high complexity present in a given environ-ment. Frequently, the object to be tracked is well known (humans, head, <b>hands,</b> <b>traffic</b> signs, etc.). Shape con-straints can be introduced directly in energy formulation, or can be defined as deformable templates. Both of them have shown very good results in object segmentation, but sometimes they are so complex that real-time tracking computation is almost impossible. In this paper, we pro-pose definitions of basics shape constraints for active contours to be used in real-time tracking. Constraints are easily incorporated and do not affect the complexity of the dynamic programming method used for solving it, thanks that they are applied locally. Our main interest is to im-prove the tracking robustness using these constraints, for robot navigation and human-robot interaction. An appli-cation for landmark tracking is presented: landmarks are quadrangular and planar objects (typically, posters). Index Terms: Model-based active contours, dynami...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the normal}} cross slope and the {{interaction}} with grade, road sections with insufficient drainage gradient are few and short. Still, they account for an unacceptable number of skid accidents. These hot spots are found at the entrances and exits of banked curves, where the cross slope changes direction {{in order to create}} superelevation. As the outside edge of the curve is raised (or superelevated) to create the bank, it passes through a point where the cross slope is absolutely flat. If there is not enough longitudinal grade, water will collect at these spots. This takes place at the beginnings and ends of curves to the left in countries with right <b>hand</b> <b>traffic,</b> and curves to the right in countries with left <b>hand</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

40|$|This book {{is written}} in {{reaction}} to, on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>trafficking</b> and smuggling discourses in Europe, and, {{on the other hand}} to the strong belief in the possibilities of bushfalling in Cameroon. Tensions between ambitions for mobility and imposed immobility are reflected in the way that Anglophone Cameroonians have started since the late 1990 s to refer to emigration in Pidgin as ‘bushfalling’. Bushfalling is the act of going out to the wilderness (bush) to hunt down meat (money) and bring back these trophies. On the basis of an ethnographic study of migration brokers, consulate officers, aspiring migrants and their families, as well as deported migrants, this research investigates what makes young Cameroonians migrate at all cost. The books argues that we can only come to understand dynamics of trafficking and bushfalling if we take seriously the perspectives of people in countries of departure, as well as the plurality of regulatory dynamics that shape conditions of departure. By studying rather than presupposing the place of state, market and family actors within conditions of departure, this study unravels how the phenomena of bushfalling and trafficking do not exist merely because individuals chose to migrate at all cost...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a real-time industrial communication network {{able to support}} both controlrelated and multimedia traffic. The industrial communication network {{is based on the}} PROFIBUS standard, with multimedia capabilities being provided by an adequate integration of TCP/IP protocols into the PROFIBUS stack. From the operational point of view the integration of TCP/IP into PROFIBUS is by itself a challenge, since the master-slave nature of the PROFIBUS MAC makes complex the implementation of the symmetry inherent to IP communications. From the timeliness point of view the challenge is two folded. On one <b>hand</b> the multimedia <b>traffic</b> should not interfere with the timing requirements of the "native" control-related PROFIBUS traffic (typically hard real-time). On the other <b>hand</b> multimedia <b>traffic</b> requires certain levels of quality-of-service to be attained. In this paper we provide a methodology that enables fulfilling the timing requirements for both types of traffic in these real-time industrial LAN. Moreover, we describe suitable algorithms for the scheduling support of concurrent multimedia streams...|$|R

50|$|The Feather River Route {{parallels}} the Overland Route in central Nevada between Weso (near Winnemucca) and Alazon (near Wells). The Southern Pacific Railroad and Western Pacific {{came to a}} shared trackage agreement to use directional running. Eastbound trains of both companies used the tracks for the Feather River Route while westbound trains used the Overland Route. In the shared track area, the tracks mostly run {{on opposite sides of}} the Humboldt River; at some points the two lines are several miles apart. Crossovers were constructed where the lines run in close proximity to allow bi-directional service to the areas previously only accessible from one of the lines, such as Battle Mountain. There is a grade separated crossover of the two lines in the shared track area near Palisade, Nevada. This results in trains following right <b>hand</b> <b>traffic</b> in the eastern half of the shared track area, but left <b>hand</b> <b>traffic</b> in the western half.|$|E
