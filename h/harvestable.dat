It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|The {{brunt of}} the {{tropical}} cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240people were killed {{as a result of}} the storm, with 5,708in Bangladesh and 538in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all <b>harvestable</b> Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000tonnes (220,000tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages.|$|E
5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet.

25|$|Aquaculture {{production}} of C. matthewsi sponges was {{undertaken by the}} Marine and Environmental Research Institute of Pohnpei (MERIP), to try and generate a sustainable income for local community residents with few options to earn money. The sponges take approximately two years to reach <b>harvestable</b> size, with free divers routinely removing seaweed and biofouling agents by hand. These sponges are processed through natural processes, where they are left to air dry and then placed in baskets {{and returned to the}} lagoon where they were grown. This process removes all the organic matter within the sponge leaving behind the final bath sponge product. Further processing occurs by softening the sponge, but no bleaches, acids or colorants are used.|$|E
25|$|Blue crab populations {{naturally}} fluctuate {{with annual}} changes in environmental conditions. They {{have been described}} as having a long-term dynamic equilibrium, which was first noted after irregular landings data in the Chesapeake in 1950. This tendency may have made it difficult for managers to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake’s blue crab populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining blue crab population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and harvest weight fell from 52,000 tons (115,000,000 lbs) to 28,000 tons (62,000,000 lbs). Revenue fell further, from $72 million to $61 million. Long term estimates say that the overall Chesapeake population decreased approximately 70% in the last few decades. Even more alarming, the number of females capable of reproducing, known as spawning age females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the <b>harvestable</b> crab population is also low. Many factors are to blame for low blue crab numbers, including high fishing pressure, environmental degradation, and disease prevalence.|$|E
500|$|After the District Court {{issued its}} ruling, both sides {{submitted}} {{appeals to the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Washington argued that the district court had no power to invalidate state fishing regulations, while the tribes argued [...] "the state may not regulate their fishing activities at treaty locations for any reason". Writing {{for a majority of}} the court, Circuit Court Judge Herbert Choy affirmed Judge Boldt's opinion [...] "in all respects", but clarified that Judge Boldt's [...] "equitable apportionment" [...] of <b>harvestable</b> fish did not apply to [...] "fish caught by non-Washington citizens outside the state's jurisdiction".|$|E
500|$|The {{court held}} that, when the tribes {{conveyed}} {{millions of acres}} of land in Washington State through a series of treaties signed in 1854 and 1855, they reserved the right to continue fishing. The court looked at the minutes of the treaty negotiations to interpret the meaning of the treaty language [...] "in common with" [...] as the United States described it to the Tribes, holding that the United States intended for there to be an equal sharing of the fish resource between the Tribes and the settlers. As the court stated, the phrase means [...] "sharing equally the opportunity to take fish ... therefore, nontreaty fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to 50% of the <b>harvestable</b> number of fish ... and treaty right fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to the same percentage". The formula used by Boldt gave the tribes forty-three percent (43%) of the Puget Sound harvest, which was equivalent to eighteen percent (18%) of the statewide harvest. The order required the state to limit the amount of fish taken by non-Indian commercial fishermen, causing a drop in their income from about $15,000–20,000 to $500–2,000.|$|E

In Alvin, streets and low-lying areas were flooded, while several businesses and homes in Angleton received water damage. Rainfall totals of [...] in much of Harris County elevated a number of bayos and creeks, some of which exceeded their banks and forced the evacuation of hundreds of people. The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County suspended bus service for several hours, stranding approximately 80,000commuters. In Aldine, over 100students were required to stay at school until water on the streets could recede, while street flooding in Houston resulted in the cancellation of classes at University of Houston and Texas Southern University. Across the county, several dozen businesses, 1,250homes, and 1,000vehicles were damaged. Three injuries occurred after a woman and her two children were submerged by water while in a pickup truck. In Galveston County, several major streets in Galveston, Hitchcock, La Marque, and Texas City were flooded. Dozens of dwellings in low-lying areas of La Marque and Texas City received extensive water damage, including 100in the latter. The La Marque City Hall was also damaged. In Galveston, flooding primarily affected the first floor of buildings damaged by the tornado. State Highway 6, a major route to the city, was inundated at Interstate 45. Throughout Texas, damage exceeded $56.2million.|$|E
2500|$|European {{settlers}} {{had cleared}} {{much of the}} land for farming, but this led to significant erosion on the steep slopes. [...] The state forestry division had been planting nonnative as well as native trees to curtail the erosion and produce <b>harvestable</b> timber. [...] Under the Division of Parks and Recreation, the plantations of nonnatives like red pine went against the policy of restoring a natural habitat. [...] As a compromise, the nonnative trees are being harvested as they reach maturity and are being replaced with more appropriate vegetation.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{the salmon}} are hatched in {{land-based}} hatcheries (several [...] of which exist) {{and transferred to}} sea cages or freshwater farms, where they are grown out to <b>harvestable</b> size of [...] The broodstock for the farms is usually selected from existing farm stock or sometimes sourced from wild populations.

After hatching, the baby salmon are typically grown to smolt stage (around six-months of age) before they are transferred to the sea cages or ponds. Most sea cage farming occurs in the Marlborough Sounds, Stewart Island, and Akaroa Harbour, while freshwater operations in Canterbury, Otago, and Tasman use ponds, raceways, and hydrocanals for growout operations.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of the world’s first mechanical harvesting tomato wasn’t Hanna’s only contribution to tomato production. With the <b>harvestable</b> tomato in hand, in 1961 he teamed up with UC Davis agricultural engineer Coby Lorenzen (who also won the John Scott Award in 1976) to develop a harvester to reap the hardier variety of tomato. Engineering the equipment was no small challenge because tomato harvesting requires multiple functions, including cutting and lifting the vines, then separating the tomatoes from the vines. During the 1950s, the UC Davis team refined the experimental harvester and in 1959 convinced a California company, Blackwelder Manufacturing, to commercialize the design. Within three years of its introduction, the proportion of California's tomato acreage planted with mechanically <b>harvestable</b> tomatoes rose from 7 percent to 85 percent.|$|E
