Lisa Dombrowski, the author of The Films of Samuel Fuller: <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Die,</b> I'll Kill You! and {{an associate professor of}} film studies at Wesleyan University, referred to the film as [...] "an impassioned attack on racial hatred."

How do you fight a Jew? You kill a Jew. In the case of Hindus, by bombing their businesses." ...|$|E
