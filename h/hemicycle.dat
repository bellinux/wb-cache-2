5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a <b>hemicycle</b> according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg <b>hemicycle</b> roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The <b>hemicycle</b> design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E

Due to the new members, the Parliament needed a larger <b>hemicycle</b> to hold debates, and more offices for MEPs. Prior to this, Parliament shared the facilities of the Council of Europe, who had built a <b>hemicycle</b> in their headquarters: the Palace of Europe.

Finally, at Hagia Sophia (6th century) a combination was made which {{is perhaps the most}} remarkable piece of planning ever contrived. A central space of 100ft (30 m) square is increased to 200ft (60 m) in length by adding two <b>hemicycles</b> to it to the east and the west; these are again extended by pushing out three minor apses eastward, and two others, one on either side of a straight extension, to the west. This unbroken area, about 260ft (80 m) long, the larger part of which is over 100ft (30 m) wide, is entirely covered by a system of domical surfaces. Above the conchs of the small apses rise the two great semi-domes which cover the <b>hemicycles,</b> and between these bursts out the vast dome over the central square. On the two sides, to the north and south of the dome, it is supported by vaulted aisles in two storeys which bring the exterior form to a general square.|$|R
5000|$|The {{project of}} {{reconstruction}} included a new library, {{on the east}} side of the Palace. The style was highly classical, and resembled that of the ancient Roman baths; pillars supported five cupolas, over a gallery closed by two semi-circulat bays. The lighting came from a recent innovation, skylights; it was later copied in the new National Library of France. The painter Eugene Delacroix was commissioned to paint the interior, a project which lasted from 1838 until 1846. Supported by a team of assistants, Delacroix painted the five cupolas and the two <b>hemicycles</b> of the library with a series of allegorical paintings on the themes of philosophy, natural history, legislation, eloquence, literature, poetry and theology; a panorama of all the aspects of civilization.|$|R

Correlation of these stacking patterns, and regional trends in buildup margin morphology, reveal {{a hierarchy of}} fifth, fourth, and third order sea-level changes driven by an allocyclic mechanism. The Caim Formation consists of shallowing upward <b>hemicycles</b> (fifth order). These are grouped into larger, broadly shallowing upward trends (fourth order). The Caim Formation and the overlying Peechee Member represent a single third order depositional sequence deposited during an overall period of sea-level rise. The dominantly retrograding buildup margins of the Peechee Member also reflect the influence of rising sea-level, punctuated by relative stillstands. Reciprocal siliciclastic basin sedimentation and buildup carbonate sedimentation characterized Peechee buildup margins.

40|$|Skeletal {{concentrations}} in mudstones may represent local facies produced by storm winnowing in shallow water, or time-specific deposits related to intervals of diminished sediment supply. Upper Ordovician (Katian) of the Cincinnati region {{is a mixed}} siliciclastic-carbonate succession including meter-scale cycles containing a shelly limestone-dominated phase and a mudstone-dominated phase. The “tempestite proximality model” asserts that shell-rich intervals originated by winnowing of mud from undifferentiated fair-weather deposits. Thus shell beds are construed as tempestites, while interbedded mudstones represent either fair-weather or bypassed mud. Meter-scale cycles are attributed to sea-level fluctuation or varying storm intensity. Alternatively, the “episodic starvation model” argues, {{on the basis of}} petrographic, taphonomic, and stratigraphic evidence, that, despite widespread evidence for storms or other turbulence events (e. g. tsunamis), winnowing alone could not generate shell beds where none had previously existed. Instead, variations in sediment supply are construed as the principal cause of shelly-mudstone cycles. Shell-rich deposits accrue during periods of siliciclastic sediment starvation and relatively shell-free mud accumulates during periods of sediment influx. Tempestite proximality and episodic starvation models lead to contrasting predictions about proximal-to-distal facies patterns. These are: (i) large versus small volumes of distally-deposited, bypassed mud; (ii) proximal grainstones and distal packstones versus distal grainstones and proximal packstones; and (iii) proximal versus distal amalgamation and condensation of shell beds. In this paper, these predictions are tested by (i) comparing meter-scale cycles from different horizons and depositional environments through the lower Cincinnatian succession (Kope through McMillan Formations representing deep subtidal through intertidal environments), and (ii) correlating intervals and individual meter-scale cycles from the Fairview Formation of the Cincinnati Arch (shallow subtidal) north and west into the Maquoketa Shale (deep subtidal) in subsurface of Ohio and Indiana. Both approaches show patterns consistent with episodic starvation, not winnowing, including: (i) small differences in stratigraphic thickness indicate small volumes of bypassed mud; (ii) discrete distal deep-water grainstones that splay proximally into bundles of thinner shallow-water packstones alternating with shelly muds show that grainstones formed from a lack of, rather than removal of mud; and (iii) distal shell bed amalgamation and condensation (and corresponding proximal splaying) of shell beds shows a proximal source of mud. Thus, winnowing by storms or other turbulence events did not generate shell beds or cycles from undifferentiated sediments despite abundant evidence for storm deposition. High-resolution correlations imply that the shell-bed and mud-bed <b>hemicycles</b> reflect simultaneous basin-wide changes in sedimentary style rather than contemporaneous facies belts that track sea-level.

40|$|The Gelasian {{succession}} of the Capodarso area (Enna-Caltanissetta basin, Sicily, Italy) {{consists of an}} offlapping stack of cycles composed of siliciclastic units passing to carbonate heterozoan, clino-stratified wedges, developed from a growing positive tectonic structure. Identification {{of a number of}} facies tracts, based on sedimentary facies, biofacies and taphofacies, provided important information about the differentiation and characterisation of systems tracts and key stratal surfaces of sequence stratigraphy. The bulk of carbonate wedges are interpreted as representing the rapid falling-stage progradation of distally steepened ramps. The inferred highest rate of carbonate production during forced regressions was concomitant with active downramp resedimentation by storm-driven downwelling flows, leading to storing of most carbonate sediment on the ramp slope as clino-beds of the prograding bodies. Comparison of the Capodarso ramps with other icehouse carbonate ramps, with particular regard to the Mediterranean Plio-Pleistocene, provides clues for defining some common features. These are inferred to include: (1) brief, rapid episodes of progradation concomitant with orbitally-forced sea-level changes, resulting in limited ramp width; (2) preferential fostering of growth and downramp resedimentation of heterozoan carbonates during glacial <b>hemicycles</b> marked by enhanced atmospheric and marine circulation; (3) building out from positive features of entirely submerged distally-steepened ramps with storm-wave-graded profile and distinctive clinoforms; (4) ramp stacks generally consisting of mixed clastic-carbonate sequences showing an ordered spectrum of distinct frequencies; (5) rapid, continuous changes in environmental parameters, leading to the short-lived persistence of faunal communities, climax communities generally having insufficient time to form.  </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{lower part}} of the St. George Group of western Newfoundland {{consists}} of Tremadocian shallow marine platform carbonates of the Boat Harbour (about 180 m thick) and the underlying Watts Bight (about 60 m thick) formations. In the Boat Harbour Formation, dolomitization is pervasive at the top of most shallowing-upward, metre-scale, peritidal <b>hemicycles.</b> Petrographic examination of the Boat Harbour Formation carbonates suggests that the succession has been affected by at least three phases of dolomitization, which influenced the final rock porosity. These phases have crystal-size ranges of about 4 to 40 μm (earliest dolomite D 1), 50 to 150 μm (D 2), and 300 μm to 20 mm (saddle dolomite D 3), respectively. They occur as both replacements and cements and exhibit dull (D 1 and D 3) to zoned (D 2) luminescence under the cold cathodoluminoscope. The occurrence of near-micritic size dolomites (about 4 – 40 μm) may suggest that dolomitization started at low temperatures during early stages of diagenesis. The lack of evaporite interbeds in the formation and the depleted δ 18 O values (– 6. 2 ± 0. 8 ‰ VPDB) as well as the low Sr contents (168 ± 45 ppm) of the earliest dolomites likely exclude a brine origin from evaporated seawater. The Sr/Ca molar ratios (0. 0069 to 0. 0017), calculated for the earliest dolomitizing fluid, suggest a mixture of marine and meteoric waters possibly in a mixing zone environment.

The ruined fountains seemed strangely to wait, in the stillness and under cover of the approaching dusk, not to begin ever again to play, also, but just only to be tenderly imagined to do so; quite as everything held its breath, at the mystic moment, for the drop of the cruel and garish exposure, for the Spirit of the place to steal forth and go his round.

It was in the flicker of fancy, no doubt, that as I hung about the great top-most terrace in especial, and then again took my way through the high gaunt corridors and the square and bare alcoved and recessed saloons, all overscored with such a dim waste of those painted, those delicate and capricious decorations which the loggie of the Vatican promptly borrowed from the ruins of the Palatine, or from whatever other revealed and inspiring ancientries, and which make ghostly confession here of that descent, I gave the rein to my sense of the sinister too, of that vague after-taste as of evil things that lurks so often, for a suspicious sensibility, wherever the terrible game {{of the life of the}} Renaissance was played as the Italians played it; wherever the huge tessellated chessboard seems to stretch about us; swept bare, almost always violently swept bare, of its chiselled and shifting figures, of every value and degree, but with this echoing desolation itself representing the long gasp, as it were, of overstrained time, the great after-hush that follows on things too wonderful or dreadful.|$|R
50|$|From {{an early}} {{point in his}} career Delville was {{interested}} in producing art that would be displayed in public spaces for the edification of all. For him, art was a means of uplifting the public, and to this end he despised art that was produced for an elite clique, sold by dealers {{for the benefit of}} collectors who saw in art no more than an investment opportunity. Delville's ideals were strongly aligned {{to the idea of a}} social purpose for art, about which he wrote extensively during his career. In his Mission de l'Art he wrote: 'If the purpose of Art, socially speaking, is not to spiritualise the weighted thinking of the public, then one has the right to ask oneself, what is truly its usefulness, or more precisely, its purpose'.Although he had already created several large artistic schemes that decorated public buildings, notably his panels for the Palais de Justice, his ambition formally to pursue this aim was finally realised in 1920 when he collaborated with several leading painters of his generation to create the Société de l'Art Monumental (Society for Monumental Art). The aim of the group was to bring together painters, artists and architects who would draw attention to the need for art specifically created for public buildings.An important realisation of this aim was the decoration of the walls in the colonnades of the <b>hemicycles</b> flanking the Arcade of the Parc du Cinquantenaire. Five artists collaborated with Delville on this project: Constant Montald, Emile Vloors, Omer Dierickx, Emile Fabry and Albert Ciamberlani. The last two were friends of Delville's since his days at the Academy and had collaborated on many project before. Most of these artists had also exhibited in Delville's Idealist forums, Pour L'Art and the Salons d'Art Idéaliste during the 1890s.The project went ahead under the patronage of King Albert I, and was paid for through a scheme of national subscription.The overall theme of this major cycle of works was a patriotic commemoration of 'The Glorification of Belgium' following the Great War through allegorical images relating to War and peace. In 1924 Delville expressed his idea for the cycle as a 'vision of a frieze in mosaic unfurling its rhythm of lines and its harmony of colours between the columns of the hemicycle' Each artist prepared six individual works (cartoons) that were then adapted to the final mosaics which were three metres high and aligned to the top part of the wall. The total distance of all the mosaics was 120 metres. An overall harmony of all the individual panels was achieved by ensuring that the artists adhered to a few common rules of composition: using the same horizon line, using the same scale for the figures, and adhering to a limited palette of related colours. The specific theme to the left of the arcade is that of Belgium at peace. Works by Fabry, Vloors and Montald represented respectively: the material life, intellectual life and moral life. The specific theme to the right side represent heroic Belgium, with works by Delville, Ciamberlani and Dierickx representing respectively: Victory, the Tribute to Heroes and War.The project was conceived between 1922 and 1926 and completed in 1932. The mosaics themselves were executed by Jean Lahaye and Emile Van Asbroeck of the company A Godchol.This monumental creation was a vindication of Idealist trends in art presented in a public space and gave his artistic perspective a wider visibility amongst the general public.Working towards the public good and alleviating the suffering of mankind was also a principle ideal of the Theosophists, an ideal to which Delville's subscribed throughout his life. Delville's Theosophical-socialist views were articulated in two articles his published before the War: Socialisme de demain (1912) and Du Principe sociale de l'Art (1913).|$|R
2500|$|In August 2012, the Paul-Henri Spaak {{building}} in Brussels which houses the <b>hemicycle</b> {{was found to}} be defective as well. Cracks in the beams that support the ceiling led to a security closure of at least six months, as announced by an estimate released on 9 October 2012 by the Parliament administration. This in turn led to a reshuffle of the Parliament's timetable. In early December 2012, it became known that the damage was more serious than previously thought, and that the closure of the <b>hemicycle</b> was expected to last [...] "until November 2013". All [...] "mini plenary" [...] meetings in Brussels until this date were scrapped, a decision that was met with [...] "fury" [...] by some MEPs. Since, as of December 2012, the European Parliament is [...] "having trouble" [...] finding a company to carry out the repair work, {{it is likely that the}} reopening of the Brussels <b>hemicycle</b> may take place only in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|McClellan Gate was {{rendered}} obsolete by 1932. Congress authorized {{construction of}} the Arlington Memorial Bridge in 1922. As part of the bridge project, Congress also approved a wide avenue known as Memorial Drive to link the bridge to the cemetery, and a new entrance to the cemetery (the [...] "Hemicycle") to replace the old entrance gates.

2500|$|Agreement {{remained}} {{elusive and}} a seat {{had to be}} found before the institutions could begin work, hence Luxembourg was chosen as a provisional seat, though with the Common Assembly in Strasbourg as {{that was the only}} city with a large enough <b>hemicycle</b> (the one used by the Council of Europe). This agreement was temporary, and plans were set to relocate the institutions to Saarbrücken which would serve as a [...] "European District", but this did not occur.|$|E
2500|$|A {{plenary session}} of the European Parliament was held on 24 October, with MEPs observing a minute’s silence. Several members of Caruana Galizia’s family {{attended}} the session at the <b>hemicycle</b> in Strasbourg. The press room at the European parliament building was renamed in her honour. A debate on {{freedom of the press}} and the protection of journalists in Malta also took place. Following this visit and the following debate, a delegation is to be sent by the European Parliament to investigate the rule of law, high-level cases of money laundering and corruption in Malta.|$|E

2500|$|On April 19, 2006, Juanes {{performed}} {{before the}} European Parliament, {{as part of}} a campaign to increase awareness against the use of landmines around the world, including in his native Colombia. [...] He was first singer to perform in the <b>hemicycle</b> where the European Parliament holds its plenary sessions. The Parliament gave a symbolic gift of €2.5 million to demine Colombia and to rehabilitate victims of the landmines. In honor of his work and his music, he was given an escopetarra (a decommissioned AK-47 converted into a guitar) by peace activist César López; he later sold it at a fundraiser in Beverly Hills for US$17,000. Juanes held a benefit concert on May 24, 2006 in conjunction with KLVE and Univision which raised roughly US$350,000 to care for injured children and provide prosthetics, wheelchairs, and land rehabilitation.|$|E
