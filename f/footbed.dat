[...] 1902 saw the development of the first flexible arch-support for insertion into factory-made shoes; and in 1964, Karl Birkenstock developed these inserts into a shoe — thus producing the original prototype of the Birkenstock sandal. In 1925 Konrad Birkenstock expanded the company by buying a large factory in Friedberg, Hesse. After World War II (1939-1945) the Birkenstock sandal was popular among returning soldiers because of the orthopedic support.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the loaded foot and the <b>footbed</b> is critical for footwear fit and comfort. Previous {{studies have shown that}} altering plantar pressure distributions can affect comfort. Hence a good fitting <b>footbed</b> is important for improving footwear comfort. The focus of this thesis was to investigate the necessary shape for the <b>footbed</b> in order to improve comfort for any foot shape. The perceived footwear fit in midfoot and forefoot in medio-lateral sides was highly correlated with the dimensional differences between foot and shoe-last in the corresponding regions. A fit that is neither tight nor loose can be achieved when the dimensional difference is around 8 mm on the width at toe region and around 15 mm on the midfoot width. In order to study various <b>footbed</b> shapes, a novel mechanical device was invented. The device was able to vary heel height, heel wedge angle, heel seat, shank shape, arch length and toe spring. The <b>footbed</b> shape deformations were estimated using structural bending theories where the largest estimation error found was 3. 70 mm at the midfoot region. Thereafter, the effects of <b>footbed</b> shapes on the plantar foot shape were studied in detail since the changes in foot shape have to be accounted for when designing shoes. It was found that the structure of the midfoot can change independently thereby creating changes in its plantar shape. The participants taking part in the experiment were able to judge these shape changes in the midfoot region and showed different preferences for different midfoot shapes. Knowing the characteristics of midfoot deformation, various <b>footbed</b> shapes were studied at different heel heights to understand their relation to perceived footwear comfort. It was found that there exists a unique <b>footbed</b> surface shape for the foot to feel comfortable at each tested heel height. In order to obtain such a <b>footbed</b> shape there are three conditions that have to be satisfied simultaneously: the contact area has to be higher than that of when standing on a flat surface, the peak pressure has to be lower than approximately 100 kPa and the percentage of force acting on the forefoot has to be approximately within 15 % to 22. 5 % of the total force. Prediction models (i. e. for each heel height) were proposed and validated based on the comfortable <b>footbed</b> shapes to predict the required <b>footbed</b> shape for given basic foot dimensions. An algorithm was proposed to transform an unconstrained 3 D foot shape (when standing on floor) in to a shape where the foot is supported on a comfortable <b>footbed</b> shape. The accuracy of the above mentioned 3 D foot modeling algorithm was within ± 1. 02 cm. The findings from this thesis, including the <b>footbed</b> prediction models and the invented device, have the potential to be integrated into footwear design, thus improving footwear comfort...|$|E
40|$|For many years, medical {{personnel}} have {{alluded to the}} health hazards of high-heeled shoes. However, fashion tends to override pain, no matter how dire the consequences may be. This led us to ask if high-heel shoes can be comfortable. Our study clearly shows that the design parameters of a shoe significantly influence the perceived feeling of a high-heel shoe wearer. Thirty-two females participated in an experiment where different <b>footbed</b> shapes were investigated at a heel height of 75 mm. The results demonstrate {{the existence of a}} <b>footbed</b> shape that is considered to be the most comfortable. The potential reason for the preferences can be related to the contact area between the plantar foot and the <b>footbed</b> surface, the peak plantar pressure distribution and the force distribution among different foot regions...|$|E

40|$|A shoe wearer's comfort {{is related}} to the shape of the <b>footbed</b> of a shoe. Even though the <b>footbed</b> shape is {{important}} in footwear design, there exists no methodology to evaluate the existing guidelines used in last making. Thirty-two females participated in an experiment where heel seat length, heel seat inclination and heel height were investigated using the profile assessment device. The dependent variables were plantar pressure and perceived feeling of each participant. The results show that perceived feel is best for wedge angles of 4 degrees and 5 degrees at a heel height of 25 mm, 10 degrees and 11 degrees at a heel height of 50 mm and 16 degrees and 18 degrees at a heel height of 75 mm. A regression model was derived and this explained approximately 80 % of the variation of perceived feeling with the contact area, peak plantar pressure and percentage of force acting on the forefoot region. Both heel wedge angle and heel seat length {{play an important role in}} the perceived feel of high-heeled shoes.

40|$|The midsole of {{footwear}} {{can provide}} an opportunity to attenuate the impact at the foot-ground interface. The present study was undertaken to quantify impact in walking in different footwear midsoles, comparing footwear thickness and hardness variations. Methods: <b>Footbed</b> thickness (28 - 41 mm) and hardness (30 - 55 Shore A) were varied independently in 7 flip-flops. Thirteen subjects walked in the footwear variations on a level walkway in the gait laboratory as lower limb kinematics, vertical ground reaction force and peak positive axial tibial acceleration were quantified. Peak magnitude and time of the acceleration were quantified and the heel-strike transient was characterised for comparison between conditions with a repeated-measures ANOVA. Thickness and hardness variations were also compared using a drop-test protocol to replicate walking. Results: Lower limb joint angles did not vary at heel-strike, however, a faster vertical heel-velocity was recorded in the softer midsoles (e. g. 55 Shore A = - 0. 294 ± 0. 055, 30 Shore A= - 0. 328 ± 0. 052, p<. 001). Varying the hardness of the midsoles also significantly altered tibial acceleration and force variables, however limited significant differences existed between the thickness variations in walking. Increasing the hardness of the heel section of the footwear increased the peak positive axial tibial acceleration values, for example increasing Shore A from 30 to 40 resulted in a 35 % increase in this variable. Concurrently, the occurrence of heel-strike transients increased from 5. 8 % in the 30 Shore A condition to 22. 5 %, 46. 7 % and 71. 7 % of all trials in the 40, 47 and 55 Shore A conditions respectively. The drop-test protocol replicated the differences evident in the walking protocol despite magnitudes being elevated. Conclusion: Modifying midsole properties of flip-flop footwear, particularly hardness, alters the gait kinematics and the shock experienced by the wearer in walking. This may pose benefits in terms of comfort and reduction in loading to the lower limb, however the influence on foot motion at initial contact and footwear longevity should be further quantified...|$|E
