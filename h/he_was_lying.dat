5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of the 2004–05 NHL season by the NHL lockout, Brashear signed with the Quebec Radio X of the semi-pro Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey league (LNAH). The deal was reportedly worth $300,000. He registered 18 goals and 50 points in 47 games, but was reluctant to fight and felt the League did little {{to protect him from}} players wanting {{to make a name for}} themselves against an established NHL enforcer. Brashear was suspended from the League following an incident where he continued punching a player in the face while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> on the ice.|$|E

A massive brawl ensued, with a member of DRI's road crew getting his arm broken.|$|E

25|$|On 1 December 1948 at 6:30am, {{the police}} were {{contacted}} after {{the body of a}} man was discovered on Somerton beach near Glenelg, about 11 kilometres (6.8mi) southwest of Adelaide, South Australia. The man was found lying in the sand across from the Crippled Children's Home, which was on the corner of The Esplanade and Bickford Terrace. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> back with his head resting against the seawall, with his legs extended and his feet crossed. It was believed he had died while sleeping. An unlit cigarette was on the right collar of his coat. A search of his pockets revealed an unused second-class rail ticket from Adelaide to Henley Beach, a bus ticket from the city that could not be proved to have been used, a narrow aluminium American comb, a half-empty packet of Juicy Fruit chewing gum, an Army Club cigarette packet containing seven Kensitas cigarettes, and a quarter-full box of Bryant & May matches.|$|E
25|$|Appian {{wrote that}} Vettius, a plebeian, {{run to the}} forum with a drawn dagger to kill Caesar and Pompey. He was arrested and {{questioned}} at the senate house. He {{said that he had}} been sent by Calpurnius Bibulus, Cicero, and Cato, and that the dagger was given to him by one of the bodyguards of Calpurnius Bibulus. The event was open to all suspicions. Caesar took advantage of this to arouse the crowd and postponed further interrogation to the next day. However, Vettius was killed in prison during the night. Caesar claimed that he was killed by the optimates {{who did not want to}} be exposed. The crowd gave Caesar a bodyguard. According to Appian, it is at this point that Bibulus withdrew from public business and did not go out of his house for the rest of his term of office. Caesar, who run public affairs on his own, did not make any further investigations into this affair. In the version of Cassius Dio Vettius was sent by Cicero and Lucullus. He did not say when this happened and did not give any details about the actual event. He wrote that Vettius accused these two men and Calpurnius Bibulus. However, Bibulus had revealed the plan to Pompey. This undermined his credibility. There were suspicions that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> about Cicero and Lucullus as well and that this was a ploy by Caesar and Pompey to discredit the optimates. There were various theories, but nothing was proven. After naming the mentioned men in public, Vettius was sent to prison and was murdered a little later. Caesar and Pompey suspected Cicero and their suspicions were confined by his defence of Gaius Antonius Hybrida in a trial.|$|E

On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, [...] "The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it.

500|$|Patrick van der Eem, working {{undercover}} for De Vries, had befriended Van der Sloot, who {{was unaware}} {{that he was}} being taped when he said that Holloway had suffered some kind of seizure while having sex on the beach. After failing to revive her, Van der Sloot said that he summoned a friend named Daury. The two men neither phoned for medical help nor checked Natalee to determine if she might still be alive. [...] Then, according to Van der Sloot, Daury volunteered to load her on a boat, and he dumped Natalee's body into the sea. The prosecutor in Aruba determined the video was admissible, but the evidence was deemed [...] "insufficient" [...] to warrant Van der Sloot's, or anyone's, arrest.

500|$|The {{following}} off-season, Cloutier {{was traded}} {{on the day of}} the 1999 NHL Entry Draft (June 26, 1999) to the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was sent to Tampa Bay, along with winger Niklas Sundstrom, a first-round selection (Nikita Alexeev) in 2000 and a third-round selection (subsequently traded) in 2000, for the Lightning's first-round selection in that year's draft (Pavel Brendl). With the departure of Tampa Bay's previous starter, Bill Ranford, to the Detroit Red Wings and Darren Puppa nearing the end of his career, Cloutier assumed the starting position for his new club. Cloutier's first season as an NHL starter was interrupted on several occasions with numerous injuries and a suspension. He suffered a strained groin early in the campaign on November 18, 1999, forcing him out of two games. On January 14, 2000, he was suspended by the league for four games after an incident with Islanders forward Tim Connolly. After the two collided, Cloutier cross-checked Connolly, then kicked his head (Connolly's helmet was intact) while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> face-down on the ice. The following month, he re-strained his groin on February 21 and missed four games. Cloutier missed another four contests beginning on March 14 after injuring his neck. His fourth injury of the season occurred on March 28, when he strained his medial collateral ligament (MCL) and missed five games. He finished the 1999–2000 season appearing in 52 games for the Lightning, recording 9 wins, 30 losses and 3 ties as the team finished second-last in the league. He registered a 3.49 GAA and [...]885 save percentage.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
