5|$|After {{tracking}} the Brittles to the Tennessee plantation {{of the wealthy}} Spencer Bennett and killing them, the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz and becomes his apprentice. Later that evening, the duo are hunted by Spencer Bennett and a large gang of white supremacists (a reference to the early Ku Klux Klan), but Dr. Schultz deceives and kills most of Bennett's gang with an explosive and Django kills Bennett. Dr. Schultz explains that he <b>feels</b> responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and <b>feels</b> morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda.

5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger <b>feels</b> like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus <b>feels</b> like.|$|E
