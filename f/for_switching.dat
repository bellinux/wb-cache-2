5|$|After {{one long}} run in The Heiress, Richardson {{appeared}} in another, RCSherriff's Home at Seven, in 1950. He played an amnesiac bank clerk who fears {{he may have}} committed murder. He later recreated the part in a radio broadcast, and in a film version, which was his sole venture into direction for the screen. Once he had played himself into a role in a long run, Richardson felt able to work during the daytime in films, and made two others in the early 1950s beside the film of the Sherriff piece: Outcast of the Islands, directed by Carol Reed, and David Lean's The Sound Barrier, released in 1951 and 1952 respectively. For the latter he won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. With his characteristic liking <b>for</b> <b>switching</b> between modern roles and the classics, his next stage part was Colonel Vershinin in Three Sisters in 1951. He headed a strong cast, with Renée Asherson, Margaret Leighton and Celia Johnson as the sisters, but reviewers found the production weakly directed, and some felt that Richardson failed to disguise his positive personality when playing the ineffectual Vershinin.

40|$|Abstract — The major {{motivation}} of the averaging technique <b>for</b> <b>switched</b> systems is {{the construction of}} a smooth average system whose state trajectory approximates in some sense the state trajectory of the switched system. Averaging of dynamic systems represented by switched ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has been widely analyzed in the literature. The averaging approach can be useful also for the analysis of switched differential algebraic equations (DAEs). Indeed by analyzing the evolution of the switched DAEs state it is possible to conjecture the existence of an average model. However a trivial generalization of the ODE case is not possible due to the presence of state jumps. In this paper we discuss the averaging approach <b>for</b> <b>switched</b> DAEs and an approximation result is derived <b>for</b> homogenous <b>switched</b> linear DAE with periodic switching signals commuting among several modes. This approximation result extends a recent averaging result <b>for</b> <b>switched</b> DAEs with only two modes. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the averaging approach <b>for</b> <b>switched</b> DAEs. I...|$|R
