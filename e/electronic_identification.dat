Because auction markets are the first market for many cattle, livestock markets are a natural place to implement animal identification scanning and recording. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand livestock market operators’ knowledge, concerns, views, and adoption of the NAIS and <b>electronic</b> animal <b>identification</b> systems. If livestock market operators do not understand the NAIS or animal identification systems they might misconstrue or misunderstand information on these systems.

40|$|Livestock {{industry}} initiatives {{such as the}} National Animal Identification System (NAIS), marketing alliances, {{and production}} verification programs are leading to increased use of <b>electronic</b> animal <b>identification</b> systems. Livestock markets are one place where animal movement and identification information can be recorded easily. Auction market facilities can differentiate themselves by offering <b>electronic</b> individual animal <b>identification</b> and tracking services to customers. However, facility modifications, installation, and operating equipment needed to record <b>electronic</b> animal <b>identification</b> information {{at the speed of}} commerce involves costs. The more animals that the radio frequency identification (RFID) reading technology would be used on, the lower the cost of investment per animal for the livestock market. Thus, auction markets will be reluctant to invest in RFID reading and recording equipment if there is little demand for the service by customers. This concern has likely increased with the NAIS becoming explicitly voluntary. Also, some market operators are concerned that producers will expect livestock markets to offer tagging services if RFID equipment is available for use. The investment required to adopt an <b>electronic</b> animal <b>identification</b> system and how this investment would affect a livestock market’s business are also major concerns. This study examines the investments required for livestock markets to adopt RFID reader systems and tagging services...|$|R
