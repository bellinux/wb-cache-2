500|$|For a {{traditionally}} trained navigator, these inputs include physical {{signals from the}} sea, skies, and stars, memory signals from his knowledge of star, swell, and wind compasses; and cultural knowledge recorded in chants, dances, and stories. Examples of physical signals include the color, temperature, and taste (salinity) of seawater; <b>floating</b> <b>plant</b> debris; sightings of land-based seabirds flying out to fish; cloud type, color, and movement; wind direction, speed, and temperature; the direction and nature of ocean swells and waves; the position of stars in the sky, and his estimation of the speed, current set, and leeway of his sailing craft. The [...] "compass" [...] he carried was not magnetic but a mental model of where islands are located and the star points that one could use to navigate between them. This mental model would have taken years of study to build; dances, chants (rong), and stories help him to recall complex relationships of geography and location. The stars give him highly reliable position information when visible, but navigators such as Mau managed to keep their position and tracks in mind even when blocked by clouds, using other references such as wind and swell as proxies.|$|E

2500|$|The 2011 Japanese nuclear {{accidents}} {{due to the}} 2011 T≈çhoku {{earthquake and}} tsunami provide a sharp contrast to some comparative safety advantages of floating nuclear plants. Land based nuclear facilities must be designed for severe ground accelerations due to earthquakes. Many are placed close to a seacoast for access to sea water for cooling. Coastal locations {{tend to be the}} areas of maximum tsunami damage, requiring protective design and risk of catastrophic failure. [...] A floating facility, near a coast but not in shallow water, can avoid the worst problems of earthquakes and tsunamis. [...] In deep enough water, tsunamis have minimal effect on floating structures, and earthquakes transmit much less force to them. [...] In the event of an accident, terrorist attack, or other calamity, it is essential to keep the water moderated and cooled reactor core covered with water. [...] An emergency measure can be to lower the core into the sea. In the worst case, accidental sinking or intentional scuttling will keep sea water on the core and prevent atmospheric release - again, especially in deep enough water. [...] Finally, [...] land based nuclear power plants can be expensive to build on-site, difficult to maintain or refuel and after retirement dangerous and expensive to clean up. [...] A <b>floating</b> <b>plant</b> is towed to a facility that handles multiple such tasks.|$|E
60|$|On the 14th {{we passed}} the Dacca river; below which the Megna is several miles wide, {{and there is an}} {{appearance}} of tide, from masses of purple Salvinia (a <b>floating</b> <b>plant,</b> allied to ferns), being thrown up on the beach like sea-weed. Still lower down, the vegetation of the Sunderbunds commences; there is a narrow beach, and behind it a mud bank several feet high, supporting a luxuriant green jungle of palms (Borassus and Phoenix), immense fig-trees, covered with Calami, and tall betel-palms, clothed with the most elegant drapery of Arostichum scandens, a climbing fern with pendulous fronds.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, it must {{be remembered}} that this gulf-weed has not, as some of the uninitiated fancy from its name, {{anything}} to do with the Gulf Stream, along the southern edge of which we were steaming. [...] Thrust away to the south by that great ocean-river, it lies in a vast eddy, or central pool of the Atlantic, between the Gulf Stream and the equatorial current, unmoved save by surface-drifts of wind, as floating weeds collect and range slowly round and round in the still corners of a tumbling-bay or salmon pool. One glance at a bit of the weed, as it floats past, showed that it is like no Fucus of our shores, or anything we ever saw before. The difference of look is undefinable in words, but clear enough. One sees in a moment that the Sargassos, of which there are several species on Tropical shores, are a genus of themselves and by themselves; and a certain awe may, if the beholder be at once scientific and poetical, come over him at the first sight of this famous and unique variety thereof, which has lost ages since the habit of growing on rock or sea-bottom, but propagates itself for ever floating; and feeds among its branches a whole family of fish, crabs, cuttlefish, zoophytes, mollusks, which, like the plant which shelters them, are found nowhere else in the world. And that awe, springing from 'the scientific use of the imagination,' would be increased if he recollected the theory--not altogether impossible--that this sargasso (and possibly some of the animals which cling to it) marks the site of an Atlantic continent, sunk long ages since; and that, transformed by the necessities of life from a rooting to a <b>floating</b> <b>plant,</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Excessive {{phosphorus}} {{can make}} for excessive production of autotrophs, like algae and cyanobacteria, leading to eutrophication in an inorganic nutrient pathway. Nutrient enrichment in lakes and reservoirs results in the microscopic <b>floating</b> <b>plants,</b> algae and formation of dense mats of larger <b>floating</b> <b>plants</b> that can produce oxygen by photosynthesis. When they die and sink to the bottom, they consume oxygen in decomposition. Bacteria thriving in this process consume oxygen. With the depletion of oxygen, fishes die and anaerobic bacteria produce methane, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which can destroy the ecosystem.|$|R
