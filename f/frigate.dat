5|$|Alarmed by {{the raid}} on Genoa, the {{authorities}} in Leghorn ordered Impérieuse to leave immediately. The <b>frigate</b> sailed north and took shelter at Fezzano, near the port of La Spezia. The French had decided that since capture was inevitable, the <b>frigate</b> should be destroyed, and beached the ship in order to remove guns and stores. Six days after the capture of Modeste, Captain reached La Spezia, acting on reports that Impérieuse was in the bay. Reeve discovered the French ship under the guns of the Santa Maria shore battery, and the following morning, 12 October, used his ship's boats to tow Captain alongside Impérieuse. At 08:00 boat parties from the ship of the line boarded the <b>frigate,</b> discovering that the remaining French crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during the night and scuttled it in shallow water. The British {{were able to take}} possession of Impérieuse without opposition from the battery. Reeve instructed his carpenters to make the <b>frigate</b> seaworthy again, refloating the ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 October before sailing back to Toulon with his prize.|$|E
5|$|At 3400 ton, {{the vessel}} is argued to {{be a small}} <b>frigate</b> rather than a corvette, and poorly armed. It's also been alleged that the Indian Navy wanted a vessel with the {{endurance}} of a 3400-ton <b>frigate</b> and an armament of a 1200-ton corvette.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to destroyers, the navy operates several classes of <b>frigates</b> such as three [...] (Project 17 class) and six -class <b>frigates.</b> Seven additional Shivalik-class <b>frigates</b> (Project 17A class <b>frigates)</b> are on order. The older [...] <b>frigates</b> will systematically be replaced {{one by one}} as the new classes of <b>frigates</b> are brought into service over the next decade.|$|R

5|$|In France, {{news of the}} {{situation}} in the West Indies forced the authorities to take action. During the autumn of 1808, a number of ships were despatched carrying much needed food and military supplies, but several were intercepted, including the <b>frigate</b> Thétis, captured during the Action of 10 November 1808 in the Bay of Biscay. Despite the losses, some ships did reach their destination intact and further supply ships were prepared, including the <b>frigate</b> Topaze, ordered to transport 1,100 barrels of flour to Cayenne. The cargo was loaded during late November and early December, the <b>frigate</b> also carrying military supplies and 100 soldiers to augment the Cayenne garrison. The ship, under the command of Captain Pierre-Nicolas Lahalle, was only three years old and carried 40 heavy guns.|$|E
5|$|In a {{postscript}} to the day's {{action the}} British <b>frigate</b> Castor, captured {{early in the}} campaign by Nielly, was attacked and retaken by the smaller HMS Carysfort under Captain Francis Laforey at the <b>frigate</b> action of 29 May 1794. Some of the crew were released by their rescuers but most, including the officers, were not aboard, having been taken onto Nielly's flagship Sans Pareil.|$|E
50|$|Harpoon {{with more}} than 124 km range and 220 kg payload (launched from Ambassador-class FPB/M, Knox-class <b>frigates,</b> Oliver Hazard Perry-class <b>frigates</b> and Descubierta-class light <b>frigates).</b>|$|R
25|$|The British <b>frigates</b> Armide and Talbot {{initially}} had to {{face the}} <b>frigates</b> on the Ottoman right wing and the island shore battery unsupported, as the other two <b>frigates</b> were away and arrived later. They were saved from annihilation by the arrival of the Russian <b>frigates.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Frigates</b> {{were the}} first large surface combatants made {{available}} to the PLAN. The Soviet Union sold several <b>frigates</b> to the PLAN in the 1950s, including the Riga-class <b>frigates.</b> These <b>frigates</b> became the foundation of Chinese built designs, such as the Type 053 <b>frigates.</b> These ships were mostly armed with naval guns, though later designs managed to replace torpedo tubes with a twin launcher for SS-N-2 Styx anti-ship missiles.|$|R
5|$|In his <b>frigate</b> HMS Phoenix, Halstead {{was able}} to cut the Batavian <b>frigate</b> Argo off from the shore {{and bring it to}} battle, forcing it to {{surrender}} in just 20 minutes as other British ships closed with the combat. The remainder of the Batavian squadron had dispersed eastwards away from the frigates and Duncan's fleet, pursued by the <b>frigate</b> HMS Pegasus and brig-sloop HMS Sylph. After a lengthy chase, Phoenix caught the cutter Duke of York, Sylph seized the brig Mercury, while Pegasus succeeded in driving the other brigs, Echo and Gier ashore, where both were believed wrecked. Duncan's blockade of the Texel was instrumental in British control of the North Sea, and a year later it would achieve a decisive victory at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|In late April 1800, Confiance cruised off Sunda Strait, {{where she}} {{captured}} an American ship; she {{then left the}} strait to avoid the <b>frigate</b> , which was known to cruise in these waters, and sailed to the Seychelles. There, he escaped a British ship {{of the line and}} a <b>frigate,</b> and sailed on to cruise the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{intercepts}} a {{distress signal}} from the Space Pirate <b>frigate</b> Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queena giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's reactor core, initiating {{the destruction of the}} ship. While Samus is escaping from the doomed <b>frigate,</b> she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the <b>frigate</b> and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E

50|$|The Rothesay class, or Type 12M <b>frigates</b> were a {{class of}} <b>frigates</b> serving with the Royal Navy, South African Navy (where they were called President-class <b>frigates)</b> and the Royal New Zealand Navy.|$|R
50|$|Steam <b>frigates,</b> {{also known}} as screw <b>frigates,</b> and the smaller steam corvettes and steam sloops were steam-powered warships. The first such ships were steam-powered {{versions}} of the traditional <b>frigates,</b> corvettes, and sloops.|$|R
5|$|Sercey's {{flagship}} {{during these}} operations was the 40-gun <b>frigate</b> Forte. Forte, commanded by the elderly Captain Hubert Le Loup de Beaulieu, {{had been built}} in 1794 based on the hull and frame of a ship of the line: the <b>frigate</b> weighed 1,400 tons bm, the largest purpose-built <b>frigate</b> at sea. The main battery of Forte consisted of 28 24-pounder long guns, only the second <b>frigate</b> ever built (after Pomone) which could manage such a heavy armament. This was augmented by fourteen 8-pounder long guns on the upper deck and eight 36-pounder carronades on the quarterdeck, totaling 52 heavy cannon complemented by eight 1-pounder swivel guns. Uniquely, {{the sides of the}} ship were lined with cork matting to prevent splinters while the more common precaution had been taken of stringing netting over the deck to protect the crew from falling debris. The ship was however weakened by an ill-disciplined crew, and Sercey had expressed doubts about the ability of the aged Beaulieu.|$|E
5|$|Surcouf {{sailed to}} Mergui to {{purchase}} food and free his prisoners, and put to sail on 10 December. En route, {{he met the}} fellow French privateer Malartic, under Jean Dutertre; soon after, the privateers met a British <b>frigate,</b> 38-gun <b>frigate</b> HMS Sybille, which gave chase and which Surcouf managed to outsail by throwing eight guns overboard, along with various other implements.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 18 June 1793 was {{the first}} decisive {{and one of the}} most celebrated {{encounters}} between British and French frigates during the French Revolutionary Wars. The action occurred off Start Point in Devon, when the British <b>frigate</b> HMS Nymphe encountered and chased the French <b>frigate</b> Cléopâtre. During the previous month, Cléopâtre and another <b>frigate,</b> Sémillante, had been successfully raiding British merchant shipping in the English Channel and Eastern Atlantic from their base at Cherbourg. In response, the British frigates Nymphe and HMS Venus had been ordered to intercept and defeat the French frigates and on 27 May Venus and Sémillante fought an inconclusive engagement off Cape Finisterre.|$|E

These ships are the same type as the South African Navy's Valour class <b>frigates.</b> In 2012 Algeria also ordered 100 Umkhonto-IR surface-to-air missiles for the <b>frigates,</b> according to SIPRI.|$|R

5|$|The Capture of USS Chesapeake, or the Battle of Boston Harbor, {{was fought}} on 1 June 1813, between the Royal Navy's <b>frigate</b> HMS Shannon and American <b>frigate</b> USS Chesapeake, {{as part of}} the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. The Chesapeake was {{captured}} in a brief but intense action in which over 80 men were killed. This was the only <b>frigate</b> action of the war in which there was no preponderance of force on either side.|$|E
5|$|The USS Constellation vs La Vengeance, or the Action of 1 February 1800, was a single-ship action fought between frigates of the French Navy and the United States Navy {{during the}} Quasi-War. In the battle the American <b>frigate</b> USS Constellation {{tried to take}} the French <b>frigate</b> La Vengeance as a prize. Both ships got heavily damaged. Although the French <b>frigate</b> struck her colors twice, she managed to flee after the main mast of her {{opponent}} had fallen.|$|E

5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French <b>frigate</b> making significant gains over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that would cut {{in front of the}} French <b>frigate.</b> These were the British <b>frigate</b> HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French <b>frigate,</b> whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
5|$|The <b>frigate</b> {{action of}} 29 May 1794—not to be {{confused}} with the much larger fleet action of 29 May 1794 that took place in the same waters at the same time—was a minor naval engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars between a Royal Navy <b>frigate</b> and a French Navy <b>frigate.</b> The action formed a minor part of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, a campaign which culminated in the battle of the Glorious First of June, and was unusual in that the French ship Castor had only been in French hands for a few days at the time of the engagement. Castor had previously been a British ship, seized on 19 May by a French battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay and converted to French service while still at sea. While the main fleets manoeuvered around one another, Castor was detached in pursuit of a Dutch merchant ship and on 29 May encountered the smaller independently cruising British <b>frigate</b> HMS Carysfort.|$|E
5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle was in a {{position}} to attack the rear-most <b>frigate</b> of the pair as they emerged from the western side of the island. This <b>frigate</b> sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle displayed a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the <b>frigate</b> came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E

50|$|Nearly {{all modern}} <b>frigates</b> are {{equipped}} with some form of offensive or defensive missiles, and as such are rated as guided-missile <b>frigates</b> (FFG). Improvements in surface-to-air missiles (e.g., the Eurosam Aster 15) allow modern guided-missile <b>frigates</b> to form the core of many modern navies and {{to be used as}} a fleet defence platform, without the need for specialised anti-air warfare <b>frigates.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Frigates</b> were {{ships of}} the fifth rate; sixth rates {{comprised}} small <b>frigates</b> and corvettes. Towards {{the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars and into the late 19th century, some larger and more powerful <b>frigates</b> were classified as fourth rates.|$|R
