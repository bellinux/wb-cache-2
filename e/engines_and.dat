40|$|Abstract. To {{research}} the matching of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> turbocharger on sail-assisted ship, a 76000 deadweight tonnage cargo ship with 5 S 60 MC main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> TCA 66 turbocharger was selected. The simulation model of working {{process of the}} engine was established, with AVL BOOST software, and verified by bench test results. Then, the model was {{used to analyze the}} matching of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> turbocharger, at constant speed mode of the main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> constant speed mode of the ship. The results show that, the matching of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> turbocharger is acceptable, on the selected sail-assisted ship. However, special attentions should be paid to the turbocharger when the engine load is above 85. 6 % of the rated power at constant speed mode of the ship, to avoid surge of the compressor...|$|R

5|$|Increasing costs: due {{to higher}} costs {{of fuel and}} insurance, and due to greater {{regulation}} requiring equipment such as new radios, {{or in some cases}} transponders, gliding costs have increased, although without the continuous use of <b>engines</b> <b>and</b> fuel, they are still considerably lower than traditional power flying.|$|E

40|$|Engine room {{monitoring}} {{control system}} is monitoring <b>and</b> controlling main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> from long distance by powerline communication network and wireless network {{to ease the}} operator in operating the ship and save operational cost. To prevent error in programming the main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine,</b> a simulation using instrument software is needed to know the machine characteristic. After simulation result fulfills the requirement which is approached the value of test record, it {{can be applied to}} the real machine. In this study, some steps were done such as: getting know type of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> which performance will be simulated and programmed, getting test record of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine,</b> getting know how the main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> work, making simulation of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> work system, doing monitoring control simulation by powerline communication and wireless network, comparing the results between simulation and test record of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine.</b> Engine programming can be set after simulation result meets the requirement. Result of simulation fulfills the requirement, the difference values between machine simulation using software instrument and test record of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> are around 1 %- 2 %. If engine room monitoring control system by wireless and powerline communication is applied in the ship, the ship owner will get advantages because it will prolong ship durability and can monitor operasional of main engine or Auxiliary engine from long distance; while the operator will be easier in operating the ship. The disadvantage is only the higher cos...|$|R
