30|$|The {{number of}} {{computations}} that the relay needs to perform is also limited.

This complexity is further lowered by only considering uniform quantization. The modulo- M 2 addition of the resulting quantization intervals involves the addition of two integers with a limited range and is thus easily implemented in hardware. Channel parameter estimation does not add to the computational burden of the relay, because all channel parameters are estimated at the <b>destination</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} protocol {{is proposed}} {{in the context of}} wireless mesh networks. The protocol implements ondemand cooperation, i. e. cooperation between a source terminal and a <b>destination</b> <b>terminal</b> is activated only when needed. In that case, only the best relay among a set of available terminals is re-transmitting the source message to the <b>destination</b> <b>terminal.</b> This typical approach is improved using three additional features. First, a splitting algorithm is implemented to select the best relay. This ensures a fast selection process. Moreover, the duration of the selection process is now completely characterized. Second, only terminals that improve the outage probability of the direct link are allowed to participate to the relay selection. By this means, inefficient cooperation is now avoided. Finally, the <b>destination</b> <b>terminal</b> discards the source message when it fails to decode it. This saves processing time since the <b>destination</b> <b>terminal</b> does not need to combine the replicas of the source message: the one from the source terminal and the one from the best relay.

As a consequence, the frames sent to terminals having good propagation conditions (i.e., in clear sky) will be queued to encapsulation units using a ModCodi that provides low bit protection. Conversely, the frames sent to terminals having bad propagation conditions (i.e., facing a rain event) will use a ModCodn with higher bit protection levels, thus requiring additional overhead.|$|R

At the <b>destination</b> <b>terminal,</b> the self-information is removed from the received signal before data detection. Naturally the network performance of ANC scheme highly depends on the self-information removal at the <b>destination</b> <b>terminal.</b> Self-information removal accuracy can be degraded due to several factors such as imperfect frame synchronization, carrier frequency offset, and imperfect knowledge of channel state information. Early studies [3 â 6] considered perfect self-information removal at the <b>destination</b> <b>terminal.</b> Therefore, an important question is [...] "How much does the imperfect self-information removal affect the performance of ANC scheme?"

40|$|AbstractâIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} a single-relay cooperative scenario where the source, relay and <b>destination</b> <b>terminals</b> are equipped with multiple transmit/receive antennas. We assume that conventional space-time block codes are employed in the underlying source-to-destination (S â D), source-to-relay (S â R) and relay-to-destination (R â D) links, and consider both decode-and-forward (DaF) and amplifyand-forward (AaF) relaying techniques. For the latter one, we consider two variants based on the availability of channel state information (CSI); namely, blind AaF and CSI-assisted AaF. Through the derivation of pairwise error probability, we quantify analytically the impact of multiple antenna deployment for each relaying technique under various scenarios which involve relay location and power control assumptions imposed on cooperating nodes. Our transmission model assumes that the source and <b>destination</b> <b>terminals</b> are equipped with MS transmit and N receive antennas, respectively, and the relay terminal is equipped with MR receive and MT transmit antennas. For a scenario where R â D and S â D links are balanced and S â R link experiences sufficiently large SNR, our performance analysis demonstrates that the maximum achievable diversity order is MT min(MS,N) +MSN for blind AaF scheme and N(MT +MS) for both CSI-assisted AaF and DaF schemes. For another scenario where R â D link has a sufficiently large SNR and S â R and S â D links are balanced, CSI-assisted AaF, blind AaF and DaF schemes achieve diversity orders of MS(N + MR), MS(N + MT), and MsN, respectively. Other scenarios involving the availability of non-fading R â D link and poor inter-user channel quality are further investigated. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is also presented to corroborate the analytical results and to provide detailed performance comparisons among the three relaying techniques under consideration.

For two different CSI-assisted relaying schemes, which could be encompassed by a unified model, we provide the compact closed-form expressions for cumulative distribution function, probability density function, moment generating function, and generalized moment (GM) of the instantaneous end-to-end SNR. Besides, the exact analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and symbol error rate (SER) and approximate expression for ergodic capacity are also derived. Furthermore, we present the asymptotic expressions for OP and SER in the high SNR regime, from which we gain an insight into the system performance and derive the achievable diversity order and array gain. The analytical expressions are validated by Monte-Carlo simulations.|$|R
