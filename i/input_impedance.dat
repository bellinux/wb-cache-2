25|$|Vacuum Tube Voltmeters or valve {{voltmeters}} (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The <b>input</b> <b>impedance</b> of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E

40|$|While {{there are}} clear {{technical}} advantages to active microphone splitting, operational considerations dictate the use of passive splitting of microphones in most sound reinforcement applications. Modern microphones generally require a load impedance greater than 1, 000 ohms, and performance often degrades significantly with heavier loading. Since mix desk <b>input</b> <b>impedances</b> rarely exceed 1, 500 ohms, passive splitting utilizing 1 : 1 turns ratio transformers can seriously degrade microphone performance when driving two or more mix desks. Transformers designed to operate in stepdown mode solve this problem and offer other benefits. This paper reviews current practice, studies stepdown-mode splitting, and recommends that mixing desks be designed with higher <b>input</b> <b>impedances</b> and that microphones be designed to work with lower impedance loads...|$|R
