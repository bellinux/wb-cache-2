[...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E

40|$|In {{this piece}} I examine the {{production}} and proliferation of adult surveillance practices online through internet safety discourses. Specifically, through an analysis of youth internet safety curricula provided to adults, along with interviews with parents, law enforcement officers and school officials, I describe the mechanisms by which adults are positioned as agents of surveillance relative to social networks and youth internet practice. As I argue, youth internet safety discourses represent what can <b>be</b> conceptualized as <b>a</b> pedagogy of surveillance—reconfiguring both adult and youth conceptions of online practice in ways which establish “trusted adults ” as final arbiters of risk and appropriateness, while casting suspicion on the everyday social practices of youth. Through the pedagogy of surveillance provided by youth internet safety materials, parents and guardians are encouraged to conceptualize social networking sites and other information technologies used by youth as surveillance tools, rather than as social spaces.

She stopped making even the most rudimentary conversation, scribbled something on my chart and left, but not before heaving an exasperated sigh and slamming the vial and syringe into a tray on the counter. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> scared of this doctor and her power over me. Could she call Department of Social Services and have my baby taken away? Could she make it so I couldn't come to the free clinic any more? I wasn't taking any chances so I never returned for my other post-natal checkups. It was months later that other questions surfaced in my mind: Is there an antidote if you take Depo-Provera and have a bad reaction? What kind of research has been done on this drug? Why didn't the doctor talk to me about condoms or any other kind of birth control? Did every woman get the same treatment? How much harder would it have been to say no if I didn't speak English, or if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> uncertain <b>teenager,</b> or if the doctor had <b>been</b> just <b>a</b> little more pushy? Paradoxically, I ended up taking Depo-Provera anyways. Several years later, as a college student close to graduation and fearful of getting pregnant, I chose to try Depo-Provera through my college clinic.

However, on Depo-Provera, I became depressed, fat, irritable, and uninterested in sex.
