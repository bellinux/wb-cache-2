25|$|Calormenes disparage Narnian poetry, {{contending that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> things like love and war and not about useful maxims, {{but when the}} Calormen-raised Cor and Aravis first hear Narnian (or Cor's native Archenlandish) poetry they find it much more exciting. Calormen also prizes the art of story-telling, which, {{according}} to Lewis, forms part of {{the education of the}} nobility. The talking horse Bree, though not fond of most things Calormene, thoroughly enjoys a story told in Calormene style by Aravis and rolling like inarticulate Calormene horses.|$|E
500|$|The filmmaker {{has often}} cited Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher {{as a major}} {{influence}} on his own work. [...] "I'm very inspired by the prints of M. C. Escher and the interesting connection-point or blurring of boundaries between art and science, and art and mathematics." [...] Another source of inspiration is Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. The director has called Memento a [...] "strange cousin" [...] to Funes the Memorious, and has said, [...] "I think his writing naturally lends itself to a cinematic interpretation because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> efficiency and precision, the bare bones of an idea." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Bedingfield, Kingston, Wayne Wilkins, Louis Biancaniello, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder from the band OneRepublic, and Sam Watters from the group Color Me Badd. It was also {{produced}} by Biancaniello, Love, Tedder, and Watters together in their production team, The Runawayz. The song is composed in the key of F major and set in common time. Bedingfield's vocals span from C4 to F5. The Auto Tune effect is heard in a few parts of the song. In the song, Bedingfield discusses finding love with {{a person who has}} always [...] "been there all your life", but that [...] "you've never noticed it until now". According to her, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> realizing how that person is actually the [...] "love of your life".|$|E

500|$|Author of the 1985 book Fresh: Hip Hop Don't Stop, writer Nelson George further {{elaborated}} on {{the appeal}} of Radio to listeners at the time, describing LL Cool J as a [...] "minimalist homeboy who knows his beats", and stating [...] "You can call it rap, hip hop or street, {{but it really is}} a way of hearing music—and partying hard—that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids. L.L. Cool J {{is one of the best}} young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> a beat with style, with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiennes {{was cast}} as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his {{performances}} in [...] and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that [...] "I saw sexual evil. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> subtlety: {{there were moments}} of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold." [...] Fiennes put on [...] to play the role. He watched historic newsreels and talked to Holocaust survivors who knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said [...] "I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to." [...] Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of the Université libre de Bruxelles describe Göth's character in the film as a classic psychopath. Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg (a survivor of the events) met him, she trembled with fear.|$|E

2500|$|Budgie {{explained}} the song [...] "Manchild": [...] "It's a story based in Colombia before the drugs cartel, it's about {{a small child}} {{caught up in a}} feud, this vendetta between his village and another rival village. In a minor way <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> drug trafficking, but ends with the stronger village wiping out the whole male population of the other village until there was just one boy left called Nelsito. It was understood that he would live till he was at least 18 before he was assassinated, but he was shot on the way to school." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2004–05 season, Cahill was {{transferred}} to Everton for a fee of £1.5million, after Millwall's South East London rivals Crystal Palace ended negotiations of a potential transfer to themselves over a payment to his agents. In his first season, he was Everton's top goalscorer and was the fans' Player of the Season. Before the 2005–06 season Cahill's contract at Everton was extended with a salary increase reflecting the impact he had made at the club. The third round of that season's FA Cup drew Cahill's former club, Millwall against Everton at The Den. He scored the winner in the replay at Goodison Park, but chose not to celebrate his winning goal, stating, [...] "I decided not to go mad and just pay my respects to the club that gave me my start in the game. To celebrate would have been a kick in the teeth, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> respect." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1909 Debussy {{wrote that}} he had almost {{finished}} Roderick Usher's monologue: [...] "It almost makes the stones weep... {{as a matter of}} fact <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> the influence of stones on the minds of neurasthenic people. The mustiness is charmingly rendered by contrasting the low notes of the oboe with the harmonics of the violin (a patent device of my own)." [...] Debussy had believed he had been subject to neurasthenia but around this time his doctor diagnosed him as suffering from the rectal cancer which was to kill him. According to Robert Orledge, [...] "Debussy began increasingly to identify with Roderick Usher, whose mental breakdown Poe had identified with the crumbling House itself." [...] Debussy made three attempts at writing a libretto. Only when he was satisfied with the third one did he produce a short-score draft of the music to the first scene and part of the second in 1916–17. He went no further with Usher before his death in 1918.|$|E
2500|$|In September, Clinton {{unveiled}} the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative {{at the annual}} meeting of her husband's Clinton Global Initiative. The goal of the new initiative is to battle hunger worldwide on a strategic basis as a key part of U.S. foreign policy, rather than just react to food shortage emergencies as they occur. The secretary said that [...] "Food security is not just about food. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> security: economic security, environmental security, even national security. Massive hunger poses a threat to the stability of governments, societies and borders." [...] The initiative seeks to develop agricultural economies, counter malnourishment, increase productivity, expand trade, and spur innovation in developing nations. Clinton said that women would be placed at the center of the effort, as they constitute a majority of the world's farmers. The next month, to mark World Food Day, Clinton said, [...] "Fighting hunger and poverty through sustainable agricultural development, making sure that enough food is available and that people have the resources to purchase it, is a key foreign policy objective of the Obama administration." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ibrahimović {{was born}} to a Bosnian Muslim father, Šefik Ibrahimović, and a Croatian Catholic mother, Jurka Gravić; his parents were {{immigrants}} to Sweden from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and {{met for the first}} time in Sweden. Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: 'I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.' He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome..." [...] In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was [...] "not a factor" [...] in fans' perception of him: [...] "For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>about</b> respect. That's how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am." ...|$|E
