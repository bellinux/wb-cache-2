50|$|The <b>Euroloop</b> {{frequency}} {{was moved}} to a centre of 13.54750 MHz (exactly half of the Eurobalise power frequency).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Euroloop</b> is an {{extension}} for Eurobalises in ETCS Level 1. It is a special Leaky feeder for transmitting information telegrams to the car.|$|E
50|$|A balise transmits telegrams at a {{specific}} site. To allow a continuous transmission the telegrams may be sent along leaky feeder cable being up to 1000 metres long. The <b>Euroloop</b> cable is always connected with a balise at its end which serves as the End of Loop Marker (EOLM). The telegram structure {{is the same as}} for the balise it is connected to. Originally the <b>Euroloop</b> used the same frequency as the Eurobalises but that was changed for specification 2.0.1 in September 2004. Euroloops had been used in Switzerland which completed the change in July 2010.|$|E
50|$|Germany {{intends to}} use Level 1 only as Limited Supervision - neither Full Supervision nor <b>Euroloops</b> will be installed.|$|R
5000|$|Level 1: ETCS is {{installed}} on lineside (possibly superimposed with legacy systems) and on board; spot {{transmission of data}} from track to train (and versa) via Eurobalises or <b>Euroloops.</b>|$|R
50|$|Level 1 is a cab {{signalling}} {{system that can}} be superimposed on the existing {{signalling system}}, leaving the fixed signalling system (national signalling and track-release system) in place. Eurobalise radio beacons pick up signal aspects from the trackside signals via signal adapters and telegram coders (Lineside Electronics Unit - LEU) and transmit them to the vehicle as a movement authority together with route data at fixed points. The on-board computer continuously monitors and calculates the maximum speed and the braking curve from these data. Because of the spot transmission of data, the train must travel over the Eurobalise beacon to obtain the next movement authority. In order for a stopped train {{to be able to}} move (when the train is not stopped exactly over a balise), there are optical signals that show permission to proceed. With the installation of additional Eurobalises ("infill balises") or a <b>EuroLoop</b> between the distant signal and main signal, the new proceed aspect is transmitted continuously. The <b>EuroLoop</b> is an extension of the Eurobalise over a particular distance that basically allows data to be transmitted continuously to the vehicle over cables emitting electromagnetic waves. A radio version of the <b>EuroLoop</b> is also possible.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the system}} is based on ETCS Level 1 it is not compatible. Most notably, the system has dropped the usage of <b>Euroloop</b> line {{signalling}} - instead additional infill balises are placed between the distant signal and the stop signal. A semaphore on the distant signal flags to use a lower speed in approaching the stop signal - in most situations in rapid transit a stop signal will be dropped before reaching the stop semaphore. To increase throughput on the main lines the infill balises can send an upgrade message to the cab signalling electronics. If the train was required to halt then the train driver is responsible for interpreting the movement authority of the semaphore signal and to move the train slowly up to the next balise past the signal mast so that the cab control computer can see the release.|$|E
40|$|With {{the wider}} {{awakening}} of the world's environmental conscience, {{and the global}} commitment to the sustainable use of biodiversity, has come the need to know much more precisely and comprehensively than before the specific composition of biological communities. This has caused attention {{to focus on the}} previously neglected invertebrates and micro-organisms which, because of their sheer numbers, play crucial roles in the maintenance of ecosystems and the functioning of the world's geo-chemical cycles. There are six times as many species of fungi as there are of flowering plants, an equal number of nematodes (between 1. 5 and 2. 7 million species), perhaps six million species of insects, and a diversity of bacteria exceeding all others combined. The task of making an inventory of the 90 - 95 % of these organisms which remain unnamed is formidable. A piece-meal approach to this task is inevitable, beginning with all taxa surveys of specific ecosystems and/or localities, and the use of indicator species to monitor environmental changes under natural and humanly modified regimes. But for both inventories and big-indicator-based monitory exercises, the correct identification of organisms and a sound knowledge of their interrelationships is an essential pre-requisite. Without authoritative names i. e. unique identities for the organisms under investigation, research results are valueless as tools for the development of desirable management prescriptions for the world's biological diversity. The biggest single scientific impediment to progress in biological research - and hence to biodiversity programmes, of whatever dimension - is the lack of authoritative identification, the lack of names. The name of an organism is the key to ail that is known about it. The science which provides these names, biosystematics, is dedicated to discovering organisms, identifying and classifying them and elucidating their interrelationships within biological systems. It is the language of biology and the foundation of all that follows. Without biosystematics there is no basis for building a database for biological diversity. Biosystematic resources worldwide are generally inadequate in the face of increasing need for them and substantial new investment in this science is needed, even in the wealthiest nations. The situation in developing countries is critical. With few notable exceptions, these lack the indigenous expertise and reference materials needed to support national programmes for biodiversity and to enable them to meet their obligations as signatories to the Global Convention on Biodiversity. The only enduring solution is for developing countries to create and sustain realistic self-reliance and {{to do so in the}} most cost-effective way, through subregional technical cooperation networks designed to mobilize, pool and optimize the use of the resulting corporate assets for the benefit of all member countries. BioNET-INTERNATIONAL, a global network of subregional LOOPS (Locally Organized and Operated Partnerships) provides the mechanism, and additionally facilitates the further strengthening of sub-regional capabilities through its consortium of centres of excellence (BioCON) in developed countries, and its Technical Secretariat at CAB International in the UK. BioCON, as exemplified by the recently formed <b>EuroLOOP</b> embracing 22 countries of Europe, stands ready to provide technical support to the developing country LOOPs of BioNET e. g. CARINET in the Caribbean sub-region, ASEANET in South East Asia, EAFRINET in East Africa and PACINET in the South Pacific. Further LOOPS are planned for Southern and West Africa, Amazonia, Southern Latin America, India and China and elsewhere.
