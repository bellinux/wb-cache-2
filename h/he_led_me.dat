60|$|I {{did what}} he commanded, and <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{through the door of}} the hut.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to {{the door}} and pointed to the high grey wall which towered up amongst the debris of the {{shattered}} houses.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{to a spot}} {{among the}} bushes where lay a small pond of thin mud the colour of weak tea with milk.|$|E
60|$|And so <b>he</b> kindly <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the door, {{and holding}} a wax-candle, lighted me up the one flight of stairs.|$|R
6000|$|He stood {{me another}} drink, and then, taking my {{arm in a}} cuddling sort o' way, and calling me [...] "Dear boy," [...] <b>'e</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> back to the wharf and explained. He said 'e would come round next evening with wot 'e called his make-up box, and paint 'is face and make 'imself up till people wouldn't know one from the other.|$|R
60|$|HILLCRIST. [Sharply] That's {{all very}} well, but <b>he</b> shouldn't have <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{to suppose that}} he would make no change.|$|R
6000|$|... "None whatever---at once, if you like. This way, my dear Sir; this way," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{across the}} passage, into the dining-room.|$|E
60|$|And issuing {{from behind}} the counter, and taking me by the arm like an old acquaintance, <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to the bar of the hotel.|$|E
60|$|We got up, and <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{on to the}} {{verandah}} which surrounded his house. We {{paused to}} look at the gay flowers that rioted in his garden.|$|E
6000|$|Gooseberry had {{followed}} {{us into the}} room. His loose eyes rolled frightfully--not in terror, but in exultation. He had made a detective-discovery on his own account. [...] "Look here, sir," [...] <b>he</b> repeated--and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to {{a table in the}} corner of the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> paused, and <b>led</b> <b>me</b> away to {{the farther}} end of the yard, for the workmen had begun to arrive and to cluster round the dipping trough.|$|R
60|$|Arrived at the Golden Anchor, where Harry put up, <b>he</b> at once <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to his room, {{and began}} {{turning over the}} {{contents}} of his chest, to see what clothing he might have, that would fit me.|$|R
6000|$|... "This way, sir," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> up the store. [...] "Miss Stone," [...] said he {{to a young}} lady, [...] "show {{this gentleman}} some red calico." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Steinar turned away, {{making no}} answer. Only Ragnar, who stood by, {{burst into a}} loud laugh. Then, putting his arm through mine, <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into the hall, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{up to my}} {{own little}} chamber, took fresh raiment for me from a press, called Lorenza and bade her bring bread and wine, vinegar and warm water.|$|E
6000|$|... “‘Can’t I? You know I {{have always}} stuck to men through {{thick and thin}} till they had enough of me. And now look at me! But inside I am as I always was. I have acted on the square to them all one after another. Only they do get tired somehow. Oh, Davy! Harry ought not to have cast me off. It was <b>he</b> that <b>led</b> <b>me</b> astray.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That black rascal {{has found}} {{something}} {{over on the}} shore of the Big River," [...] said Farmer Brown's boy to himself. [...] "I'll go over there to see what it is. There isn't much escapes the sharp eyes of that black busybody. <b>He</b> has <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to a lot of interesting things, one time and another. There he is on the top of that tree over by the Big River." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] Prescott assented. [...] "I can't {{see that}} I owe him anything, and <b>he</b> once <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into {{a piece of}} foolishness that nobody but himself could have thought of. I knew the thing was crazy, but I did it when he urged me, and I've regretted it ever since. Still, when I meet the fellow I expect I shan't have a word of blame for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> out to {{the head}} of the stair. [...] "This {{unexpected}} occurrence," [...] he said, [...] "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{off to a}} seat by {{the north}} door, between two pews, very black and silent. There we sat, he putting his gun {{carefully}} beside him. He remained perfectly still, thinking.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me,</b> {{after a few}} minutes' journey, {{into the}} cobbled yard of a bright-painted inn, on whose {{signboard}} a rising sun glimmered faintly gold, and these letters standing close above it--"The World's End." ...|$|E
5000|$|His spiritual {{testament}} begins: [...] "The Lord {{called me}} to himself with a most tender love, and with an infinite charity <b>he</b> <b>led</b> and directed <b>me</b> along the path of my life." [...] ((Saint of the Day [...] )) ...|$|R
60|$|So {{making no}} doubt {{we were off}} for a ramble, perhaps to Apsley House, in the Park, to get a sly peep at the old Duke before he retired for the night, for Harry had told me the Duke always went to bed early, I sprang up to follow him; but what was my {{disappointment}} and surprise, when <b>he</b> only <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into the passage, toward a staircase lighted by three marble Graces, unitedly holding a broad candelabra, like an elk's antlers, over the landing.|$|R
40|$|Firstly, I {{would like}} to thank my advisor, Professor Chunchi Wu, for his instruction, {{encouragement}} and great help during the whole period of my master study. It was <b>he</b> who <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into this exciting and challenging world of finance. It was he who helped me gain the courage and dedication to go further in the academic path. Through his vast knowledge and strict way in doing research, he gives me a good example of what a real scholar is like. Let me say once again: Thanks, Professor Wu...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> {{into another}} long room above, where a dry old lady {{sat at a}} frame of embroidery, and the three handsomest young women (I suppose) in Scotland stood {{together}} by a window.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here, and you'll {{know what}} I mean," [...] he answered. And <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> down the passage {{to a window}} that {{overlooked}} {{the door of the}} prison. [...] "Look at that!" [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "There ain't any," [...] {{said the}} Boy lightly. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into a many-tabled {{restaurant}} full of civilians and grey-green uniforms. At {{one end of}} the room, on a slightly raised dais, stood a big table.|$|E
5000|$|And when I {{desire to}} rejoice, my heart groaneth {{because of my}} sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted. My God hath been my support; <b>he</b> hath <b>led</b> <b>me</b> through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath {{preserved}} me upon {{the waters of the}} great deep. He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me. Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night-time. (2 Nephi 4:19-23) ...|$|R
50|$|On 27 December 2012, Bonačić joined Mes Kerman as {{head coach}} {{for the second time}} but left the team {{at the end of the}} season after leading the club at the sixth place. On 1 July 2013, he was named as the head coach of Zob Ahan, signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club. On 16 December 2013, it was announced that Luka will leave Zob Ahan in January 2014 and will be succeeded by Mojtaba Taghavi. On 23 January 2014, Luka returns as manager of Mes Kerman with signing a contract until the end of the season. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>Mes</b> Kerman to the Hazfi Cup final for the first time, however, his side lost the match 1-0 to Tractor Sazi. On 6 April, Mes Kerman relegated to the Azadegan League after a 0-0 draw with Saba Qom. He was given a one-year contract by the club to lead them in Azadegan League and promotion back Mes Kerman to the Iran Pro League at the end of the season. However, he was sacked on 11 November 2014 after poor results. On 21 November 2014, he was named as manager of Qatar Stars League side Al-Shahania.|$|R
60|$|When we arrived, Herr Delbrück rushed {{so quickly}} {{down the steps}} to meet me, that it was {{apparent}} he had been watching within. Taking me by both hands <b>he</b> solicitously <b>led</b> <b>me</b> in. The officer saluted me and was turning to withdraw, when I recognised his purpose, and insisted that he should come to my rooms. Over {{a glass of wine}} I warmly thanked him and his brave comrades for saving me. He replied simply that he was more than glad, and that Herr Delbrück had at the first taken steps to make all the searching party pleased; at which ambiguous utterance the maître d'hôtel smiled, while the officer pleaded duty and withdrew.|$|R
6000|$|... "Straight to {{his bedroom}} and his bed <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>me,</b> and, turning down the covers, showed there to me, asleep as she had slept for many a {{thousand}} years, the mummy of a slender Egyptian maid.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> resistlessly to the seat, {{away from}} {{the noise of the}} regimental band and the dancers, and then sat himself down at the far end from me, like a great surly bear that he was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{have been}} to Switzerland. I have seen the curé--a good man. He has told me {{all there is to}} tell. I found him at the hospice, busy with his oeuvre de bienfaisance. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>me</b> to her grave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{woman has}} him heart and soul," [...] he said, [...] "as is fitting, and where's the room {{between the two}} for an archer-churl to lodge? Mayhap, after all, I should have done well to take yonder Murgh for lord when I had the chance. Man, or god, or ghost, he's a fellow to my liking, and once <b>he</b> had <b>led</b> <b>me</b> through the Gates no woman would have dared to come to part us. Well, good-bye, Hugh de Cressi, till you are sick of kisses and the long shafts begin to fly again, for then you will bethink you of a certain bow and of him who alone can bend it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Do not say, [...] "It is the Lord's {{doing that}} I fell away;" [...] for He {{does not do}} what He hates. Do not say, [...] "It was <b>He</b> who <b>led</b> <b>me</b> astray;" [...] for He has no need of the sinful. The Lord hates all abominations; such things are not loved by those who fear Him. It was He who created {{humankind}} in the beginning, and He left them {{in the power of}} their own free choice. If you choose, you can keep the commandments, and to act faithfully is a matter of your own choice. He has placed before you fire and water; stretch out your hand for whichever you choose. Before each person are life and death, and whichever one chooses will be given.|$|R
6000|$|But my nerves, {{which he}} so much misjudged, were in so strange a disarray that speech was now become impossible; {{and we made}} the drive thenceforward in {{unbroken}} silence. When we arrived before the door of our destination, the young gentleman alighted, opened it with a pass-key like one who was at home, bade the driver carry the trunks into the hall, and dismissed him with a handsome fee. <b>He</b> then <b>led</b> <b>me</b> into this dining-room, looking nearly as you behold it, but with certain marks of bachelor occupancy, and hastened to pour out a glass of wine, which he insisted on my drinking. As soon as I could find my voice, [...] "In God's name," [...] I cried, [...] "where am I?" ...|$|R
