5000|$|Homeopaths {{maintain}} that this water retains some [...] "essential property" [...] {{of the original}} material, because the preparation has been shaken after each dilution. Hahnemann believed that the <b>dynamisation</b> or shaking of the solution caused a [...] "spirit-like" [...] healing force {{to be released from}} within the substance. Even though the homeopathic preparations are often extremely diluted, homeopaths {{maintain that}} a healing force is retained by these homeopathic preparations. [...] Modern advocates of homeopathy have proposed a concept of [...] "water memory", according to which water [...] "remembers" [...] the substances mixed in it, and transmits the effect of those substances when consumed. This concept is inconsistent with the current understanding of matter, and water memory has never been demonstrated to have any detectable effect, biological or otherwise. The claim often given to support [...] "water memory" [...] is that science does not fully understand water. In fact a great deal is known about the structure and properties of liquid water, from both theoretical and experimental studies, because of its importance in biochemistry, its relative molecular simplicity and the quantum mechanical nature of hydrogen bonding which make it a popular substance to study in theoretical chemistry. The actual memory of water can be measured experimentally and is found to be around 50 femtoseconds, which is 0.00000000000005 seconds. Generally considered to be pseudoscience by the scientific community, one disputed study into the so-called memory of water, conducted by Jacques Benveniste, claims to have demonstrated that water can be energetically imprinted upon. Another such study, published in 2003 by Swiss chemist Louis Rey, claims to have found that homeopathically diluted solutions of sodium chloride and lithium chloride have a very different hydrogen bond structure from normal water, as measured by thermoluminescence.|$|E

30|$|<b>Dynamisation</b> of an {{external}} fixator {{is important in}} regenerate training and consolidation of an osteotomy or fracture. One reported downside {{of the most frequently}} used hexapod, the Taylor spatial frame (TSF), is the lack of ease of achieving this. Controlled frame <b>dynamisation</b> with the TSF is not achievable easily due to the limited two-ring construct and interosseous transfixion [24]. Unlocking individual, alternate or all struts lead to an uncontrolled loss of stability in one or more planes [24]. This can be ameliorated by the use of non-standard modified shoulder bolts, which permit some motion between strut and ring, whilst preserving the overall configuration and relative stability, but this has not been proven. The OSF appears to exceed the mechanical characteristics of the Ilizarov fixator in terms of rigidity and allows controlled and safe <b>dynamisation</b> for desirable regenerate training without the risk of excessive and unwanted deformation. This may prove of clinical importance and will need to be confirmed in clinical studies.|$|E
40|$|Bacground/Aim. Intertrochanteric {{fractures}} of the femur are {{the third}} most common fractures among all bone fractures. Today in everyday orthopedic practice {{a number of different}} methods of treatment of trochanteric fractures of the femur are applied. Despite the improvement in the development of new implants, the percentage of serious complications of the treatment of these fractures remains very high, varying from 10 % to 20 %. One of the most serious complications of internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures is nonunion of fractures {{due to the lack of}} additional axial <b>dynamisation</b> of implants. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of double <b>dynamisation</b> in stable and unstable intertrochanteric fractures treatment using the self dynamisable internal fixator. Methods. During the period from 2000 to 2009 we analyzed the use of selfdynamisable internal fixator (SIF implant) in the treatment of 247 patients with stable and unstable intertrochanteric fractures. Fracture types were classified according to the AO Fracture Classification/Orthopaedic Trauma Association Scheme. Salvati and Wilson scoring systems were used for functional assessment considering pain, walking ability and hip movements of operated patients. Results. Of the total number of treated patients, 134 were males and 113 females, aged 19 to 90 (average 49. 6) years. More than a half of the patients were older than 50 years. Monitoring of the patients after the operation was carried out clinically and radiographically for a period of three to six months in all the patients, whereas a 2 -year follow-up was conducted in 176 (71. 2 %) patients. The average duration of surgery was 47 min, the average blood loss 145 mL, and the average fluoroscopy time was 16 sec (8 - 97 sec). The average time for union was 3. 7 months (3 - 6. 5 months). Double <b>dynamisation</b> (<b>dynamisation</b> along the neck and shaft of the femur) was observed in 85 (34. 4 %) patients, and was on average 4. 3 mm (1. 5 - 8 mm). All fractures managed with <b>dynamisation</b> implants healed completely within no later than six months after the surgery. In 17 cases there was a cut-out phenomenon of implant, while in seven cases there was mechanical implant failure. Complications were detected within 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery, and treated by the method of intramedullary fixation. During the study, there were no cases of infecton and thromboembolic complications detected. Conclusion. The concept of double <b>dynamisation</b> improves the fracture healing in the stable and unstable intertrochanteric fractures using the selfdynamisable internal fixator. This biological method of fixation provides healing of intertrochanteric fracture in the optimum period of time, significantly reducing the risk for mechanical failure...|$|E
40|$|Purpose As axial <b>dynamisation</b> is a {{recognised}} method, many authors using interlocking femoral nail {{perform an}} additional small operation {{two months after}} the primary operation in order to remove one screw so as to provide axial <b>dynamisation.</b> According to the literature, dynami-sation happens in about 15 – 25 % of cases, but it cannot be predicted which patient or fracture will need <b>dynamisation.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} present a new selfdynamisable implant and a minimally invasive method for the internal fixation of different femoral fractures. Materials and methods The study was conducted between 2000 and 2008 and included 849 patients with 871 fractures receiving the selfdynamisable internal fixator (SIF) for proximal, diaphyseal and distal femur fractures. Results The average operative time was 44 min (23 – 119 min) and the average fluoroscopy time was 12 s (6 – 92 s), while the average blood loss was 90 ml (60 – 250 ml) when a minimally invasive technique was used. None of the patients developed complications during the intra-operative period. Complete follow-up was available in 726 patients with 738 fractures. The healing time was 3. 9 months (3 – 9 months). Healing was achieved in 99. 1 % of patients. Superficial infection developed in seven fixations (0. 9 %), while deep infection developed in four patients (0. 5 %). Screw-breaking occurred within 6 – 18 weeks in 19 fixa-tions (2. 6 %). Cut-out phenomenon happened in 24 cases. Spontaneous axial <b>dynamisation</b> was observed in 71 (23. 8 %) out of 738 fractures, being 5 mm on average (2 – 12 mm).

Group II was treated with a fixator that was similarly unlocked at 4 to 6 weeks but included a small silicone spring which on weight-bearing could be compressed by up to 2 mm. this spring returns to its original length on cessation of weight-bearing thus allowing cycles of motion of up to 2 mm. Group III had a spring fixator like group II, but it was unlocked from the start to allow cyclical micromovement as soon as weight-bearing began. Fracture healing was monitored by the measurement of fracture stiffness. We defined healing as achieving a stiffness of 15 Nm per degree. The mean time was 14. 1 weeks in group I, 15. 9 weeks in group II, and 19. 3 weeks in group III. The difference between groups was statistically significant (p = 0. 004).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{manuscript}} is to present {{the results of the}} doctoral research project titled “Development of service innovation capabilities in knowledge-intensive organizations”. The rationale for carrying out the project was the disproportionately limited insight academics currently have into how knowledge intensive organisations develop and dynamise their service innovation capabilities, compared to the already very high and constantly growing importance of knowledge-intensive services in the developed economies. In order to explore this relatively under-investigated field, we have carried out six case studies in two groups of knowledge-intensive organisations – business consultancies and Research and Technology Organisations. Our work lays foundations for better understanding of the key service innovation capabilities building blocks, as well as related practices used by successful organisations. We also propose a set of concrete organisational capabilities identified as important for service innovation, namely (1) committing to service innovation, (2) spotting trends in the market, (3) partnering for service innovation, (4) dialoguing with (potential) clients, (5) inventing new service solutions (6) focusing organisational service innovation efforts, (7) locating required expertise, (8) integrating different skills and perspectives, (9) cultivating new service growth, (10) demonstrating new service value (11) leveraging organisational service experience and (12) de-contextualising developed services for future re-use. Finally, in an attempt to illustrate how organisations ensure the <b>dynamisation</b> of these capabilities in a continuous fashion in practice, we propose the following as drivers: (a) constant ‘flow’ or movement in the organisation, (b) continuous improvement philosophy, (c) regular ‘change of scenery’, (d) ‘pause and reflect’ time, (e) no-blame culture, (f) trust and openness, (g) open invitation of criticism and ideas, (h) outside-in perspective, (I) diversity, (j) empowerment, (k) simplification and (l) feedback follow up management. Based on our findings, we propose several discussion points relating to both service innovation and to the more general topic of capabilities <b>dynamisation,</b> raising some important questions about the currently dominant models of these aspects in management literature.

30|$|The {{importance}} of rotational instability in femoral diaphyseal non-unions is exemplified by attempts to encourage union through dynamising femoral nails; the subsequent union rates {{are less than}} 50 % and {{are associated with a}} risk of significant limb shortening by more than 2  cm [27, 28, 29]. <b>Dynamisation</b> increases axial loading of the fracture and should, in theory, encourage bone healing, but unless the bone ends can interlock in a way that restores rotational control, the instability and mechanical environment for healing will be made worse by the removal of {{one or more of the}} distal cross-screws.|$|E

A subgroup in which shortening was classified as large, comprising one-third of the patients in each group, had a similar extent of shortening, but more medialisation of the femoral shaft occurred in the CHS (26 %) than in the MSP (12 %) group (p = 0. 03). Five postoperative failures of fixation occurred with the CHS and none with the MSP (p = 0. 03). The marginally greater femoral shortening seen with the MSP compared with the CHS appeared to be justified by the improved control of impaction of the fracture. Biaxial <b>dynamisation</b> in unstable intertrochanteric fractures is a safe principle of treatment, which minimises the rate of postoperative failure of fixation...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The Ortho-SUV frame (OSF) {{is a novel}} hex-apod circular external fixator which draws upon the inno-vation of the Ilizarov method and the advantages of hexapod construction in the three-dimensional control of bone segments. Stability of fixation {{is critical to the}} success or failure of an external circular fixator for fracture or os-teotomy healing. In vitro biomechanical modelling study was performed comparing the stability of the OSF under load in both original form and after <b>dynamisation</b> to the Ilizarov fixator in all zones of the femur utilising optimal frame configuration. A superior performance of the OSF in terms of resistance to deforming forces in both original and dynamised forms over that of the original Ilizarov fixator was found. The OSF shows higher rigidity than the Ilizarov in the control of forces acting upon the femur. This sug-gests better stabilisation of femoral fractures and os-teotomies and thus improved healing with a reduced incidence of instability-related bone segment deformity, non-union and delayed union...|$|E
