5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing <b>gas</b> <b>delivery,</b> increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E

25|$|Gas {{flow rates}} are usually {{controlled}} by an industrial gas regulator on the cylinder, {{and may be}} measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the mixed gas, but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the delivery pressure changes.|$|E
25|$|As {{deregulation}} {{put an end}} to vertically integrated <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> and marketing, consuming regions began {{crying for}} additional pipeline capacity. In Alberta, half a continent away from America's east coast and from the San Francisco Bay, cheap gas awaited. All they needed were pipelines. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, governments generally supported throwing open to all contenders the race to build pipelines. Competition among operators moving the gas to market - not government regulation - was supposed to keep transmission costs reasonable in the new milieu.|$|E
25|$|A {{bailout bottle}} (BoB) or bailout {{cylinder}} is a scuba cylinder carried by an underwater diver {{for use as}} an emergency supply of breathing gas {{in the event of}} a primary gas supply failure. A bailout cylinder may be carried by a scuba diver in addition to the primary scuba set, or by a surface supplied diver using either free-flow or demand systems. The bailout gas is not intended for use during the dive except in an emergency. The term may be used to refer to just the cylinder, or the bailout set or emergency gas supply (EGS), which is the cylinder with the <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> system attached.|$|E

25|$|Technical divers may use diving {{equipment}} {{other than}} the usual single cylinder open circuit scuba equipment used by recreational divers. Typically, technical dives take longer than average recreational scuba dives. Because a decompression obligation prevents a diver in difficulty from surfacing immediately, {{there is a need}} for redundancy of breathing equipment. Technical divers usually carry at least two independent breathing gas sources, each with its own <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> system. In the event of a failure of one set, the second set is available as a back-up system. The backup system should allow the diver to safely return to the surface from any point of the planned dive, but may involve the intervention of other divers in the team. Stage cylinders may be dropped along the guideline for later use during the exit or for another dive.|$|E

25|$|On January 3 and 4 Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ursula Plassnik {{supported}} {{resumption of}} gas supplies by Gazprom and emphasized that a lasting solution was preferable to unilateral measures.

The statement included the opinion that demanding higher prices by blocking <b>gas</b> <b>deliveries</b> was acceptable and that the EU should find other sources.|$|R
2500|$|By early 1930, {{there was}} talk of a {{pipeline}} from Turner Valley to Toronto. [...] Estimates showed that <b>gas</b> <b>delivery</b> to Toronto would cost $2.48 per thousand cubic metres. A parliamentary committee looked into ways to force waste gas down old wells, set up carbon black plants or export the gas to the United States. [...] Another proposal called for the production of liquefied methane.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opposition}} was also {{supported by a}} perception by local Welsh people that a pipeline like {{this would not be}} permitted in England, raising echoes of the infamous drowning of Capel Celyn for a reservoir. Local councils such as Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council were pressured to speed up planning permission. Planning decisions were pushed through, {{as in the case of}} the Cilfrew Pressure Reduction Installation which was approved only by excluding certain protesting councillors from the vote, a process deemed illegal by a high court judge saying [...] "it is a wonder that anybody votes on anything". The result of this decision led the National Grid to declare a force majeure notice in April 2007 to avoid any responsibility for any delays in <b>gas</b> <b>delivery.</b> In June 2007 a High Court ruling meant the Brecon protest camp featuring tree houses and tunnels open since January was closed down with a number of protestors arrested and substantial local disruption to roads. In Peterstow Herefordshire, protestors forced the National Grid to choose another site that was more expensive but more environmentally friendly for their installation.|$|E

25|$|On January 7, all Russian {{gas flow}} through Ukraine was halted, {{completely}} cutting off supplies to Southeastern Europe, {{much of which}} is completely reliant on Russian gas, and partially {{to other parts of}} Europe. Miller stated that Gazprom had stopped all <b>gas</b> <b>deliveries</b> to Ukraine because Ukraine had closed the system down, but Naftogaz said it closed down the system because Gazprom had stopped delivering gas. According to an official statement by Gazprom, Ukraine was sabotaging the transit of gas to European countries and had practically declared a gas blockade of Europe. Prime Minister Putin accused Ukraine of blackmail, referring back to the letter Naftogaz sent to Gazprom on December 30 which threatened to confiscate European bound gas if no contract was in place. Ukraine denied the charges and blamed Russia for stopping <b>gas</b> <b>deliveries</b> to Europe. According to the Ukrainian presidential envoy for international energy security, Bohdan Sokolovsky, Ukraine had no technical capability to stop the pumping of Russian gas into its territory. He claimed that all pumping stations through which gas is supplied to Ukraine are located in Russia.|$|R
2500|$|Although Russia cut off {{supplies}} only to Ukraine, {{a number}} of European countries saw a drop in their supplies as well. [...] The European Commissioner for Energy Andris Piebalgs and several affected member states warned that blocking of <b>gas</b> <b>deliveries</b> was unacceptable. Pascal Lamy, {{director general of the}} World Trade Organisation, expressed the opinion that all Post-Soviet states should pay market prices for their energy needs in order to improve the efficiency of their economies.|$|R
