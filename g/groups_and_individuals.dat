40|$|Group {{psychotherapy}} in Germany is {{well established}} {{as part of an}} integrative treatment plan in inpatient treatment. Outpatient group psychotherapy, however, is conceptualized as a separate treatment option in competition with individual therapy. German guidelines for outpatient psychotherapy exclude concurrant <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy. Research favors studies on treatments in pure form. So publications on concurrant <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> psychotherapy are mainly descriptive and published in english. This paper describes models of simultaneous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> psychotherapy with special reference to inpatient treatment and to the psychoanalytic-interactional group psychotherapy (a treatment modality within the Goettingen modell of group psychotherapy). Outpatient treatment with concurrant <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy at the Goettingen University Student Counselling Center is described. Discussion covers pre-treatment preparation of patients, different group settings, therapists' difficulties with concurrant treatment and indications for combinations of <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy. Evidence reported suggests for outpatient treatment the use of group psychotherapy not only as an alternative to individual therapy but also as concurrant therapy with <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> sessions as parts of an integrative treatment plan. Concurrant <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> therapy offers some advantages of inpatient treatment in an outpatient setting...|$|R

5|$|Archaeological, {{linguistic}} and anecdotal {{evidence suggests that}} Taiwan's indigenous peoples have undergone a series of cultural shifts to meet the pressures of contact with other societies and new technologies. Beginning in the early 17th century, Taiwanese aborigines faced broad cultural change as the island became incorporated into the wider global economy by a succession of competing colonial regimes from Europe and Asia;. In some cases groups of aborigines resisted colonial influence, but other <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>individuals</b> readily aligned with the colonial powers. This alignment could be leveraged to achieve personal or collective economic gain, collective power over neighboring villages or freedom from unfavorable societal customs and taboos involving marriage, age-grade and child birth.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{suffrage}} in Wales {{has historically}} been marginalised due to the prominence of societies and political groups in England which led the reform for women throughout the United Kingdom.

Nevertheless, distinct Welsh <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>individuals</b> rose to prominence and were vocal in the rise of suffrage in Wales and the rest of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz was {{involved}} in unofficial negotiations between the U.S. and Sudanese governments in 1996 and 1997 to obtain access to Sudan's intelligence files on Osama bin Laden and the early remnants of Al-Qaeda's network there after efforts to extradite bin Laden to the U.S. failed in early 1996. In the same year, the United States Congress imposed sanctions against Khartoum over allegations of harboring and abetting terrorist cells on its soil. In early 1996, CIA and State Department officials held secret meetings near Washington D.C. with Sudan's then-defense minister, El Fatih Erwa. In May 1996, bin Laden left Sudan for Afghanistan {{under pressure from the}} United States when the meetings failed to reconcile U.S. demands made of Khartoum about its record in aiding, abetting and harboring known terrorist <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>individuals.</b>|$|E

5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>individuals</b> associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist <b>groups</b> <b>and</b> <b>individuals</b> responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
