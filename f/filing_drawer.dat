40|$|In 1979, Robert Rosenthal {{coined the}} term “file drawer problem ” to {{describe}} the tendency of researchers to publish positive results much more readily than negative results, skewing our ability to discern exactly what an accumulating body of knowledge actually means [1]. He posited the worse-case scenario for experimental trials: journals filled with 5 percent of the studies that show type 1 errors (i. e., find positive results when no positive effect exists), and <b>file</b> <b>drawers</b> filled with 95 percent of the studies that show nonsignificant results. In 1979, sans Watergate-style break-ins, there were few means to estimate how many papers were stuffed into the <b>file</b> <b>drawers.</b> In 2008, former Food and Drug Administration reviewer Erick Turner et al. pried open the <b>file</b> <b>drawer</b> by examining the FDA registry and results database on all phase II and III clinical trials for 12 antidepressant agents approved by th...|$|R

40|$|For {{any given}} {{research}} area, one cannot tell how {{many studies have}} been con-ducted but never reported. The extreme view of the "file drawer problem " is that journals are filled with the 5 % of the studies that show Type I errors, while the <b>file</b> <b>drawers</b> are filled with the 95 % of the studies that show non-significant results. Quantitative procedures for computing the tolerance for filed and future null results are reported and illustrated, and the implications are discussed. Both behavioral researchers and statisti-cians have long suspected that the studies published in the behavioral sciences are a biased sample of the studies that are actually carried out (Bakan, 1967; McNemar, 1960; Smart, 1964; Sterling, 1959). The extreme view of this problem, the "file drawer prob-lem, " is that the journals are filled with the 5 % of the studies that show Type I errors, while the <b>file</b> <b>drawers</b> back at the lab are filled with the 95 % of the studies that show nonsignificant (e. g., p>. 05) results.

40|$|Concerns {{exist within}} {{the medical and}} {{psychological}} sciences that many published research findings are not replicable. Guidelines accordingly recommend that the <b>file</b> <b>drawer</b> effect should be eliminated and that statistical significance {{should not be a}} criterion in the decision to submit and publish scientific results. By means of a simulation study, we show that selectively publishing effects that differ significantly from the cumulative meta-analytic effect evokes the Proteus phenomenon of poorly replicable and alternating findings. However, the simulation also shows that the selective publication approach yields a scientific record that is content rich as compared to publishing everything, in the sense that fewer publications are needed for obtaining an accurate meta-analytic estimation of the true effect. We conclude that, under the assumption of self-correcting science, the <b>file</b> <b>drawer</b> effect can be beneficial for the scientific collective.

A more important contribution to the likelihood of publication was research productivity, and researchers whose first study was published {{were more likely to}} have continued their work. The impetus for this study was a concern about a possible bias favoring publication of studies showing positive findings over those supporting the null hypothesis in research on the human menstrual cycle.

50|$|In 1918, the Record Card Company first {{registered}} Oxford as a brand name. The {{success of}} the Oxford brand led the company to change its name in 1921 to the Oxford Filing Supply Company.

In 1939, the company began making expanding envelopes and introduced the convenience of file folder labels in rolls, as well as corrugated board transfer <b>files</b> in a <b>drawer</b> style. The company's most significant advance, however, was the Oxford Pendaflex hanging file folder. This was the now familiar filing pouch that hooked over the sides of a <b>file</b> <b>drawer.</b> Smaller <b>files</b> placed inside the hanging <b>file</b> allowed the <b>drawer</b> to be easily subdivided.

40|$|Publication bias arises {{whenever}} {{the probability that}} a study is published depends on the statistical significance of its results. This bias, often called the file-drawer effect since the unpublished results are imagined to be tucked away in researchers' file cabinets, is potentially a severe impediment to combining the statistical results of studies collected from the literature. With almost any reasonable quantitative model for publication bias, {{only a small number of}} studies lost in the file-drawer will produce a significant bias. This result contradicts the well known Fail Safe <b>File</b> <b>Drawer</b> (FSFD) method for setting limits on the potential harm of publication bias, widely used in social, medical and psychic research. This method incorrectly treats the <b>file</b> <b>drawer</b> as unbiased, and almost always misestimates the seriousness of publication bias. A large body of not only psychic research, but medical and social science studies, has mistakenly relied on this method to validate claimed discoveries.

Such certainty is virtually impossible to achieve in literature surveys. Comment: 31 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Today {{unpublished}} or “file drawer” {{experiments are}} {{the impetus for}} trial registration and reporting of all results. In 1801, Joseph Carpue, the father of modern plastic surgery, did a <b>file</b> <b>drawer</b> experiment for Benjamin West, who was President of the Royal Academy of Arts. George III had commissioned West to create the largest stained glass window ever created whose theme, the Crucifixion, was based upon Michelangelo's drawing. Subsequently, West suffered a series of political, professional and economic setbacks. In the summer of 1801, West's project was delayed. By the fall, West hoped that independent scientific confirmation of his design could salvage the project. West approached Carpue who obtained a murderer's fresh corpse that he crucified and documented the results with plaster casts created by sculptor Thomas Banks. Carpue's experiment showed that West's window design wrongly depicted the Crucifixion because West had posed the hands and shoulders incorrectly. West died in 1820 without ever being associated with Carpue's experiment. Carpue's obituary in The Lancet in 1846 contained Carpue's handwritten note that described the experiment but not West's Royal commission. As no records or publications associate the cast with West project, this can {{be considered to be}} a <b>file</b> <b>drawer</b> experiment. After 1801, West made further drawings of the Crucifixion that showed the figures in the same position as the cast. Nineteenth century auction catalogues suggest that West made a corrected Crucifixion painting, but its current location remains a mystery...|$|R
