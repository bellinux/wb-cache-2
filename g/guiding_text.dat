Two groups of writers, varying in the extent to which their writing is assumed to be directed towards rhetorical goals, were asked to write either planned or non-planned texts. Key-stroke logs were collected, and changes in subjective understanding about the topic were measured.

5000|$|..... {{took part}} in a very intense debate {{regarding}} the peasants. The debate took place throughout Latin America and especially in Mexico, which partially were resonating to a world debate. The topic of this debate allowed me to advance a radical critique of Marxism’s well-known position on the peasants. I was classified as a 'campesinista' in contrast to various other intellectual positions, in a debate basically celebrated within the Marxist framework. Even though I continued, for a long time, to consider myself a Marxist, little by little I abandoned Marxism as a doctrine and as a political and ideological orientation. ... In that process, through which I came closer and closer in contact with the concrete activities of peasants, I was able to question the categories of all the disciplines in which I had been educated or which I had learned on my own. I began to formulate a radical critique of development. This change in my thinking could be clearly seen in the name of an umbrella organization, Analysis, Development and Gestión, created in 1979 to coordinate the actions of many other NGOs we had constituted in that period....I suspect that the most important rupture in my life occurred when I began to remember my experiences with my grandmother as a child. She could not come to our house in Mexico City through the front door because she was an Indian. She was not allowed by my mother to talk to us in Zapotec or tell us stories about her community. My mother assumed that the best she could do for her children was to radically uproot them from their Indian ancestry. But I adored my grandmother and during holidays asked to be sent with her, to Oaxaca. Remembering my grandmother, remembering what she taught me in spite of the restrictions imposed by my mother -something I had {{in the back of my}} mind through my previous journey-, re-membered me with the people at the grassroots. I described this experience in a text written in 1986 and which I still consider an important <b>guiding</b> <b>text,</b> “Regenerating People’s Space.” In this text I alluded to the new questions that I began to ask myself in that time, and also some of the ways in which I began to confront them. My theoretical work on people of the margins, which was abundant in those years, very clearly shows a new path which was consolidated and affirmed when I met Ivan Illich in 1983.The rupture with previous ways of thinking and acting is clearly evident in the 80s. What I did and what I wrote clearly illustrates it. I still, however, found myself, especially in the sphere of ideas, rooted in the Western horizon of intelligibility. Only after moving to live in the Zapotec village of San Pablo Etla, in Oaxaca, in 1989, and after my involvement with the Zapatistas starting in 1994, was I able to abandon that horizon and seriously entertain the possibility that a new horizon had appeared for me, even though I was still not able to fully articulate it.|$|E
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the "Ruhnama", the "Book of the Spirit" of Turkmenistan's late President Saparmurat Niiazov (d. 2006), {{and its influence}} on history writing and teaching in Turkmenistan. I argue that the book was initially not intended as a history book but as an epos: it describes the customs {{and values of the}} ancient Turkmens and the epical heroes of the Turkmen tradition as models for the nation of today. Consistent with the traditional political functions of epics, the "Ruhnama" (2001) projected a unified identity of the Turkmen tribes back into the past, and legitimized the poitical order of the country after independence. Under Niiazov no Turkmen history schoolbooks were published, and the "Ruhnama" served as a <b>guiding</b> <b>text</b> for history teachers who had no other 'official' materials. Under Niiazov's successor, President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, new course books came out in 2008. In the new history books for the lower classes, the "Ruhnama" continues to be important, and history is still organized according to the epic epochs as described in the "Ruhnama". By contrast, the new textbooks for upper classes largely bypass the "Ruhnama"and its author. Yet while Niiazov is gradually removed from the realm of all-pervasive political leadership into the corner of epics, current president Berdimuhamedov's public representation still draws on narrative structures and techniques reminiscent of the "Ruhnama"...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the notion of}} a scholarship of teaching. Such scholarship is displayed through a teacher&# 039;s grasp of, and response to, the relationships between knowledge of content, teaching and learning in ways that attest to practice as being complex and interwoven. Yet attempting to capture teachers&# 039; professional knowledge is difficult because the critical links between practice and knowledge, for many teachers, is tacit. Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) offers one way of capturing, articulating and portraying an aspect of the scholarship of teaching and, in this case, the scholarship of science teaching. The research underpinning the approach developed by Loughran, Berry and Mulhall offers access {{to the development of the}} professional knowledge of science teaching in a form that offers new ways of sharing and disseminating this knowledge. Through this Resource Folio approach (comprising CoRe and PaP-eRs) a recognition of the value of the specialist knowledge and skills of science teaching is not only highlighted, but also enhanced. The CoRe and PaP-eRs methodology offers an exciting new way of capturing and portraying science teachers&# 039; pedagogical content knowledge so that it might be better understood and valued within the profession. This book is a concrete example of the nature of scholarship in science teaching that is meaningful, useful and immediately applicable in the work of all science teachers (preservice, in-service and science teacher educators). It is an excellent resource for science teachers as well as a <b>guiding</b> <b>text</b> for teacher education. Understanding teachers&# 039; professional knowledge is critical to our efforts to promote quality classroom practice. While PCK offers such a lens, the construct is abstract. In this book, the authors have found an interesting and engaging way of making science teachers&# 039; PCK concrete, useable, and meaningful for researchers and teachers alike. It offers a new and exciting way of understandin...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT UNDERSTANDING THE IN-SCHOOL LITERACIES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES THROUGH A SOCIOCULTURAL PARADIGM: IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT by AARON M. JOHNSON May 2016 Advisor: Dr. Gina DeBlase Major: Curriculum and Instruction Degree: Doctor of Philosophy There {{has been}} great debate about the reasons why African American male {{students}} reject the institution of school and school related content. Furthermore, data from multiple sources, including, national and local assessments and governmental studies, document a gap in achievement and school retention rates between African American students and their White counterparts. The data substantiates the notions that African American males have an aversion to the pedagogy of their teachers, schools’ environments, and the cultural mores {{and values of the}} institution of school that often run counter to their home or community values. This study explored how immersing teachers in a book club model of professional development could encourage them to use the practice in their classrooms and to use literacy as a means to connect students to the institution of school and school-related content. The book club model is heavily anchored in Vygotskian theory, and this study used Vygotsky’s social learning theory as a foundational theoretical framework while exposing teachers to a professional development series that encouraged them to address their perceptions of students by participating in inquiry about their instructional practice. Accordingly, teachers were asked to reflect on their pedagogy, text selections for their African America male students, and their thoughts about the nature of literacy and its components. The {{purpose of this study was}} twofold: 1) to engage teachers in professional development aimed at providing evidence-based literacy strategies to use with their students; and 2) to assist teachers to make connections between their perceptions of their African American students and their pedagogical decisions. The history of African Americans in this country, Supreme Court cases related to school desegregation, and the sociopolitical ideals of this nation were used as a backdrop to contextualize the current academic pandemic that faces African American children. This study used Tatum (2005) as the <b>guiding</b> <b>text</b> and his nesting ground framework was the main construct upon which the activities, conversations, and solutions were grounded. It was understood that human thought is varied and nuanced; therefore, it was necessary to employ a qualitative methodology using a sociocultural paradigm to understand how to improve teachers’ understandings of their students. Also, a robust data collection methodology was used to ensure that the findings could answer questions of validity and reliability...|$|E

An experiment designed to test this prediction is then described. The results confirm that dispositionally produced new ideas are relatively more conceptually coherent than new ideas produced to satisfy rhetorical goals...|$|R

Moreover, certain words and morphemes are removed from the query as they are considered to have little semantic value. The system checks every query against a stop list of such words and morphemes. Other processing methods, e. g. reversing the search phrase word order and allowing “zero or more words ” between the search target words, are also utilized.
