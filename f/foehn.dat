5|$|In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, {{northwest}} winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, {{the region}} is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the <b>foehn.</b> The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Chūgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight <b>foehn</b> effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|During the storm's passage, {{there were}} 61daily {{rainfall}} records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant slope failures and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment {{displaced by the}} rains was estimated at 4,456m3/km2, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630m3 (2,066ft3) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in Kagawa and Tokushima prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115km/h (72mph) in Muroto. A station on Tobishima in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119km/h (74mph). The typhoon spawned a F1 tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In Wajima, Ishikawa, Nabi produced a <b>Foehn</b> wind, causing temperatures to rise quickly.|$|E
5|$|During 4January, Rewa {{moved back}} into the South Pacific basin and {{continued}} eastward as a weakening category 3severe tropical cyclone, with the FMS estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150km/h (90mph). During the next day, its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa's circulation by creating a hot and dry <b>Foehn</b> wind. The FMS reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm. The system subsequently made landfall {{in the vicinity of}} Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it emerged near Thio from the east coast during 6 January. By 7January, Rewa's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies; as a result both the FMS and JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression. Over the next 3 days, the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands. During 10 January, Rewa's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin and {{back into the}} Australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone, as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size.|$|E
25|$|Strong winds {{over the}} Alps became <b>foehn</b> wind and caused unseasonally high {{temperatures}} in Italy (up to 25°C/77°F in Turin).|$|E
25|$|Southwesterly winds further {{warmed by}} <b>foehn</b> wind can give warm {{temperatures}} in narrow Norwegian fjords in winter; Tafjord has recorded 17.9°C in January and Sunndal 18.9°C in February.|$|E
25|$|Compared to Western Europe, Slovenia is {{not very}} windy, because it lies in the {{slipstream}} of the Alps. The average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries. Due to the rugged terrain, local vertical winds with daily periods are present. Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the bora, the jugo, and the <b>foehn.</b> The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The <b>foehn</b> {{is typical of the}} Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia. Generally present in Slovenia are the northeast wind, the southeast wind and the north wind.|$|E
25|$|According to the Köppen climate classification, Como has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa); winters are not long, but foggy, damp and chilly with occasional periods of frost from the siberian anticyclone; spring and autumn are well marked and pleasant, while summer {{can be quite}} oppressive, hot and humid. Wind is quite rare; only sudden bursts of <b>foehn</b> or thunderstorms manage to sweep the air clean.|$|E
25|$|Zürich has, {{depending}} on the definition used, an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb), with four distinct seasons. Decisive for the climate of Zürich are both the winds from westerly directions, which often result in precipitation and, on the other hand, the Bise (east or north-east wind), which is usually associated with high-pressure situations, but cooler weather phases with temperatures lower than the average. The <b>Foehn</b> wind, which {{plays an important role}} in the northern alpine valleys also has some impact on Zürich.|$|E
25|$|The Rs.I was {{completed}} by October 1915 and rolled out at Seemos for trials. On 23 October, during a taxi test, the port propeller and/or gearbox parted company with the aircraft, causing damage to the gearbox mountings and the upper wing. The opportunity was taken to move the outboard engines into nacelles identical to that of centre engine, and mount them between the wings on an independent structure with catwalks to enable engineers to attend to engines in flight. This gave much better clearance from spray for the propellers, which was probably {{the cause of the}} port gearbox/propeller failure. Taxiing trials recommenced, but with little success. On 21 December 1915 a <b>Foehn</b> wind blew up during trials. Unable to beach the giant flying boat, attempts were made to ride out the storm on the lake, but the moorings gave and the Rs.I was dashed to pieces on the lakeside rocks.|$|E
25|$|Most of Cafayate {{region in}} Salta {{is located at}} 5,446 feet (1,660 meters) above sea levels in the river delta between the Rio Calchaqui and the Rio Santa Maria. The climate of the area {{experiences}} a <b>foehn</b> effect which traps rain producing cloud cover {{in the mountains and}} leaves the area dry and sunny. Despite its high altitude daytime temperatures in the summertime can reach 100°F (38°C) but at night the area experiences a wide diurnal temperature variation with night time temperatures dropping as low as 54°F (12°C). There is some threat of frost during the winter when temperatures can drop as low as 21°F (-6°C). Despite producing less than 2% of Argentina's yearly wine production, the Cafayate region is increasing gaining in prestige and appearance on wine labels, as well as foreign investment from worldwide wine producers such as enologist Michel Rolland and California wine producer Donald Hess.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} half year, {{the air on}} the Swiss Plateau can stay still, with little {{exchange}} to rest of the atmosphere, building a lake of cold air on the plateau and often a ceiling of high fog. The clouds look like an ocean of fog when seen from above, (usually around 800m) and hence is called the 'nebelmeer'. This weather is called inversion because the temperature below the fog {{is lower than the}} temperature above. Sometimes, it lasts for days or even for weeks, during which the neighbouring regions of the Alps and the Jura can have the brightest sunshine. Typical for the high fog is the bise, a cold wind from northeast. Since it is channelled by the Swiss Plateau narrowing in southwest, it reaches its major strength in the lake Geneva region where wind speeds of 60km/h with top speeds of more than 100km/h are usual in typical bise weather. The regions near the Alps of the central and eastern plateau sometimes have temperature rises due to the warm <b>foehn</b> wind.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Antarctic Division {{conducted}} {{an expedition to}} Heard Island during the austral summer of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on avian and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, {{in an effort to}} determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable echo sounder, the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of <b>Foehn</b> winds on glacier mass balance. Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat GPS surface surveys revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the ablation zone and the accumulation zone of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching dynamic equilibrium. The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E

As such, the temperature may rise as much as [...] in a few hours, with humidity approaching 0% during a Zonda wind event. In contrast, cold waves are also common, owing to the Andes channeling cold air from the south, allowing cold fronts to come frequently during the winter months, causing cool to cold temperatures with temperatures that can fall below freezing. Temperatures can dip below [...] at the higher altitudes.|$|E
500|$|The {{region is}} mostly mountainous, {{characterized}} by steep river valleys. Elevations in the Chetco River watershed range from sea level to [...] {{at the summit}} of Pearsoll Peak. Precipitation averages between [...] per year, with October through June being the wettest months. Seventy percent of surface runoff is collected from rain, and 30percent from rain on snow. Twenty-five separate wetlands totaling [...] {{have been identified in}} the watershed. Temperatures average between , although the Brookings effect (or Chetco effect; similar to a <b>foehn</b> wind) often brings localized hot weather to the Brookings area. The increase in temperature is caused by the geography of the region; cool air funnels down the Chetco River valley from the Siskiyou and Coast ranges, gradually heating up before eventually reaching Brookings as a warm wind. The mountains also shield the area from cool marine layers. Partially {{as a result of this}} phenomenon, Brookings recorded its highest temperature ever, , on July 8, 2008.|$|E
500|$|In mountainous areas, local {{distortion}} of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as rotors, which can be topped by lenticular clouds. Strong updrafts, downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by the}} rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as upslope flow, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed. Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds are warm and dry. In Europe downwind of the Alps, they are known as <b>foehn.</b> In Poland, an example is the halny wiatr. In Argentina, the local name for downsloped winds is zonda. In Java, the local name for such winds is koembang. In New Zealand, they are known as the Nor'west arch, and are accompanied by the cloud formation they are named after that has inspired artwork over the years. In the Great Plains of the United States, the winds are known as a chinook. In California, downsloped winds are funneled through mountain passes, which intensify their effect, and examples include the Santa Ana and sundowner winds. Wind speeds during downslope wind effect can exceed [...]|$|E

With the more regular [...] one for the coldest month, Salzburg would be a four-season oceanic climate with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called Schnürlregen in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced <b>foehn</b> winds regularly occur.|$|E
2500|$|Dunedin has {{relatively}} low rainfall {{in comparison to}} many of New Zealand's cities, with only some [...] recorded per year.

Prevailing wind in the city is mainly a sometimes cool southwesterly and during late spring will alternate with northeasterlies. Warmer, dry northwest winds are also characteristic <b>Foehn</b> winds from the northwest.

5000|$|The leeward {{edge of an}} {{extensive}} mass of orographic clouds may be quite distinct. On the leeward side of the mountain, the air flowing downward {{is known as a}} <b>foehn</b> wind. Because some of the moisture that has condensed {{on the top of the}} mountain has precipitated, the <b>foehn</b> (or föhn) is drier, and the lower moisture content causes the descending air mass to warm up more than it had cooled down during ascent. The distinct cut-off line which forms along and parallel to the ridge line is sometimes known as a <b>foehn</b> wall (or föhn wall). This is because the edge appears stationary and it often appears to have an abrupt wall-like edge. A <b>foehn</b> wall is a common feature along the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies.|$|E
