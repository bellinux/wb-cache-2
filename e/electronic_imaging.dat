25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other <b>electronic</b> <b>imaging</b> device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This work {{reports the}} {{extension}} of a semiempirical method based on the correlation ratios to convert <b>electronic</b> portal <b>imaging</b> devices transit signals into in vivo doses for the step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiotherapy Siemens beams. The dose reconstructed at the isocenter point Diso, compared to the planned dose, Diso,TPS, and a γ-analysis between 2 -dimensional <b>electronic</b> portal <b>imaging</b> device images obtained day to day, seems to supply a practical method to verify the beam delivery reproducibility. Method: The <b>electronic</b> portal <b>imaging</b> device images were obtained by the superposition of many segment fields, and the algorithm for the Diso reconstruction for intensity-modulated radiotherapy step and shoot was formulated using a set of simulated intensity-modulated radiotherapy beams. Moreover, the in vivo dose-dedicated software was integrated with the record and verify system of the centers. Results: Three radiotherapy centers applied the in vivo dose procedure at 30 clinical intensity-modulated radiotherapy treatments, each one obtained with 5 or 7 beams, and planned for patients undergoing radiotherapy for prostatic tumors. Each treatment beam was checked 5 times, obtaining 900 tests of the ratios R = Diso/Diso,TPS. The average R value was equal to 1. 002 ± 0. 056 (2 standard deviation), while the mean R value for each patient was well within 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of mechanical and <b>electronic</b> microwave <b>imaging</b> systems with high frame rates {{will now be}} pursued for over 15 years, and there exist several different technically challenging imaging techniques with impressive frame rates.

In this work it is shown that a new fully <b>electronic</b> microwave <b>imaging</b> system can be realized with a combination of the method of aperture synthesis and the directional beam steering by frequency shift, based on a slotted-waveguide antenna.

40|$|In {{external}} beam radiotherapy, <b>electronic</b> portal <b>imaging</b> {{becomes more and}} more an indispensable tool for the verification of the patient setup. For the safe clinical introduction of high dose conformal radiotherapy like intensity modulated radiation therapy, on-line patient setup verification is a prerequisite to ensure that the planned dosimetric coverage of the tumor volume is actually realized in the patient. Since the direction of setup fields often deviates {{from the direction of the}} treatment beams, extra dose is delivered to the patient during the acquisition of these portal images which may reach clinical relevance. The aim of this work was to develop a new acquisition mode for the PortalVision aS 500 <b>electronic</b> portal <b>imaging</b> device from Varian Medical Systems that allows one to take portal images with reduced dose while keeping good image quality. The new acquisition mode, called RadMode, selectively enables and disables beam pulses during image acquisition allowing one to stop wasting valuable dose during the initial acquisition of "reset frames.
