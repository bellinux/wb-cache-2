The headmaster's house at Trinity was erected circa 1877. The site operated as several different teaching institutions until it was purchased by the Anglican Church, becoming known as Trinity Grammar School in 1925. Trinity Grammar {{is one of many}} wealthy schools in New South Wales, and has previously received some of the largest <b>government</b> <b>subsidies,</b> when comparing total <b>government</b> <b>subsidies</b> per school.

However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with <b>government</b> <b>subsidies</b> to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.|$|E

30|$|The major {{results of}} the {{analyses}} are as follows: First, two short-term and technical outputs such as publications and patents had a statistically significant positive (+) correlation with <b>government</b> <b>subsidy,</b> respectively, while the positive (+) correlation between commercialization sales and <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> was not statistical significant. Second, contrary to the first hypothesis, when the influence of <b>government</b> R&D <b>subsidy</b> size was controlled, there was {{no statistically significant difference}} in the efficiency between R&D collaboration types. However, JV-Type 3 (i.e., SME-University-Laboratory Joint-Venture) was relatively superior to the others, which achieved the largest median as well as the smallest IQR of DEA efficiency scores. Third, the efficiency differences were statistically significant between <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> sizes, and the phenomenon of diseconomies of scale was identified on the whole. As the <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> size increases, the central measures of DEA efficiency scores are reduced, but the dispersion measures rather tend to get larger. In summary, Hypothesis 2 is accepted completely with the statistical significance. Meantime, Hypothesis 1 can be partially accepted based on the comparisons of the descriptive statistics of DEA efficiency scores. In particular, the nonparametric analysis framework proposed in this study and the findings by using this framework can be the major contribution of the present study to the literature.|$|R

In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E

The Canadiens denied the report, however Molson hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to examine its future involvement in sports.

5|$|Research {{published}} by Bloomberg New Energy Finance in February 2016 predicts that as battery prices continue to fall, light-duty electric vehicles without <b>government</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{will be as}} affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by the mid-2020s. As a result, the study forecasts that annual sales of electric vehicles will hit 41 million by 2040, representing 35% of new light duty vehicle sales. In another scenario the study considers that if new carsharing services are successful, together with the adoption of autonomous cars, they could boost electric-vehicle market share to 50% of new car saless by 2040. On the other hand, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in its 2015 World Oil Outlook projected that the market share of battery electric cars and fuel cell cars will remain below 1% in 2040, while the share of hybrid electric cars is projected to grow from 1% in 2013 to 14% in 2040.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to {{the ups and downs}} of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with <b>government</b> <b>subsidies.</b> At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Beijing metro {{system is}} owned by a {{state-owned}} company {{on behalf of the}} government who fully financed its construction. The service provision and equipment replacement are delegated to semi-private or state-owned operating companies. To meet the public affordability, the fare in Beijing metro system is heavily regulated by the government. The fare income however does not cover the cost of operating company. <b>Government</b> <b>subsidy</b> is therefore required to ensure the sustainable operation of Beijing metro. Cost-plus and fixed-price contracts are commonly used subsidy contract, but they lack incentives {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>government</b> <b>subsidy.</b> This paper proposes introduction of incentives to the contract to reduce the amount of <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> while the resulting equipment reliability does not compromise service quality and safety. In the proposed contract, the government first pays an agreed sum and then shares the deviation of the final cost from the agreed price with the operating company. An illustrative study demonstrates that the proposed incentive scheme is able to encourage the operating companies to reduce their costs and thus the <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> while the level of service safety and quality are upheld...|$|R
5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints {{from the likes of}} Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised <b>government</b> <b>subsidies</b> to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E
