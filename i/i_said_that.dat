She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I would accept them both.|$|E

500|$|Critics commended the episode's music, with Mulkern {{comparing}} {{the use of}} [...] "Con te partirò" [...] in [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] to its use in Benidorm, in which Pemberton starred, but noted that in [...] "The 12 Days of Christine" [...] it was used [...] "with devastating effect". Ellen E Jones, writing in The Independent, said that the song [...] "was deployed on the soundtrack to devastating effect - we'll be humming it uneasily for another 12 days to come." [...] Writers for <b>i</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> viewers would be [...] "mournfully humming" [...] the song [...] "for 12 days to come".|$|E

I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose {{that they were going to}} turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously should have done it.|$|E
500|$|At {{the press}} conference in Hamburg, I was asked if Michael, Eve and Lucifer were {{historical}} figures {{of the past and}} I answered that they exist now, for example Lucifer in New York. In my work, I have defined Lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion, of anarchy. He uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation. He does not know love. After further questions about the events in America, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> such a plan appeared to be Lucifer's greatest work of art. Of course I used the designation [...] "work of art" [...] to mean the work of destruction personified in Lucifer. In the context of my other comments this was unequivocal.|$|E
500|$|In October 2007, MTV {{reported}} that Hot Chip {{was planning to}} give [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] to Kylie Minogue. Other reports incorrectly suggested that Hot Chip had written Made in the Darks second single, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] specifically for Minogue. Taylor explained {{that it was a}} misunderstanding; [...] "It started because someone asked me if we would ever write for Kylie. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] would probably be the most suitable. From that, I got misquoted. We didn't write [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] for Kylie, didn't send it to her and she never heard it." ...|$|E

500|$|The use of {{a safety}} car to start the race had a mixed {{response}} within the sport. Coulthard agreed with the FIA's decision: [...] "I know {{there will be a}} debate over it but the fact is I was asked beforehand and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> based on the previous years we've had here, the safest thing is to have a safety-car start". He added that although the safety-car start eliminated overtaking, it also prevented a major accident. Ralf Schumacher also agreed with the decision to start under safety-car conditions. However, ITV commentator and former driver Martin Brundle felt that the track was not wet enough for a safety car. Journalist Nigel Roebuck said that the length of time under safety-car conditions was inadequate, and raised the possibility of abandoning standing starts. FIA race director Charlie Whiting consulted Coulthard, the drivers' representative, before making his decision.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the album's release, musicians {{who had worked with}} Idol in the past were asked to comment on the failure of Cyberpunk. Tony James of Sigue Sigue Sputnik, a pop-cyberpunk band, and former bassist for Generation X, weighed in. Though sympathetic to his former band mate, he felt the stylistic change didn't fit Idol. [...] "Billy is always cool but he does Billy Idol rebel yellin the best, i felt cyberpunk was a wrong turning for him..he has his sound..stay great as u are Bill..." [...] In 2001 Steve Stevens was asked if Idol's declining popularity and the failure of Cyberpunk was related to their split. Stevens rejected the idea, saying of the failed album, [...] "I think the Cyberpunk record people didn't get. I think I would be doing Billy and his fans a great disservice if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he needed me for his popularity." ...|$|E
500|$|Yiddish theatre {{composer}} Herman Yablokoff {{claimed in}} his biography, Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage, that the melody to [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was plagiarized from his song [...] "Shvayg mayn harts" [...] ("Hush My Heart"), {{which he wrote}} for his play Papirosn (1935). When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. He offered me $10,000 to withdraw the suit. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the money was not important, but I wanted him {{to admit that the}} song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E

500|$|Francisco Vázquez de Coronado {{describes}} his 1541 encounter with [...] "Two {{kinds of people}} travel around these plains with the cows; one is called Querechos and the others Teyas; they are very well built, and painted, and are enemies of each other. They have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows. They kill all of these they wish, and tan the hides, with which they clothe themselves and make their tents, and they eat the flesh, sometimes even raw, and they also even drink the blood when thirsty. The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are tied at the top, and when they go {{from one place to}} another they carry them on some dogs they have, of which they have many, and they load them with the tents and poles and other things, for the country is so level, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> they can make use of these, because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground. The sun is what they worship most." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E
500|$|Gibbes {{handed over}} command of No.3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19April 1943. With his rank of {{squadron}} leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, until October. While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No.464 Squadron RAAF, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, {{he gave a}} series of morale-building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students: [...] "So I, you know, went round and lied like hell. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{it was all a}} [...]" [...] In January 1944, he joined No.2 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Mildura, Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March. He worked with Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No.2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1July. In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory, flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No.80 Wing. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, [...] "a little dark-haired popsy" [...] named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23January 1945.|$|E

500|$|Havers {{returned}} to Coronation Street on 17 February 2012. While appearing on Loose Women the previous year, Havers {{revealed that he}} had been in talks with Coronation Street producers about a return to the show. He stated that he had adored his role as Lewis and that he had to return and apologise to Audrey. Later that year, ITV announced that Havers would return to Coronation Street in 2012 to reprise his role as Lewis. Series producer Phil Collinson said that Havers had started filming his scenes in January 2012 and he would return on-screen from February. Collinson also said that Lewis would have a lot of ground to cover to win Audrey back, that the character is [...] "a great hoot" [...] and that it was wonderful to have Havers back. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star wrote that [...] Lewis' return storyline would show Audrey and her daughter, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), unexpectedly meeting Lewis at a country pub. Havers told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Lewis then tries to convince them he is his own twin brother, Hugh. Havers said, [...] "Audrey is totally floored to see him again— as you can imagine. And if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!" [...] Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.|$|E
500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> because I think you can do it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E
