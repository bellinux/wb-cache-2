Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility).

25|$|The moment <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> is a {{structural}} analysis method for statically indeterminate beams and frames developed by Hardy Cross. It {{was published in}} 1930 in an ASCE journal. The method only accounts for flexural effects and ignores axial and shear effects. From the 1930s until computers began to be widely used {{in the design and}} analysis of structures, the moment <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> was the most widely practiced method.|$|E
25|$|In {{the moment}} <b>distribution</b> <b>method,</b> every joint of the {{structure}} to be analysed is fixed so as to develop the fixed-end moments. Then each fixed joint is sequentially released and the fixed-end moments (which {{by the time of}} release are not in equilibrium) are distributed to adjacent members until equilibrium is achieved. The moment <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> in mathematical terms can be demonstrated as the process of solving a set of simultaneous equations by means of iteration.|$|E

25|$|The {{flexural}} stiffness (EI/L) {{of a member}} is represented {{as the product of}} the modulus of elasticity (E) and the second moment of area (I) divided by the length (L) of the member.

25|$|Landline {{teleprinter}} operations {{began in}} 1849 when a circuit {{was put in}} service between Philadelphia and New York City. Émile Baudot designed a system using a five unit code in 1874 that is still in use today. Teleprinter system design was gradually improved until, {{at the beginning of}} World War II, it represented the principal <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> used by the news services.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of MDAC was {{released}} in August 1996. At that time Microsoft stated MDAC was more a concept than a stand-alone program and had no widespread <b>distribution</b> <b>method.</b> Later Microsoft released upgrades to MDAC as web-based redistributable packages. Eventually, later versions were integrated with Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer, and in MDAC 2.8 SP1 they ceased offering MDAC as a redistributable package.|$|E

The traditional engineer's {{sign convention}} is not used in the calculations of the moment <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> although the results can be expressed in the conventional way. In the BMD case, the left side moment is clockwise direction and other is anticlockwise direction so the bending is positive and is called sagging.|$|E
25|$|Balloon {{propaganda}} {{campaigns in}} Korea include both North and South Korean propaganda leaflet campaigns {{through the use}} of balloons as a <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> since the Korean War. A variety of other contents have also been included with the balloons. Originally, these campaigns were organized by the governments and militaries of the Korean states. Contemporarily, however, they are mainly organized by South Korean non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that regularly involve themselves in balloon release events that aim to send materials censored in North Korea, as well as various other goods, to the North Korean people.|$|E
25|$|For the {{analysis}} of entire systems, this approach {{can be used in}} conjunction with statics, giving rise to the method of sections and method of joints for truss analysis, moment <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> for small rigid frames, and portal frame and cantilever method for large rigid frames. Except for moment distribution, which came into use in the 1930s, these methods were developed in their current forms {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century. They are still used for small structures and for preliminary design of large structures.|$|E

25|$|Arguments between proponents {{and opponents}} of the current electoral system include four {{separate}} but related topics: indirect election, disproportionate voting power by some states, the winner-takes-all <b>distribution</b> <b>method</b> (as chosen by 48 of the 50 states), and federalism. Arguments against the Electoral College in common discussion focus mostly on the allocation of the voting power among the states. Gary Bugh's research of congressional debates over proposed constitutional amendments to abolish the Electoral College reveals reform opponents have often appealed to a traditional version of representation, whereas reform advocates have tended to reference a more democratic view.|$|E
25|$|However, {{along with}} the rise in {{broadband}} internet connections beginning around 1998, higher quality movies began to see widespread distribution – {{with the release of}} DeCSS, ISO images copied directly from the original DVDs were slowly becoming a feasible <b>distribution</b> <b>method.</b> Today, movie sharing has become so common that it has caused major concern amongst movie studios and their representative organizations. Because of this the MPAA is often running campaigns during movie trailers where it tries to discourage people from copying material without permission. Unlike the music industry, which has had online music stores available for several years, the movie industry moved to online distribution only in 2006, after the launch of Amazon Unbox.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in <b>distribution</b> <b>method.</b> Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.|$|E
