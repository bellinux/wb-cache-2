Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Geodes</b> {{differ from}} vugs {{in that the}} former were formed as early, rounded, {{structures}} within the surrounding rock and are often removed intact, whereas vugs are irregularly shaped pockets, voids or cavities within a formation, often along a vein or in breccia. <b>Geodes</b> also differ from [...] "nodules" [...] in that a nodule is a mass of mineral matter that has accreted around the nodule nucleus. Both structures had the minerals contained within, deposited from groundwater or hydrothermal processes. <b>Geodes</b> commonly have a chalcedony (cryptocrystalline quartz) shell lined internally by various minerals, often as crystals, particularly calcite, pyrite, kaolinite, sphalerite, millerite, barite, celestite, dolomite, limonite, smithsonite, opal, chalcedony and macrocrystalline quartz, which {{is by far the}} most common and abundant mineral found in <b>geodes.</b> <b>Geodes</b> are found mostly in basaltic lavas and limestones. The Warsaw Formation in the Keokuk region near the area where Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois join contains abundant <b>geodes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some desktop Linux distributions, such as Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE, do not {{enable the}} HIGHMEM64 option by default in their default kernels, which is {{required}} {{to gain access to}} the NX bit in 32-bit mode, because the PAE mode that {{is required to}} use the NX bit causes boot failures on pre-Pentium Pro (including Pentium MMX) and Celeron M and Pentium M processors without NX support. Other processors that do not support PAE are AMD K6 and earlier, Transmeta Crusoe, VIA C3 and earlier, and <b>Geode</b> GX and LX. VMware Workstation versions older than 4.0, Parallels Workstation versions older than 4.0, and Microsoft Virtual PC and Virtual Server do not support PAE on the guest.

25|$|Quartz {{belongs to}} the {{trigonal}} crystal system. The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end. In nature quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached {{at the other end}} to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within gypsum. A quartz <b>geode</b> is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geodes</b> {{can form}} in any cavity, but {{the term is}} usually {{reserved}} for more or less rounded formations in igneous and sedimentary rocks. They can form in gas bubbles in igneous rocks, such as vesicles in basaltic lavas; or, as in the American Midwest, in rounded cavities in sedimentary formations. After rock around the cavity hardens, dissolved silicates and/or carbonates are deposited on the inside surface. Over time, this slow feed of mineral constituents from groundwater or hydrothermal solutions allows crystals to form inside the hollow chamber. Bedrock containing <b>geodes</b> eventually weathers and decomposes, leaving them present at the surface if they are composed of resistant material such as quartz. Many <b>geodes</b> {{can be found in}} deserts.|$|R

500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a <b>geode.</b> They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. Seven {{manganese}} minerals {{have been}} observed in <b>geodes</b> from Chihuahua, Mexico. Ramsdellite occurs {{in a number of}} different habits, but the morphology and precession X-ray patterns suggest that it is pseudomorphous after groutite. Pyrolusite is found only in association with rams-dellite and is believed to be an alteration product of that mineral. Todorokite generally occurs as a late-stage fibrous overgrowth in many of the <b>geodes.</b> Rancirite, birnessite, hollandite, and crypto-melane are present in trace amounts. This assemblage of manganese minerals is typical of supergene mineralization. IN a previous article describing the mineralogy of <b>geodes</b> from North Central Chi-huahua, Mexico, Finkelman et al. (1972) observed fifteen minerals. Among these were six manganese oxides: birnessite, cryptomelane, pyrolusite, ramsdellite, ranci 6 ite, and todorokite. We have since confirmed the presence of hollandite, the seventh manganese mineral, as well as beidellite and mordenite. The only manganese oxide previously reported in <b>geodes</b> was pyrolusite (Sinotte, I 969). z There has been con-siderable interest in the genesis of this complex group of minerals, and many questions are still unanswered (Fleischer and Richmond, 1943; Bricker, 1965; McKenzie, I 971) ...|$|R
