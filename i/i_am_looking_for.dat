2500|$|In January 2012, Ellis {{auditioned for}} the debut series of The Voice UK, a reality {{television}} singing competition. The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I thought you did a really phenomenal job, I really did. I can't fault that, all I can fault is myself for not turning around. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and you get back on the horse and you carry on." ...|$|E

In 1965, he reflected on his post-military problems, saying: What was my hangup then? Just about everything. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the four years I had lost in service. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a rhyme or reason to the mass murders that took place. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> the ideals <b>I</b> had once had. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> disgusted with the world — a world in which civilians acted as though there hadn't been a worldwide holocaust.|$|R
