From this it will be seen that I was timid, and that the cellar-steps were steep, and that the doorway was very low.|$|E

40|$|Polysomnographic {{findings}} {{were compared with}} data obtained subsequently from home documented monitoring in order to study the diagnostic value of both techniques. Polysomnography was performed in 1274 infants born prematurely and in 422 patients admitted because of apparent life threatening events (ALTEs). In 72 of the <b>infants,</b> <b>home</b> documented monitoring of the cardiorespiratory pattern, including QRS complexes, was performed. Subsequent documented episodes of heart rate < 50 beats/min were considered as "serious life threatening events". It was confirmed that polysomnographic findings correlated well with subsequent events as registered by home documented monitoring. Especially in the ALTE group where both infants with and without abnormal polysomnography were home monitored, the single polysomnography significantly predicted subsequent life threatening events. Home documented monitoring of the cardiorespiratory pattern has a distinctive advantage over simple cardiorespiratory monitoring {{as a means to}} identify and document life threatening events, in addition to its value as a rescue device. ...|$|R

5000|$|In nasopharyngeal {{cannulation}} (or {{placement of}} the nasopharyngeal airway or tube), the infant is fitted with a blunt-tipped length of surgical tubing (or an endotracheal tube fitted to the child), which is placed under direct visualization with a laryngoscope, being inserted into the nose and down the pharynx (or throat), ending just above the vocal cords. Surgical threads fitted through holes in the outside end of the tube {{are attached to the}} cheek with a special skin-like adhesive material called 'stomahesive', which is also wrapped around the outside end of the tube (but not over the opening at the end) to keep the tube in place. This tube or cannula, which itself acts as an airway, primarily acts as a sort of [...] "splint" [...] which maintains patency of the airway by keeping the tongue form falling back on the posterior pharyngeal wall and occluding the airway, therefore preventing airway obstruction, hypoxia and asphyxia. Nasopharyngeal airways are not available at every center, however, when available, nasopharyngeal cannulation should be favored over the other treatments mentioned in this article, as it is far less invasive; it allows the infant to feed without the further placement of a nasogastric tube. This treatment may be utilized for multiple months, until the jaw has grown enough so that the tongue assumes a more normal position in the mouth and airway (at birth, the jaws of some infants are so underdeveloped that only the tip of the tongue can be seen when viewed in the throat). Some institutions discharge the <b>infant</b> <b>home</b> with a nasopharyngeal tube in place (Citation: KD Anderson, May 2007, CPCJ).|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, I {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the Residential Lead Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act. Enacted in 1996, the lead hazard disclosure policy requires sellers and landlords to disclose known lead-based paint hazards to potential buyers or renters. Employing a difference-in-differences approach, I find evidence that the law prompted some families with children to reallocate toward homes without significant lead risks, increased lead mitigation in rental properties, and reduced blood-lead levels among children in rental properties. However, because white families appear to be more responsive to information disclosure than other groups, the information disclosure law might exacerbate racial disparities in lead exposure. In the second chapter, I estimate the spatio-temporal dynamics between wildfire and infant birthweight. Exposure to wildfire smoke is determined using the latitude and longitude coordinates of each <b>infant's</b> <b>home</b> address and a fine-scaled, spatial dataset of wildfire smoke plumes re-constructed in GIS from satellite images of the landscape.

The focus group meetings were analysed using a general thematic analysis. ResultsPerinatal care is a special health issue and a time of privileged sensitisation. The attitude of health risks are well known in the case of traditionally toxic substances. In the case of emerging environmental exposure, these attitudes depend on the knowledge, beliefs and experience specific to each practitioner. GPs were acquiring a new role in the field of environmental health, whilst at the same time coming to grips with their own strengths and limitations. The implementation of prevention depends on factors which are specific to the practitioner, but also related to the parents and the organisation of the medical practice. DiscussionThe sensitisation of GPs to environmental medicine, promotion of eco-citizen education, development of research, and the distribution of information, are some of the means which need to be implemented to prevent harmful exposure of the infant...|$|R
