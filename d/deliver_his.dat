5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the gekiken kogyo performances, in his later years Sakakibara regretted their development. In his view, the rules and strictures of gekiken were perverting kenjutsu into new forms that were no longer {{relevant}} to battlefield combat. He disdained the point-scoring swordsmanship of other kendoka of his era, ignoring light touches by his opponents in order to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> own powerful strikes. Nonetheless, the gekiken kogyo practices which he began created an interest in fencing which led ultimately to the development of modern kendo.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{faith in}} Johnson {{to balance the}} ticket proved misplaced. In the general election, Johnson cost the Democrats votes in the South, where his {{relationship}} with Chinn was particularly unpopular. He also failed to garner much support from the West, where {{he was supposed to}} be strong due to his reputation as an Indian fighter and war hero. He even failed to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> home state of Kentucky for the Democrats. Regardless, the Democrats still won the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to Iraq {{to quell the}} Kharijites. Following Umar's death and the accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E

5|$|After {{the speeches}} Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan led a procession, which {{included}} the dignitaries and the crowd, past the Executive Mansion, now the White House, then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance of the Capitol, where President Arthur received passing troops. Then, in the House Chamber, the president, his Cabinet, diplomats and others listened to Representative John Davis Long read a speech written {{a few months earlier}} by Robert C. Winthrop, formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier, but now too ill to personally <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> speech. A final speech was given by John W. Daniel of Virginia. The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks, both aerial and ground displays.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} on 5 June at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité in Montmartre, more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who {{included}} Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played Patrie, and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from Carmen. At the burial which followed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet {{had been struck}} down {{just as he was}} becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> final peroration. After a special performance of Carmen at the Opéra-Comique that night, the press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.|$|E
5|$|Clements had {{supported}} Bert T. Combs for governor against Chandler in 1955, {{and did so}} again against Harry Lee Waterfield in 1959. Combs defeated Waterfield and rewarded Clements by appointing him state highway commissioner. In 1961, Clements and Combs split over a proposed deal to lease dump trucks from a Louisville car dealer. State newspapers charged that the deal was payback to the dealer, a Combs supporter. When Combs canceled the deal Clements {{took it as a}} public rebuke and soon after resigned to work on the presidential campaign of his friend, Lyndon Johnson. Following his split with Combs, Clements allied himself with the Chandler faction, opposing Combs' lieutenant governor, Wilson Wyatt in his bid to unseat Senator Thruston Morton. Clements' influence declined rapidly after the split with Combs, and by the 1963 gubernatorial race, he was unable to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> home county for Chandler in the primary against Edward T. Breathitt. Clements died in his hometown of Morganfield, Kentucky on March 12, 1985.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Southchurch's background, but his family came from the manor of Southchurch, now part of Southend-on-Sea. Richard de Southchurch held this manor of the Prior and Convent of Christ's Church, Canterbury. He also held other land in the county of Essex, {{including}} Prittlewell, which he held in fee of the king. He served as sheriff of the combined shrievalties of Essex and Hertfordshire from 27 October 1265 to 12 June 1267. In 1279, he received a pardon and was acquitted of a fine of 100 shilling for being present at the theft of a hart at the king's forest of Chelmsford. In 1289 he was also acquitted of the great sum of 1000 pounds for perjury, in return for releasing the manor of Hatfield Peverel to the king. Southchurch was dead by 2 April 1294, when the escheator was ordered to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> lands to his son and heir, Peter de Southchurch.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, Punk briefly {{became a}} villain by joining the New Breed alliance, after several weeks {{in which both}} the New Breed and the ECW Originals had {{attempted}} to recruit him. Two weeks later, however, Punk betrayed the New Breed during a four-on-four elimination match between the New Breed and ECW Originals by kicking New Breed leader Elijah Burke {{in the back of}} the head and costing them the match. After the match, Punk proceeded to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> finisher, the Go To Sleep, on Burke and sarcastically apologized before leaving the ring alone, becoming a fan favorite again. At Judgment Day, Punk defeated Burke in his first singles match on a pay-per-view. Punk then went on to One Night Stand and teamed up with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in a tables match to defeat the New Breed.|$|E
5|$|Part of Samuel's army lay siege to the hill, and the {{remainder}} attacked the nearby coastal town of Ulcinj, {{which was part of}} the fortification system of the Theme of Dyrrhachium. Vladimir eventually surrendered, a decision the chronicle attributed to his wish to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> people from famine and the sword. He was sent to a prison in Samuel's capital of Prespa, located in western Macedonia. Having failed to conquer Ulcinj, which received men and supplies by sea from Dalmatian towns, the tsar directed his forces towards Dalmatia. There, he burned the towns of Kotor and Dubrovnik, and ravaged the region as far northwest as Zadar. He then returned to Bulgaria via Bosnia and Raška. A consequence of this campaign was the Bulgarian occupation of Duklja, Travunia, Zachlumia, Bosnia, and Raška. Venetian, and indirectly Byzantine power in Dalmatia was weakened. Samuel had succeeded in breaking up the pro-Byzantine bloc.|$|E

The eulogy enhanced his popularity and solidified his position as Clay's political heir apparent. He also campaigned for the election of Democrat Franklin Pierce as president. Although Pierce lost Kentucky by 3,200 votes, Breckinridge wielded more influence with him than he had with outgoing Whig President Millard Fillmore. A week after his inauguration, Pierce offered Breckinridge an appointment as governor of Washington Territory. He had initially sought the appointment, securing letters of recommendation from Powell and Butler, {{but by the time}} it was offered, he had decided to stay in Kentucky and seek re-election to the House.|$|E

The boy sets off to the railroad construction area, passing the dangerous terrain without incident. The father, Tony Prolo (Senior), greets his young son and happily takes his lunch. His young son begins tossing rocks {{across the street and}} runs out into the road and is knocked down by a passing vehicle. Tony rushes to his son's aid and the rich man, Mr. Sears gets out the car and attempts to comfort the father. The father rejects him and rushes home, carrying his son in his arms. At home, Tony Prolo and his wife attend to their son and pray for his health.|$|E
5|$|The {{rift between}} Williams and Patton became {{permanent}} during negotiations {{over the state}} budget in 1999. Patton proposed to Williams a 7-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, with 1cent of every 7 dedicated to counties with the most unpaved roads – usually heavily Republican counties ignored by past Democratic governors. Patton claimed Williams {{told him he had}} 10votes in the Senate for the increase. But gas prices spiked before the measure came to a vote in the Senate, and Williams failed to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> votes after the House passed the tax. The administration and key Republican senators reached a compromise that saved Patton's budget with tax changes that were mostly revenue-neutral. Patton believed Williams had deliberately misled him, however, and the two never reconciled.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{after the}} closing of his father's estate and sale his father's property, he moved west to {{homestead}} and farm at Manitoba, in the Little Saskatchewan district, near Minnedosa. A few years later, {{he had come to}} the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him; his farm had been situated in an area that was so far removed from a town that travel to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> products had been cumbersome. He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations. He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field. He would join the contracting firm of Murray & McDermot, serving as foreman on various projects, including the building of the Manitoba Hotel. After some 13 years, he went to Carberry, Manitoba where he continued contracting, this time also entering the furniture business. In 1902, he would also be involved {{in the construction of the}} Union Bank building there.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had.

Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage <b>deliver</b> <b>his</b> nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant.
