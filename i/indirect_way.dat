5|$|The CIP was {{a scheme}} whereby US dollars {{were given to}} the South Vietnamese {{government}} treasury. Selected businesspeople were given import licenses that allowed them to purchase US dollars with South Vietnamese currency at a rate far below the market value. The importers then used their American currency to buy US goods, while the Saigon government kept the South Vietnamese currency paid by the businessmen to fund the military and public service. The objective of the mechanism was to inject large amounts of money into the economy in an <b>indirect</b> <b>way,</b> through material goods, so that inflation would be avoided. However, the initiative failed to generate much economic development, as licenseholders spent most of their funds on consumer goods.|$|E

25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An <b>indirect</b> <b>way</b> to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This indirect method is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E

25|$|VAM {{executives}} and engineers sought {{to move the}} two-door 1976 American ECD from the limited edition status into a regular production model, and also change its concept from general luxury into a personal luxury vehicle, which VAM no longer offered since the mid-1976 discontinuation of the Classic Brougham (Matador Brougham coupe) model. Taking advantage of this upcoming new model was a plan of this group of employees to make a homage to VAM's general manager Gabriel Fernández Sáyago, {{one of the most}} respected men in the Mexican auto industry at the time and leader of the company since 1946. The new personal luxury compact was named after him using his initials as a designation. The model was presented to him as a surprise in late 1976, which he appreciated highly but opting for a more humble stance, he requested the model not to carry his name. The group of VAM employees respected his decision, but managed an <b>indirect</b> <b>way</b> to keep their original plan. Te general manager's initials were retained, but the meaning was changed into Grand Formula Sport. The model was introduced along with VAM's 1977 lineup as a two-door alternative to the American ECD and a luxury one to the sporty American Rally.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted {{just above}} {{does not use}} {{calorimetry}} or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or <b>indirect</b> <b>way</b> of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference {{is supposed to have}} been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes that take the system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.|$|E

Estraven also faces difficulties communicating with Ai, who does not understand shifgrethor, the Gethenians' <b>indirect</b> <b>way</b> of giving and receiving advice.

2500|$|In sports, {{competition}} tests who {{has better}} skill and ability {{at the time}} of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two chickens that have similar abilities.

The evil urge knows that {{it is easier to}} subvert successful people into believing in the success of their own efforts than to convince people of average means that they do not need God. Alshich taught that [...] thus reflects the way that the evil urge works. The process of moving away from serving God can be gradual, almost imperceptibly slow.

2500|$|Congress enacted Johnson's Great Society {{program to}} fight poverty and hunger. The Watergate Scandal had a {{powerful}} effect of waking up a somewhat dormant Congress which investigated presidential wrongdoing and coverups; the scandal [...] "substantially reshaped" [...] relations between the branches of government, suggested political scientist Bruce J. Schulman. Partisanship returned, particularly after 1994; one analyst attributes partisan infighting to slim congressional majorities which discouraged friendly social gatherings in meeting rooms such as the Board of Education. Congress began reasserting its authority. Lobbying became a big factor despite the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. Political action committees or PACs could make substantive donations to congressional candidates via such means as soft money contributions. While soft money funds were not given to specific campaigns for candidates, the money often benefited candidates substantially in an <b>indirect</b> <b>way</b> and helped reelect candidates. Reforms such as the 2002 McCain-Feingold act limited campaign donations but did not limit soft money contributions.

2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an <b>indirect</b> <b>way,</b> cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E
