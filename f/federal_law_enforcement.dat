5|$|Dozens of {{communities}} across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C. journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. He observes {{that it is}} unclear whether such theft is on the rise, as it is not tracked by <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is an {{offender}} profiler {{working for}} a private investigative firm called the Millennium Group, who consult with local or <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> on criminal cases. The Millennium Group, and Black, specialise in examining violent crimes or those of a millenarian nature.|$|E

Despite his guilty plea, Shah and his {{supporters}} continue to claim that he was entrapped and never actually intended to join or support al-Qaeda. In addition, the case raised further controversy regarding <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement's</b> use of paid informants.|$|R

5|$|In response, Prime Minister Borden {{amended the}} {{policing}} legislation in November 1919, bringing together the Royal North-West Mounted Police and the Dominion Police {{to form the}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police, with the new force responsible for <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> and national security across Canada {{under the command of}} Perry. The legislation came into effect on 1 February 1920, officially marking the end of the older force.|$|E
5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying heavy cargo, yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave {{a speech}} in the United States House of Representatives in which he {{asserted}} that the Rajneeshees {{were involved in the}} bioterror attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a Jefferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. Turner was never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E

5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment {{prevents}} most warrantless searches by {{law enforcement}} officers, and since Weeks v. United States (1914), has been enforced by the exclusionary rule, which excludes most evidence gathered through Fourth Amendment violations from criminal trials. While Wolf v. Colorado (1949) had held the amendment {{to apply to the}} states, a process known as incorporation, the exclusionary rule had explicitly not been incorporated by the decision. Evidence gathered by state law enforcement was therefore not yet bound by the same strictures as that gathered by <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Through {{ballistics}} examination, {{law enforcement}} investigators determined that Cho used the Glock 19 pistol during the attacks at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory and at Norris Hall on the Virginia Tech campus. Police investigators found that Cho fired more than 170 shots during the killing spree, evidenced by technicians finding at least 17 empty magazines at the scene. During the investigation, <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> investigators {{found that the}} serial numbers were illegally filed off on both the Walther P22 and the Glock 19 handguns used by Cho during the rampage.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{there has}} been a push to legalize {{importation}} of medications from Canada and other countries, in order to reduce consumer costs. While in most cases importation of prescription medications violates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and <b>federal</b> <b>laws,</b> <b>enforcement</b> is generally targeted at international drug suppliers, rather than consumers. There is no known case of any U.S. citizens buying Canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription, who has ever been charged by authorities.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>federal</b> {{immigration}} <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> {{has traditionally}} been the exclusive province of the federal government, there is considerable dispute regarding the constitutionality of civil immigration <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> by state and local authorities.http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/aca_20_cfa_20050701_151400_asm_comm.htmlhttps://www.aclu.org/ImmigrantsRights/ImmigrantsRights.cfm?ID=19048&c=22 The measure was sure to have faced legal challenges if approved by voters in California.|$|R
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators included: Ma Anand Sheela, Sally-Anne Croft, Chief Financial Officer of Rajneeshpuram; Susan Hagan, head of {{security}} at Rajneeshpuram, Catherine Jane Stork, who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered {{to be the}} actual murderer; Ann Phyllis McCarthy, fourth-in-command of Rajneeshpuram; and co-conspirators Alma Potter, Carol Matthews, Phyllis Caldwell and Richard Kevin Langford. Two of the conspirators obtained false identification to purchase handguns out-of-state, stalked Turner, and planned to murder him near his workplace in Portland, Oregon. The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later, {{as a result of}} the investigation by <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> into the bioterror attack in The Dalles and other illegal acts by the Rajneeshpuram leadership.|$|E
5|$|The victims, {{including}} three pregnant women, {{ranged in age}} from 3 months to 73 years. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation/Federal Highway (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the Federal government victims were <b>Federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agents. Of those law enforcement agents four were members of the U.S. Secret Service, two were members of the U.S. Customs Service, one {{was a member of the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two members of the U.S. Army, two members of the U.S. Air Force, two members of the U.S. Marine Corps. The rest of the victims were civilians, including 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were abrasions, severe burns, and bone fractures.|$|E

40|$|CHDS State/LocalThis thesis {{examines}} the interoperability of <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement's</b> Big Six investigative agencies, {{to include the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Drug Enforcement Administration, Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, Internal Revenue Service-CID, and the United States Secret Service-Investigations. The main issue is whether, in the post- 9 / 11 environment of transnational and terrorist criminal threats, the current administrative and jurisdictional configuration of the Big Six within three executive epartments with overlapping duties marginalizes the nation's investigative work-product. This discussion includes the establishment of metrics used to gauge the functionality of the Big Six and, thus, to determine whether Negative Characteristics are present that materially affect the "total" mission. Ultimately, the conclusion is drawn that {{the integration of the}} Big Six into a single agency, namely the FBI, would better serve the nation's <b>federal</b> investigative <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> needs. This leads into the next area of discussion, which is how to integrate the Big Six. Associated with both these topics is an analysis of what the federal investigative mission means and whether it should include a domestic intelligence product.
