Improved knowledge of personal sun exposure patterns can inform public health policy; and help target high-risk population groups.

Many of these studies, however, use digital or paper-based journals (self-reported volunteer recall), or employ cost prohibitive electronic UV dosimeters (that limit the size of sample populations), to estimate periods of exposure. A cost effective personal electronic sun journal (ESJ) built from readily available infrared photodiodes is presented in this research. The ESJ can be used to complement traditional UV dosimeters that measure total biologically effective exposure by providing a time-stamped sun <b>exposure</b> <b>record.</b> The ESJ can be easily attached to clothing and data logged to personal devices (including fitness monitors or smartphones).

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{an emerging}} animal welfare {{and public health}} issue linked to antimicrobial use (AMU) in livestock. This {{study was conducted in}} 2004 on 20 swine farms in Alberta and Saskatchewan. On-farm records and questionnaires were used to retrospectively describe the antimicrobial exposures of pigs through feed, water, and injection. Antimicrobial use in all production categories was described over 12 months. On-farm records and questionnaires provided sufficient data to describe antimicrobial exposure rates through feed and water. In contrast, on-farm records did not supply sufficient data to describe parenteral antimicrobial exposure rates. Records lacked data on the number of exposures per treatment, therefore parenteral AMU was described as an exposure incidence. Parenteral <b>exposure</b> <b>records</b> were often unavailable for pigs less than 22 kg, in which case questionnaires were used. The incidence of parenteral AMU was significantly higher in herds reporting exposure by questionnaire compared with existing records, suggesting that on-farm records did not reliably describe parenteral AMU.

Based on accumulated TCN, the methodology required by these applications must however rely on precise geological targets (e. g. superimposed lava flows, sequestered sediments) which must meet certain conditions (e. g. erosion negligible, recent exposure negligible) and on which several independent measurements can be performed (e. g. independent estimate of the ancient exposure duration). Under favorable conditions, a careful evaluation of the analytical limitations and a rigorous sampling strategy may nevertheless allow a useful precision to be reached, from several kyr up to several Myr time scales. Thus, challenging issues might be assessed by these methods, as for example, (i) uplift or subsidence histories, (ii) the forcing effect of climatic variations on erosion, or (iii) the setting time of huge magmatic provinces...|$|E

Objective: This {{study was conducted to}} assess tanning patrons ’ adherence to FDA-recommended exposure limits and to measure the amount of UVA and UVB radiation emitted by tanning beds. Methods: A community-based survey was administered during routine state inspections of North Carolina tanning facilities (n 50). At each facility, patron records were randomly selected (n 483) for a survey of <b>exposure</b> <b>records,</b> and UVA and UVB outputs were measured for each tanning bed. Results: The recommended limits were exceeded by 95 % of patrons, and 33 % of patrons began tanning at the maximum doses recommended for maintenance tanning.

40|$|To assess quantitatively the {{association}} between benzene and leukemia, we evaluated {{the rate of mortality}} experienced by a cohort occupationally exposed to benzene. Using data from historical air sampling surveys, we estimated the daily benzene exposure for each member of the cohort. The expected number of leukemia deaths was calculated and compared to the actual number of leukemia deaths that occurred. The overall standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for leukemia was 337. Person-years at risk within the cohort were stratified by increasing levels of cumulative benzene exposure. The resulting SMRs increased from 109 to 322 to 1186 and to 6637 with respective increases in cumulative benzene exposure from less than 40 ppm-years to 40 - 199, 200 - 399, and greater than 400. The shape of the exposure-response relation was examined with a case-control analysis. Another analysis was performed to take into account an induction period for leukemia. All of the analyses demonstrated that a strongly positive exposure-response relationship etists between benzene and leukemia. Previous attempts to quantify this cohort's risk of developing leukemia were based on surrogates of exposure, such as duration of employment. Using actual air sampling data to estimate individual exposures represents a marked improvement over these previous attempts and emphasizes the importance of conducting industrial hygiene surveys and maintaining historical <b>exposure</b> <b>records.</b> The etiologic association between benzene and leukemi...|$|E
