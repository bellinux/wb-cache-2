In {{the second}} book he related {{how he had}} had since childhood, a {{recurrent}} dream of something akin to a huge wasp descending towards him. During the war he experienced a Nazi Stuka dive-bomber descending in just such a manner. After that he claimed never to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> dream again. Producer Daniel M. Angel successfully sued More for libel in 1980 over comments made in his second autobiography.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{issued a}} number of {{charters}} for West Frankish recipients during his stay in Paris {{during and after the}} siege. He recognised rights and privileges granted by his predecessors to recipients in the Spanish March and Provence, but especially in Neustria, where he had contact with Nantes {{at a time when the}} Breton duke Alan I was known to be powerful in the county of Nantes. It is probable that Charles granted Alan the right to be titled rex; as emperor he would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> prerogative and Alan's use of the title appears legitimate. A charter datable to between 897 and 900 makes reference to the soul of Karolus on whose behalf Alan had ordered prayers to be said in the monastery of Redon. This was probably Charles the Fat.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Radio Times, he asserted that the BBC was being [...] "ruined by women", commenting that: [...] "The trouble is that the BBC now is run by women and it shows: soap operas, cooking, quizzes, kitchen-sink plays. You wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> in the golden days." [...] In response, a BBC spokeswoman described Moore as being one of TV's best-loved figures and remarked that his [...] "forthright" [...] views were [...] "what we all love about him". During his June 2002 appearance on Room 101 he banished female newsreaders into Room 101.|$|E
500|$|In a 1997 case {{known as}} the Stolen Generations Case, the court upheld an {{ordinance}} issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of Indigenous Australian children from their families. The court reasoned {{that the purpose of}} the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> effect. Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section116 will only [...] "prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect". In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.|$|E
500|$|With Atkinson thus occupied, an {{alternative}} arrangement {{to pick up}} Scott was necessary. Disregarding Meares, who was [...] "not available for work", the most qualified person available to meet Scott's party was the physicist Wright, an experienced traveller and navigator, but the chief scientist Simpson insisted Wright's scientific work be given priority. Atkinson therefore chose Cherry-Garrard, who could however not navigate, had never handled a dog before and who was moreover short-sighted. Lt Evans wrote later that he thought Scott would have approved the decision to keep Wright at the base camp, whereas Wright later stated [...] "It always worries me - I should <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> job". Cherry-Garrard would be accompanied by Dimitri. In his 1922 book The Worst Journey, Cherry-Garrard recalled the controversial verbal orders given by Atkinson. He was to travel to One Ton Depot as fast as possible, where he was to leave food for the returning polar party. If Scott had not arrived before him, Cherry-Garrard should decide [...] "what to do". Atkinson also emphasised {{that this was not}} a rescue party, and added that Scott had given instructions that the dogs were [...] "not to be risked in view of the sledging plans for next season". In the standard edition of his book, Cherry omitted any mention of Scott's request to be picked up at 82° or 82°30' on 1 March. But after Atkinson's and Lady Scott's deaths in 1929 and 1947 respectively, in a postscript to his privately published 1948 edition, Cherry acknowledged the existence of Scott's order and provided reasons why Atkinson, and later he himself, failed to comply: Cherry-Garrard in 1948 stated that Atkinson was too exhausted at the beginning of February to set off to meet Scott, and that the lack of dog food at One Ton Depot made a timely start impractical. Karen May of the Scott Polar Research Institute goes further by suggesting that the instruction about saving the dogs for the following season was Atkinson's own invention.|$|E

2500|$|James Joyce {{noted that}} [...] Tolstoy admired {{him but he}} {{thought that he had}} little artistic {{accomplishment}} or mind. Yet, as he said, 'he admired his heart', a criticism which contains a great deal of truth, for though his characters do act extravagantly, madly, almost, still their basis is firm enough underneath... The Brothers Karamazov... made a deep impression on me... he created some unforgettable scenes ... Madness you may call it, but therein may be the secret of his genius... I prefer the word exaltation, exaltation which can merge into madness, perhaps.

2500|$|The poem is {{the work}} of an {{anonymous}} writer who lived during the 14th century in the north Midlands. [...] His source was the French prose romance La Mort Artu, but he compressed it to a romance only about one fifth of the Mort Artu’s length. [...] He probably intended his work for a wide and relatively unsophisticated audience. [...] He cast his work in the metre of a minstrel romance ballad, each stanza containing eight lines rhyming abababab, and each line having four beats. [...] As the poem has come down to us there are seven places where the stanza is two lines short, but the original poem may not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>that</b> fault. [...] The poet took many liberties with his rhymes, and also used more alliteration than is common in a Middle English rhyming romance.|$|E
