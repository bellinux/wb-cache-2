5|$|The club {{appointed}} Ian Holloway {{as their}} new manager on 6 January 2014, {{with the club}} sitting 21st in the table. He was given the priority of maintaining their Football League Championship status, which he achieved. Millwall went unbeaten <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>eight</b> games of the 2013–14 season and finished in 19th place, four points above the relegation zone. The following season, Holloway was sacked on 10 March 2015 with the team second from bottom in the Championship, and Neil Harris was reinstated as caretaker manager {{until the end of}} the season. He was unable to ensure survival, however, as Millwall's relegation to League One was confirmed on 28 April with one game of the 2014–15 season still to play. Harris was confirmed as Millwall's permanent manager the next day. In his first full season in charge, Harris led Millwall to a fourth-place finish in League One and a play-off final at Wembley, which the Lions lost 3–1 to Barnsley.|$|E
5|$|England beat Argentina 1–0 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>eight,</b> with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; {{the match}} was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Rattín, {{who refused to}} leave the pitch after being {{dismissed}} for dissent. In contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal {{proved to be a}} fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack {{from the start of the}} match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum, which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2–1 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April. This remains a record for an England goalkeeper.|$|E
