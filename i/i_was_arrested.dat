But {{whenever}} the court {{let me go}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> again. I have learnt to speak English better. Perhaps I do not speak King's English but it's Kisch English anyhow. I did not come here to tell there is terrorism in Europe. I come {{here to tell you}} how to stop it. I have been an eye-witness. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> the day the Reichstag was burnt down by Göring and his lieutenants. I saw my friend, Erich Mühsam, the poet, whose works I translated, made to walk naked, even in winter, and to lick up the spittle of his captors. All his limbs were broken gradually, and he died." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Police came to {{my house}} on Sunday at 1pm when I was having my siesta and told me that the escapees had demanded to see me before they gave {{themselves}} up to the police voluntarily. I was reluctant because last time I helped the police <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> but I agreed if it meant they would give themselves up, so I went with two officers to Tanoliu.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but I kept on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
60|$|The Vagrant: Hungry, yes, {{and many}} thanks to you; but if I go naked <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>arrested</b> for indecent exposure. You require {{me to wear}} clothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to {{be charged}} with horse-stealing because of what has been done, it cannot be avoided now. Before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>I</b> must carry the message with which <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> entrusted, and to do so I need another horse. I had {{believed}} I could get one from you without difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well done, my upright cousin," [...] I muttered; [...] "this {{is losing}} no time, certainly. I owe half that money, I admit, sir, if my farm only sold for five {{thousand}} dollars, as I hear, and <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>arrested</b> for the penalty of my bond. But, at whose suit <b>am</b> <b>I</b> thus pursued?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jacob," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "how mad, how {{imprudent}} of you! I ordered you specially, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested,</b> to pay no heed, but to {{make your}} way north." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would do}} so gladly," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch, [...] "but the casket which {{contains}} {{it is not in}} my possession. It was seized when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> at Greenwich." ...|$|E
60|$|I was but {{a little}} way down the street, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> {{by the sound of}} some one running, and Jim's voice calling me by name. He had {{followed}} me with a letter which had been long awaiting my return.|$|E
50|$|During World War <b>I,</b> Beam <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> in December 1917 at Seal Beach as a German spy.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it was madness!" [...] he exclaimed, angrily. [...] "There are spies everywhere. Your {{brother and}} <b>I</b> <b>were</b> overheard talking {{together}} {{at this very}} place. <b>I</b> may <b>be</b> <b>arrested</b> at any moment." ...|$|R
50|$|Supporting the SLP's {{opposition}} to World War <b>I,</b> MacManus <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> in 1915 {{at a meeting}} in George Square, Glasgow, for speaking against the threatened introduction of conscription.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{was sure}} of," [...] Ned {{said with a}} hard laugh. [...] "As I have {{received}} no message from her from the day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> I guessed pretty well that whatever doubt other people might feel, my mother was positive that I had murdered her husband." ...|$|E
60|$|Having murdered {{my mother}} under {{circumstances}} of singular atrocity, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> and put upon my trial, which lasted seven years. In charging the jury, the {{judge of the}} Court of Acquittal remarked {{that it was one}} of the most ghastly crimes that he had ever been called upon to explain away.|$|E
60|$|Now in {{all this}} matter, I ask you, Sir, who ran the {{greatest}} risk? Why, I--Hector Ratichon, of course--Hector Ratichon, in whose apartment M. de Firmin-Latour was discovered in a position bordering on absolute inanition. And the proof of this is, that that selfsame night <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> at my lodgings at Passy, and charged with robbery and attempted murder.|$|E
50|$|On the {{instruction}} of Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom and the archiepiscopal synod, Árbóc (a Cuman maternal relative of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary) and Mojs <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> and held in captivity by Peter Monoszló, the Bishop of Transylvania in 1288, because Lodomer mistakenly thought that they had planned to go the Mongols as the envoys of Ladislaus IV whose relationship was severely burdened with the Catholic Church. They were released soon.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was also}} {{surprised}} {{at the lack of}} an armed response: [...] "I thought <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> <b>arrested,</b> or maybe killed in a shootout with CIA guards or police." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} trouble," [...] said she. [...] "I {{give you my}} word that I will stay where <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> advise you to be careful, Captain Fowler. You've shown once before that you are liable to do things before you have thought of the consequence. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>arrested</b> all the world will {{know that you have}} given away the secrets that were confided to you. There is an end of your career, my friend. You can punish me, no doubt. What about yourself?" ...|$|R
60|$|With {{these words}} he let fall a heavy bottle of Kirschenwasser which, {{dropping}} precisely upon {{the crown of}} my head, caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out. Impressed with this idea, I was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> by the cry of the Angel, who bade me hold on.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is little}} more to tell, sir. I went up with this woman to the box she had pointed out, and there found this Captain Presnovich as I {{believed}} him to be. I put on his hat, mask, and cloak, walked down the stairs, and was leaving the Opera-house when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested,</b> and am even now wholly ignorant of having committed any offence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finding {{that we had}} a {{day before}} us, we {{explored}} the queer old town, and, as our tastes varied, each went a different way. I roamed about the narrow streets, seeking some odd souvenir to carry away, and was peering into a dark lane, attracted by some fine shells, when suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> by a sight which caused me to pause {{in the middle of a}} puddle, exclaiming dramatically, [...] "At last! at last!" ...|$|E
60|$|Hurrying {{to catch}} a certain car at a certain corner late one stormy night, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{suddenly}} <b>arrested</b> {{by the sight of}} a queer-looking bundle lying in a door-way.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is not a}} man here," [...] Monsieur Flambard said, [...] "who {{would not}} do all in his power for me. Some of them have been with the firm nearly all their lives. I treat them well, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> happy to say that not one of them has taken any part in our last troubles. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> told {{that is one of the}} matters that, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>arrested,</b> will <b>be</b> brought against me. It will be said that it was a proof of my enmity to the Convention that none of my people took the side of the patriots.|$|R
50|$|Enemy {{aliens in}} Queensland during World War <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{frequently}} <b>arrested</b> and detained. Strong anti-German sentiment resulted in many arrests and investigations. German place names were renamed with British names.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{first came}} to Boston, I had my money stolen, {{and there were two}} days when I had nothing to eat; and then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> by mistake for {{stealing}} a girl's satchel; and when I was acquitted, I slept the next night in the tramp's lodging-house, and that fellow was there, and {{when he came to the}} St. Albans I was ashamed to tell where I had known him, and so I let him pass himself off for my friend." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{their voices}} sank {{so low that}} as they withdrew I caught not what was said. The door closed softly and for a space there was silence, broken at last by a sigh above my head. With an {{answering}} sigh I opened wide my eyes and feasted them upon the lovely face of Yvonne de Canaples, as she bent over me {{with a look of}} tenderness and pity that at once recalled to me our parting when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Rowan raised {{himself a}} little in his seat. [...] "Hefferom," [...] he said, [...] "it's no use talking like that. I haven't got it. I'll be frank, frank as you have been. I know no {{more than you do}} who has got it. I quarrelled with Sinclair, and he got suspicious. We fought in his room, and the result you know, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> before I left the hotel. Everyone knows that. The paper--I never had it--I never even saw it. Where it is now God only knows. I don't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duson," [...] he said, [...] "that fellow Horser is {{annoyed with}} me. If <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>arrested</b> on any charge, or should fail {{to return to}} the hotel within {{reasonable}} time, break that seal and send off the telegrams." ...|$|R
60|$|After a time, we {{were all}} seated, when I narrated {{the manner in which}} I had lost my ship, and the reason why Clawbonny had been sold, and why <b>I</b> {{supposed}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thus <b>arrested.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Allen Price and John Stumpy {{were one}} and the same person! For a moment so great was my {{surprise}} that <b>I</b> forgot <b>I</b> <b>was</b> under <b>arrest,</b> and walked on beside the officer without a protest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he returned, smiling, [...] "that was my name at that moment. My friends," [...] he continued, resting {{a hand on}} my shoulder, and {{speaking}} to the others, [...] "I have met this young Englishman before. A few days ago, when I was on my way hither, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> at Las Cuevas in his company; it was by means of his assistance that I succeeded in making my escape. He did this good deed, believing {{at the time that he}} was helping a poor peasant, and not expecting any return." ...|$|E
60|$|One night I had roamed {{into the}} City, and was walking slowly {{on in my}} usual way, musing upon a great many things, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> by an inquiry, the purport of which did not reach me, but {{which seemed to be}} {{addressed}} to myself, and was preferred in a soft sweet voice that struck me very pleasantly. I turned hastily round and found at my elbow a pretty little girl, who begged to be directed to a certain street at a considerable distance, and indeed in quite another quarter of the town.|$|E
60|$|This put {{a second}} {{reflection}} in my mind: that if I were {{to separate from}} Alan and his tell-tale clothes I should be safe against arrest, and might go openly about my business. Nor was this all; for suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> when I was alone, there was little against me: but suppose I was taken in company with the reputed murderer, my case would begin to be grave. For generosity's sake I dared not speak my mind upon this head; but I thought of it none the less.|$|E
5000|$|This is the twenty-seventh time <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>arrested</b> and <b>I</b> ain't {{going to}} jail no more! The only way we gonna stop them white men from whuppin' us is to take over. What we gonna start sayin' now is Black Power! ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sure, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in The Legion of Doom. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> in everybody's system. But <b>I</b> {{have never}} <b>been</b> <b>arrested.</b> <b>I</b> have never broken {{anything}}, I {{have never done}} anything really, really, criminally bad.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, I {{must remain}} Desmond Kennedy at present, Mike. It is under that name that my safe conduct was made out, and if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>arrested</b> as Gerald O'Carroll, {{it would be}} no {{protection}} to me. However, I shall not want to use it long, for {{it seems to me that}} my first step must be to return to France, and to see some of the officers who knew my father, and were aware of my birth. Their testimony would be of great value, and without it there would be little chance of your sister's evidence being believed." ...|$|R
