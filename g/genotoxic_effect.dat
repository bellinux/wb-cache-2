40|$|Advisor: Pramod MahanjanOverall {{objective}} {{of our research}} project is to analyze, at the molecular level, the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of genistein, the main isoflavonoid in soybeans. Due to their anti-oxidative properties, soy isoflavonoids have received considerable attention as health food supplements. Recent studies have also documented {{a variety of other}} biological effects of isoflavonoids including anticancer activity. Some of these effects are due to structural similarity of genistein with steroid hormones, and some effects are thought to be due to the ability of genistein to interfere with cellular pathways involved in drug metabolism or cell cycle progression. However, it is unclear if the observed toxicity of genistein toward some types of cancer cells is specific and limited only to the cancer cells. Moreover, reasons for the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of genistein remain unexplained. We hypothesize that the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of isoflavonoids are mediated via damage to cellular DNA and subsequent modulation of the DNA damage repair pathways of the host cells. Fully understanding molecular mechanisms of the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of genistein will significantly improve utility of genistein and other isoflavones as pharmaceutical/neutraceutical compounds. Therefore, we are evaluating the <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of genistein in rats as an animal model using Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase as a marker of DNA damage.

Experimental animals were treated intraperitoneally with three different concentrations of CdCl 2 : 0. 5, 1, and 2 mg/kg of CdCl 2, while the control animals received equal volume of sterile phosphate buffered saline. The individuals of both sexes were treated at the age of 3, 6 and 12 month. Frequency of micronuclei formation was evaluated in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs), 24 h hours after the treatment. The results showed that CdCl 2 caused a concentration-dependent increase of micronucleus frequency. The most significant differences were found between ages of 3 / 12 and 6 / 12 months at 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg CdCl 2 concentrations. Namely, 3 month old males had higher frequency of MNi in comparison to 12 month old males, whereas in females it was the opposite. Likewise, 6 months old males exbibited greater sensistivity to CdCl 2 in comparison to 12 month old rats, and in the females it was the opposite. Sex differences were further confirmed as slightly stronger <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> in 12 months old females treated with 0. 5 and 1 mg/kg of CdCl 2.

40|$|Hormones are {{cellular}} products {{involved in}} the regulation {{of a large number}} of processes in living systems, and which by their actions affect the growth, function and metabolism of cells. Considering that hormones are compounds normally present in the organism, it is important to determine if they can, under certain circumstances, lead to genetic changes in the hereditary material. Numerous experimental studies in vitro and in vivo in different systems, from bacteria to mammals, dealt with the mutagenic and genotoxic effects of hormones. This work presents an overview of the research on genotoxic effects of non­steroidal hormones, although possible changes of genetic material under their influence have not still been known enough, and moreover, investigations on their genotoxic influence have given conflicting results. The study results show that mechanisms of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of nonsteroidal hormones are manifested through the increase of oxidative stress by arising reactive oxygen species. A common mechanism of ROS occurence in thyroid hormones and catecholamines is through metabolic oxidation of their phenolic groups. Manifestation of insulin <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> is based on production of ROS by activation of NADPH isophorms, while testing oxytocin showed absence of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effect.</b> Considering that the investigations on genotoxicity of nonsteroidal hormones demonstrated both positive and negative results, the explanation of this discordance involve limitations of test systems themselves, different cell types or biological species used in the experiments, different level of reactivity in vitro and in vivo, as well as possible variations in a tissue-specific expression. Integrated, the provided data contribute to better understanding of <b>genotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of nonsteroidal hormones and point out to the role and mode of action of these hormones in the process of occurring of effects caused by oxidative stress.
