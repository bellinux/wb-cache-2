2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E

'Friend,' replied Joshua, with a {{constrained}} smile, 'but that I know thou dost {{not mean}} as thou sayst, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> we {{are under the}} protection of this country's laws; nor do we the less trust to obtain their protection, that our principles permit us not, by any act of violent resistance, to protect ourselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little to me, indeed, to whom all {{the world}} will soon be as nothing," [...] {{answered}} Sir Kenneth boldly; [...] "but were I now stretched on the rack, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> that what <b>I</b> have said is much to thine own conscience and thine own fame. I <b>tell</b> <b>thee,</b> Sir King, that if thou dost but in thought entertain the purpose of wedding thy kinswoman, the Lady Edith--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] says my good {{creature}} the Quaker, [...] "thou hast so ill {{an opinion}} {{of me as}} to think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> an untruth, {{and say that the}} Lady ---- was gone from my house if she was not! I assure thee I do not use any such method; nor does the Lady ---- desire any such kind of service from me, as I know of. If she had been in the house, I should have told thee so." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I--I don't think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> if I knew," [...] said Sylvia, {{turning her}} head away. [...] "You see--I don't {{want you to}} help caring." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I don't, Florence, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> Of course Mr. Saul {{has asked}} me. I {{never had any}} secret with you about that--have I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you, indeed? How delightful! Oh! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what {{is behind}} the black veil for the world! Are not you wild to know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad of it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> myself. My father has, today, {{laid his}} {{commands}} {{on me to}} marry the Sieur de Pascal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{admit that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing just now," [...] she said, gratefully. [...] "You are {{sure you will}} never say again that you don't {{understand}} me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jackson. Beg pardon, sir; {{but they}} seemed to avoid seeing your father until they had seen you. It looked mysterious, and I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> first.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! that's the question. If I {{felt that}} I {{was talking to}} a real Christian that had a care for the poor girl's soul, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> in a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|Catherine {{wished it}} would go on, but she herself continued. [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that I have not seen him again, but that I should like to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the help}} {{rendered}} {{to us all}} {{at the moment of}} distress, deign to accept, mejuffrouw, our humble thanks. For the rest, believe me, our deed was not one of valour, and such as it was it is wholly unworthy of the praise thou dost deign to bestow upon it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> more," [...] he added, whimsically, [...] "only that my friend behind me is violently kicking the calves of my legs, which renders the elegant flow of language well nigh impossible. I stopped him talking just now--he retaliates ... it is but just." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not all painful, Miss Hannay, but in parts. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Doctor, {{when we have}} {{finished}} our journey this evening, if your curiosity {{will allow you to}} wait so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her that <b>you</b> have not been blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her that <b>you</b> shall be cleared in every fair mind. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it {{were only}} so simple as all that," [...] she answered, [...] "oh! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> so willingly. But it is not. There {{is so much}} which I do not {{understand}} myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> one thing," [...] said he, with force; [...] "serve the people, as {{all true}} men should in a republic. But do not rely upon their gratitude. You will {{remember}} that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do; pray do. There are so {{many reasons}} why we should tell each other everything." [...] This {{elicited}} no promise from Mary. [...] "If I thought that you would care, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> better <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> {{have promised}} to marry Mr. Weston when things are propitious," [...] she said. She looked around at Weston with a smile. [...] "At least, I suppose I have." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought not}} to guess in such a matter. You {{ought not to}} have it on your mind at all. I told <b>you</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> shall go. That's all that I have got to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot; I wish to God I could. But I'll {{take you}} to him, I swear I will. I'll make my friends give him up to you. Do you think that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> now, if I could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word;--unless it be {{by letter}} from Morony Castle, {{and then only}} to me. I will not have you here meddling with my affairs. I told you, though I didn't tell my father, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish, Grace. It {{all comes}} from your not knowing him, or {{understanding}} him. And how should you understand him? I {{give you my}} word that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> if I {{did not know that}} he wishes you to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not that. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} that I could tell, {{because you have}} been so very, very good to me. But I cannot tell. I cannot explain even to myself. Oh, Lady Albury, why have you been so good to me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Convinced, Arthur, of its inconceivability.

6000|$|... “Come, get to work, Doctor. The {{signs are}} {{favourable}} for an extensive practice this voyage. I don’t {{know what the}} Ghost would have been without you, and if I could only cherish such noble sentiments <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> her master is deeply grateful.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I do. God knows I do. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> everything. I would indeed. As to {{screwing}} a hard bargain, I'm {{the last}} man in London who would do it. I thought that your father {{might be willing to}} buy half the property." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like to {{have any}} secret from you, sir," [...] said Frank; [...] "nor, for the matter of that, from anybody else"--the anybody else was {{intended}} to have reference to his mother--"and, therefore, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> at once what I have {{made up my mind}} to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{that that}} were all, my lady.
