The objectives of the Handbook are (1) to bring together pertinent factual information concerning the history, organization and objectives of the <b>EXPAN</b> Program; (2) to articulate the role of the peer counselor and the crucial and strategic function he or she fulfills in {{the success or failure of}} the <b>EXPAN</b> Program; (3) to familiarize the peer counselor with the various university and community support services that are available to the <b>EXPAN</b> student, e. g., work-study, financial aids, tutoring services, housing facilities; (4) to sensitize the peer counselor to the unique needs of the <b>EXPAN</b> student and to outline ways in which the peer counselor can function to help meet these needs; and (5) to serve as a guide, sourcebook and ???ready reference??? for the peer counselor. The Handbook included in this project is meant to serve a real and practical function for the <b>EXPAN</b> Program staff and participants. Upon approval, it will be multiple duplicated and issued to current and prospective peer counselors.

40|$|Abstract — A novel way to {{compensate}} the distortion of Power Amplifier(PA) modules is presented in this paper. A diode linearizer with an inductor is used {{to compensate}} the distortion of the PA using LDMOS FET and has a characteristic of a positive phase and a gain expansion. Two diode-based linearizers are employed {{to compensate the}} distortions. One linearizer compensates the distortion of the phase, mainly. The other compensates the ones of the gain and the phase. It is possible to compensate the distortion of the PA module using this linearizing technique even though the driver stage of the PA module has the distortion. This implies that the PA modules can operate with high efficiencies. In addition, {{it is possible to}} achieve lightweight PA modules. A modulated spectrum power of 8 dB and an EVM of 1. 4 % can be improved using the proposed techniques in the PA module when a 16 -QAM modulated signal is used at a 42 dBm output power and a 3 dB back-off condition.

In the nervous system, growth factor-activated Trk receptor trafficking serves to convey biochemical signaling that underlies fundamental neural functions. Focus has been placed on axonal trafficking but little is known about growth factor-activated Trk dynamics in the neuronal soma, particularly at the molecular scale, {{due in large part to}} technical hurdles in observing individual growth factor-Trk complexes for long periods of time inside live cells. Quantum dots (QDs) are intensely fluorescent nanoparticles that have been used to study the dynamics of ligand-receptor complexes at the plasma membrane but the value of QDs for investigating ligand-receptor intracellular dynamics has not been well exploited. The current study establishes that QD conjugated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (QD-BDNF) binds to TrkB receptors with high specificity, activates TrkB downstream signaling, and allows single QD tracking capability for long recording durations deep within the soma of live neurons. QD-BDNF complexes undergo internalization, recycling, and intracellular trafficking in the neuronal soma. These trafficking events exhibit little time-synchrony and diverse heterogeneity in underlying dynamics that include phases of sustained rapid motor transport without pause as well as immobility of surprisingly long-lasting duration (several minutes).

Also highlighted ar e recen t developments in inst ru ct ion as th ey pertain spe cifically to th e teaching of L 2 sp eaking, listen ing, readi ng, and writing. In th e past 15 yea rs o r so, seve ra l crucia l facto rs have co mbined to affect cu rren t persp ec tives on the teaching of En glish worldwide: (a) the declin e of methods, (b) a growing emphasis on both bottom-up and top-down skills, (c) th e cre a tion of new kn owled ge abo u t En glish, and (d) integrat ed an d contextualized teaching of multiple language skills. In part becau se of its comparatively short history as a discipline, TESOL has been {{and continues to be}} a dynamic fie ld, one in which new venues an d perspectives are still un foldin g. The growth of new knowledge about the how and the wh at of L 2 teaching and learning is certain to continue and will probably remain the hallmark ofTESOL's disciplinary maturation. T oday, it is a truism to say that each era in the history of secondlanguage (L 2) teaching has been marked by expansions of kn owl-edge and pivotal advancemen ts in dis ciplinary theory and practice. One unfortunate sid e effec t of ongoing dis ciplinary innovation and a searc h for the best teaching m ethod is what Richards (2005) referred to as "the theoretical flavor of th e month " (n. p.), alluding to recurrently fash ion-able theories of language learning and use that claim to be based on th e findings of current research. H owever, implicit in a view of the ongoing development of L 2 teaching is an expectation that what is cu rren t, innovative, and central in L 2 pedagogy today is likely to bec ome a stepping-stone in the <b>expans</b> ion and refinement of disciplinary kn owl-edge. This overview of th e current perspectives in L 2 teaching highligh ts the trends that began in th e 1990 s and the 2000 s and are likely to con tinue to affect instruction in L 2 skills at least in the immediate future. In the current dynamic perspectives on foundational L 2 skills, fou...|$|R
