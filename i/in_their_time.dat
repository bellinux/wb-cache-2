5|$|In a {{retrospective}} Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>time.</b> He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game which has become an expensive collector's item.|$|E
5|$|Romeo and Juliet {{may be the}} most-filmed play of all time. The {{most notable}} {{theatrical}} releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The latter two were both, <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>time,</b> the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever. Romeo and Juliet was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer.|$|E

5|$|Hieroglyphs {{retained}} their pictorial appearance, {{and classical}} authors emphasised this aspect, {{in sharp contrast}} to the Greek and Roman alphabets. In the 5th century, the priest Horapollo wrote Hieroglyphica, an explanation of almost 200 glyphs. His work was believed to be authoritative, yet it was misleading in many ways, and this and other works were a lasting impediment to the understanding of Egyptian writing. Later attempts at decipherment were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to study hieroglyphs, by comparing them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>time.</b> The study of hieroglyphs continued with fruitless attempts at decipherment by European scholars, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Georg Zoëga in the 18th. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 provided critical missing information, gradually revealed by a succession of scholars, that eventually allowed Jean-François Champollion to solve the puzzle that Kircher had called the riddle of the Sphinx.|$|E
5|$|Sir Abraham Elton was {{succeeded by}} four further Sir Abraham Eltons. Sir Abraham Elton, 2nd Baronet, {{and his son}} Sir Abraham Elton, 3rd Baronet, were also Sheriff and Mayor of Bristol <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>time,</b> and the second Baronet was also MP for Taunton 1722–1727, {{succeeding}} to his father's seat of Bristol in 1727 until his own death in 1742, despite being nearly ruined in the South Seas Bubble crisis. The third Baronet died bankrupt, and the estate (which had been entailed {{to protect it from}} his creditors) passed in 1761 to his brother, Sir Abraham Isaac Elton, 4th Baronet. He made substantial changes to the house and grounds in the then fashionable Gothic revival style, and was succeeded in 1790 by his son, Sir Abraham Elton, 5th Baronet. He was ordained as a young man, and was a curate in West Bromwich before inheriting the title. He was a supporter of Hannah More, and a fervent opponent of Methodism, at one time inducing the vicar of Blagdon to sack his curate, causing a national scandal. His second wife, Mary, made further alterations to the house in the early 19th century, and also made many improvements to the town, including a school. One of the town's modern primary schools is named after her.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} the frequency of injuries in primary and secondary schools during leisure time and physical education classes in school {{as well as in}} group and individual sports. The sample included 2842 pupils from nine primary schools and 1235 students from five secondary schools in Slovenia. The data were processed with the SPSS statistical software package and the frequencies and Crosstabs were calculated. The results showed that substantially more pupils and students were injured <b>in</b> <b>their</b> leisure <b>time</b> than during physical education classes. Girls were more frequently injured in group and individual sports practiced during physical education classes and in individual sports practiced <b>in</b> <b>their</b> leisure <b>time,</b> whereas boys suffered more injuries in group sports practiced <b>in</b> <b>their</b> leisure <b>time.</b> As regards group sports, pupils and students were most frequently injured while playing football <b>in</b> <b>their</b> leisure <b>time</b> whereas, during physical education classes, they suffered most injuries in volleyball, followed closely by basketball and football; as regards individual sports, pupils and students were most frequently injured while cycling and rollerblading <b>in</b> <b>their</b> leisure <b>time,</b> whereas during physical education classes they suffered most injuries in athletics...|$|R
