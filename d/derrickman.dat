50|$|The Derrickhand or <b>Derrickman</b> {{position}} varies {{greatly from}} one drilling rig to another. He almost always reports {{directly to the}} driller. The name <b>derrickman</b> comes from the position that he normally occupies, {{which is at the}} top of the derrick. From this position he guides the stands of drill pipe, typically 90 feet (27 meters) long, into the fingers at the top of the derrick while tripping (removing the drill string) out of the hole. When tripping into the hole (or Running In) he will pull the pipe out of the fingers and guide it into the elevators suspended from the top drive. Traditionally, the <b>derrickman</b> also works closely with the mud engineer (see drilling fluid) when not tripping pipe since he is not needed in the derrick. In this capacity it is his responsibility for monitoring the pH level, level of Calcium, viscosity and the mud weight (density), adding sacks of chemicals (25-100 lb each) to the mud or oil to maintain the desired properties, and monitor the mud level in the mud pits to aid in the well control. He is also responsible for the shale shakers and the mud pumps (making sure they run well and fixing them when a fault occurs). The <b>derrickman</b> is also responsible for the transfer of additional fluids or chemicals (e.g.: Barite, Bentonite or oil-based fluids) from bulk silos or tanks (tank farm) to the mud system.|$|E
5000|$|Stands are emplaced {{inside of}} the [...] "board" [...] of the {{drilling}} rig. They are usually kept between [...] "fingers". Most boards will allow stands to go ten stands deep {{and as much as}} fifty stands wide on land based rigs. The stands are further held in place using ropes in the board which are tied in a shoe knot by the <b>derrickman.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Derrickhand (derrick-man): Responsible for the {{drilling}} mud, the mud pits where drilling fluids are circulated around the system, and the mud pumps, {{as well as}} being the hand up in the derrick manipulating stands {{into and out of the}} fingers during tripping operations. Acting as a lead for the driller who is mostly restricted to the rig floor. In many cases the <b>derrickman</b> is exclusively responsible for work in the derrick during [...] "tripping" [...] pipe in and out of the hole.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to estimate the risk of lung cancer attributable to occupational factors and not due to tobacco. At 24 hospitals in nine metropolitan areas in the United States, 1793 male lung cancer cases were matched for race, age, hospital, year of interview, and cigarette smoking (never smoker, ex-smoker, smoker (1 - 19 and > or = 20 cigarettes per day)) to two types of controls (cancer and non-cancer hospital patients). Information on usual occupation, exposure to specific potential carcinogens, and cigarette smoking was obtained by interview. Risk of lung cancer was increased significantly for electricians; sheetmetal workers and tinsmiths; bookbinders and related printing trade workers; cranemen, <b>derrickmen,</b> and hoistmen; moulders, heat treaters, annealers and other heated metal workers; and construction labourers. All of these occupations are potentially exposed to known carcinogens. Odds ratios (ORs) were increased for exposure to coal dust (adjusted OR = 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 1 - 2. 1). After stratification, this association was statistically significant only after 10 or more years of exposure. Lung cancer was also related to exposure to asbestos (adjusted OR = 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 2. 2). The ORs increased with increasing duration of exposure to asbestos for all smoking categories except for current smokers of 1 - 19 cigarettes per day. The statistical power to detect ORs among occupations that were previously reported to be at increased risk of lung cancer but that failed to show an OR of at least 1. 5 in the current study was small. The cumulative population attributable risk (PAR) of lung cancer due to occupation was 9. 2 %. It is concluded that occupational factors play an important part in the development of lung cancer independently of cigarette smoking. Because occupations at high risk of lung cancer were under-represented, the cumulative PAR of the present study is likely to be an underestimate of the true contribution of occupation to risk of lung cancer...|$|R
5000|$|Stands are emplaced on {{the floor}} of the {{drilling}} rig by the chain hand. When stands are being put onto the floor the chainhand is said to be [...] "racking stands". After the bottom of the stand is placed {{on the floor}}, the <b>derrickman</b> will unlatch the elevators and pull the stand in either with a rope or with just his arms. When stands are being put back into the hole, the derickman will slam the stand into the elevators to force them to latch. The chainhand will brace against the stand to control it when the driller picks it up. This is referred to as [...] "tailing the pipe" [...] as the chain hand will hold the pipe and allow it to semi-drag them back to the hole. The chain hand then passes it off to the tong hand, who then [...] "stabs" [...] the stand into the pipe already in the hole.|$|E
