In the meantime, Koṇḍañña returned to his home town of Kapilavastu and ordained Punna. Punna attained arahantship and 500 of his clansmen become monks. Punna was later acknowledged by the Buddha as the foremost of the disciples in preaching skills.|$|E

50|$|Condign merit (meritum de condigno) is {{an aspect}} of Roman Catholic {{theology}} signifying merit with the dignity of Christ. A person born again in Christ does not merit of his own virtue but the virtues of Christ are applied to his work. Therefore, it is God crowning his works. Congruent merit {{is the equivalent of}} condign merit but applied to an unregenerated person by the goodness of God. In the first case, God has obligated himself, by <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> reward <b>his</b> son's merits in his children. In the second case, God bestows his merit to those who seek him in faith not from obligation but from mercy and love. In neither case is God obligated by the human. In the first case, God is obligated by <b>his</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> those who love him. In the second, God is obligated by his love and mercy to his creatures who obey him.|$|R
