40|$|Immunoblotting is a {{powerful}} technique {{for the detection of}} small amounts of immunologically interesting proteins in unpurified preparations. Iodinated protein A (PA) has been widely used as a second antibody for detection of proteins; however, it does not bind equally well to immunoglobulins from different species nor does it bind to all subclasses of immunoglobulin G (IgG). We compared the sensitivity of [125 I]PA with those of both horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (HRP) and glucose oxidase-anti-glucose oxidase (GAG) soluble complexes for visualizing bovine serum albumin, human IgG, or human C 3 which was either <b>dot</b> <b>blotted</b> or electroblotted to nitrocellulose. [125 I]PA was uniformly 10 - to 100 -fold less sensitive than either HRP or GAG.

Both 125 I-Cry 1 Ac and 125 I-QNR-AAA bound to 210 - and 120 -kDa proteins from M. sexta brush border membrane vesicles and purified 120 -kDa aminopeptidase N on ligand <b>blots.</b> However, on <b>dot</b> <b>blots</b> 125 I-QNR-AAA bound brush border vesicles but did not bind purified aminopeptidase except when aminopeptidase was denatured. In the reciprocal experiment, 125 I-aminopeptidase bound Cry 1 Ac but did not bind QNR-AAA. 125 I-aminopeptidase bound Cry 1 Ab to a limited extent but not the Cry 1 Ab domain I mutant Y 153 D or Cry 1 Ca.

40|$|Protein, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functional biomolecules in the human body, plays a significant role in physiological responses and molecular diagnostics. Detecting the existence of proteins, quantifying concentration, and identifying protein types are therefore important techniques in many fields. Immunoassays are one of the major techniques relied on for protein detection. Immunoassays have been broadly applied in disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical development, food science, and environmental protection. The first part of this dissertation describes studies aimed at developing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene as a large size protein biosensing platform. To utilize graphene as a biosensing platform, techniques to immobilize proteins on graphene are critical. In this dissertation work, carboxyl functional groups (-COOH) were created by graphene functionalization, and the functionalized graphene was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photo spectroscopy (XPS), and fluorescence microscopy. The approach developed here provides information about protein coupling density and uniformity on large scale graphene (> cm 2). The second and the third parts of the thesis describe the application of a microfluidic technique to two widely used protein detection methods – immunoblotting and <b>dot</b> <b>blotting.</b> The microfluidic systems were designed and fabricated to be easily interfaced with a common type of protein blotting membrane called polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The microfluidic device was specifically applied to the antibody incubation step, which reduces antibody consumption and therefore also significantly reduces the cost of the assay. In microfluidic immunoblotting, an approach to activate the PVDF membrane to increase its protein binding capacity was developed. This was achieved by adding a surfactant Tween- 20 to the antibody solution. The concentration of Tween- 20 was optimized so that only the portion of the membrane within the channel region was activated. The system has been shown to be able to profile inflammatory signaling pathways. In microfluidic <b>dot</b> <b>blotting,</b> the influence of substrate hydrophobicity and protein concentrations on device design constraints were studied. Inflammatory cytokine detection using the developed microfluidic <b>dot</b> <b>blotting</b> system was determined. Altogether these experiments demonstrate that applying microfluidic techniques to protein immunoblotting and <b>dot</b> <b>blotting</b> improves detection efficiency, and reduces cost by utilizing less antibodies...|$|R

40|$|AIM: Recently, anti-Enolase and anti-carbonic anhydrase {{antibodies}} {{have been}} observed in over 60 % of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and cystoid macular oedema (CME). We investigated {{the presence of these}} antibodies in a series of patients with CME due to different pathologies. METHODS: In 10 patients with CME serum antibodies against Carbonic anhydrase (CA) II (30 kD) and Enolase (46 kD) were sought using Western <b>Blots,</b> <b>Dot</b> <b>Blots</b> as well as ELISA. RESULTS: Western and <b>dot</b> <b>blotting</b> showed anti-CA II antibodies in all and anti-Enolase antibodies in six of the 10 patients. The average titer measured with ELISA was 0. 9 +/- 0. 08 OD Units (0. 35 - 1. 4) with a dilution of 1 : 400. CONCLUSION: The presence of anti-retinal antibodies in the serum of all patients confirms the high prevalence of these antibodies in patients with CME. This may suggest that a dysfunction of CA and enolase activity in the retinal pigment epithelium may lie at the root of oedema formation, whereas other mechanisms may be responsible in the absence of these antibodies...|$|R
50|$|A <b>dot</b> <b>blot</b> (or slot blot) is a {{technique}} in molecular biology used to detect biomolecules, and for detecting, analyzing, and identifying proteins. It represents a simplification of the northern blot, Southern blot, or western blot methods. In a <b>dot</b> <b>blot</b> the biomolecules to be detected are not first separated by electrophoresis. Instead, a mixture containing the molecule to be detected is applied directly on a membrane as a dot, and then is spotted through circular templates directly onto the membrane or paper substrate. This differs from the western blot because protein samples are not separated electrophoretically. This is then followed by detection by either nucleotide probes (for a northern blot and southern blot) or antibodies (for a western blot).|$|E
50|$|A {{blotting}} matrix, in {{molecular biology}} and genetics, is the substrate onto which macromolecules, such as proteins, are transferred in a blot method.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of digoxigenin and biotin labelled DNA probes {{for the detection}} of human papillomavirus (HPV) by <b>dot</b> <b>blotting</b> and in situ hybridisation was compared in tissues from cervical, laryngeal, and anogenital neoplasia. Probes were either labelled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, or labelled with biotin by nick translation and detected with streptavidin, both methods having a common final visualisation procedure using alkaline phosphatase. Digoxigenin labelled probes proved two to 10 -fold more sensitive by quantitative <b>dot</b> <b>blotting</b> and four-fold more sensitive in detecting HPV 16 DNA in a series of 31 anal carcinomas, compared with biotinylated probes. The digoxigenin method also produced less non-specific background staining of tissue sections than biotin labelled probes. It is concluded that digoxigenin DNA labelling and detection provides a simple, reliable, and efficient alternative to the use of biotin or radioactive isotopes {{for the detection of}} HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation. Digoxigenin labelled probes also offer the possibility of double labelling in situ hybridisation procedures when used with biotin labelled probes to provide simultaneous identification of different DNA sequences...|$|R

40|$|A {{microscale}} Western blotting {{system based}} on separating sodium-dodecyl sulfate protein complexes by capillary gel electrophoresis followed by deposition onto a blotting membrane for immunoassay is described. In the system, the separation capillary is grounded through a sheath capillary to a mobile X-Y translation stage, which moves a blotting membrane past the capillary outlet for protein deposition. The blotting membrane is moistened with a methanol and buffer mixture to facilitate protein adsorption. In the first instrument discrete protein zones could be detected, but bands were broadened by about 1. 7 -fold by transfer to membrane. A complete Western blot for lysozyme was completed {{in about one hour}} with 50 pg mass detection limit from low microgram per milliliter samples. To increase throughput, a multiplexed CE-Western apparatus was constructed. To improve stability and allow for speedier separation, formulations for dextran sieving media were tested. Reduced band broadening and separation of 100 kDa proteins in 20 min was achieved. Up to four capillaries were operated in parallel, separating and transferring cell lysate proteins to a single blot for immunoassay for total analysis in 1 hour. Each capillary performed multiple injections before capillary regeneration, further increasing throughput. Sub-microgram/mL levels of actin were easily detected in cell lysate samples. These results demonstrate substantial reduction in time requirements and improvement in mass sensitivity compared to conventional Western <b>blots.</b> <b>Dot</b> <b>blotting</b> using capillaries for deposition is also reported. By delivering nanoliter-microliter volumes to a narrow spot, sensitivity is enhanced. For a dot 1000 x larger in volume, a 7 x larger diameter dot was observed, representing orders of magnitude in concentrating effects for larger volume accumulations. Western blotting using capillary electrophoresis and capillary <b>dot</b> <b>blotting</b> show promise to analyze low volume samples with reduced reagents and time.
