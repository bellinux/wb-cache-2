But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday.

500|$|In December 2006, Robert [...] "Evel" [...] Knievel sued West for {{trademark}} infringement in West's video for [...] "Touch the Sky". Knievel {{took issue with}} a [...] "sexually charged video" [...] in which West takes on the persona of [...] "Evel Kanyevel" [...] and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the [...] "vulgar and offensive" [...] images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Just days {{before his death in}} November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, [...] "I thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> guy and quite a gentleman." ...|$|E

After the news of his death, leading figures from the world of {{football}} and politics paid tribute to him. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called him a [...] "great friend, a wonderful individual and tremendous football man". UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "He will be remembered not only for his playing career and his outstanding managerial career at both club and international level, but also because he was a truly warm and passionate human being." [...] Gary Lineker said, [...] "It is a sad day and a great loss. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> man and will be deeply missed by everybody in the country. I never played for a more enthusiastic man. He gave so much to the game." [...] Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair described Robson as a [...] "real Geordie gentleman". According to the then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Robson [...] "epitomised everything that is great about football in this country". His friend, the broadcaster Michael Parkinson, said, [...] "Robson will be remembered long after the present lot are old bones. By his decency, his humour, his love of the game's traditions and origins and confusion at what it had become, he made present day football look what it is – shabby by comparison. I can think of no more fitting epitaph." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and {{enrolled}} in his dance {{class at the}} London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image [...] "really blossomed". [...] "He lived on his emotions, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus." [...] Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed {{in the creation of}} personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned [...] "Over the Wall We Go" [...] became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, [...] "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year. In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play The Pistol Shot in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway {{to take part in a}} film, Song of Norway; this affected him, and several songs, such as [...] "Letter to Hermione" [...] and [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] reference her, and for the video accompanying [...] "Where Are We Now?" [...] he wore a T-shirt with the words [...] "m/s Song of Norway". They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of Love You till Tuesday, a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including [...] "Space Oddity", which had not been released when the film was made.|$|E

2500|$|In 1940, Walter Lippman {{regarded}} {{him as an}} opportunist, who [...] "changes his views from hour to hour… always more concerned with taking the popular position than he is {{in dealing with the}} real issues." [...] The journalist John Gunther wrote that [...] "There are plenty of vain and ambitious and uncharming politicians. This would not be enough to cause Dewey's lack of popularity. What counts more is that so many people think of him as opportunistic. Dewey seldom goes out on a limb by taking a personal position which may be unpopular... every step is carefully calculated and prepared." [...] Adding to that, he had a tendency towards pomposity and was considered stiff and unapproachable in public, with his aide Ruth McCormick Simms once describing him as [...] "cold, cold as a February iceberg". She however added that [...] "he was brilliant and thoroughly honest." [...] Leo O'Brien, a reporter for the United Press International (UPI), recalled Dewey in an interview by saying that [...] "I hated his guts when he first came to Albany, and I loved him by the time he left. It was almost tragic – how he put on a pose that alienated people. Behind a pretty thin veneer <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> guy." [...] John Gunther wrote in 1947 that some [...] "people may not [...] "like" [...] Dewey, but (a) an inner core of advisers and friends, including some extremely distinguished people, have a loyalty to him little short of idolatrous, and (b) {{he is one of the}} greatest vote-getters in the history of the nation." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{was anxious}} to make himself popular; and the people, who had long disliked the late King, were very willing {{to believe that he}} {{deserved}} to be so.

And the King fought at tournaments and always came off victorious--for the courtiers took care of that--and there was a general outcry that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> man. Empson, Dudley, and their supporters were accused of a variety of crimes they had never committed, instead of the offences of which they really had been guilty; and they were pilloried, and set upon horses with their faces to the tails, and knocked about and beheaded, to the satisfaction of the people, and the enrichment of the King.|$|E

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> man, this Cap'n Bill. Not so very old, {{although}} {{his hair was}} grizzled--what there was of it. Most of his head was bald as an egg and as shiny as oilcloth, and this made his big ears stick out in a funny way. His eyes had a gentle look and were pale blue in color, and his round face was rugged and bronzed. Cap'n Bill's left leg was missing, from the knee down, {{and that was why}} the sailor no longer sailed the seas. The wooden leg he wore was good enough to stump around with on land, or even to take Trot out for a row or a sail on the ocean, {{but when it came to}} [...] "runnin' up aloft" [...] or performing active duties on shipboard, the old sailor was not equal to the task. The loss of his leg had ruined his career and the old sailor found comfort in devoting himself to the education and companionship of the little girl.|$|E
