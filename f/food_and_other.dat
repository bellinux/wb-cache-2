5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a black market in <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food {{on the black}} market was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to synthesize existing {{information on the}} role of gender-based local knowledge in utilization of wild <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> non-wood forest products for household food security in Tanzania. The study aimed at generating useful knowledge for advocacy, policy making and training. The specific objectives of this study were firstly, to assess issues of accessibility and dependency on wild <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> non-wood forest products for household food security in the country, secondly, to examine the difference between women’s and men’s local knowledge with regard to collection, processing and utilization of wild <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> non-wood forest products, and thirdly, to identify potentials and problems/threats with regard to availability of non-wood forest products for household food security. Literature from different authorities was critically synthesized to achieve the study objectives. The available information shows that there exists a wide range of wild <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> non-wood forest products, which are important for household food security. Non-wood forest products contribute through direct consumption of harvested wild <b>foods</b> <b>and</b> indirectly through income generation...|$|R
5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> supplies, persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this {{made its way to}} St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|Britain's hold on Gibraltar was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked {{the continuation of}} the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across {{the upper end of the}} peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> supplies.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col.

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in 1914 Norway declared its neutrality, alongside Sweden and Denmark. Nansen was appointed president of the Norwegian Union of Defence, but had few official duties, and continued with his professional work as far as circumstances permitted. As the war progressed, the loss of Norway's overseas trade led to acute shortages of food in the country, which became critical in April 1917 when the United States entered the war and placed extra restrictions on international trade. Nansen was dispatched to Washington by the Norwegian government; after months of discussion he secured <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> supplies {{in return for the}} introduction of a rationing system. When his government hesitated over the deal, he signed the agreement on his own initiative.|$|E

Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and {{the introduction}} of contaminants and invasive species. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to its natural state.|$|E
