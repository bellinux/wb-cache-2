The range of cutting velocity (V) employed in these tests were from 0. 0023 to 52. 53 m/sec. The depth of cut (feed of tool per revolution of a steel disk) was varid from 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm by varing the speed of the <b>feed</b> <b>carriage</b> in combination with two variable-speed motors and some pulleys (Fig. 1). The main results obtained were : (1) The type of chip formation, the curvature of the chip (ρ), and the checks occurring in the chip, change with V (Figs. 5 ～ 9). (2) Although the cutting-force components change remarkably with V, the degree of their changes depends not only on the cutting conditions but also on the workpiece conditions. For instance, in the range of very - low cutting - velocity, below about 10 m/sec, the horizontal component (F_H) and the frictional force (F) of the cutting force, when cutting with air - dried workpieces, decrease remarkably with increases in V. In the range of V of about 10 ～ 30 m/sec, these components are not affected by V. In the range of V of about 30 ～ 53 m/sec, these components decrease gradually with increases in V. Compared with these, the vertical component (F_V) and the normal force (N) of the cutting force change slightly or vary little with V (Figs. 8 and 9). (3) The frictional coefficient (μ), when cutting with water - saturated workpieces, is lower in comparison with that when cutting with air - dried workpieces, and μ, when cutting not only with water - saturated workpieces but also with air - dried workpieces, decreases with increases in V (Fig. 10) ...|$|E

For instance, some results show practically no effect on cutting force 2), 6), whereas others show a curve with a minimum value of cutting force at some velocities, or a gradual decrease with an increase in cutting velocity 1), 4), 7), 8). Furthermore, there exist many unknown matters with respect to the effects of cutting velocity on mechanism of chip formation in wood cutting. In the present experiment, cutting tests of wood with the grain were performed to obtain fundamental data on the effects of cutting velocity on chip formation, cutting force and frictional coefficient by the use an experimental appearatus for cutting tests (Fig. 1). The range of cutting velocity employed in these tests were from 0. 0023 to 52. 53 m/sec. The depth of cut (feed of tool perrevolution of a steel disk) was adjusted from 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm by varing the speed of the <b>feed</b> <b>carriage</b> in combination with two variable speed motors and somepulleys (Fig. 1). The tool used for cutting test was made of high-speed steel (SKH 2), and its sharpness angle was 25 degrees; its clearance angle was held constant at 10 degrees. Test materials used were mainly Hinki (Chamaecyparisobtusa, specific gravity in air-dry (ru) : 0. 40, moisture content (u) : 13. 0 %), Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla, ru: 0. 38, u : 14. 3 %) and Red meranti(Shorea sp, ru : 0. 38, u: 13. 0 %); in addition to these, hinoki in water-saturated condition (u : 83 ± 5 %) was used. The main results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) Three types of chip formation were recognized throughout the entire cutting conditions employed in this test, that is,their types are continuous flow type, split type, and intermediate type (resembling continuous flow type but the chip has slight checks). Relations of these types to cutting velocity (V) at various combinations of depth of cut (t) and workpiece conditions are given in Fig. 6. (2) The curvature of the chip (o) and the checks occurring in the chip, change with V, for instance, o decreases and the pith of checks (pc) in the chip increases, with increases in V (Figs. 7 and 8). (3) Although the cutting-force components change remarkably with V, the degree of their changes depends not only on the cutting conditions but also on the workpiece conditions. For instance, in the range of very-low cutting-velocity, below about 10 m/sec, the horizontal component (FH) and the frictional force (F) of the cutting force, when cutting with air-dried workpieces, decrease remarkably with increases in V. In the range of V of about 10 ～ 30 m/sec, their components are not affected by V. In the range of V of about 30 ～ 53 m/sec, their components decreae gradually with increases in V. Compared with these, the vertical component (Fv) and the normal force (N) of the cutting force change slightly or vary little with V (Figs. 9 and 10). (4) The remarkable increase in V and the presence of a large quantity of free water reduce the friction on the interface between the tool rake face and the chip to much lower value. For instance, the frictional coefficient (μ), when cutting with water-saturated workpieces, is lower in comparison with that when cutting with air-dried workpieces, and μ, when cutting not only with water-saturated workpiecesbut also with air-dried workpieces decreases with increases in V (Fig. 12). These results can be explained {{on the basis of the}} frictional theories on theories on terms of adhesion and lubrication and so on...|$|E

With the proposed mandrel, we performed several experiments corresponding to the variation of typical filament winding-related process parameters: fiber speed, roving tension, roving dimensions, wet versus dry winding, and surface quality of the mandrel. The results indicate that the surface quality of the mandrel and the type of winding process (wet vs. dry fibers) have a considerable influence on the obtained data.

The clear specimens the end grain surface to which were applied thin sensitive films printed grid patterns, were prepared. After being soused in water up to saturated condition, they were set on the experimental apparatus equipped with two 2 -axis dynamometers (Fig. 1). Then, these test specimens were compressed or rolled out by two types of pressure bars in both stationary and feeding state of the <b>feeding</b> <b>carriage.</b> The distributions of the deflections in the specimens were determined from the moiré fringe pattern or the distortion pattern of grid line. Furthermore, in order to determine the effects of pressure bar compression and restraint in the thick-slicing process, cutting tests were carried out on the experimental apparatus, using a roller bar and a single faced nosebar (sharp bar), and the cutting force components acting on the tool face and the compressive force components acting on the pressure bar face were measured with the two 2 -axis dynanometers. The main results obtained are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical component of the compressive force acting on the bar face (Pv) varies largely with the combinations of horizontal distance (h) and vertical distance (v), whereas the horizontal component of the bar force (PH) varies slightly with h and v (Figs. 11 and 12). (2) In slicing with a roller bar, Pv increases largely with decrease in h. Therefore, the tool edge deflection due to overcompression of bar occurs in the smaller range of h (Fig. 10). (3) The distribution pattern of the deflection in the workpiece varies with the types of pressure bars applied, that is, in the case of sharp bar, the high strain concentrates at the loaded point and the distribution of the deflection is limited to a narrower area, but in the case of roller bar, the strain concentration diminishes and the distribution of the deflection spreads in a large area (Photos. 1 ～ 4). (4) Surfaces of the sliced veneer produced with a roller bar are well smoother than those with a sharp bar (Photos. 5 and 6). (5) From these results, it may be concluded that the major factors affecting the quality of the thick-sliced veneer are not only the bar restraint which is determined by the combinations of such factors as h, v, depth of cut (t), cutting angle (θ) and roller diameter of roller bar (D) but also the contact area between the bar face and the workpiece surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of the acidification of pelleted <b>feed</b> on the <b>carriage</b> and seropositivity against Salmonella in finisher pigs of a commercial herd. Three different diets were assayed: 0. 8 % formic acid (group 1); 0. 4 % lactic acid plus 0. 4 % formic acid (group 2) and a feedstuff without additives (group 3). One thousand pigs were includ-ed in each treatment that was administered from 19 to 26 weeks of age. Blood, faecal content and mesenteric lymph nodes were collected at slaughter (30 pigs/group). The diet including lactic and formic acids significantly reduced Salmonella seroprevalence compared to the diet without additives (p< 0. 05) but there were no differences on the faecal excretion or in Salmonella carriage in mesenteric lymph nodes. Our results suggest that the administration of a combination of lactic and formic acids at the levels used in this study can be helpful to reduce Salmonella prevalence in finishing pigs. Introduction Feeding strategies have shown to be effective for reducing the incidence of Salmonella in pigs when combined with other measures such as hygiene and adequate manage-ment practices.

The conference was re-named “Amplifying M(Others) Voices 2010. ” The venue remained the same. And it was a fantastic focussed conference with scholars, activists, and artists from around the world participating ! Starting with AU’s Dr. Gina Wong Wylies’ keynote address on the first morning of the conference, the 3 days were filled with excellent and diverse sessions all related to mothering practice and motherhood. My paper was part of a session entitled “Loving & Love in the Art of Motherhood” with the focus on notions of the “good mother. ” The audience was generous in their interpretation and discussion of the overall theme and all of the presentations in this session were well received. Although I did have the sense that my paper, which was based in a very specific psychological theory, was perhaps a little too specific for this audience. There was lots of opportunity throughout the conference to chat and discuss ideas. I used {{a lot of the time}} to gather information and ideas for my new undergraduate course on “Mothering”. Meeting other scholars interested in “Motherhood” as an academic discipline was perhaps the most inspiring aspect of the conference. Please note that my presentation was based on a recently published book chapter [Ross, L. R. (2010). Mom’s the word: Attachment theory’s role in defining the “good mother”. In L. R. Ross (Ed.), Feminist counselling: Theory, issues, and practice (pp. 22 - 51). Toronto: Women’s Press. ] and consequently the presentation is not available to be reproduced online. John Bowlby's (1907 - 1990) attachment theory was formulated to explain mother-infant bonding. The theory was bound by a number of assumptions that placed responsibility for child rearing soley in the hands of women. Bowlby’s theory suggested that infants form a single, principle, bond that once formed provides the mental models that will govern all subsequent attachment relationships. Infant separation from the mother—“maternal deprivation”—was seen as the primary agent affecting infant personality development. Bowlby assumed that women are biologically suited and best able to raise children. The infant’s role in the formation of attachment bonds was not considered, nor were the roles of others in helping infants and children develop positive “attachment” relationships. In 1952 Hilde Bruch (cited in Mead, 1954) astutely pointed out that Bowlby's emphasis on maternal deprivation was " [...] . a new and subtle form of antifeminism in which men—under the guise of exalting the importance of maternity—are tying women more tightly to their children than has been thought necessary since the invention of bottle <b>feeding</b> and baby <b>carriages.</b> " Although a highly influential theory from its inception, in the early 1970 ’s only a handful of “attachment” studies had been published; today we see entire scholarly journals devoted to the topic, publishing literally thousands of articles each year. This paper will review the historical development of the attachment construct and discuss concerns about its continued use in informing mothering practice...|$|R
