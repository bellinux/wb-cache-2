50|$|The {{difficulties}} {{attending the}} publication of a newspaper in such a far frontier town as San Diego were soon evident. The dearth of local news and <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> exchanges was the cause of frequent editorial grumbling. At one period, Ames ran for several weeks {{a list of all the}} post offices and postmaster in California, and at another filled up with a circular of the General Land Office. Most of the American population, including Ames himself, hoped for the ultimate annexation of Lower California, but the presence of the military post and the influence of the army officers, with most of whom Ames was always on intimate terms, made open support or sympathy inexpedient. The Herald achieved its greatest journalistic feat by publishing a series of letters from one of Walker's officers, all grossly colored to favor the filibusters; but toward the last, when the hopelessness of the expedition was clear to all, Ames denounced it.|$|R

25|$|On an {{individual}} basis, foreign nurses {{are subject to}} exploitation by employers. In 1998 six Americans were charged with falsely obtaining H-1A visas and using them to employ Filipino nurses as nurse aides instead of registered nurses. In a case in 1996, a Catholic archdiocese employed some of these foreign nurses as nurse aides instead of nurses. In 2000, Filipino nurses in Missouri received $2.1 million for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> proper wages that an American {{in the same position}} would receive. While these cases were brought to court, many similar situations are left unreported thereby jeopardizing the rights of foreign nurses. Foreign nurses have the tendency to receive less desirable jobs, such as entry-level positions, because of their immigrant status; they are excluded from jobs that would lead to facilities and are often not paid proper salaries.|$|E
25|$|Cannon {{was elected}} as a Democrat to the State House for the 1845/46 session and the 1847/48 session. From 1849 until 1851 he was State Treasurer. Although {{he had been}} a leader in the a Democratic Party prior to the 1862 elections, at that time he {{switched}} parties and became a Republican, who were organized as the Union Party for this election. Perhaps the switch resulted from his devotion to the Union, but it also may have been due to a three time <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> the Democratic nomination for Governor. In {{the months leading up to}} the 1862 elections Cannon and incumbent U.S. Representative George P. Fisher feared they would be defeated by a combination of so many Republican voters off serving in the U.S. Army, and polling place shenanigans by stay at home Democrats. Their solution was to request federal troops to monitor the voting places. The troops came, supervised the election, and Cannon was elected, defeating Democrat Samuel Jefferson from New Castle County. However, Fisher lost, and Cannon faced a General Assembly with a Democratic majority in both houses.|$|E

Writing for The Atlantic, Christoper Orr deemed Adams' performance to be [...] "mesmerizingly open, by turns uplifting and sorrowful", and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times believed that the film was a [...] "showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve". Arrival was a commercial success, earning over $200 million against a $47 million budget.

500|$|In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey {{discusses}} grace, {{calling it}} [...] "our last best word". The book's thesis is that, although people crave grace {{and it is}} centrally important to the gospel, many local churches ignore grace {{in their quest to}} exterminate immorality. Yancey uses the word [...] "ungrace" [...] to describe actions that fail to demonstrate grace. According to the author, the greatest gift the Christian Church can give the world is grace, but the church sometimes offers ungrace instead. Yancey writes that there are secular analogues to most Christian activities benefiting the world, such as social justice work and community service, but that [...] "grace is theological; it comes from God. It's one thing the church can offer that isn't found anywhere else". He describes his experiences attempting to make grace part of the way he lived and not just part of his theology. Yancey quotes Christian counselor David Seamands: [...] "The two major causes of most emotional problems among Evangelical Christians are these: the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> understand, <b>receive</b> and live out God's unconditional grace and forgiveness; and the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> give out that unconditional love, forgiveness, and grace to other people".|$|R

40|$|While zero defects is a noble goal, {{services}} are often manufactured and delivered in real time, leaving {{no time for}} quality inspection prior to delivery to the customer. Hence service failure is inevitable from time to time.

40|$|Introduction This {{abstract}} introduces an early-stopping Terminating Reliable Broadcast (TRB) {{protocol for}} the roundbased model of synchronous computation {{in the presence}} of general-omission failures. The worst-case round complexity of our protocol is given by the number of rounds that precede the first two consecutive failurefree rounds. Process crashes and <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> send or <b>receive</b> messages are the only types of failures in this model. All correct processes must make the same decision: either deliver the value broadcast by the sender, a distinguished process, or decide that the sender is faulty. Only the first alternative is acceptable when the sender is correct. Most known early-stopping TRB protocols (or their Agreement counterparts) have worst-case running times expressed as a function of t (maximum number of faulty processes) or f (number of failures that actually occur).

2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{exists in}} regard {{to whether or not}} any parts of the historic region of Macedonia are incorporated in the present-day Republic of Macedonia, as very little if any of the ancient Macedonian kingdom is. There is also controversy, however, with regard to the Slavic peoples who are concentrated in {{less than half of the}} region. They first arrived in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD when Slavic-speaking populations overturned Macedonia's Greek ethnic composition. As a result, the appropriation by the [...] "Republic of Macedonia" [...] of what Greece held as its [...] "Greek symbols", raised concerns in Greece as well as fuelling nationalist anger. This anger was reinforced by the legacy of the Civil War and the view in some quarters, that members of Greece's Slavic-speaking minority were pro-Yugoslavian and presented a danger to its borders. The status of the Republic of Macedonia became a heated political issue in Greece where demonstrations took place in Athens while one million Macedonian Greeks took to the streets in Thessaloniki in 1992, under the slogan: [...] "Macedonia is Greek", referring to the name and ancient history of the region, not posing a territorial claim against their northern neighbor. Initially, the Greek government objected formally to any use of the name Macedonia (including any derivative names) and also to the use of symbols such as the Vergina Sun. On the other hand, also in 1992, demonstrations by more than 100,000 ethnic Slav Macedonians took place in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, over the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> recognition and supporting the constitutional name of the country.|$|E
2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>receive</b> follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there is mounting evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.|$|E
