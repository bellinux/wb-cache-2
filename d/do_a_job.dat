All of the mission property, (which amounted to $12,270 in 1861), was taken possession by the chiefs of the nation. The same thing happenend with the Koweta Mission. The Creek children were sent back to their homes, while the dedicated teachers took a mournful leave of each other and went back to their homes in the Northern and Southern parts of the country.|$|E

Many of them are quite pretty (and well aware of the fact); they look very gay and rather brazen as, giggling and chattering among themselves, they move along with their heavy burdens, which are held in place by a woolen girdle around the chest.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the war, Belgium {{had been}} {{regarded}} as the foremost European country for the manufacture of armaments. Its Sillon industriel, or industrial valley, {{was one of the}} first fully industrialized and mechanized regions in Europe. The Poudreries Réunies de Belgique was among the oldest armament manufacturers on the Continent, known for its manufacture of mortars, artillery shells, and land mines. Graham Spicer, an official in the Ministry of Munitions who had worked in Belgium before the war and knew its armaments manufacturing capabilities, suggested that perhaps the Belgians might be able to help. An approach was made, and the result was that 1000 skilled Belgian armaments workers volunteered help train other volunteers. As the result of another suggestion (possibly from Spicer as well) most of these volunteers were drawn from the pool of soldiers who had been badly wounded at the front and declared unfit to return there; they were not so unfit they could not <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> of work, but were not capable of resuming life at the Front.|$|E

As an incentive, it offered to pay an extra 10% above the normal going rate for London office developments. Piano decided to take the commission because, as he put it, [...] "the client and the company involved were all about long lasting quality, without rushing.

500|$|Into Temptation {{marks the}} second film by {{independent}} filmmaker Patrick Coyle, who {{wrote and directed}} the 2003 drama film Detective Fiction. Coyle said Into Temptation was partially inspired by his father, James Patrick Coyle, a kind but belligerent {{man who had been}} encouraged by his mother to become a priest. James entered seminary but dropped out before ordination after he was drafted into serving overseas in World War II and met Margaret Mary Quinlan, who would become his wife and Patrick Coyle's mother. Coyle conceived of the script for Into Temptation while imagining what kind of priest his father would have been. His father strongly approved of the project, and told Coyle, [...] "Go make that movie. And tell the truth." [...] Coyle was also partially inspired by his childhood pastor and friend, the Reverend Damian Zuerlein, who performed the marriage ceremony for Coyle and his wife and baptized their children. Coyle said of him, [...] "He's just a young, energetic, competent, committed, devoted man working with a poor parish. And he loves his work. I was inspired by that." [...] Coyle said when writing Into Temptation, he did not intend to make a religious film, and said of protagonist Father John Buerlein, [...] "The character could have been a minister or a rabbi or a public defender. He's a good man trying to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> the best he can." ...|$|E
