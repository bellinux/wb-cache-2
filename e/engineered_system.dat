2500|$|DNA {{sequencing}} is {{determining the}} order of the nucleotide bases in a molecule of DNA. Synthetic biologists make use of DNA sequencing in their work in several ways. [...] First, large-scale genome sequencing efforts continue to provide a wealth of information on naturally occurring organisms. [...] This information provides a rich substrate from which synthetic biologists can construct parts and devices. Second, synthetic biologists use sequencing to verify that they fabricated their <b>engineered</b> <b>system</b> as intended.

40|$|Game {{theory has}} been {{employed}} traditionally as a modeling tool for describing and influencing behavior in societal systems. Recently, game theory {{has emerged as a}} valuable tool for controlling or prescribing behavior in distributed <b>engineered</b> <b>systems.</b> The rationale for this new perspective stems from the parallels between the underlying decision making architectures in both societal <b>systems</b> and distributed <b>engineered</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, both settings involve an interconnection of decision making elements whose collective behavior depends on a compilation of local decisions that are based on partial information about each other and the state of the world. Accordingly, there is extensive work in game theory that is relevant to the engineering agenda. Similarities notwithstanding, there remain important differences between the constraints and objectives in societal and <b>engineered</b> <b>systems</b> that require looking at game theoretic methods from a new perspective. This chapter provides an overview of selected recent developments of game theoretic methods in this role as a framework for distributed control in <b>engineered</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to begin mapping {{perspectives}} of engineering faculty on barriers and opportunities related to the integration of climate change in the analysis and design of <b>engineered</b> <b>systems</b> (CC&ES). Although both sustainability and renewable energy have been receiving increasing attention in engineering education for quite some time 1, climate change, especially as it relates to <b>engineered</b> <b>systems,</b> has yet to become a widely accepted topic of teaching and research. From recent literature on engineering education and from interviews with engineering faculty, a picture emerges of whether and how climate change is an important dimension in the analysis and design of <b>engineered</b> <b>systems.</b> From those sources, we begin to see what it might take to incorporate the relationship between climate change and <b>engineered</b> <b>systems</b> in engineering education, what the barriers and opportunities to this incorporation might be, and what strategies might be available to institutionalize this incorporation in engineering education. · Support for this paper comes from a larger research project on "Climate Change, <b>Engineered</b> <b>Systems,</b> and Society " which has the goal to develop conceptual and educational frameworks and networks ~f change agents to promote effective formal and mf~rmal education for engineering students, policymakers and the public at large.

50|$|Determining {{what the}} users/sponsors {{actually}} want, {{rather than what}} they say they want, is not engineering—it is an art. An architect does not follow an exact procedure. S/he communicates with users/sponsors in a highly interactive way—together they extract the true requirements necessary for the <b>engineered</b> <b>system.</b> The hardware architect must remain constantly in communication with the end users (or a systems architect). Therefore, the architect must be familiar with the user's environment and problem. The engineer need only be very knowledgeable of the potential engineering solution space.|$|E

50|$|It is {{necessary}} {{to distinguish between the}} architecture of the user's world and the engineered hardware architecture. The former represents and addresses problems and solutions in the user's world. It is principally captured in the computer-human interfaces (CHI) of the <b>engineered</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>engineered</b> <b>system</b> represents the engineering solutions—how the engineer proposes to develop and/or select and combine the components of the technical infrastructure to support the CHI. In the absence of an architect, there is an unfortunate tendency to confuse the two architectures, since the engineer thinks in terms of hardware, but the user may be thinking in terms of solving a problem of getting people from point A to point B in a reasonable amount of time and with a reasonable expenditure of energy, or of getting needed information to customers and staff. A hardware architect is expected to combine knowledge of both the architecture of the user's world and of (all potentially useful) hardware engineering architectures. The former is a joint activity with the user; the latter is a joint activity with the engineers. The product is a set of high level requirements reflecting the user's requirements which can be used by the engineers to develop hardware systems design requirements.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>systems</b> are coupled {{networks}} of interacting sub-systems, whose dynamics are constrained to requirements of robustness and flexibility. They have evolved by design to optimize {{function in a}} changing environment and maintain responses within ranges. Analysis, synthesis, and design of complex supply chains aim to identify and explore the laws governing optimally integrated systems. Optimality expresses balance between conflicting objectives while resiliency results from dynamic interactions among elements. Our increasing understanding of life’s multi-scale architecture suggests that living systems share similar characteristics with much to be learned about biological complexity from <b>engineered</b> <b>systems.</b> If health reflects a dynamically stable integration of molecules, cell, tissues and organs; disease indicates displacement compensated for and corrected by activation and combination of feedback mechanisms through interconnected networks. In this article, we draw analogies between concepts in systems engineering and conceptual models of health and disease; establish connections between these concepts and physiologic modeling; and describe how these mirror onto the physiological counterparts of <b>engineered</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
