25|$|In 1853 Caesar first {{played for}} England. The game was against Nottinghamshire at Lord's. He scored only 1 and 7, but his second {{dismissal}} caused some controversy. He <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> a ball from John Birkley, which went towards the wicket-keeper. In taking the ball, the wicket-keeper dislodged a bail, {{at which point}} the umpire announced him out bowled. The wicket-keeper remained silent as Caesar walked. Caesar fared better in the weeks after this and put together a series of high scores, including 63 not out in Cirencester. In August, he got his maiden century, for England against Kent. His 101 included one five, nine fours and five threes.|$|E
60|$|The Princess <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> {{her eyes}} with a little morsel of lace handkerchief.|$|E
60|$|He <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> {{his lips}} with his napkin {{and leaned back}} in his chair. Peterson stared dejectedly at the table.|$|E
60|$|Bronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't half know I'm. Molly great <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> seeing anyone looking.|$|R
6000|$|He {{helped me}} to my feet. [...] "You exerted {{yourself}} too much," [...] he said, <b>dabbing</b> <b>at</b> the yellow stuff with his hand to remove it from my garments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, after {{a fashion}} I can," [...] {{returned}} Rooney, with a modest look, [...] "though I don't pretend to {{be much of a}} <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> it. Are you fond o' singin'?" ...|$|R
60|$|She drew {{a sigh of}} content. She {{raised his}} hand to her lips. Then she <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> her eyes with the few inches of perfumed lace which she called a handkerchief. It was passing, that evil moment.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Simpson <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> her eyes-and sat {{regarding}} him in bewilderment. Her twin chins {{were still}} quivering with emotion, {{but her eyes}} were beginning to harden. [...] "What are you talking about?" [...] she inquired, in a raspy voice.|$|E
60|$|The {{next time}} Jerry <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> {{him with a}} paw, barked, and scurried away in an {{enticing}} semi-circle, Michael started involuntarily though slowly after him. But Michael did not bark; and, after half a dozen leaps, {{he came to a}} full stop and looked to Villa and Harley for permission.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{doubt of}} it," [...] replied Disco, with a grin; [...] "I {{was used to}} be {{considered}} raither a <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> wittles, but I must say I knocks under to you, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say,' Logan interrupted, 'what a <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> disentangling Lumley {{would have}} been if he had not got that Professorship of Toxicology at Edinburgh, and been able to marry Miss Wingan at last!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss T. (In a stage whisper.) A twenty-four-inch waist, and she won't let it out. Where are my bangles? (Rummager on the toilet-table, and <b>dabs</b> <b>at</b> {{her hair}} with a brush in the interval.) ...|$|R
60|$|Archie <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> his {{forehead}} with his handkerchief. The moments were flying, and it began to seem impossible to shift these two men. Mr. Connolly was as firmly settled in his chair as some primeval rock. As for Mr. Brewster, he, too, had seated himself, and was gazing at Archie with a weary repulsion. Mr. Brewster's glance always made Archie feel as though there were soup on his shirt-front.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went and}} <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> the eyebrow, {{and added a}} little to the lobe of the ear to suggest materialism. Further {{consideration}} ensued. [...] "Vigil's off, I'm afraid," [...] said Harringay. [...] "Why not Mephistopheles? But that's a bit too common. 'A Friend of the Doge,'--not so seedy. The armour won't do, though. Too Camelot. How about a scarlet robe and call him 'One of the Sacred College'? Humour in that, and an appreciation of Middle Italian History." ...|$|E
60|$|Ella {{passed her}} arm through his. Mademoiselle Rosine {{had told her}} while she stood on tiptoe and <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> her cheeks with a powder-puff, that she was too cold. The Messieurs Anglais were often so difficult. They needed encouragement, so very much encouragement. Then there were more confidences, and Madame Rosine was very much astonished. What sort of a man was this Monsieur Macheson, yet so gallant, so gay! She promised herself that she would watch him.|$|E
50|$|On 5 January 2015, {{the network}} {{merged with the}} Greatest Hits Network of Scottish AM {{stations}} to form the Bauer City 2 network. The London-based Magic became available nationally via <b>DAB</b> <b>at</b> the same time.|$|R
60|$|He {{unlocked}} {{the box and}} dipped Michael out with the customary strangle- hold on the neck. He squirmed and struggled, <b>dabbing</b> <b>at</b> {{the air with the}} injured as well as the uninjured forepaw and increasing his pain.|$|R
60|$|Having had a {{previous}} hint of this, he had sought advice from his cousin, the Honourable George, whom he {{regarded as a}} <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> speaking; at least, so {{he had heard the}} Honourable George say of himself.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was escorted}} by a bouncing, black-eyed {{waitress}} {{to a table}} for four. The next table was a long one, at which seven traveling men, or local business men whose wives were at the lake for the summer, ceased trying to get nourishment out of the food, and gawped at her. Before the Boltwoods were seated, the waitress <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> non-existent spots on their napkins, ignored a genuine crumb on the cloth in front of Claire's plate, made motions at a cup and a formerly plated fork, and bubbled, [...] "Autoing through?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{apparition}} vanished. Jimmy {{drew out}} his handkerchief and <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> his forehead. He felt weak and guilty. He {{felt as if}} he had just been accused of nameless crimes and had been unable to deny the charge. Such was the magic of Miss Trimble's eye--the left one, which looked directly at its object. Conjecture pauses baffled at the thought of the effect which her gaze might have created in the breasts of the sex she despised, had it been double instead of single-barrelled. But half of it had wasted itself on a spot some few feet to his right.|$|E
60|$|Sir Thomas <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> his {{forehead}} with his handkerchief. He dared not face the vision of Lady Julia in possession of the truth. At one time, the fear lest she might discover the harmless little deception he had practised had kept him awake at night, but gradually, as the days went by and the excellence of the imitation stones had continued to impose upon her and upon everyone else who saw them, the fear had diminished. But {{it had always been}} {{at the back of his}} mind. Even in her calmer moments, his wife was a source of mild terror to him. His imagination reeled at the thought of what depths of aristocratic scorn and indignation she would plumb in a ease like this.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He 'it me,' {{said the}} long youth, <b>dabbing</b> <b>at</b> {{his face with}} a {{handkerchief}} and pointing an accusing finger at Psmith, who regarded him through his eyeglass with a look in which pity and censure were nicely blended.|$|R
6000|$|... "All sorts, sir. Natives and foreigners. From gentlemen to 'prentices. I {{have had}} Frenchwomen come, before now, and show {{themselves}} <b>dabs</b> <b>at</b> pistol-shooting. Mad {{people out of}} number, of course, but THEY go everywhere where the doors stand open." ...|$|R
60|$|Stone was <b>dabbing</b> <b>at</b> {{his mouth}} with a handkerchief, a task which precluded {{anything}} {{in the shape of}} conversation; so Robinson replied that Mike's study was the first you came to on the right of the corridor {{at the top of the}} stairs.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{not quite}} honest with himself, or he would have {{acknowledged}} the pleasure he took in watching Elsie's erect and graceful figure as she rode past his office window of a morning. It was pleasant to pause at {{the open door of}} her studio for a moment and say [...] "Good-morning," [...] though he received but a cold and formal bow in return. She was more alluring at her easel than in any other place, for she had several curious and very pretty tricks in working, and seemed like a very intent child, with her brown hair loosening over her temples, her eyes glowing with excitement, while she <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> the canvas with a piece of cheese-cloth or a crumb of bread. She dragged her stool into position with a quick, amusing jerk, holding her brush in her teeth meanwhile. Her blouses were marvels of odd grace and rich color.|$|E
60|$|For the {{moonlight}} this evening was almost solid, seeming with its cool still vibration {{to replace the}} very air; in it the war-time precautions against light seemed fantastic, like shading candles in a room still full of daylight. What lights there were {{had the effect of}} strokes and stipples of dim colour laid by a painter's brush on a background of ghostly whitish blue. The dreamlike quality of the town was perhaps enhanced for her eyes by the veil she was wearing--in daytime no longer white. As the music died out of her, elation also ebbed. Somebody had passed her, speaking German, and she was overwhelmed by a rush of nostalgia. On this moonlight night by the banks of the Rhine--whence she came--the orchards would be heavy with apples; there would be murmurs, and sweet scents; the old castle would stand out clear, high over the woods and the chalky-white river. There would be singing far away, and the churning of a distant steamer's screw; and perhaps on the water a log raft still drifting down in the blue light. There would be German voices talking. And suddenly tears oozed up in her eyes, and crept down through the powder on her cheeks. She raised her veil and <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> her face with a little, not-too-clean handkerchief, screwed up in her yellow-gloved hand. But the more she dabbed, the more those treacherous tears ran. Then she became aware that a tall young man in khaki was also standing before the shop-window, not looking at the titles of the books, but eyeing her askance. His face was fresh and open, with a sort of kindly eagerness in his blue eyes. Mechanically she drooped her wet lashes, raised them obliquely, drooped them again, and uttered a little sob....|$|E
50|$|Dabbing {{has made}} its {{appearance}} in politics, as well. In January 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton dabbed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In October, Representative Loretta Sanchez <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of a}} Senate debate. On January 3, 2017, Cal Marshall, 17-year-old son of Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan), <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> his father's swearing in as a Congressman, confusing House Speaker Paul Ryan. On February 22, 2017, Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson dabbed in the UK's House of Commons. French presidential candidates Emmanuel Macron, Benoît Hamon and François Fillon dabbed on TV in March 2017.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew which}} was your carriage--leastways, I guessed it; {{and as it}} came along, I did a drop." [...] Tommy spread out {{her arms and legs}} to {{illustrate}} the action. [...] "The lamps, you know," [...] explained Tommy, still <b>dabbing</b> <b>at</b> her face--"one of them caught me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] said Grandfer Cantle, with melancholy conviction. [...] "Well, {{this is a}} {{bad night}} {{altogether}} for them that have done well in their time; and if I were ever such a <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> the hautboy or tenor-viol, I shouldn't have the heart to play tunes upon 'em now." ...|$|R
50|$|The film won the Canadian Film Award for Film of the Year in 1953. Gélinas was {{so moved}} by the victory {{that he began to}} cry during his {{acceptance}} speech, and presenter Dorothy Lamour pulled the handkerchief out of his suit pocket and began to <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> his eyes as he spoke.|$|R
50|$|In 1853 Caesar first {{played for}} England. The game was against Nottinghamshire at Lord's. He scored only 1 and 7, but his second {{dismissal}} caused some controversy. He <b>dabbed</b> <b>at</b> a ball from John Birkley, which went towards the wicket-keeper.

Caesar fared better in the weeks after this and put together a series of high scores, including 63 not out in Cirencester. In August, he got his maiden century, for England against Kent. His 101 included one five, nine fours and five threes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{not much}} of a <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> my exercise,' he said under his breath, 'but I shall get into fewer scrapes at that work than at this. Every man came into the world for something; my {{department}} seems to be to make every woman cry without meaning it. It's rather hard!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Tom," [...] he said, as they {{stumbled}} along {{over the}} loose ice towards the ice-belt {{that lined the}} cliffs,--"you see, I'm a great <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> ornithology, especially when I've got a gun on my shoulder. When I haven't a gun, strange to say, I don't feel half so enthusiastic about birds!" ...|$|R
6000|$|His wife, {{apparently}} {{struggling to}} repress a little excitement, nodded. [...] "He—he’s left me two hundred pounds {{a year for}} life, Henry," [...] she said, <b>dabbing</b> <b>at</b> her pale blue eyes with a handkerchief. [...] "They’re going to pay it monthly; sixteen pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence a month. That’s how he left it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ever so much better!" [...] said Euphemia. [...] "Now we {{know what}} Nature is. We are sitting right down in her lap, and she is cuddling us up. Isn't that sky lovely? Oh! I think this is {{perfectly}} splendid," [...] said she, making a little <b>dab</b> <b>at</b> her face,--"if it wasn't for the mosquitoes." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{it came to}} {{pass that}} only in public did she meet Walter. He showed his resentment by {{inviting}} her out less and less, by telling her less and less frankly his ambitions and his daily <b>dabs</b> <b>at</b> becoming a great man. Apparently he was rather interested in a flour-faced actress at his boarding-house.|$|R
