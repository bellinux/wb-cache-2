5|$|Microbes simply secrete {{digestive}} <b>enzymes</b> {{into their}} surroundings, while animals only secrete these <b>enzymes</b> from specialized cells in their guts, including {{the stomach and}} pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular <b>enzymes</b> are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>enzymes</b> {{are used}} commercially, for example, in the {{synthesis}} of antibiotics. Some household products use <b>enzymes</b> to speed up chemical reactions: <b>enzymes</b> in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and <b>enzymes</b> in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.|$|E
5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are <b>enzymes</b> called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase <b>enzymes</b> are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase <b>enzymes</b> often make mistakes, {{and this is one}} of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} function of <b>enzymes</b> {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. <b>Enzymes</b> such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but <b>enzymes</b> hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different <b>enzymes</b> digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic <b>enzymes,</b> such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic <b>enzymes</b> IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic <b>enzymes</b> such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant <b>enzymes.</b> Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple <b>enzymes,</b> with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these <b>enzymes</b> to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E

50|$|This <b>enzyme</b> {{belongs to}} the family of {{transfer}}ases, to be specific, those glycosyltransferases that transfer hexoses (hexosyltransferases). The systematic name of this <b>enzyme</b> class is 1,4-alpha-D-glucan:1,4-alpha-D-glucan 6-alpha-D-(1,4-alpha-D-glucano)-transferase. Other names in common use include branching <b>enzyme,</b> amylo-(1,4â†’1,6)-transglycosylase, Q-enzyme, alpha-glucan-branching glycosyltransferase, amylose isomerase, enzymatic branching factor, branching glycosyltransferase, <b>enzyme</b> Q, glucosan transglycosylase, 1,4-alpha-glucan branching <b>enzyme,</b> plant branching <b>enzyme,</b> alpha-1,4-glucan:alpha-1,4-glucan-6-glycosyltransferase, and starch branching <b>enzyme.</b> This <b>enzyme</b> participates in starch and sucrose metabolism.|$|R
50|$|This <b>enzyme</b> {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this <b>enzyme</b> class is (S)-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating). Other names in common use include malic <b>enzyme,</b> pyruvic-malic carboxylase, NAD+-specific malic <b>enzyme,</b> NAD+-malic <b>enzyme,</b> and NAD+-linked malic <b>enzyme.</b> This <b>enzyme</b> participates in pyruvate metabolism.|$|R
5|$|Conversely, some <b>enzymes</b> display enzyme promiscuity, having broad {{specificity}} {{and acting}} {{on a range of}} different physiologically relevant substrates. Many <b>enzymes</b> possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, <b>enzymes</b> almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent <b>enzymes,</b> an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent <b>enzymes</b> the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and <b>enzymes</b> such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response {{to changes in the}} cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because <b>enzymes</b> called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from <b>enzymes</b> in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these <b>enzymes</b> can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Enzymes</b> {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most <b>enzymes</b> are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzymes</b> {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without <b>enzymes,</b> metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through <b>enzymes</b> whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Enzymes</b> must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. <b>Enzymes</b> are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. <b>Enzymes</b> can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E

30|$|The {{substrate}} concentration, {{below the}} requirement for the <b>enzyme</b> saturation, allows the <b>enzyme</b> environment to partition the substrate toward the <b>enzyme.</b> This results {{an increase in the}} <b>enzyme</b> activity.|$|R
5|$|<b>Enzymes</b> serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. <b>Enzymes</b> are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain <b>enzymes</b> for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E

5|$|Like all catalysts, <b>enzymes</b> {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some <b>enzymes</b> {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, <b>enzymes</b> are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. <b>Enzymes</b> differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic <b>enzymes</b> {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts.

Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the <b>enzymes</b> released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
