30|$|In most {{countries}} livestock manure are stored {{for a month}} or more before applied into the soil (Sommer and Hutchings 2001). On the other hand, manure storage contributes to the atmospheric pool <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> such as ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane (Kulling et al. 2001). The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> depends on feed digestibility and general animal performance (Mathot et al. 2012). Due to this loses only about 52  % of Nitrogen excreted by livestock is estimated to be recycled (Webb et al. 2012). In manure, Nitrogen is lost as ammonia or nitrous oxide. Ammonia volatilisation is the major pathway for Nitrogen loss (van der Meer 2008; Ndegwa et al. 2008). Emission occurs due to manure exposure to atmosphere in barns, during storage and application (Hafner et al. 2012).|$|R

These risks will be {{exacerbated}} depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> additional greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> Urgent action is needed to limit the severity of impacts associated with further warming. British Columbia (BC) has taken action to reduce greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> from carbon-based fuels by introducing a carbon tax in 2008. As an innovative approach to climate change mitigation, especially in North America, studies evaluating its effectiveness are valuable. We assessed the long-term viability potential of the BC carbon tax using common pool resource design principles, a novel application of the design principles to environmental policy. We found that the design principles can be applied productively to environmental policy and larger scale air pollution problems. With regard to the BC carbon tax, {{our findings suggest that}} closer monitoring of user behavior, further increases of the tax over time, and pursuing efforts for a more elaborate system of nested enterprises and interjurisdictional cooperation could increase the long-term success of the BC carbon tax. We also found that the design principles allowed us to more comprehensively reach conclusions regarding the broader effectiveness of the tax when compared to existing policy analysis. Traditionally, climate policy evaluation has focused on the end goal without considering broader constraints and issues of resource allocation. We suggest that common pool resource theory, which is based on strong theoretical principles and encourages reflexivity, will be able to address those limitations...|$|R

40|$|Life cycle {{assessments}} <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> {{have been}} developed for analyzing products "from cradle to grave": from resource extraction to waste disposal. Life cycle assessment methodology has also been applied to economies, trade between countries, aspects of production and to waste management, including CO 2 capture and sequestration. Life cycle assessments <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> are often part of wider environmental assessments, which also cover other environmental impacts. Such wider ranging assessments allow for considering "trade-offs" between (reduction <b>of)</b> greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and other environmental impacts and co-benefits <b>of</b> reduced greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> Databases exist which contain estimates <b>of</b> current greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> linked to fossil fuel use and to many current agricultural and industrial activities. However these data bases do allow for substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Assessments <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> linked to new processes and products are subject to even greater data-linked uncertainty. Variability in outcomes of life cycle assessments <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> may furthermore originate in different choices regarding functional units, system boundaries, time horizons, and the allocation <b>of</b> greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> to outputs in multi-output processes. Life cycle assessments may be useful in the identification of life cycle stages that are major contributors to greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and <b>of</b> major reduction options, in the verification of alleged climate benefits and to establish major differences between competing products.
