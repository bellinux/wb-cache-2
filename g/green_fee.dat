40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2012 This {{thesis is}} an evaluative {{case study of}} the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF). I use this case study to locate the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund within a broader {{movement}} of student-funded, campus sustainability organizations, which are growing nationwide, though differing in form. Prior research on student <b>green</b> <b>fees</b> has focused primarily {{on the creation of}} <b>green</b> <b>fees</b> through student campaigns with little attention to the design and management of these programs once they go into effect. This research uses organizational change theory to evaluate the successes, tools for success and challenges of HEIF. It also provides recommendations for HEIF???s continued improvement as an organization and best practices for other campus <b>green</b> <b>fees.</b> The results indicate that a multistakeholder organization which values interdisciplinarity, student leadership, collaboration, and organizational learning is effective at reaching its goals and overcoming obstacles...|$|R

40|$|The golf {{industry}} in the United States has grown tremendously over the last fifteen years, due primarily to the surging economy during the 1990 s {{and the rise of}} Tiger Woods with his record-setting win at the 1997 Masters. The National Golf Foundation 2 ̆ 7 s (NGF) latest report, however, showed that, the number of rounds played, a key barometer of golf industry growth, has been declining since 2008 and the number of core golfers has also declined (Rudy, 2008). Municipal golf courses, 2 ̆ 2 Munis, 2 ̆ 2 are coping with a myriad of challenges such as declining number of rounds played, budget cuts, escalating benefits expenses for city employees, the increased cost of turf management, and so on. For example, the city of Albuquerque has increased their <b>green</b> <b>fees</b> to cover costs of maintaining their three municipal courses; however, no data exists to analyze the impact of this decision. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to analyze factors affecting consumers’ preferences in selecting golf courses, their perceptions about the prices of products being sold at the golf courses, and to analyze the differences in price perceptions among different groups of golfers such as avid golfers, core golfers, and casual golfers. A questionnaire was developed based on literature available in the golf industry and reviewed by an expert panel. The findings show that there were no significant differences among golfers using municipal golf courses about price perceptions being sold at the pro shop including <b>green</b> <b>fees,</b> cart rentals, golf equipment, etc. Golfers perceived <b>green</b> <b>fees</b> as “reasonable” but the results of this research suggest that golf course authorities should keep <b>green</b> <b>fees</b> competitive, and find other innovative ways to manage their course assets to increase participation in the future...|$|R

50|$|American {{universities}} are working towards becoming more sustainable {{in the face}} of global warming. One way that many of them tackle the problem is by using more renewable energy such as solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal energy. Many are also working on getting ‘green fees’ so that they can purchase renewable energy if they do not create their own. Some universities like Middle Tennessee State University, University of North Carolina, and the Evergreen State College already have green fees in place. Other schools like the University of Florida and universities in Texas are working hard to add a <b>green</b> <b>fee</b> to their tuition so that they can improve their sustainability ratings.|$|E
