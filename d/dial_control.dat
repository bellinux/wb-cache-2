50|$|The playfield {{displays}} {{your ship}} {{moving across the}} surface (displayed as a wavy line) and submarines moving across the screen. The target depth is set using a <b>dial</b> <b>control</b> (displayed as a dashed line). Depth charges are dropped by pushing the <b>dial</b> <b>control.</b> The speed of your ship is controlled using a speed lever control. Charges that miss make a low boom. Charges that hit make a louder boom and trigger an explosion sequence. Points are awarded for successful hits. The game is timed, so {{the goal is to}} sink or destroy as many submarines as possible before the time expires.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike later {{electronic}} organs with conventional tab stops, early Thomas {{electronic organs}} utilized a <b>dial</b> <b>control</b> for their stops, presumably {{to add a}} certain familiarity to its users since the dials worked much like those on a radio or television. This may be evidenced {{by the introduction of}} the Talking Organ with its [...] "Built-In Teacher," [...] a phonograph intended for use with instructional recordings.|$|E

50|$|The 5/A2/A2e has two <b>dials</b> to <b>control</b> exposure, {{one over}} the shutter button {{and one on the}} back of the camera. The dial above the shutter button will adjust the shutter speed in shutter {{priority}} Tv/Time value mode, but in aperture priority Av/Aperture value mode this same dial will adjust the lens aperture. In full manual mode, the dial above the shutter reverts to adjusting the shutter speed, and the back <b>dial</b> <b>controls</b> the aperture.|$|R

50|$|A {{dual control}} (dual custody) {{combination}} lock has two <b>dials</b> <b>controlling</b> two locking mechanisms for the door. They are usually configured so that both locks must be dialed {{open at the}} same time for the door to be unlocked. No single person is given both combinations, requiring two people to cooperate to open the door. Some doors may be configured so that either dial will unlock the door, trading off increased convenience for lessened security.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} cameras ever {{produced}} for left-handers was the half-frame Yashica Samurai. Cameras predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and <b>dials</b> <b>controlled</b> by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.|$|R
50|$|Front Line (Furonto Rain) is a military-themed run & gun shooter game {{released}} by Taito for arcades in 1982. It {{was one of}} the first video games to feature a ground combat theme and grenades, a precursor to many similarly-themed games of the mid to late 1980s. The original arcade version of Front Line consists of a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button. The single button is used to throw grenades and to enter and exit tanks, while the rotary <b>dial</b> <b>controls</b> and fires the player's gun.|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} {{prevalence of}} many {{sexually transmitted diseases}} (STDs) is low. Thus, most epidemiologic studies of STDs are conducted among STD clinic populations to maximize efficiency. However, STD clinic patients have unique sociobehavioral characteristics. To examine the potential effect of study population on identification of risk factors, the authors compared 1) STD clinic patients with a random digit dialing telephone sample, 2) general population cases with random digit <b>dialing</b> <b>controls,</b> and 3) STD clinic cases with STD clinic controls (Seattle, Washington, 1992 – 1995). Risk factors for gonorrhea identified among STD clinic patients formed a subset of those identified in the general population. In both populations, risk decreased with age (odd...|$|R

The game can be played by one player or by two alternating players.|$|R
50|$|The central {{element of}} the MMI {{terminal}} is the <b>control</b> <b>dial.</b> This dial can be rotated, to navigate up and down through menus, and pressed to activate a selected highlighted function. Starting with MMI 3G system an integrated joystick in the main <b>control</b> <b>dial</b> {{can be used to}} (for example) navigate the map. Depending on the MMI generation and configuration, four to eight function buttons surround the <b>control</b> <b>dial</b> which are used to launch the various features. The MMI screen is available as a five-inch monochrome black-and-red or seven-inch 16:9 full colour display, depending on the variation of MMI fitted in the car. MMI uses Media Oriented Systems Transport (MOST) technology to interconnect the various systems. Harman Becker Automotive Systems manufactures the MMI system, utilizing QNX Neutrino's Real Time Operating System (RTOS) software.|$|R

50|$|The M7 is {{also the}} first Leica M series to support film DX {{encoding}} and exposure compensation using the dial that {{has been on the}} back of Leica cameras since the M3. Originally used simply as a reminder of the sensitivity of the film, and then as film speed setting coupled to the light meter starting with the M6, the <b>dial</b> now <b>controls</b> exposure compensation on the M7.|$|R
40|$|Inhalational {{anaesthetic}} {{agents are}} usually liquids {{at room temperature}} and barometric pressure {{and need to be}} converted to vapour before being used and this conversion is effected using a vapouriser. Vapourisers have evolved from very basic devices to more complicated ones. Anaesthetists should understand the basic principles of anaesthetic vapouriser, including the principles that affect vapouriser output and how they influence vapouriser design. Most of the modern vapourisers in use are designed to be used between the flow meter and the common gas outlet on the anaesthesia machine. Modern vapourisers are flow and temperature compensated, concentration calibrated, direct reading, <b>dial</b> <b>controlled</b> and are unaffected by positive-pressure ventilation. Safety features include an anti-spill and a select-a-tec mechanism and a specific vapouriser filling device. Desflurane has unique physical properties requiring the use of a specific desflurane vapouriser. The most recently designed vapourisers are controlled by a central processing unit in the anaesthetic machine. The concentration of vapour is continuously monitored and adjusted by altering fresh gas flow through the vapouriser. This article looks at the basic design and functioning of the modern vapourisers...|$|R
50|$|To {{address the}} {{ergonomic}} criticisms, third parties {{have developed a}} custom grip to make the camera easier to grip, and a plastic ring to surround the <b>control</b> <b>dial,</b> making the dial {{less likely to be}} accidentally moved.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon Coolpix P7100 is {{a digital}} compact camera {{announced}} by Nikon on August 24, 2011, {{successor to the}} Nikon Coolpix P7000. It differs from the earlier model by an extra <b>control</b> <b>dial,</b> flip-out screen and improved responsiveness.|$|R
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary <b>dial</b> fire <b>control</b> selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|R
50|$|Antique TRF {{receivers}} {{can often}} be identified by their cabinets. They typically have a long, low appearance, with a flip-up lid {{for access to the}} vacuum tubes and tuned circuits. On their front panels there are typically two or three large <b>dials,</b> each <b>controlling</b> the tuning for one stage. Inside, along with several vacuum tubes, there will be a series of large coils. These will usually be with their axes at right angles to each other to reduce magnetic coupling between them.|$|R
50|$|The Apple IIc had a {{built-in}} 5.25-inch floppy drive (140 KB) along {{the right side}} of the case—the first Apple II model to include such a feature. Along the left side of the case was a <b>dial</b> to <b>control</b> the volume of the internal speaker, along with a -inch monaural audio jack for headphones or an external speaker. A fold-out carrying handle doubled as a way to prop up the back end of the machine to angle the keyboard for typing, if desired.|$|R
50|$|The {{electronic}} tanpura {{was created}} as a marketable, practical solution for instrumentalists, having their hands otherwise engaged, who cannot readily avail themselves of able tanpura players for their long hours of private practice. Generally, the electronic tanpura has one or more <b>dials</b> to <b>control</b> the tone and volume, and may have other switches and buttons that allow a certain pitch and volume to be saved and used again at a later time. The range is usually one to two octaves.|$|R
50|$|Selectable {{automatic}} full-time Control Trac {{four-wheel drive}} designed by BorgWarner is standard on all 4x4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, Auto mode, Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary <b>control</b> <b>dial</b> on the dash.|$|R
500|$|The only control {{common to}} all Leslie {{speakers}} is a <b>dial</b> that <b>controls</b> the master volume. This is normally set up once and then left, since the organ's expression pedal normally controls the volume. Leslie recommended playing the organ at full volume with all stops (drawbars) pulled out and adjusting the volume just before distortion occurs. However, the distorted sound of an overdriven vacuum tube amplifier can be a desirable sound, {{to the extent that}} modern Leslie simulators have an explicit [...] "overdrive" [...] setting.|$|R
