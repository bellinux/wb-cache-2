5|$|To {{create a}} death scene, Aronofsky <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> Mayan mythology the {{description}} of flowers and butterflies emerging from the bodies of valiant warriors when they die.

A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe {{the idea of the}} {{summarized}} title of his novel. Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into believing the novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.|$|E
5|$|Jacob's Ladder {{was made}} by Carolco Pictures ten years after being written by Rubin. It <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> several inspirations for its story and effects, {{including}} the short film An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and the paintings of Francis Bacon. Though only moderately successful upon release, the film garnered a cult following and became a source of influence for various other works such as the horror video game franchise Silent Hill. A loose remake was announced to be in works by LD Entertainment.|$|E

The {{intensity}} of the support she <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> these groups {{is said to have}} surprised even Juan Perón himself.

5|$|Starting in late 1945, Madagascar's first French National Assembly deputies, Joseph Raseta, Joseph Ravoahangy and Jacques Rabemananjara of the Mouvement démocratique de la rénovation malgache (MDRM) {{political}} party, led {{an effort}} to achieve independence for Madagascar through legal channels. The failure of this initiative and the harsh response it <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> the Socialist Ramadier administration radicalized elements of the Malagasy population, including leaders of several militant nationalist secret societies.|$|E
5|$|The story also explores Balzac's {{conviction}} that a person's {{name is a}} powerful indicator {{of his or her}} destiny, an idea he <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, {{have continued to}} comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from Games and Culture said that the game <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view of due process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{accepted}} {{a job with}} Tufts, where he became involved with the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which began broadcasting music from the campus on March 8, 1916. The station owner, Harold Power, hired him to run the company's laboratory, at a salary greater than that which Bush <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> Tufts. In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council. He attempted to develop a means of detecting submarines by measuring the disturbance in the Earth's magnetic field. His device worked as designed, but only from a wooden ship; attempts to get it to work on a metal ship such as a destroyer failed.|$|E

5|$|Development lasted three years, {{involving}} {{a team of}} thirteen people. Several members, including director Matt Nava and composer Austin Wintory, had previously worked on the 2012 video game Journey—the ocean setting of Abzû was both {{a reaction to the}} desert setting of Journey and inspired by Nava's love of scuba diving. The setting and story <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> Sumerian mythology and the cosmic ocean myth. Reaching high positions in sales charts, Abzû was praised by journalists: the majority of praise went to its art style, with some critics comparing it to Journey.|$|E
5|$|He <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> {{his medical}} {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, Gordon and Levin {{met with}} Warner Bros. {{to develop the}} film there again. Tim Burton at one point {{expressed}} interest in directing the film but ultimately turned it down. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on 300, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen. Screenwriter Alex Tse <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> his favorite elements of Hayter's script, but also returned it to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic. Similar to his approach to 300, Snyder used the comic book as a storyboard. Following negotiations, Paramount, which had already spent $7 million in their failed project, earned the rights for international distribution of Watchmen and 25% of the film's ownership.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to the flowing main theme, Khan's leitmotif {{was designed as a}} percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character's insanity. The seven-note brass theme was echoplexed to emphasize the character's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V, but does not play fully until Reliants attack on the Enterprise. Many elements <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> Horner's previous work (a rhythm that accompanies Khan's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen, in turn influenced by Goldsmith's score for Alien). Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{was born}} in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police {{department}} clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the Petite École, a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that they observed with their own eyes and <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba also {{condemned}} distinction {{based on}} religion or caste. It remains unclear {{if he was}} a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that <b>drew</b> <b>from</b> both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to you.|$|E
