50|$|The Voigtländer Ultramatic CS was {{the first}} 35mm leaf shutter SLR camera with TTL metering. The design of the not too heavy camera {{was derived from the}} Voigtländer {{viewfinder}} cameras, with rounded sides and a shifter on the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> as shutter <b>release.</b> Its designer was Walter Swarofsky. A specialty of the camera was that shutter speed and aperture were controlled by rings around the bayonet. The lenses had only a distance control ring. The bayonet is a variant of the Deckel bayonet (DKL) offering mechanical control of both, aperture release and automatic aperture setting. The Septon 1:2/50mm was a well regarded lens, and like the Skopagon 2.0/40mm it was a quite fast lens for that type of SLR. The exposure delay was only 1/50 sec.|$|R
40|$|DE 102007011403 A 1 UPAB: 20081008 NOVELTY - The {{solar cell}} element {{comprises}} a carrying semiconductor layer (2) with a doping type. A layer structure (1) is arranged at the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> of the carrying semiconductor layer {{adjacent to the}} carrying semiconductor layer and has another doping which is complementary to the former doping. Two <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization (4, 6) are provided, in which the former <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization (4) electrically contacts the layer structure and another <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization (6) is electrically insulated from the former <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for manufacturing a solar cell module. USE - Solar cell element for <b>front</b> <b>sided</b> series interconnection in a solar cell module (Claimed). ADVANTAGE - The former <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization electrically contacts the layer structure and another <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization is electrically insulated from the former <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization, and thus prevents high concentration conditions causing very high electric current densities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{fundamental}} challenge of balancing the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in silicon heterojunction solar cells. We present two-dimensional numerical device simulations as well as experimental investigations concerning n-type silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells featuring either a front emitter or rear emitter. By varying both, the pitch of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metal grid electrode and the sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO, the fill factor losses associated with the two-dimensional carrier transport are investigated. We prove experimentally {{that in the case}} of the rear emitter design a substantial part of the lateral carrier transport is shifted from the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO into the absorber, thus, lowering the effective sheet resistance of the <b>front</b> <b>side.</b> Owing to this additional lateral current path the trade-off between the optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO are less pronounced for a rear emitter cell design compared to the traditional front emitter cell design. This leads to fewer restrictions for the choice of <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCOs and the design of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metal grid electrode. Depending on the optimization route, this should allow for higher solar cell efficiencies or the application of more economic TCOs...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we discuss}} {{the results of a}} 2 -dimensional {{numerical}} device simulation study concerning amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (a-Si/c-Si SHJ) solar cells. In this context we address the fundamental challenge of balancing the trade-off between transparency and conductivity of transparent conducting oxides (TCO) at the illuminated <b>front</b> <b>side</b> of the solar cell. We investigate fill factor losses associated to the 2 D lateral carrier transport, by varying the pitch of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization and the sheet resistance (Rsh) of the TCO for both, front emitter and rear emitter solar cells. It is demonstrated that for the rear emitter design a substantial part of the lateral carrier transport can be shifted from the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO into the base. Due to this additional lateral current path, the trade-off between optical and electrical properties of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO is less pronounced for this rear emitter cells. This leads to fewer restrictions for the choice of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> TCO and/or the design of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallization.

40|$|The {{industrial}} standard process for producing solar cell <b>front</b> <b>sides</b> includes several drawbacks. First {{of all the}} screen-printed <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallisation with silver paste leads to contacts with a poor aspect ratio and a low conduction quality due to the composition of a printable paste. Additionally, the poor contact resistance requires high surface doping concentrations of the emitter. When using further developed cell concepts like the laser-fired contacted rear side (LFC) featuring dielectric passivation and a local point contact structure, the high-temperature step for establishing the front contact is detrimental too. A solution for this problem could be the use of alternative <b>front</b> <b>side</b> metallisation techniques. Without firing through they all require a selective opening of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> antireflection coating. The approach studied in this paper is the selective laser ablation of this layer...|$|R
