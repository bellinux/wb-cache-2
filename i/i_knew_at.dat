25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> home.|$|E
500|$|At 11.00 on 6 April Huré {{sent out}} patrols {{to bury the}} dead at Gueznaïa, whilst he {{reinforced}} the defences at Aïn Médiouna and directed 12 aircraft to bomb the tribesmen remaining in the area. [...] Huré left three companies to garrison Aïn Médiouna before withdrawing {{the remainder of the}} men. [...] He and his men were commended for their enthusiasm and spirit which enabled the garrison to be relieved earlier than expected. [...] Huré singled out the French Foreign Legion machine gunners for praise, noting that they had held the enemy off for four hours to cover the retreat of other units. [...] He said [...] "despite your small number... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> once that you would save the situation".|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E

But {{we had a very}} rocky last year. I think what might have caused some of that was his feeling, stronger than <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> the time, that {{he wanted to go to}} mornings more than I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a September 2015 {{interview}} with Michael Isikoff, Fiorina said that, {{in the weeks}} following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, she {{received a phone call}} from Michael Hayden, then the director of the National Security Agency, asking her assistance in providing HP computer servers to the NSA for expanded surveillance. Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina [...] "acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security" [...] to the agency's Fort Meade headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: [...] "I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did," [...] adding, [...] "They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... What <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>at</b> the time was our nation had been attacked." [...] Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency [...] "on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness." [...] According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be [...] "as transparent as possible, about as much as possible".|$|E
