25|$|Ythogtha is {{the second}} son of Cthulhu and resembles a gigantic, {{humanoid}} frog, or Deep One, with only a single-eye <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead, like a cyclops. A dense mane and a beard of writhing tentacles grows from his head. Although never fully described in Carter's own stories, Ythogtha is incredibly large; when the sorcerer-priest Zanthu attempts to free Ythogtha from his prison, he mistakes his god's clawed, slimy fingertips for mountainous heads.|$|E
25|$|Between his {{creation}} as Duke of Edinburgh in 1726 and {{his creation}} as Prince of Wales, he bore {{the arms of}} the kingdom, differentiated by a label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a cross gules. As Prince of Wales, the difference changed to simply a label argent of three points. Frederick never succeeded his father as Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire and so the red escutcheon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Hanover quarter is empty.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to {{distract}} Bragg's attention, Grant authorized Thomas's army to advance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{line to the}} base of Missionary Ridge. A combination of misunderstood orders and the pressure of the tactical situation caused Thomas's men to surge to the top of Missionary Ridge, routing the Army of Tennessee, which retreated to Dalton, Georgia, fighting off the Union pursuit successfully at the Battle of Ringgold Gap. Bragg's defeat eliminated the last Confederate control of Tennessee and opened the door to an invasion of the Deep South, leading to Sherman's Atlanta Campaign of 1864.|$|E

500|$|Gardner lined his men up at {{the edge}} of some woods {{near the top of the}} hill and {{advanced}} with bayonets fixed. [...] The Americans approached and lined up in an open field outside musket range. [...] General Moultrie positioned two six-pound field cannons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> line, with a smaller two-pounder on the right. [...] The Americans then advanced on the British, Moultrie observing that the action was [...] "reversed from the usual way of fighting between British and Americans; they taking the bushes and we taking the open ground." [...] The Americans opened fire first with the artillery, and then with musket volleys. [...] The battle continued for about 45 minutes, at which point the Americans were running low on ammunition. [...] Moultrie had begun a withdrawal when the British were also observed to retreat, leaving the field to the Americans. [...] A company of light horse militia chased after the British, very nearly cutting them off from their boats. [...] They successfully captured 26 men, but were unable to hold all of them due to their small numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Where Milton differs {{is in the}} use {{of scripture}} as evidence. Milton relies on scripture as the basis of his {{argument}} and keeps scripture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> text, whereas many other theological treatises keep scriptural passages to the margins. In essence, as Lieb says, [...] "Milton privileges the proof-text over that which is to be proven." [...] Schwartz has {{gone so far as to}} claim that Milton [...] "ransacked the whole Bible" [...] and that Milton's own words are [...] "squeezed out of his text." [...] However, the actual [...] "proof-texts" [...] of the Bible are various: no single version is used in Milton's Latin citations.|$|E
2500|$|Zhang Shijie ordered about 1000 {{warships}} to be chained together, {{forming a}} long string within the bay, and placed Emperor Huaizong's boat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fleet. This was done to prevent individual Song ships from fleeing the battle. [...] The Yuan forces steered fire ships into the Song formation, but the Song ships were prepared for such an attack: all Song ships had been painted with fire-resistant mud. The Yuan navy then blockaded the bay, while the Yuan army cut off the Song's fresh water and wood sources on land. The Song side, with many non-combatants, soon ran out of supplies. [...] The Song soldiers were forced to eat dry foods and drink sea water, causing nausea and vomiting. Zhang Hongfan even kidnapped Zhang Shijie's nephew, asking Zhang Shijie to surrender on three occasions, to no avail.|$|E

2500|$|On June 27 Biarritz got occupied. Here in a {{hotel on}} August 14 the writer's 75th anniversary celebration was held, {{organized}} {{by a group of}} French writers, with some notable Russians like Pavel Milyukov, Ivan Bunin and Mark Aldanov invited. It was there that Merezhkovsky made comments which (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) were later presented by some memoirists as his [...] "infamous German radio speech". Still, even Zobnin admits that there were reasons to regard him a Nazi sympathizer. In the Autumn of 1941 Merezhkovsky found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> German admirers – students, mostly, but army officers too. It was their German friends who helped the couple move back to Paris from Biarritz where they found themselves penniless and on the verge of homelessness. [...] "Merezhkovsky flew up to the Nurnberg fires with the agitation of a newly born butterfly... By this time most of us stopped visiting them," [...] wrote V. Yanovsky, a Green Lamp group member.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in the Defenders of the Realm cartoon and Mythologies as a tall, bald figure wearing an teal-colored bodysuit under a black tabard adorned with ornamental spikes on the shoulders, accented by a yin-yang symbol on the sternum. Designed by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, this style was carried over into Mortal Kombat 4, but for Deadly Alliance, the first release following Tobias' 2000 departure from Midway, Quan Chi's design was minimized with him going shirtless and revealing a well-built physique with only a black bandolier across his chest, in addition to simple black trousers and knee-high boots, with Shinnok's amulet usually attached to his belt; this has remained his primary template in all his MK appearances thereafter, while his first design returned as an alternate costume in several games. In conceptual sketches by Deadly Alliance character designer Allen Ditzig, Quan Chi was seen brandishing a [...] "mysterious living weapon"—a staff topped with a grotesque head capable of spewing green mist and flies from its mouth. Though the staff was cut from the game, its concept was used in the creation of Drahmin, one of whose offensive moves involved shooting flies at his opponent. The one element of Quan Chi's design that has remained unchanged is his albino skin tone, with simple parallel black stripes extending upward from his eyelids and extending over {{the top of his head}} in his first appearances, then enhanced in Deadly Alliance and onward with an extensive collection of red tattoo-like markings on his head, back and arms, in addition to an elliptical red gem planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead.|$|E
60|$|The storm now let up a bit, and Ralph {{was able}} to {{take a good look at}} the fellow beside him. He was a tall, strong-looking chap, with sharp black eyes, and a heavy head of dark hair.

60|$|The prince {{raised his}} field glasses to his eyes.

He rode, swinging his saber above his head, and behind him at full gallop came a squadron of the Royal Horse.|$|E

60|$|The dragon {{was waiting}} and ready. He was {{breathing}} forth vast volumes of sulphurous smoke and lurid blasts of flame.

Out went the fires in an instant, and the dragon curled up and died.|$|E

60|$|Nerle did {{not notice}} the prince's swift gesture nor the whispered word; but he was staring {{straight}} at Terribus at the time, and he saw with surprise the eye {{on the top of}} the king's head move down toward his forehead, and the eye <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead slide slightly toward the left, and the elephant-like nose shrink and shorten at the same time. Also it seemed to him that the king's skin was not so crimson in color as before, and that a thin growth of hair had covered his head.|$|E

He staggered sideways, there was a crash as the rifle exploded harmlessly, and before he could recover I had him by the neck and hurled him half-choked through the door. I had the sense to slam it and slip the bolt home; then, while I stood panting, the Colonel prepared to improve our position.|$|E
60|$|When the boy wakened, {{after many}} hours, {{he found the}} room again light.

He was, however, a second too late, for the birch staff met him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, and, falling like a log, he lay where he fell. Steel deliberately snapped the knife beneath his heel, and Lane shouted something as my comrade said: [...] "The next man I down at that trick will get his skull smashed in." ...|$|E
