2500|$|If a New South Wales Police Force officer elects to {{undertake}} criminal investigation duties, {{after a period}} of exams and assignments, and given experience in a criminal <b>investigation</b> <b>office</b> that officer is given the designation of [...] "detective". As it is a designation and not a rank, the designation comes prior to the rank, i.e. detective constable, or detective senior constable etc. Returning to general duties (uniform) is common for detectives, and many detectives do seek promotion in the general duties arena. However, while they do not lose their detective's designation if they leave full-time investigation duties, it is customary not to use their designation while performing general or other duties which are not an authorised investigative position. On returning to an authorised position they can use their designation again without having to requalify. There has been some consideration given by the police force in recent years to identify designated detectives performing uniform duties by way of a distinctive badge or uniform embellishment, but this has not been adopted.|$|E
