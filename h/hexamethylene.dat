2500|$|Isocyanates {{are very}} {{reactive}} materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use. [...] The aromatic isocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates, such as <b>hexamethylene</b> diisocyanate (HDI) or isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that {{is they have}} exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which {{is a mixture of}} molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups. In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.|$|E
2500|$|Otto Bayer and his {{coworkers}} at IG Farben in Leverkusen, Germany, first made polyurethanes in 1937. The new polymers had some advantages over existing plastics that were made by polymerizing olefins or by polycondensation, and were not covered by patents obtained by Wallace Carothers on polyesters. Early work focused on the production of fibres and flexible foams and PUs were applied on a limited scale as aircraft coating during World War II. Polyisocyanates became commercially available in 1952, and production of flexible polyurethane foam began in 1954 using toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and polyester polyols. [...] These materials were also used to produce rigid foams, gum rubber, and elastomers. Linear fibers were produced from <b>hexamethylene</b> diisocyanate (HDI) and 1,4-Butanediol (BDO).|$|E

50|$|Heidelberger passed muster, and in September 1912 {{began working}} in Walter Abraham Jacobs' {{laboratory}} on a derivative of <b>hexamethylene</b> tetramine, a complex {{that seemed to}} prolong the life of monkeys suffering from polio, and that Flexner hoped could be adapted for use in humans. Results appeared promising at first, but Heidelberger and Jacobs later attributed them to loss of virulence of the virus.|$|E
50|$|Hexamethylenediamine is used almost {{exclusively}} {{for the production of}} polymers, an application that takes advantage of its bifunctional structure. The great majority of the diamine is consumed by the production of nylon 66 via condensation with adipic acid. Otherwise <b>hexamethylene</b> diisocyanate (HDI) is generated from this diamine as a monomer feedstock in the production of polyurethane. The diamine also serves as a cross-linking agent in epoxy resins.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hexamethylene</b> {{diisocyanate}} (HDI) is {{an organic}} compound {{in the class}} known as isocyanates. More specifically, it is an aliphatic diisocyanate.

Aliphatic diisocyanates are used in special applications, such as enamel coatings which are resistant to abrasion and degradation from ultraviolet light.

5000|$|<b>Hexamethylene</b> triperoxide diamine (HMTD) is a [...] high {{explosive}} organic compound. The theorized structure lent itself well to acting as an initiating, or primary explosive.

As such, it was quickly taken up as a primary explosive in mining applications. However, it has since been superseded by even more stable compounds such as tetryl.|$|E
