5|$|The Castle is a pub at No.54 Pentonville Road, at the {{junction}} with Baron Street. In 2015, the perpetrators of the Hatton Garden safe deposit burglary met at the pub to discuss the crime shortly after it occurred, but were secretly filmed there by the Flying Squad. All were subsequently arrested and sent to prison. The current owners, Geronimo Inns, wish to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> burglary and forbid staff {{to discuss it with}} customers.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by Saeroen which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> theatrical conventions which were common in the contemporary film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also touches on the interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work {{was meant to be}} realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

5|$|O'Leary was {{referring}} to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incident.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it sound as if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
50|$|By October 5, 2016, {{politicians}} were <b>distancing</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proposed legislation. On October 6, lawmakers voted the bill down {{with plans to}} present a counterproposal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government.|$|R

50|$|Although Germany's once-powerful {{trade unions}} <b>distanced</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Left in the 2005 federal election, some union leaders {{expressed}} interest in cooperating with the party after the election.

5|$|In early October 1942, Jevđević and Baćović, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and {{southeast}} Bosnia, {{participated in the}} Italian-led Operation Alfa. This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the Neretva River. Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian–Chetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to burn a number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area. Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern Dalmatia to aid Đujić's forces. A month after the massacre, Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailović, hoping to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> actions of the troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle, {{reversing}} the British defeat of 6 July, inflicting severe losses on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and trapping Linois in Cadiz proved decisive in confirming British control of the Mediterranean Sea. With the French plan to reinforce the army stranded in Egypt in ruins, the British invasion fleet was free to operate without interference, succeeding in capturing the country in September 1801. In a wider sense too, it emphasized {{the degree to which}} the Royal Navy dominated European waters, destroying any attempt by the navies of France and its allies to conduct operations at sea. In Spain the government, furious at the losses suffered for so little gain, began to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> alliance with France, which was a contributing factor in the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 that ended the French Revolutionary Wars. For the remainder of the war the British maintained undisputed control of the Mediterranean Sea and the Spanish coast, the Cadiz blockade preventing the French and Spanish forces there from putting to sea.|$|E

50|$|Following its creation, the Linz Program never gained {{much support}} in any {{influential}} political circles. Additionally, <b>the</b> framers eventually <b>distanced</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> program. This {{was due in}} large part to Schönerer's venomous anti-Semitic inclinations, which became associated with the program over time.|$|R
50|$|Schools (those {{which are}} not independent) in Sedgemoor are {{operated}} the Children & Young People's Directorate of Somerset County Council, although some such as The Kings of Wessex School in Cheddar have <b>distanced</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> county council by opting for foundation status.|$|R
25|$|UCC {{claims the}} plant staff falsified {{numerous}} records to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incident and absolve themselves of blame, {{and that the}} Indian Government impeded its investigation and declined to prosecute the employee responsible, presumably because that would weaken its allegations of negligence by Union Carbide.|$|E
25|$|Lantos was {{an activist}} {{for the rights}} of Hungarian minorities; {{as a member of the}} US House of Representatives.

25|$|On July 23, 2015, Simon & Schuster {{confirmed}} to the Associated Press {{that it would}} not be releasing a paperback version of the Cosby-approved 2014 biography Cosby: His Life and Times, which gained criticism for not addressing the then-few public sexual assault allegations against Cosby. The publisher also pulled celebrity endorsements for the book after David Letterman and Jerry Seinfeld reportedly asked to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> biography.|$|E
50|$|The movie mostly {{received}} positive reviews; however, {{it received}} criticism because {{the authors of}} Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy, Jossey-Bass, 2007, , <b>distanced</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> production out of respect to the Amish community. Others criticized the movie for blending facts with fiction.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{sex workers}} engage in {{emotional}} labor as a self-protection strategy, <b>distancing</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sometimes emotionally volatile work. Finally, clients often value perceived authenticity in their transactions with sex workers; thus, sex workers may attempt {{to foster a}} sense of authentic intimacy.|$|R
25|$|In August, former Patriots {{tight end}} Aaron Hernandez {{was charged with}} the murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez was {{released}} by the Patriots following his arrest in the murder investigation in June. In an effort to further <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> troubled Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans an opportunity to trade-in Hernandez jerseys for another jersey of comparable value. Hernandez would be convicted of the murder charge and sentenced to life imprisonment in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|According {{to social}} status, Koreans used to dress differently, making {{clothing}} an important mark of social rank. Impressive, but sometimes cumbersome, costumes were {{worn by the}} ruling class and the royal family. These upper classes also used jewellery to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ordinary people. A traditional item of jewellery for women was a pendant {{in the shape of}} certain elements of nature which was made of precious gemstones, to which a tassel of silk was connected.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{broke up}} on 26 December 1991. Yeltsin's {{economic}} reform program took effect on January2, 1992. Soon afterward prices skyrocketed, government spending was slashed, and heavy new taxes went into effect. A deep credit crunch shut down many industries and {{brought about a}} protracted depression. Certain politicians quickly began to <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> program; and increasingly the ensuing political confrontation between Yeltsin on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform on the other, became centered in the two branches of government.|$|E

25|$|The Pilgrims were a {{small group}} of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to {{physically}} <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corrupt Church of England. After initially moving to the Netherlands, they decided to re-establish themselves in America. The initial Pilgrim settlers sailed to North America in 1620 on the Mayflower. Upon their arrival, they drew up the Mayflower Compact, by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small Plymouth Colony. William Bradford was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.|$|E
25|$|Harvard {{political}} scientist and historian Samuel P. Huntington argues in Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity that illegal immigration, primarily from Mexico, threatens {{to divide the}} United States culturally, into an Anglo-Protestant north, central, and eastern portion, and a Catholic-Hispanic southwest. Immigration researcher Andrea Nill has a similar point. Nill noted that the association of illegal immigration with Latinos would bring adverse attention to their community. Recent immigration laws could help fuel these associations and possibly encourage citizens to discriminate and <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hispanic culture. Furthermore, this separation could allow for tensions and possibly violence to grow between both groups.|$|E
25|$|With the {{foundation}} of the republic in 1955, the flag was adopted by the successor state, the Republic of Vietnam (more commonly known as South Vietnam). It was the national flag for the entire duration of that state's existence (1955–1975) from the First Republic to the Second Republic. With the capitulation of Saigon on April 30, 1975, the Republic of Vietnam came to an end and the flag ceased to exist as a state symbol. Afterwards, it has been adopted by many in the Vietnamese diaspora to symbolically <b>distance</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Communist government and continues to be used either as an alternative symbol for ethnic unity or as a protest tool against the current government.|$|E
