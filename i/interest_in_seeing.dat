25|$|As {{the latest}} {{offering}} from a noted genre specialist, A Bay of Blood {{was greeted with}} disappointment and disgust by several critics, especially by those who were fans of the director's earlier, more restrained films. At the 1971 Avoriaz Film Festival, where the movie had its world premiere, Christopher Lee attended a screening of the film, having expressed an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the latest effort from the director of The Whip and the Body, which Lee had starred in eight years before.

25|$|Austen {{began writing}} the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent {{with her brother}} Edward and his wife in 1796. It was {{originally}} titled First Impressions, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797. On 1 November 1797 Austen's father {{sent a letter to}} London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post. The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times. The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves for in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.|$|E

500|$|Dave Gibbons {{became an}} adviser on Snyder's film, but Moore {{has refused to}} have his name {{attached}} to any film adaptations of his work. Moore has stated he has no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> Snyder's adaptation; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 that [...] "here are things that we did with Watchmen that could only work in a comic, and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can't". While Moore believes that David Hayter's screenplay was [...] "as close as I could imagine anyone getting to Watchmen", he asserted he {{did not intend to}} see the film if it were made.|$|E

Metroid series designer Yoshio Sakamoto was questioned on the status and history of Metroid Dread from video game journalists, and confirmed that the game existed at one point, but stated that the staff would start from scratch if development resumed. Critics have expressed an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the game or a similar 2D side-scrolling Metroid game released, and listed Metroid Dread in their most wanted lists as of 2013.

500|$|In April 2005, Lucas and Davis {{commented that}} a {{television}} series {{acting as a}} sequel was under consideration. In June 2008, Davis reiterated his hopes to return for a theatrically-released second installment of the film. On February 15, 2013 Val Kilmer posted a photo via Twitter implying that it was [...] "Right around the corner!". However, this coincided with a Life's Too Short mockumentary featuring Davis and Kilmer, {{and is likely to}} have been a hoax. In March 2013, Davis indicated an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> a sequel (perhaps as a TV series), but gave no indication that any development was ongoing. In September 2016, Warwick Davis went on record again in stating that he would not like to see a remake of Willow but {{he would like to see}} a sequel that explores if Willow became a sorcerer or not and what happened to Elora Danan when she grew up.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} Shelby's advent on Puck evoked the most praise. Benigno called the segment where Puck meets Beth [...] "the best scene {{of this very}} young season", The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg {{said it was a}} [...] "top moment", and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it [...] "the sweetest scene of the night". VanDerWerff also called it [...] "very sweet" [...] and {{expressed}} hope that [...] "the show will come up with something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season." [...] The effect of her return on Quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm. Reiter was [...] "not thrilled" [...] by the possibility of a custody battle between Quinn and Shelby and called Quinn's plan [...] "half-baked", and Canning dismissed it as [...] "clichéd drama". Kubicek expressed <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> [...] "where this goes", and VanDerWerff noted that Quinn has been [...] "grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn't even know it", and characterized it as a [...] "fairly powerful storyline".|$|E
500|$|Acquiring {{territory}} in the German-speaking states was {{an essential part of}} Joseph's policy to expand his family's influence in Central Europe. For Frederick the Great, Joseph's claim threatened the Prussian ascendancy in German politics, but he questioned whether he should preserve the status quo through war or through diplomacy. Empress Maria Theresa, who co-ruled with Joseph, considered any conflict over the Bavarian electorate not worth bloodshed, and neither she nor Frederick saw any point in pursuing hostilities. Joseph would not drop his claim despite his mother's contrary insistence. Frederick August III, Elector of Saxony, wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of the Duchy for his brother-in-law, Charles August, and had no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the Habsburgs acquire additional territory on his southern and western borders. [...] Despite his dislike of Prussia, which had been Saxony's enemy in two previous wars, Charles August sought the support of Frederick, who was happy to challenge the Habsburgs. France became involved to maintain the balance of power. Finally, Catherine the Great's threat to intervene on the side of Prussia with fifty thousand Russian troops forced Joseph to reconsider his position. With Catherine's assistance, he and Frederick negotiated {{a solution to the problem}} of the Bavarian succession with the Treaty of Teschen, signed on 13 May 1779.|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, co-writer Cargill {{stated that}} Marvel felt some initial {{ideas for the}} film from him and Derrickson {{highlighted}} {{too much of the}} [...] "weird stuff" [...] associated with the character to feature in an origin story, but told the duo to hold onto them for potential future films. In October 2016, Derrickson confirmed he had plans for a sequel, saying, [...] "I love the character, I love the visual possibilities, and I know the comics so well— the tip of an iceberg. There's so much progress that can be made." [...] He would like to follow the example of The Dark Knight and [...] "bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [...] a more visceral experience". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more Doctor Strange solo film. Derrickson hoped to feature Nightmare in a potential sequel, and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is [...] "kept in the loop" [...] on how the Avengers films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director Joe Russo. Spaihts has also expressed <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> Clea appear in a potential sequel. By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, Locke & Key.|$|E
500|$|Don {{settles in}} as a {{bachelor}} after last season's divorce {{from his wife}} Betty (January Jones). Roger sets him up {{on a date with}} Bethany, a friend of his wife Jane, who is a petite blonde, like Betty. After the date, Bethany (Anna Camp) expresses <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> Don again, but rejects his sexual advances. On Thanksgiving Day, Don spends time with a prostitute, and Betty has problems fitting in with the family of her new husband Henry (Christopher Stanley). At Thanksgiving dinner with his family, Betty's daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) complains about the food. The childish action blows up into a scene when Betty yells at Sally, treats her brusquely, and causes problems by forcing food into Sally's [...] mouth. Henry's mother later privately expresses displeasure with her son's new wife, observing that her children are clearly scared of her. However, in bed, Henry and Betty get along. The next day, Don picks up his two oldest children for an overnight visit, and Don is disappointed he can't see baby Gene, whom Betty sent to Carla's. Betty curtly tells Don to have the kids back by 9. When he returns the next evening, the house is empty and he has to wait for Betty and Henry to come back. When they return, at 10:30 pm, an argument ensues about the house; Don, at his lawyer's instigation, angrily reminds them {{they were supposed to be}} out a month ago, and he demands they either buy him out, pay him rent, or leave. [...] A minor argument later sparks between Henry and Betty when Henry agrees with Don's point. [...] Betty stubbornly reiterates that they will leave on her timeline, not Don's.|$|E
500|$|Some {{media have}} been {{critical}} of the adult-oriented material created by fans. In some cases, these videos may appear in Internet searches that children may perform while looking for online copies of the program or while searching for images of characters from the show, forcing parents to have to discuss pornography and sex with their children. One parody series, drawn by animator Max Gilardi in the style of John Kricfalusi, places the characters in explicit adult situations and was described by the web site io9 as [...] "disgusting ... and most certainly NSFW". A segment on The Howard Stern Show in July 2012 weighed on the pornographic aspect of the brony fandom, often referred to as [...] "clop". Slates Amanda Marcotte opined that the transformation of the pony characters into teenage girls for the [...] feature film was a move to satisfy the adult fans who [...] "have expressed a strong <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> the Ponies in sexy, humanized forms". In one case, a brony who claimed to be engaged to Twilight Sparkle wrote to a fan artist who drew the character in erotic situations, demanding that he cease such work; the letter was highlighted by several media outlets as evidence of the ridiculous nature of the fandom and the Internet as a whole. The fandom acknowledges that such material is generated by a subset of the group, but considers it [...] "an unavoidable part of any online fandom", as described by TV Guides Sadie Gennis, and not worry about this facet. A study performed by graduate students from the University of Connecticut found that [...] "a particularly extreme subset" [...] of the brony fandom shows characteristics of hegemonic masculinity, where male members strive to keep their majority in the numbers by purposely excluding and alienating females.|$|E
