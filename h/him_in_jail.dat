5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, and at some point entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for six months (however, due to good behavior, he was out in four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E

25|$|The Niigata court {{opened his}} trial on May 23, 2000. In the proceedings, the {{prosecutors}} acted very carefully to avoid further damage to Sano's mental health. The prosecution's case included even minor charges against Satō (for example, shoplifting of women's underwear) {{with the goal}} of putting <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for as long as possible.

The Yellow Ribbon Movement took to demonstration over alleged exploitation of justice and political revenge.|$|E

The man said that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. Officers said that they were going to thoroughly check his story. They kept <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for three weeks so his beard would grow back, which would allow Mrs. Harmon to positively identify him as her attacker.|$|E

500|$|Born into a landed {{family in}} {{southern}} Nicaragua, Chamorro was partially {{educated in the}} United States. After returning to her home country, she married and raised a family.

As {{a result of his}} anti-government stance, he was often jailed or exiled, forcing Chamorro to spend a decade following him abroad or visiting <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> When he was assassinated in 1978, Chamorro took over the newspaper.

Initially, when the Sandinistas were victorious over Anastasio Somoza Debayle, Chamorro fully supported them. She agreed {{to become part of the}} provisional government established under the Junta of National Reconstruction ( [...] , JGRN); however, when the Junta began moving in a more radical direction and signed agreements with the Soviet Union, Chamorro resigned and returned to the newspaper.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album {{was released on}} March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that [...] "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance.

500|$|The {{episode is}} best known for the {{introduction}} of recurring character Elim Garak. Fields said of the character at the time, [...] "we didn't want to make him an out and out spy, because then what would you do with him after the episode? You'd have to put <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> on Bajor. So we tread a pretty thin line." [...] Fields had decided when creating the character that the station needed a Cardassian on-board and when no-one objected to his suggestion to put him in a tailor shop, that became Garak's profession. This was a reference to The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which used a tailor shop as a front, as Fields had begun his writing career on that series. Andrew Robinson had originally been considered for the part of Odo, {{and was one of the}} final three actors vying for the part alongside Gerrit Graham and René Auberjonois. Robinson was invited back to audition for Garak, while Graham was cast as the Hunter in [...] "Captive Pursuit".|$|E
