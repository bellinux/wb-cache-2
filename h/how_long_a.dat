5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, {{only as good as}} the human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E
5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a very high}} level of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E

25|$|Retention factor (kappa prime) {{measures}} <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> {{component of}} the mixture stuck to the column, measured by the area under the curve of its peak in a chromatogram (since HPLC chromatograms are a function of time). Each chromatogram peak will have its own retention factor (e.g. kappa1 for the retention factor of the first peak). This factor may be corrected for by the void volume of the column.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue into the future. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population.|$|E

25|$|Eliza Acton’s Modern Cookery, {{in all its}} Branches : Reduced to a System of Easy Practice, {{for the use of}} Private Families {{was first}} {{published}} in 1845 and a number of editions are in the Cookery Collection at Leeds.

25|$|Entomological {{evidence}} is legal {{evidence in the}} form of insects or related artifacts and is a field of study in forensic entomology. Such {{evidence is}} used particularly in medicolegal and medicocriminal applications. Insect evidence is customarily used to determine post mortem interval (PMI), but can also be used as evidence of neglect or abuse. It can indicate <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> person was abused/neglected as well as provide important insights into the amount of bodily care given to the neglected or abused person.|$|E
50|$|Another study {{revealed}} that <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>an</b> item spends in short-term memory is not the key determinant in its strength in long-term memory.

25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 2002, Home Secretary David Blunkett {{ordered that}} Roy Whiting must serve {{a minimum of}} 50 years in prison. This made him ineligible for parole until 2051, meaning {{that he would have}} to live to be at least 92 before parole could be considered; this was in effect an {{agreement}} with the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff. Within 48 hours of the ruling being made, the Law Lords and the European Court of Human Rights had ruled in favour of another convicted murderer (Anthony Anderson) who was challenging the right of politicians to decide <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> murderer must spend in prison before being considered for parole.|$|E
25|$|Before 2005, donor lungs {{within the}} United States were {{allocated}} by the United Network for Organ Sharing on a first-come, first-served basis to patients on the transplant list. This {{was replaced by}} the current system, in which prospective lung recipients of age of 12 and older are assigned a lung allocation score or LAS, which takes into account various measures of the patient's health. The new system allocates donated lungs according to the immediacy of need rather than <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> patient has been on the transplant list. Patients who are under the age of 12 are still given priority based on how long they have been on the transplant waitlist. The length of time spent on the list is also the deciding factor when multiple patients have the same lung allocation score.|$|E

Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas's method is more useful, because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor.|$|R
25|$|Ancient strategists, Chinese Guan Zhong and Shang Yang and Indian Kautilya, drew doctrines linking {{agriculture}} {{with military}} power.

25|$|Njóla {{is a long}} didactic theological-philosophical poem Björn wrote mostly {{during his}} survey travels when the weather did not permit to work or in the evenings. It was {{published}} originally in the annual report of 1842 of the Bessastaðir school, and then in 1853 with some minor revisions and again in 1884 in Reykjavík. The poem begins by describing a night view of the skies, and then introduces the reader to astronomic distances, explaining <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> cannonball shot from the sun would take to reach each of the planets—and then the next star. In later stanzas, he describes {{the birth of the}} universe, covers Newton's laws and explains gravity. He interweaves such physics and mathematics framed as poetry with theological and philosophical musings about the purpose of the universe, the nature of good and evil, and God's intent.|$|E
25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata can use their eight legs and two palps to pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey {{out into the open}} or calms the prey while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite the victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers do not know <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E
25|$|Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two {{meanings}} for {{rechargeable batteries}} {{but only one}} for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either {{the length of time}} a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>a</b> battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the Zamboni pile, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The Oxford Electric Bell has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.|$|E
50|$|Daylight {{autonomy}} is {{the percentage}} of time that daylight levels are above a specified target illuminance within a physical space or building. The calculation is based on annual data and the predetermined lighting levels. The goal of the calculation is to determine <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>an</b> individual can work in a space without requiring electrical lighting, while also providing optimal visual and physical comfort.|$|R
