5|$|Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist Max Weber (1864–1920) are {{typically}} {{cited as the}} three principal architects of sociology. Herbert Spencer, William Graham Sumner, Lester F. Ward, W. E. B. Du Bois, Vilfredo Pareto, Alexis <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville,</b> Werner Sombart, Thorstein Veblen, Ferdinand Tönnies, Georg Simmel and Karl Mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber and Friedrich Engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure {{is associated with a}} particular theoretical perspective and orientation.|$|E
5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as great in the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville</b> noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E

25|$|The French Revolution has {{received}} {{enormous amounts of}} historical attention, both from {{the general public and}} from scholars and academics.

25|$|Various {{other early}} social historians and economists have gained {{recognition}} as classical sociologists, including Robert Michels (1876–1936), Alexis <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville</b> (1805–1859), Vilfredo Pareto (1848–1923) and Thorstein Veblen (1857–1926). The classical sociological texts broadly differ from political philosophy {{in the attempt}} to remain scientific, systematic, structural, or dialectical, rather than purely moral, normative or subjective. The new class relations associated with the development of Capitalism are also key, further distinguishing sociological texts from the political philosophy of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras.|$|E
25|$|Several {{well-known}} {{figures have}} been linked to the city of Metz throughout its history. Renowned Messins include poet Paul Verlaine,Pierre Gunther, composer Ambroise Thomas, and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet; numerous well-known German figures were also born in Metz notably during the annexation periods. Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer François Rabelais, Cardinal Mazarin, political thinker Alexis <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville,</b> French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman Robert Schuman.|$|E
25|$|The French {{writer and}} {{traveler}} Alexis <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville,</b> in Democracy in America (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing {{its effects on}} American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the south, were bringing the white and black populations {{to a state of}} equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.|$|E
60|$|The system--or rather anarchy--according {{to which}} France was governed during this {{transitional}} period, may {{be read in}} that work of M. <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> which I have already quoted, and which is accessible to all classes, through Mr. H. Reeve's excellent translation. Every student of history is, of course, well acquainted with that book. But as {{there is reason to}} fear, from language which is becoming once more too common, both in speech and writing, that the general public either do not know it, or have not understood it, I shall take the liberty of quoting from it somewhat largely. I am justified in so doing by the fact that M. <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> book is founded on researches into the French Archives, which have been made (as far as I am aware) only by him; and contains innumerable significant facts, which are to be found (as far as I am aware) in no other accessible work.|$|R
50|$|The work, which {{appeared}} before Alexis <b>de</b> <b>Tocqueville's</b> Democracy in America (La Démocratie en Amérique, 1835-39) {{in most cases}} idealizes American society as one based on social equality and justice, {{the realization of the}} ideas of Classical liberalism, an example worth following. The praise of American society is at once a critique of the Hungarian one. Bölöni Farkas attributes great importance to public education, to the press and non-governmental organizations.|$|R
