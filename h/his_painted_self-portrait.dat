50|$|The impressionists painted {{scenes of}} {{everyday}} life that included cigars, cigarettes, or pipes, {{but they did not}} put symbolic importance in them. The post-impressionists returned symbolic meaning to smoking instruments. One notable painting was done by Vincent van Gogh called Skull with a Burning Cigarette. Although this painting seems to be an anti-smoking warning, it was actually representative of the black humor and practical jokes popular during that time. Edvard Munch launched this trend with <b>his</b> <b>painting</b> <b>Self-Portrait.</b> It shows the artist with a cigarette against a dark background and an eerie look across his face. Munch used smoke to symbolize psychological problems.|$|R

50|$|Self-Portrait (or Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight Years Old Wearing a Coat with Fur Collar) is a {{painting}} on wood panel by the German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer. Painted early in 1500, {{just before his}} 29th birthday, {{it is the last}} of <b>his</b> three <b>painted</b> <b>self-portraits.</b> It is considered the most personal, iconic and complex of his self-portraits, and the one that has become fixed in the popular imagination.|$|R
25|$|As {{has been}} {{established}} by X-ray analysis, Manet <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>Self-Portrait</b> with Palette over a portrait in profile of his wife Suzanne Manet. In this picture she was depicted in a pose {{similar to that in}} the painting Madame Manet at the Piano (1868, Musée d'Orsay).|$|R
50|$|Kos won {{numerous}} {{prizes for}} his work, including the Prešeren Award for <b>his</b> oil <b>painting</b> Dekle s harmoniko (Girl with an Accordion) in 1947 and again for <b>his</b> oil <b>painting</b> Avtoportret (<b>Self-Portrait)</b> in 1950. In that year he also {{exhibited at the}} Venice Biennale. On December 6, 1949 he {{became a member of}} the Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts.|$|R
50|$|Rodríguez studied {{sculpture}} {{under the}} Venezuelan Santiago González (1850-1909) in Guatemala. Afterwards {{he went to}} Spain, where he finished his studies under Luis Muriel y López. After his return to Guatemala, he <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> famous <b>self-portrait.</b> He committed suicide in 1929.|$|R
50|$|Ludger tom Ring the Younger was {{the second}} son of Ludger tom Ring the Older. Until his father's death in 1547, tom Ring the Younger trained artistically with him, and later worked in his older brother Hermann tom Ring's, studio. <b>His</b> first <b>painting,</b> a <b>self-portrait</b> now in Brunswick's Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, was painted in 1547.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{reflective}} {{cover of the}} [...] "bartmann" [...] jug behind the cheese Clara Peeters painted her own portrait. She thus followed the example of Jan van Eyck, who <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait</b> in 1434 in his famous double portrait of the Arnolfini Portrait couple. Clara Peeters made a total of seven self-portraits, including this one.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} into a {{conservative}} middle-class family in Lausanne, and there he attended Collège Cantonal, graduating with a degree in classical studies in 1882. In that year he moved to Paris to study art under Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger at the Académie Julian. He spent many hours in the Louvre, where he greatly admired the works of Holbein, Dürer and Ingres; these artists would remain exemplars for Vallotton throughout his life. Vallotton's earliest paintings, chiefly portraits, are firmly rooted in the academic tradition. In 1885 he painted the Ingresque Portrait of Monsieur Ursenbach as well as <b>his</b> first <b>painted</b> <b>self-portrait</b> (seen at left), which received an honorable mention at the Salon des artistes français in 1886.|$|R
50|$|From 1908 to 1913, Hitler tinted postcards {{and painted}} houses for a living. He <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> first <b>self-portrait</b> in 1910 {{at the age}} of 21. This painting, along with twelve other {{paintings}} by Hitler, were discovered by Company Sergeant Major Willie J. McKenna in 1945 in Essen, Germany.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 Berner co-wrote and hosted The Loaded Brush on Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The {{documentary}} explored Berner's {{passion for}} the craft of painting and consisted of video diaries Berner filmed of himself <b>painting</b> <b>his</b> own <b>self-portrait</b> for the Archibald Prize, as well as interviews with other artists who had previously entered the Archibald.|$|R
50|$|His bitter disappointments in {{life are}} {{revealed}} on <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait</b> <b>painted</b> a year prior to his death. He looked at {{the world with the}} eye of a naturalist, despite his hot-temper. Tragically, the last years of his life were spent in a mental hospital; nevertheless he left a unique heritage. His works represented realism, like Courbet’s, and he wasn’t afraid to represent all matters of life, including the lives of humble people.|$|R
5000|$|Funi {{was born}} in Ferrara. He studied at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts from 1906 to 1910 and joined the Nuove Tendenze {{movement}} as a painter of Cubo-Futurist works in 1914. Having enlisted in the Volunteer Cyclist Battalion and served in World War I, he became a champion of the [...] "return to order". He studied Graeco-Roman statuary and was influenced by De Chirico’s Metaphysical <b>painting.</b> <b>His</b> <b>self-portrait</b> Autoritratto da giovane, 1924, is in the Museo Cantonale d’Arte in Lugano.|$|R
2500|$|Wilson-Bareau proposes an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} origin of the self-portraits. [...] When the art historian and Manet biographer Adolphe Tabarant asked Manet's stepson Léon Leenhoff about the point in time at which Manet had been stricken with Syphilis, Leenhoff gave 1879 as an answer, which would explain why Manet, who had never before in <b>his</b> life <b>painted</b> a <b>self-portrait,</b> had <b>painted</b> two within that year. It would seem that with the reality of death right before his eyes, he felt a need {{to come to terms with}} himself.|$|R
5000|$|In 1856 Lock and Emily Chaffey (b. 1829) {{were married}} at St. George's Anglican Church in Montreal; and {{afterward}} made {{their home in}} Brockville where Emily's widowed mother and perhaps six of Emily's siblings were living. [...] Lock made another trip to sketch Niagara Falls in winter where he produced one additional graphite sketch of the falls, dated 1857, that has survived. In 1858, Lock worked from his artist's studio on Market Street in Brockville; {{and it is likely}} there that Lock <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait</b> (featured prominently above), which is in the McCord Museum, Montreal.|$|R
50|$|Alex Israel (born 1982) is {{multimedia}} artist, writer, and eyewear designer {{born and}} based in LA. Deeply entwined with his hometown, his work explores popular media, Hollywood, and {{the cult of}} celebrity, while positing LA as central {{to an understanding of}} American culture and the American dream. He is known for his large, colorful airbrushed paintings of abstract gradients and Los Angeles skies, <b>his</b> <b>Self-Portraits,</b> <b>painted</b> on shaped Fiberglass panels, and multimedia installations constructed from movie-house props. His works are often made on the backlot of Warner Bros. Studios.|$|R
50|$|After {{four years}} he {{traveled}} to Florence, Venice, then Paris. He was eclectic and prolific, among his works: An Episode of the 1301 Siege of Messina; The main Italian Poets at the Court of Frederico II in SiciIy; Vatti a far monaca!; Hamlet scene; La prima sventura di Luigi Camoens; Le castellane e il menestrello; Il trovatore cacciato in bando; Dante and Beatrice; The escape of Bianca Cappello; Le maggiolate; Ophelia Crazed; I Vespri Siciliani. He painted {{for a number of}} churches in his Catania, with paintings such as San Benedetto; L'Immacolata; La cena in Emaus; Il sacrifìcio di Gedeone; San Vito; Le Vergini di Sion; San Luigi Gonzaga; L'Addolorata; Sant'Agata in jail. Rapisardi was criticized for the anacronism of <b>his</b> costumes. He <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait.</b>|$|R
25|$|His Two on the Aisle (1927) {{sold for}} a {{personal}} record $1,500, enabling Hopper to purchase an automobile, which he used to make field trips to remote areas of New England. In 1929, he produced Chop Suey and Railroad Sunset. The following year, art patron Stephen Clark donated House by the Railroad (1925) to the Museum of Modern Art, the first oil painting that it acquired for its collection. Hopper <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> last <b>self-portrait</b> in oil around 1930. Although Josephine posed for many of his paintings, she sat for only one formal oil portrait by her husband, Jo Painting (1936).|$|R
500|$|Self-Portrait with Halo and Snake, {{also known}} as Self-Portrait, is an 1889 oil on wood {{painting}} by French artist Paul Gauguin, which represents his late Brittany period in the fishing village of Le Pouldu in northwestern France. No longer comfortable with Pont-Aven, Gauguin moved on to Le Pouldu with his friend and student Meijer de Haan and {{a small group of}} artists. He stayed for several months in the autumn of 1889 and the summer of 1890, where the group spent their time decorating the interior of Marie Henry's inn with every major type of art work. Gauguin <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>Self-Portrait</b> [...] in the dining room with its companion piece, [...] Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan (1889).|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile he {{continued}} painting frescoes and illusory domes in Turin, Mondovì, Modena, Montepulciano and Arezzo. In 1681 {{he was asked}} by Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany to <b>paint</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait</b> for the ducal collection (now in the Uffizi in Florence). This oil on canvas has become a most original self-portrait. It shows the painter in a diagonal pose, showing with his right index finger <b>his</b> illusionist easel <b>painting</b> (a trompe-l'oeil dome, perhaps of the Badia church in Arezzo) while his left hand rests on three books (probably alluding to his not-yet published treatises on perspective). The painting {{was sent to the}} duke in 1688. He also painted scenes from the life of St Stanislaus Kostka in the saint's rooms of the Jesuit noviciate of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome.|$|R
25|$|Sukumaran <b>painted</b> {{multiple}} <b>self-portraits</b> {{while on}} Nusakambangan. <b>His</b> final <b>painting</b> resembles a bleeding Indonesian flag.|$|R
5000|$|One critic wrote [...] "Julian {{is a man}} who {{has seen}} life, absorbed it and now {{presents}} it." [...] Sweeping and majestic paintings presented the very essence of Ritter's emotions. [...] "The Carousel" [...] was a complicated composition exploring man's spiritual nature. Ritter dealt with man's hypocrisy in [...] "The Sunday Preacher". Ritter's [...] "Man on the Cross" [...] was a deeply personal view into Ritter's emotions as he <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait</b> onto the cross. One critic wrote of the piece: [...] "Undoubtedly, it is a daring and modern interpretation of life. It is a work which will cause considerable controversy. But what great artist hasn't caused that? What artist of any note has not or will not speak his own mind through his pictures?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Conditions {{improved}} {{during the}} summer of 1858. Whistler recovered and traveled with fellow artist Ernest Delannoy through France and the Rhineland. He later produced a group of etchings known as [...] "The French Set", with the help of French master printer Auguste Delâtre. During that year, he <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> first <b>self-portrait,</b> Portrait of Whistler with Hat, a dark and thickly rendered work reminiscent of Rembrandt. But the event of greatest consequence that year was his friendship with Henri Fantin-Latour, whom he met at the Louvre. Through him, Whistler was introduced to the circle of Gustave Courbet, which included Carolus-Duran (later the teacher of John Singer Sargent), Alphonse Legros, and Édouard Manet.|$|R
2500|$|With the Portrait of Dr. Gachet, Van Gogh {{sought to}} create a [...] "modern portrait", which {{he wrote to his}} sister [...] "impassions me most—much, much more than all the rest of my métier." [...] Elaborating on this quote, Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker noted [...] "... much later generations {{experience}} it not only as psychologically striking, but also as a very unconventional and 'modern' portrait." [...] He also wrote, [...] "My self-portrait is done in nearly the same way but the blue is the fine blue of the Midi, and the clothes are a light lilac," [...] which would refer to one of <b>his</b> final <b>self-portraits</b> <b>painted</b> in September the year previous.|$|R
50|$|Harlow {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{attractive}} figures in the history of English <b>painting.</b> <b>His</b> works only suggest what he might have achieved. Many of his portraits were engraved, and those of James Northcote, Fuseli, Thomas Stothard, William Beechey, John Flaxman, amongst others, were highly esteemed. <b>His</b> <b>self-portrait,</b> <b>painted</b> for the gallery at Florence, was engraved for Ranalli's Imperiale e Reale Galleria di Firenze. A drawing from it by J. Jackson, R.A., was bequeathed to the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery in 1888 by the painter's nephew, G. Harlow White. Another drawing by himself was engraved by B. Holl for theLibrary of the Fine Arts. He introduced his own portrait into the background of The Trial of Queen Katharine. A portrait of the Prince of Wales (later George IV) by Harlow was engraved in mezzotint by W. Ward.|$|R
50|$|Similarly to its architecture, {{the wall}} {{paintings}} of Lesnovo {{all come from}} a short time span. The original church was painted in 1346-47, the narthex in 1349. There were four painters of whom are known {{the names of the}} three, inscribed in medallions (Sevasto, Mihail and Marko). One of them has also <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait,</b> seated by the river of knowledge coming from the teachings of one of church fathers. Although painted in just several years the frescoes of Lesnovo show all the stylistic diversity of the current styles of painting. While some of the paintings in the nave follow the classicist examples {{from the beginning of the}} 14th century with their calm composition and mild color contrast, the painter of the cycle on St Michael emphasized movement and drama of the events, painting them in bright colors.|$|R

50|$|In 1768 Krafft {{returned}} to Stockholm after 21 years abroad. Pastel were {{now out of}} style, and oil paintings again in vogue. Before the portrait orders increased, Krafft undertook other assignments. In 1770, he painted an altarpiece for Muskö chapel. In competition with Lorens Pasch the Younger who painted the court and nobility, Krafft mostly painted the local bourgeois and scholars. He did portraits of Carl Christoffer Gjörwell Sr., Niclas Sahlgren, Emanuel Swedenborg, Sven Lagerbring, Carl Michael Bellman, Carl Linnaeus, Jonas Alströmer and peasantry President Anders Mattsson. At Uppsala University Krafft performed a couple of chancellor portraits, including King Adolf Frederick and King Gustavus III as Crown Prince. Later, he received more orders of King Gustaf III and his queen, and received the title of Professor in 1773 and {{was elected to the}} painting academy. At the Academy Krafft <b>painted</b> <b>his</b> <b>self-portrait</b> around 1775.|$|R
