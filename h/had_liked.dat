5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing {{him to be a}} great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of the psyche lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent the psyche locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E

He considered it more a [...] "long-running social phenomenon" [...] than a movie, rating it 2.5 out of 4 stars. Bill Henkin noted that Variety thought that the [...] "campy hijinks" [...] of the film seemed labored, and also mentioned that the San Francisco Chronicle John Wasserman, who <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> the stage play in London, found the film [...] "lacking both charm and dramatic impact". Newsweek called the film [...] "tasteless, plotless and pointless" [...] in 1978.|$|E
500|$|A further {{problem for}} Quinn was {{that none of}} the actors who had played Quatermass for BBC Television in the 1950s were still alive. This was solved by {{employing}} Andrew Keir, who had played Quatermass in the Hammer Film Productions version of Quatermass and the Pit in 1967, a performance which Kneale <b>had</b> <b>liked.</b> Keir was happy to take the part, but somewhat concerned about only being used as a [...] "link man" [...] and not in a fully dramatic role. The clips that were used from the original BBC episodes were all carefully edited so that the actors playing Quatermass were never heard, and thus the differences between their voices and Keir's would not confuse the audience. Also in the cast were Emma Gregory as the journalist, Mandy, and Zulema Dene as Quatermass's housekeeper, Maire.|$|E

It was only when Roberts suggested that Catatonia record some extended plays (EPs) after two months with the label that Mwyn made the arrangements. The first, entitled For Tinkerbell, had a cover photo taken by Roberts and Matthews' housemate Roland Dafis. Mwyn successfully got the record on BBC Radio 1 after sending a copy to radio presenter Mark Radcliffe. After Iestyn George heard the release, the journalist named it as {{the record of the}} week for the magazine NME. For Tinkerbell contained some early tracks, including a version of [...] "Sweet Catatonia". Matthews later explained that while she <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> the songs on the EP, she felt that she wasn't good at performing live at the time. They signed to Nursery Records to release the single [...] "Bleed". Catatonia's first national interview was published following the release of [...] "For Tinkerbell", a 300 word piece appearing in Melody Maker.|$|E

Although Sunday was immediately smitten with her, both had serious on-going relationships that bordered on engagements. Furthermore, Nell Thompson had grown to maturity {{in a much more}} privileged environment than had Sunday, and her father strongly discouraged the courtship, viewing all professional baseball players as [...] "transient ne'er-do-wells who were unstable and destined to be misfits once they were too old to play." [...] Nevertheless, Sunday pursued and eventually married her. On several occasions, Sunday said, [...] "She was a Presbyterian, so I am a Presbyterian.

After the band released their third studio album Undone in early 2004, they decided {{to take some time}} off, and realized they could record a Christmas album over that period. Although MercyMe had started as a rock band, they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] became successful. In creating The Christmas Sessions, the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres; Millard described it as [...] "the most 'rock' album we've done" [...] and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying [...] "we didn’t have to worry about which direction we went.

500|$|The filmed pilot episode {{served as}} basis for {{additional}} tweaking of intended story lines. The expanded role of Brother Justin encouraged {{the creation of}} his sister Iris in a supporting role, for which Amy Madigan was cast. Little was changed on Ben Hawkins' side except for {{the addition of the}} cootch (striptease) Dreifuss family; a Carnivàle consultant had elated the producers by calling attention to his research about families managing cootch shows in the 1930s. Cynthia Ettinger (Rita Sue Dreifuss) had lost her role as Martha Kent in the pilot episode of Smallville before the opportunity for Carnivàle came up and had turned to theater jobs; she chose Carnivàle because of the theater-like experience. Amanda Aday (Dora Mae Dreifuss) knew she would join the cast for only a few episodes, but was not told the story reasons at that point. The writers prolonged the character arcs of recurring John Carroll Lynch (Stroud) and K Callan (Eleanor) considerably beyond their original intention. Similarly, Robert Knepper's role as Tommy Dolan was extended from a few episodes to half of both seasons because the writers <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> his performance as an [...] "ambitious man [...] Brother Justin to further his career." ...|$|E
500|$|Karen Moore, a Paramount executive, {{suggested}} to Bennett that Nicholas Meyer, writer of The Seven-Per-Cent Solution {{and director of}} Time After Time, could help resolve the screenplay issues. Meyer had also never seen an episode of Star Trek. He had {{the idea of making}} a list consisting of everything that the creative team <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> from the preceding drafts"it could be a character, it could be a scene, it could be a plot, it could be a subplot, [...] it could be a line of dialogue"so that he could use that list as the basis of a new screenplay made from all the best aspects of the previous ones. To offset fan expectation that Spock would die, Meyer had the character [...] "killed" [...] in the Kobayashi Maru simulator in the opening scene. The effects company required a completed script in just 12 days. Meyer wrote the screenplay uncredited and for no pay before the deadline, surprising the actors and producers, and rapidly produced subsequent rewrites as necessary. One draft, for example, had a baby in Khan's group, who is killed with the others in the Genesis detonation. Meyer later said: ...|$|E

500|$|Intuition's first game, Dinowaurs, is a {{strategy}} and action game where two players compete as dinosaurs to seize the most cavemen settlements on a single screen. Captured settlements provide resources for upgrades to the players' dinosaurs. The object of this arms race is to kill the other dinosaur. It features online matchmaking. The game was built from an unfinished Flash-based multiplayer strategy game started by Boxleiter and {{an image of a}} stegosaurus with a jetpack drawn by Martens. The team combined the concepts for {{a strategy}} game about dinosaurs fighting for food. They struggled with long-distance communication, but used a project management website and Skype to stay in touch. When looking for a platform, Intuition originally pitched the game with a clay dinosaur to Adult Swim—who was funding Flash games—but was declined for not being [...] "edgy enough". In June, they then tried then-new Flash site Kongregate via a connection Larson had made with its CEO Jim Greer at the 2007 Game Developers Conference. He asked the team to wait for their new Director of Games to be hired, who ended up being Intuition's contact at Adult Swim. The contact <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> the idea and thought the game worked better for Kongregate than did for Adult Swim, and so funded the game by November 2007 {{as one of the first}} five for the Kongregate platform. The package was a one-year browser exclusivity agreement that let Intuition keep the intellectual property.|$|E
500|$|Black & White {{took over}} three years to develop {{beginning}} on 14 February 1998, and was released on 30 March 2001. Peter Molyneux funded the project himself and devoted his entire focus to its development. Molyneux stated {{that he tried to}} correct the mistakes he made with the game design of Dungeon Keeper. The goal was to develop a unique game where players felt they inhabited a world where they could do anything. Molyneux <b>had</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of controlling people as a god since his previous venture, Populous. He was interested in the concept of good and evil and thought that this could be used to influence the game's atmosphere. Development was slow, starting with only six people, as Molyneux wanted to assemble the right team. Discussions about concepts (including a Mafia-style game) began at his house in 1997, and in February 1998, the team moved into Lionhead's offices. The expanded nine-person team exchanged further suggestions for the game and its content, such as lip-synchronised characters, although this was thought impossible. As more people joined, Molyneux wanted Lionhead's friendly atmosphere to remain, and their policy of only recruiting people who could fit in with existing members meant that the team had developed their own way of working. According to Molyneux, team members questioned and competed with each other, resulting in a better quality of work. He said that [...] "the team did the work of a group twice their number." [...] The group that finally numbered twenty-five programmers with a budget of approximately £4 million.|$|E
500|$|The {{cover of}} the first {{printing}} of The Great Gatsby {{is among the most}} celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald {{was in the midst of}} writing it. The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had [...] "written it into" [...] the novel. Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as [...] "blue and gigantic– their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose." [...] Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the [...] "girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs." [...] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but [...] "Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story.
