5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} southwestern Madagascar. Populations of this species have {{historically}} been included in Miniopterus manavi, but molecular data published in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this supposed species in fact consists of five separate species, including the newly described M.mahafaliensis. The species {{has been found in}} dry, spiny, and <b>gallery</b> <b>forest,</b> as well as more open habitats, in southwestern Madagascar.|$|E

40|$|The Cerrado biome {{contains}} a rich mammal community, with an influence from the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests, principally {{observed in the}} <b>gallery</b> <b>forests.</b> In this paper, through literature review, it is shown that the non-volant mammal community of the <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> is distinct from the mammal communities of any other physionomy of the Cerrado. Additionally, the <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> contain twice as many species common to the rainforests when compared {{to all the other}} physiognomies of the Cerrado combined. The <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> appear to provide habitat within the Cerrado for rainforest mammals, increasing the biodiversity of this biome. As such, <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> may function as dispersion corridors for these species...|$|R

5|$|The {{range of}} Miniopterus mahafaliensis extends through southwestern Madagascar in the spiny forest and dry forest, often {{but not always}} near caves; {{it has been found}} on the Mahafaly Plateau, in the Forêt des Mikea, and the Kirindy Mitea National Park. Further inland, it has been found in {{disturbed}} <b>gallery</b> <b>forest</b> in Isalo National Park, in a cave in savanna habitat near Ihosy, and in unspecified habitat at Betroka. Little is known of the ecology of M.mahafaliensis, but species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects, breed seasonally, and roost in large colonies in caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{small round}} yellow fruit ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, {{although}} they peak in autumn and winter (April to July). Known as a syconium, the fruit is an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. Ficusobliqua is pollinated by two species of fig wasp—Pleistodontes greenwoodi and P.xanthocephalus. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. The range is along the east coast from Queensland, through New South Wales in rainforest, savanna woodland, sclerophyll forest and <b>gallery</b> <b>forest.</b> It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai. All parts of the tree have been used in traditional medicine in Fiji.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gallery</b> <b>forests</b> {{have shrunk}} in extent {{worldwide}} {{as a result}} of human activities, including domestic livestock's preventing tree seedling establishment and the construction of dams and weirs causing flooding or interfering with natural stream flow.

25|$|In areas it is native to, the red {{important}} {{fire ant}} {{is still a}} dominant species and coexists with 28 ant species in <b>gallery</b> <b>forest</b> gaps and ten species in xerophytic forest grassland, winning most aggressive interactions with other ants. However, some ants can be co-dominant in areas where they coexist such as the Argentine ant, where they compete symmetrically. Workers regularly engage in food competition with other ants, and can suppress the exploitation of food resources from honeydew-producing hemipterans (specifically from Phenacoccus solenopsis) from native ants; however, red important fire ants are unable to eliminate T. melanocephalum completely although they consume {{a higher proportion of}} food. Instead, the two ants may peacefully coexist and share the honeydew. When encountering neighboring fire ants, workers may take on death-feigning behaviours to avoid them with success. However, such behaviour is only seen in young workers, as older workers either flee or fight back when threatened.|$|E

500|$|In {{secondary}} forest, it {{is generally}} observed from ground level up to [...] above ground, yet [...] in the canopy of primary forest.

500|$|Like {{all other}} members of the family Cheirogaleidae, the gray mouse lemur is nocturnal and arboreal.

[...] The species is more common in secondary forest than in primary forest, particularly bush and scrub habitat, where it occupies a [...] "fine branch" [...] niche, restricting the vertical range to fine branches, fine terminal supports, lianas and dense foliage. These lemurs are usually seen on branches less than [...] in diameter. The gray mouse lemur tends to prefer lower levels of the forest and the understory, where branches and vegetation are dense.|$|E
500|$|The {{forests are}} {{composed}} of diverse species of deciduous and coniferous trees and {{a great variety of}} wildflowers. An important element of the region's flora, apart from the rich variety of plant species, is the high degree of endemism in Balkan (23%) and Greek species (5.8%). Recent studies on the flora of the National Park counted 873 vascular plants, including more than 250 medicinal, aromatic, and poisonous taxa. The park's forests are abundant in species associated with the cool local climate, such as Wych Elm, Nettle-leaved Bellflower, Horse-chestnut and Large-leaved Linden. In the valley of the Vikos Gorge, Platanus orientalis form an azonal <b>gallery</b> <b>forest</b> {{along the banks of the}} Voidomatis. The woodland in the mountain area around the village of Papingo is characterized by the predominance of different juniper species, such as Juniperus communis, foetidissima, oxycedrus and excelsa. In the upper hills Juniperus foetidissima dominates, with exceptionally high (more than [...] ) trees. At higher altitudes, pure conifer forests of either pine or fir are found.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gallery</b> <b>forests</b> of the Colombian Eastern Plains are {{important}} reservoirs of global biodiversity {{as a result}} of the small area occupied and its high structural and functional heterogeneity. However, to date there are no one-hectare permanent plots reported in the <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> of the seasonal savannas of the Colombian Eastern Plains. This study provides information about the diversity and vegetation structure of three hectares of mature <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> associated to three waterways that f low into the Tomo River (Tomo Grande Reserve, municipality of Santa Rosalia, department of Vichada), through the analysis of diversity (Fisher's alpha) and physiognomy (verticalstructure, the importance value index IVI, timber volume by diameter class) and also the relation between the diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height for the individuals measured except palms. We included trees, vines and hemiepiphytes with DBH greater than or equal to 10 cm. A total of 120 species were found, and a low diversity compared with Amazon plots (D-Fisher mean= 27. 0), which is related to a reduced area occupied by <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> in relation to large Amazon blocks. However, the most abundant families (Arecaceae, Annonaceae,Rubiaceae, Bignoniaceae, Moraceae, Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae) match the most abundant families of Amazon plots, except for Bignoniaceae, fact that shows the similarity between the Llanos and the Amazonian flora. Most species showed local dominance (high IVI), compared with plots placed on other <b>gallery</b> <b>forests</b> and in the Amazon, which indicates that despite the closeness, there may be biogeographic, climatic, geologic and biotic differences that may affect the successful recruitment of species ineach area...|$|R
