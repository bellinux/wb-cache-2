5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> {{in the style of}} military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E

30|$|The {{effects of}} 30 years (1972 – 2003) of Wildland Fire Use for Resource Benefit (WFU) fires on ponderosa pine forest stand {{structure}} were evaluated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gila <b>Wilderness,</b> New Mexico, and <b>the</b> Saguaro <b>Wilderness,</b> Arizona. Tree density, diameter-class distributions, basal area, and stand density index were compared among areas that burned with different frequencies since 1972 and areas that burned mid-century (1940 – 1950) and {{again during the}} WFU era (1972 – 2003). <b>In</b> both <b>the</b> Saguaro <b>Wilderness</b> and <b>the</b> Gila <b>Wilderness,</b> significantly fewer small-diameter (5 cm to 22.5 cm) trees occurred in areas that burned multiple times since 1972 compared to areas that were unburned (p < 0.05) during this time. The density of large-diameter (> 45 cm diameter breast height) trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gila <b>Wilderness</b> was highly variable and {{did not differ significantly}} among fire treatments (p > 0.32). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Saguaro <b>Wilderness,</b> significantly more large-diameter trees (> 45 cm dbh) occurred in areas that burned mid-century and again during WFU than in all other fire treatments. Mean 10 -year basal area increment growth rates (1840 to the present) of trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gila <b>Wilderness</b> that experienced mid-century fires suggest that those fires may have had a thinning effect. Ponderosa pine forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gila <b>Wilderness</b> and Saguaro Wilderness are structurally diverse and resistant to fires burning during the natural fire season, suggesting that repeated WFU fires have restored forest resilience to fire.|$|R

The theatre reopened on Christmas Day 1971 as the Klondike Theatre after {{almost a year}} of renovations. Towne Cinema restored the original function of {{the interior of the}} building, rebuilt sections of the exterior, and installed a new marquee at a cost of $270,000.

5|$|Arriving back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness,</b> {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take {{them all to}} Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000). Only two trails enter the wilderness area and even those stop after a few miles or kilometers. From there most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with a ranger. No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness</b> area.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness,</b> probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness.</b> The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
5|$|In December 1903, in {{an effort}} to avert another bout of Beebe's throat ailment, Hornaday sent him on an {{expedition}} to Mexico which would last until the following April. Since Mexico was still largely unstable at this point, he and Blair traveled on horseback and lived mostly in tents, and both carried revolvers for self-protection. Although the purpose of the expedition was to discover, identify and collect Mexico's birds, it has also been described as yet another honeymoon between him and Blair. Beebe's first book, titled Two Bird Lovers in Mexico, was an account of this expedition. The last chapter was written by Blair, and was an explanation of how to plan and execute a vacation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness.</b> The book was enthusiastically well received.|$|E

She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>wilderness,</b> males seldom {{live longer}} than 10 to 14 years, as {{injuries}} sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their life span. In captivity they can live more than 20 years. They typically inhabit savanna and grassland, although they may take to bush and forest. Lions are unusually social compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and {{a small number of}} adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. Lions are apex and keystone predators, although they are also expert scavengers obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have. Sleeping mainly during the day, lions are active primarily at night (nocturnal), although sometimes at twilight (crepuscular).|$|E
