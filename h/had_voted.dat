5|$|During the elections, Ohio {{officials}} were harassed by Michigan {{authorities and the}} area residents were threatened with arrest if they submitted to Ohio's authority. On April 8, 1835, the Monroe County, Michigan sheriff arrived {{at the home of}} Major Benjamin F. Stickney, an Ohio partisan. In the first contact between Michigan partisans and the Stickney family, the sheriff arrested two Ohioans under the Pains and Penalties Act on the basis that the men <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> in the Ohio elections.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' {{re-election}} {{was more}} difficult. In four months {{he had lost}} the temporary support of Thomas' allies in the General Assembly who <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> for him in 1818. He narrowly defeated Thomas partisan Michael Jones {{by a vote of}} 23–19. This may have been due to the influence of the powerful Secretary of State Elias Kane, a Thomas ally.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's jury {{votes in}} the Grand Final were all {{declared}} invalid, as all the jury members <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> exactly the same from 3 points up to 12 points. According to EBU, this constitutes a statistical impossibility. Therefore, only Georgia's televoting result {{was used for the}} distribution of the Georgian points in the Grand Final.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{the breakdown of}} his marriage, Afroyim {{decided to return to}} the United States, but the State Department refused to renew his U.S. passport, ruling that because Afroyim <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> in the 1951 Israeli legislative election, he had lost his citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940. A letter certifying Afroyim's loss of citizenship was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on January 13, 1961.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, Michael Schiavo {{created a}} {{political}} action committee, TerriPAC. It {{was formed to}} raise money to support right-to-die candidates and oppose candidates who <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> for government involvement in the Schiavo case. In 2007, TerriPAC paid a $1,350 fine to the Federal Election Commission for failing to file complete and timely records. Schiavo shut down the PAC later that year.|$|E
5|$|In October 1986, the IOC <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> to {{hold the}} Olympic Winter Games halfway through the {{four-year}} Olympiad, {{rather than in the}} same year as the summer Games, and this change started with the XVIIth Olympic Winter Games in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway.

5|$|Julie Bishop {{remained}} the deputy {{leader of the}} party, without being challenged for the position. Abbott thus became the third consecutive leader, after Nelson and Turnbull, for whom Bishop would serve as deputy. After the ballots, Bishop declared that she <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> for Turnbull, although Turnbull doubted her loyalty and Bishop resorted to proving it by retrieving her ballot papers.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor. After Andrew pledged that {{neither he nor}} his brother would take vengeance on those who <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> against them in 1594, the Diet elected him prince on 28 March. However, as Alfonso Carillo noted, the most influential noblemen remained opposed to Andrew, even if they did not dare to raise an objection openly.|$|E
5|$|The thirty-five Tribes {{were not}} ethnic or kinship groups, {{but rather a}} generic {{division}} into which Roman citizens were distributed. When the Tribes were created the divisions were geographical, similar to modern Parliamentary constituencies. However, since one joined the same Tribe that one's father belonged to, the geographical distinctions were eventually lost. The order that the 35 Tribes voted in was selected randomly by lot. The order was not chosen at once, and after each Tribe <b>had</b> <b>voted,</b> a lot {{was used to determine}} which Tribe should vote next. The first Tribe selected was usually the most important Tribe, because it often decided the matter. It was believed that the order of the lot was chosen by the Gods, and thus, that the position held by the early voting Tribes was the position of the Gods. Once a majority of Tribes <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> the same way, voting ended.|$|E
50|$|Gore {{supporters}} {{argued that}} had candidate Ralph Nader, a liberal, not {{run in the}} election, {{the majority of the}} 97,421 votes he received in Florida would have been cast for Gore. Thus, they contend that Nader's candidacy spoiled the election for Gore by taking away enough votes from Gore in Florida to swing the election to Bush. Their argument is bolstered by a poll of Nader voters, asking them for whom they would <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> <b>had</b> Nader not run, which said 45 percent of Nader voters would <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for Gore, 27 percent would <b>have</b> <b>voted</b> for Bush, and the rest would not <b>have</b> <b>voted.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried {{to explain why the}} German people {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why it was necessary for outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> into power.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{taking office}} in 2001, Bush stated his {{opposition}} to the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the world's population and would have cost {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. He also cited that the Senate <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.|$|E
5|$|Warren is {{a leading}} figure in the Democratic Party and is popular among American progressives. Although she {{repeatedly}} stated {{that she was not}} running for the presidency, Warren was frequently mentioned by political pundits as a strong potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election. Warren remained neutral during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, endorsing presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton only after all fifty states <b>had</b> <b>voted.</b>|$|E

The council rules had stipulated a necessary two-thirds supermajority to reject the schemas. Although only 60% <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> against the schemas, they were regardless discarded at the intervention of Pope John XXIII, upon the request of the liberal Council Fathers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the heavy}} 4–1 {{defeat in the}} {{previous}} Ashes series, captain and fellow Victorian Jack Ryder was omitted altogether from the 1930 Ashes tour, and Woodfull appointed captain. Ryder {{was one of the}} three selectors and advocated his own retention, but his two colleagues <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> him off. At first, Woodfull was reluctant to accept the job, feeling that it rightfully belonged to Ryder. When he was informed that Ryder was not even touring, Woodfull only agreed after a ballot was organised. He was unanimously selected by the board. Woodfull had limited leadership experience and in his brief captaincy duties had been the first captain to declare his team's second innings in Shield history.|$|E

5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> to cut Medicare; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> {{in favor of}} declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who <b>had</b> <b>voted</b> in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E
