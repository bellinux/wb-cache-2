In this work we focus on a domestic chore deemed dull {{by a majority of}} the population, the task of ironing. The presented algorithm improves on the limited number of previous works by joining 3 D perception with force/torque sensing, with emphasis on finding a practical solution with a feasible implementation in a domestic setting. Our algorithm obtains a point cloud representation of the working environment. From this point cloud, the garment is segmented and a custom Wrinkleness Local Descriptor (WiLD) is computed to determine the location of the present wrinkles. Using this descriptor, the most suitable <b>ironing</b> <b>path</b> is computed and, based on it, the manipulation algorithm performs the force-controlled ironing operation. Experiments have been performed with a humanoid robot platform, proving that our algorithm is able to detect successfully wrinkles present in garments and iteratively reduce the wrinkleness using an unmodified iron.

40|$|The use of seed plates during {{directional}} solidification (DS) of Quasimono silicon ingots causes additional yield losses compared to standard multi-crystalline ingots {{due to an}} increased area of low minority carrier lifetime ("red-zone") in the bottom region. This effect is attributed in literature mainly to iron impurities which are contaminating the seed crystal during heat up and afterwards the as-grown ingot during solidification. However, the contamination mechanisms itself are still not completely understood. Therefore, in this work the seed contamination mechanisms by iron and their effect on the lifetime distribution in the bottom region of Quasimono silicon ingots were investigated. For this purpose special crystal growth experiments in a laboratory-scale DS furnace were carried out by using diffusion barriers at the crucible/seed and seed/melt interfaces in order to separate the different contamination paths. The {{results show that the}} <b>iron</b> diffusion <b>path</b> from the crucible into the seed plates plays an important role. But in addition to this it will be demonstrated that an even more important <b>iron</b> contamination <b>path</b> is by gas phase transport from furnace parts via the furnace atmosphere to the seed crystals...|$|R

40|$|Maxi-ferritins are {{ubiquitous}} iron-storage proteins with {{a common}} cage architecture made up of 24 identical subunits of five α-helices that drive iron biomineralization through catalytic iron(II) oxidation occurring at oxido-reductase sites (OS). Structures of iron-bound human H ferritin were solved at high resolution by freezing ferritin crystals at different time intervals after exposure to a ferrous salt. Multiple binding sites were identified that define the <b>iron</b> <b>path</b> from the entry ion channels to the oxidoreductase sites. Similar data are available for another vertebrate ferritin: the M protein from Rana catesbeiana. A comparative analysis of the iron sites in the two proteins identifies new reaction intermediates and underlines clear differences {{in the pattern of}} ligands that define the additional iron sites that precede the oxidoreductase binding sites along this path. Stopped-flow kinetics assays revealed that human H ferritin has different levels of activity compared with its R. catesbeiana counterpart. The role of the different pattern of transient iron-binding sites in the OS is discussed with respect to the observed differences in activity across the species...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{non-linear}} observer for Induction Machine (IM) drives which takes {{into consideration the}} saturation effects. The non-linear observer {{is based on an}} original formulation of the dynamic model of the IM taking into consideration the magnetic saturation of the iron core. A Lyapunov based convergence analysis is proposed in order to suitably compute the observer gain guaranteeing the stability of the observer. The proposed non-linear observer has been tested in numerical simulation and experimentally on a suitably developed test set-up. Its behaviour has been compared to that obtained with a classic Full-Order Luenberger Observer (FOLO) in variable flux working conditions, in terms of accuracy of the amplitude and phase of both the rotor flux linkage and the stator currents space vectors. Results have shown the capability of the proposed non-linear observer to correctly estimate the rotor flux linkage amplitude and phase under flux varying conditions including strong variation of the saturation of the <b>iron</b> <b>path</b> with accuracy in the flux estimation much higher than that obtained with the classic FOLO...|$|E
40|$|Ferritins {{managing}} iron–oxygen biochemistry in animals, plants, and microorganisms {{belong to}} the diiron carboxylate protein family and concentrate iron as ferric oxide ≈ 1014 times above the ferric Ks. Ferritin iron (up to 4, 500 atoms), used for iron cofactors and heme, or to trap DNA-damaging oxidants in microorganisms, is concentrated in the protein nanocage cavity (5 – 8 nm) formed during assembly of polypeptide subunits, 24 in maxiferritins and 12 in miniferritins/DNA protection during starvation proteins. Direct identification of ferritin ferroxidase (Fox) sites, complicated by multiple types of iron–ferritin interactions, is now achieved with chimeric proteins where putative Fox site residues were introduced singly and cumulatively into an inactive host, an L maxiferritin. A dimagnesium ferritin cocrystal model guided site design and the diferric peroxo Fox intermediates (A at 650 nm) monitored activity. Diferric peroxo formation in chimeric and WT proteins had similar Kapp values and Hill coefficients. Catalytic activity required cooperative ferrous substrate binding to two sites A (E, EXXH) and B (E, QXXD). The weaker B sites in ferritin contrast with stronger B sites (E, EXXH) in diiron carboxylate oxygenases, explaining diferric oxo/hydroxo product release in ferritin vs. diiron cofactor retention in oxygenases. Codons for Q/H and D/E differ by single nucleotides, suggesting simple DNA mutations relate site B diiron substrate sites and diiron cofactor sites in proteins. The smaller kcat values in chimeras indicate the absence of second-shell residues important for ferritin substrate–product channeling that, when identified, will outline the entire <b>iron</b> <b>path</b> from ferritin pores through the Fox site to the mineral cavity...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{motivated}} by the growing needs for multi-degree of freedom (M-DOF) electromagnetic actuators capable of smooth and accurate multi-dimensional driving motions. Because high coercive rare-earth permanent-magnets (PMs) are widely available at low cost, their uses for developing compact, energy-efficient M-DOF actuators have been widely researched. To facilitate design analysis and optimization, this thesis research seeks to develop a general method based on distributed source models to characterize M-DOF PM-based actuators and optimize their designs to achieve high torque-to-weight performance with compact structures To achieve the above stated objective, a new method that is referred to here as distributed multi-level current (DMC) utilizes geometrically defined point sources has been developed to model electromagnetic components and phenomena, which include PMs, electromagnets (EMs), <b>iron</b> <b>paths</b> and induced eddy current. Unlike existing numerical methods (such as FEM, FDM, or MLM) which solve for the magnetic fields from Maxwell’s equations and boundary conditions, the DMC-based method develops closed-form solutions to the magnetic field and force problems {{on the basis of}} electromagnetic point currents in a multi-level structure while allowing trade-off between computational speed and accuracy. Since the multi-level currents can be directly defined at the geometrically decomposed volumes and surfaces of the components (such as electric conductors and magnetic materials) that make up of the electromagnetic system, the DMC model has been effectively incorporated in topology optimization to maximize the torque-to-weight ratio of an electromechanical actuator. To demonstrate the above advantages, the DMC optimization has been employed to optimize the several designs ranging from conventional single-axis actuators, 2 -DOF linear-rotary motors to 3 -DOF spherical motors. The DMC modeling method has been experimentally validated and compared against published data. While the DMC model offers an efficient means for the design analysis and optimization of electromechanical systems with improved computational accuracy and speed, it can be extended to a broad spectrum of emerging and creative applications involving electromagnetic systems.

25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft <b>iron</b> return <b>paths,</b> as shown in figure (C).|$|R

40|$|High intensity, {{high energy}} X-rays {{for use in}} protein crystallography, nano-machining and medical applications, such as non {{invasive}} coronary angiography, can be produced by a 1. 2 to 1. 5 GeV electron storage ring compact light source with 6 to 8 tesla superconducting bending magnets. Because the bending magnets are to be superconducting, the storage ring energy can be over factor of two lower than a conventional storage ring that delivers same photon energy. The ring, which has superconducting bending magnets, is smaller in circumference and {{has the advantage of}} having fewer particles in the ring for a given x ray source intensity. The proposed storage ring is a separated function accelerator ring with six superconducting bending magnet units. Conventional quadruples and correction elements would be located between the bending magnets. Because the synchrotron radiation is generated in the bend, the superconducting bending magnets must have a warm vacuum chamber for the electron beam. Variations of a superferric magnet design have been studied for this application. This report presents a superferric H magnet design that can produce good quality magnetic field in a region that is 50 mm high by 100 mm wide. This modified superferric H magnet design has saturated iron poles but the magnetic flux is returned from one pole to the other through an unsaturated <b>iron</b> return <b>path.</b> The dipole magnet required for a compact storage ring must be physically short (380 mm long), and the field must fall off rapidly at the ends of the magnet.

40|$|Planar magnet-coil {{actuators}} {{are used}} in many different MEMS devices. This report describes one way to improve the actuator range per current input of planar coil actuators. This is accomplished by adding a flux channel around and beneath the actuator's magnet. The Lorentz force is created by putting a current carrying planar coil over a magnet in an actuator assembly. The Lorentz force depends on the current vector and the magnetic field vector. In this thesis the Lorentz force is altered by changing the direction and concentration of the magnetic field. Magnetic fields may be modeled as flux lines traveling from the north face of the magnet to the south face along the least resistant <b>path.</b> <b>Iron</b> is a magnetic material with 4000 times the magnetic permeability of air, so when iron is placed in a magnetic field, {{the majority of the}} magnetic flux will travel from North to South through the iron. This "channel" alters the way the magnetic field would normally travel given the bare magnet. The magnetic flux that travels through the channel depends in part upon the channel geometry. The result of varying the width of this channel is modeled and tested in this work. The physical principle was examined in simulations by varying channel width and then extracting the corresponding actuator output. A relationship was fit to the simulated results. (cont.) The actuator output augmentation was maximized at a critical width and remained steady thereafter. Beyond the critical width, the addition of the flux channel was able to produce more than 45 % increase in the actuator force. Experimental results showed less than a 5 % difference from the simulated results. by Jacob Bourgeois. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Hahajima {{represents}} an Eocene forearc volcanic centre produced during {{the initiation of}} subduction within an intra-oceanic domain of the western Pacific. The Eocene-Oligocene Izu-Bonin arc-forearc is envisaged as a broad region of volcanism generated in an extensional tectonic regime. The forearc {{is likely to have}} consisted of a series of small rift basins, punctuated and bordered by coherent volcanic edifices. Hahajima represents one such edifice at the southern termination of the Chichijima-Mukojima rift basin. Major element, trace element and isotopic data are presented for representative volcanic rocks from Hahajima. The volcanic sequence comprises porphyritic basalt and andesite breccias and flows intercalated with tuffaceous sandstones. All lavas contain high proportions of plagioclase phenocrysts (20 - 36 %) and comparatively low mafic mineral contents. The andesite suite is typified by the presence of magnetite and orthopyroxene phenocrysts and pseudomorphs after olivine. Basalts are dominated by an assemblage of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and olivine. Nodules and xenocrysts typical of the andesites are found in the basalts and vice versa, suggesting an intimate relationship between the two magmas during volcanism. The basaltic suite follows a tholeiitic fractionation <b>path</b> (<b>iron</b> enrichment) while the andesites are more representative of calc-alkaline magma evolution. These trends are found to be clearer when corrections are made for the excess proportions of plagioclase in the whole rock. Trace element differences between the suites can not be reconciled by a straightforward crystallization model, but can be related to a similar parental magma if the shallow level magma evolution involves a combination of open and closed system fractionation processes. Comparisons of volcanic suites within and between each site sampled along the Izu-Bonin forearc indicate that each eruptive centre has an individual trace element signature. This suggests that variations within each site can be explained by melting and/or shallow-level fractionation processes, while differences between localities are related to heterogeneities in the composition, trace element and isotopic enrichment, and thermal characteristics of the source. The Hahajima volcanic rocks contrast with the more recent arc magmas of the Izu-Bonin system in that they share some features, such as high-Mg and elevated Zr/Y, with the contemporaneous boninitic lavas...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a series}} of geoenvironmental studies on the {{mobilization}} and fate of selenium (Se) and other potentially toxic trace elements in southeast Idaho phosphate mining areas, trace element concentrations (mg kg 1 dry mass) in plant samples collected along transects at the Wooley Valley Unit 1, 3, and 4 waste-rock dumps were compared with samples collected from undisturbed sites at Dairy Syncline, Deer Creek, Dry Valley, Maybe Canyon, and Rasmussen Ridge. Additionally, trace-element concentrations in veg- etation samples collected from wetlands associated with mine waste-rock piles were compared with samples collected from a single reference wetland. In undisturbed areas, Se in vegetation growing in soils overlying and derived from Phosphoria Formation phosphatic rocks tended to be higher than vegetation in undisturbed Wells Limestone or Rex Chert soils. Vegetation growing in highly disturbed soils, such as those comprising waste-rock dumps, had the highest tissue Se. Vegetation in a wetland at the base of Wooley Valley Unit 4 waste-rock dump accumulated decreasing concentrations of Se with increasing distance away from the waste-rock dump along the wetland flow <b>path.</b> <b>Iron</b> oxides were observed coating wetland sediment surfaces and helped control Se bioavailability. Plant uptake, as well as coprecipitation and sorption of Se by iron oxides, were key processes in the natural attenuation of Se in this wetland. Legumes at the rock dumps contained higher Se (mean = 80 mg kg- 1) than trees (mean = 52 mgkg 1), grasses (mean = 18 mgkg 1), shrubs (mean = 6 mgkg 1), and forbs (mean = 3 mg kg- 1). However, grasses were among the highest Se accumulators among plant lifeforms in contaminated wetlands, with a mean value of 53 mg kg 1 Se. In most places, uptake of Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, and Zn was below critical high levels for plants. However, Se, Cd, Cr, and Zn uptake by some plants may have been large enough to affect their growth. Several plant lifeforms had Se concentrations that surpassed the acute and chronic toxicity thresholds for grazing livestock and wildlife, posing a lethal risk to these animals. Forages, particularly legumes, sampled from waste-rock dumps had increased Mo concentrations, resulting in Cu/Mo ratios below 1. High Mo (above 10 mg kg 1) and Cu/Mo ratios below 2 may cause molybdenosis in ruminants. There were instances where tree Zn content exceeded upper chronic intake for livestock/wildlife. This may pose some concern for browsing animals feeding upon trees, particularly in winter months. Based on the vegetation survey, possible remediation strategies via physical, chemical, and biologi- cal manipulations of the contaminated sites include removal of the most contaminated soils, capping contaminated soils and revegetating capping materials, application of selec- tive herbicides to remove legumes from reclaimed waste-rock dumps, and fencing some contaminated areas to better manage grazing...|$|R
