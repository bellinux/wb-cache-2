The analysis finds evidence of significant inefficiencies in Croatia''s <b>spending</b> on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and education, related to inadequate cost recovery, weaknesses in the financing mechanisms and institutional arrangements, weak competition {{in the provision of}} these services, and weaknesses in targeting public subsidies on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and education. These inefficiencies suggest that government spending on health and education could be reduced without undue sacrifices in the quality of these services. The paper identifies ways to do that.

25|$|Hepatitis B {{accounts}} for a much larger percentage of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> in endemic regions like Asia. In 1997 it accounted for 3.2% of South Korea's total health care expenditures and resulted in $696 million in direct costs. A large majority of that sum was spent on treating disease symptoms and complications. Chronic hepatitis B infections are not as endemic in the United States, but accounted for $357 million in hospitalization costs in the year 1990. That number grew to $1.5 billion in 2003, but remained stable as of 2006, which may be attributable {{to the introduction of}} effective drug therapies and vaccination campaigns.|$|E

25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place.

25|$|The {{issue of}} the health of {{immigrants}} and the associated cost to the public has been largely discussed. On average, per capita <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>spending</b> is lower for immigrants {{than it is for}} native-born Americans. The non-emergency use of emergency rooms ostensibly indicates an incapacity to pay, yet some studies allege disproportionately lower access to unpaid health care by immigrants. For this and other reasons, there have been various disputes about how much immigration is costing the United States public health system. University of Maryland economist and Cato Institute scholar Julian Lincoln Simon concluded in 1995 that while immigrants probably pay more into the health system than they take out, {{this is not the case}} for elderly immigrants and refugees, who are more dependent on public services for survival.|$|E

40|$|Several recent {{proposals}} have advocated using {{the income tax}} system to collect user fees to help fund the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. While there is {{a considerable amount of}} research investigating both how individuals respond to tax incentives for employer provided health insurance and on the effects of user fees payable at the point of service on the use of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services, there is limited evidence on how individuals respond to tax incentives when these are not realized until taxes are paid. This paper uses existing exemptions in the Canadian tax code that allow individuals to deduct the cost of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> or <b>health</b> insurance from their taxable income in order to identify the tax price elasticity of demand for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> when price changes are realized {{at the end of the}} tax year. Our results suggest that despite not realizing the tax benefit at the time of purchase, individuals are quite responsive to changes in the tax price of <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Our elasticity estimates for a wide range of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> products are well within the range of traditional price elasticity estimates, including in particular our estimates for prescription drugs. We also find some evidence that suggests individuals trade off risk sharing through traditional insurance companies with risk sharing through the tax code. That is, as the tax price of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> decreases, individuals <b>spend</b> more on <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> but <b>spend</b> less on health insurance. ...|$|R
