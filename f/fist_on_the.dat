25|$|I {{think that}} in some quarters, {{many parts of the}} country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because we have {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a <b>fist</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{is usually a}} high quality hard stone, and far less frequently deerhorn, soapstone, or jade. It's sometimes carved by machine. When it's carved by hand, an intō ("seal-engraving blade"), a mirror, and a small specialized wooden vice are used. An intō is a flat-bladed pencil-sized chisel, usually round or octagonal in cross-section and sometimes wrapped in string to give the handle a non-slip surface. The intō is held vertically in one hand, with the point projecting from one's <b>fist</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side opposite one's thumb. New, modern intō {{range in price from}} less than US$1 to US$100.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{return to}} Germany, Gröning {{lived with his}} father-in-law. At the dinner table, they once made [...] "a silly remark about Auschwitz", {{implying}} {{that he was a}} [...] "potential or real murderer," [...] which Gröning said enraged him, banging his <b>fist</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, demanding: [...] "This word and this connection are never, ever, to be mentioned again in my presence, otherwise I'll move out!" [...] Gröning said that this request was respected.|$|E
2500|$|Päts {{founded the}} Estonian Defence League to provide defence for the {{advancing}} Red Army. On 28November 1918, Soviet Russian forces captured Narva, which resulted the Estonian War of Independence. During a government meeting, Konstantin Päts banged his <b>fist</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table {{and refused to}} compromise with the communists. This persuaded other government members to start a war against Soviet Russia. In January 1919, Estonians forced the Bolsheviks to retreat and by 24February 1919, the entire Estonian territory was {{under the control of}} the Provisional Government. In his speech at the 1919 Independence Day parade, he said: [...] "We have to secure our economy so we could become less dependent from our allies. In order to avoid bankruptcy, we have to found our state on agriculture". This became the basis for the Estonian economy for the next 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|French {{at first}} {{reported}} to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their [...] "last card" [...] and the BEF were holding them off. [...] He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps [...] "might go during the night", {{although he did}} send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French [...] "believed what he wished to believe" [...] and [...] "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp". [...] He thought [...] "everything was going splendidly" [...] and [...] "the Germans were exhausted" [...] until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his <b>fist</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table shouting [...] "How {{do you expect me}} to carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly Mrs. Chailey, {{turning from}} the subject of sheets, dismissing them entirely, clenched her <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of them, and proclaimed, [...] "And you couldn't ask a living {{creature}} to sit where I sit!" ...|$|R
60|$|Dick was {{interested}} in <b>the</b> work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> punching bag, and he walked closer to note what Lew Flapp was doing. Clap! clap! clap! went Flapp's <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bag, which bounced {{back and forth with}} great rapidity.|$|R
5000|$|Reference {{is made in}} Victor Hugo's Les Miserables: “Dupuytren and Recamier {{entered into}} a quarrel in the amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and {{threatened}} each other with their <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Over the years, Susan Lucci {{became known}} for gaining Daytime Emmy Award {{nominations}} for her portrayal of Erica, but never winning. Almost {{every year from}} 1978 to 1998, Lucci received nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama series and never won. Her negative reactions to the losses, including pounding her <b>fist</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and leaving one ceremony in tears, were mentioned in tabloids. Her losses also caused her fellow castmate Ruth Warrick to speak out to the press. In 1983, when Lucci lost to All My Children newcomer Dorothy Lyman (Opal), Warrick said, [...] "It seemed impossible that Susan wouldn't win this year. We are all very puzzled, amazed, and disgruntled." [...] She later added, [...] "It was {{a slap in the}} face to Susan that Dorothy should walk off with it after being on the show such a short time. And of course her role was so outrageous and so, well, it was a caricature. That's not in any way to put down what Dorothy did, but it really was a supporting role rather than a leading role." [...] The losing streak became a [...] "long-running gag" [...] in the entertainment community. Jay Leno on The Tonight Show used it as a joke as did Saturday Night Live. The author of The Emmy, Tom O'Neil, attributed the losses to the material she submitted for consideration. [...] "In the episodes she sent in last year, she was crying 75 percent of the time," [...] he said. [...] "She drowned her chances in a tsunami of tears. Lucci eventually won the Daytime Emmy Award in 1999, receiving a two-minute standing ovation at the win and again after the show in the press room. A reporter in the press room questioned whether she would miss the attention she got for losing, to which Lucci responded, [...] "Oh, not for a minute. Winning is definitely better." [...] The entries Lucci submitted for the 1999 Daytime Emmy Awards involved scenes from Erica's storyline where she helps Bianca deal with her anorexia.|$|E

6000|$|The {{magazine}} writer discussed {{theories of}} government; these men the practice. They had been there. They {{knew all about}} it. They banged their <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and spoke of political [...] "pulls," [...] the vending of votes, and so forth. Theirs was not the talk of village babblers reconstructing {{the affairs of the}} nation, but of strong, coarse, lustful men fighting for spoil, and thoroughly understanding the best methods of reaching it.|$|R

60|$|She refused him for {{the second}} time but with a {{weakening}} certainty in a little white summer-house that gave a glimpse of the sea between green and wooded hills. She sat and stared at the sea after he had left her, through a mist of tears; so pitiful did he seem. He had beaten his poor <b>fists</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone table and then caught up her hand, kissed it and rushed out.... She had not dreamt that love could hurt like that.|$|R
50|$|A {{straight}} punch executed from a front stance (zenkutsu-dachi) {{is called}} gyaku-tsuki (reverse punch) if the advanced leg and <b>fist</b> are <b>on</b> opposite sides, or oi-tsuki (forward punch or lunge punch) if the leg and <b>fist</b> are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same side.|$|R
50|$|Çelebi-Gottschlich {{migrated}} to Berlin from Turkey in 1970 {{at the age}} of 17.
