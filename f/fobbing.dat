5|$|The {{revolt of}} 1381 {{broke out in}} Essex, {{following}} the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May. Bampton {{was a member of}} Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles. He based himself in Brentwood and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, <b>Fobbing</b> and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June. The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks. Bampton first interrogated the people of <b>Fobbing,</b> whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would be forthcoming. When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out. Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed. Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.|$|E
500|$|Michael Deacon of The Daily Telegraph reacted {{positively}} {{towards the}} series, stating [...] "episode one was enjoyably sinister. It was also, once or twice, quite amusing, in (of course) a blokey way." [...] Deacon liked {{the beginning of}} the pilot where the main characters record a video message, stating [...] "this is what Mad Dogs did well – like any competent suspense thriller, it made you ask questions throughout. The episode bubbled with foreboding, right up to the cliffhanger." [...] Deacon also noted at the cliffhanger that [...] "the most disturbing sight wasn't the shower of blood but the gunman's rubber mask, which was of a grinning Tony Blair." [...] John Crace of The Guardian was more mixed, starting [...] "after unsuccessfully <b>fobbing</b> us off with endless series of Ross Kemp looking macho, Sky is now throwing serious money at getting viewers to watch something other than sport." [...] Crace was critical of the set up of the episode, stating [...] "I'm all for allowing a drama time to breathe but we didn't really need a whole hour just to establish that Alvo was a bit dodgy and that the four others had complications in their lives. Rather than building menace, the snail-like pace dissipated it," [...] However, he reacted positively towards the end, as [...] "things did eventually look up," [...] adding [...] "there's hope for Mad Dogs yet." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seems that}} some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some {{one of the}} Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and {{beaching}} a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow {{under the jurisdiction of}} a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in <b>fobbing</b> his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same <b>fobbing</b> of them.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have one}} remark more before I leave this damp {{part of the}} world, and which I cannot omit on the women's account, namely, that I took notice of a strange decay of the sex here; insomuch that all along this country it was very {{frequent}} to meet with men that had had from five or six to fourteen or fifteen wives; nay, and some more. And I was informed that in the marshes {{on the other side}} of the river over against Candy Island there was a farmer who was then living with the five-and-twentieth wife, and that his son, who was but about thirty-five years old, had already had about fourteen. Indeed, this part of the story I only had by report, though from good hands too; but the other is well known and easy to be inquired into about <b>Fobbing,</b> Curringham, Thundersly, Benfleet, Prittlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Cricksea, Burnham, Dengy, and other towns of the like situation. The reason, as a merry fellow told me, who said he had had about a dozen and a half of wives (though I found afterwards he fibbed a little) was this: That they being bred in the marshes themselves and seasoned to the place, did pretty well with it; but that they always went up into the hilly country, or, to speak their own language, into the uplands for a wife. That when they took the young lasses out of the wholesome and fresh air they were healthy, fresh, and clear, and well; but when they came out of their native air into the marshes among the fogs and damps, there they presently changed their complexion, got an ague or two, and seldom held it above half a year, or a year at most; [...] "And then," [...] said he, [...] "we go to the uplands again and fetch another;" [...] so that marrying of wives was reckoned a kind of good farm to them. It is true the fellow told this in a kind of drollery and mirth; but the fact, for all that, is certainly true; and that they have abundance of wives by that very means. Nor is it less true that the inhabitants in these places do not hold it out, as in other countries, and as first you seldom meet with very ancient people among the poor, as in other places we do, so, take it one with another, not one-half of the inhabitants are natives of the place; but such as from other countries or in other parts of this country settle here for the advantage of good farms; for which I appeal to any impartial inquiry, having myself examined into it critically in several places.|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} Chr 15 {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) <b>Fob</b> 3 b in lines of mice selected for high (Fat line) and low (Lean line) body fat content that represent an unique model of polygenic obesity. Here we genetically dissected the <b>Fob</b> 3 b interval by analyzing the phenotypes of eight overlapping congenic lines and four F[down] 2 congenic intercrosses and prioritized candidates by bioinformatics approaches. Analyses revealed that the <b>Fob</b> 3 b QTL consists {{of at least two}} separate linked QTLs <b>Fob</b> 3 b 1 and <b>Fob</b> 3 b 2. They exhibit additive inheritance and are linked in coupling with alleles originating from the Lean line, decreasing obesity-related traits. In further analyses, we focused on <b>Fob</b> 3 b 1 because it had a larger effect on obesity-related traits than <b>Fob</b> 3 b 2. e. g., the difference between homozygotes for adiposity index (ADI) percentage was 1. 22 and 0. 77 % for <b>Fob</b> 3 b 2, respectively. A set of bioinformatics tools was used to narrow down positional candidates from 85 to 4 high-priority <b>Fob</b> 3 b 1 candidates. A previous single <b>Fob</b> 3 b QTL was therefore resolved into another two closely linked QTLs, confirming the fractal nature of QTLs mapped at low resolution. The interval of the original <b>Fob</b> 3 b QTL was narrowed from 22. 39 to 4. 98 Mbp for <b>Fob</b> 3 b 1 and to 7. 68 Mbp for <b>Fob</b> 3 b 2, which excluded the previously assigned candidate squalene epoxidase (Sqle) as the causal gene because it maps proximal to refined <b>Fob</b> 3 b 1 and <b>Fob</b> 3 b 2 intervals. A high-resolution map along with prioritization of <b>Fob</b> 3 b 1 candidates by bioinformatics represents an important step foward to final identification of the Chr 15 obesity QTL...|$|R
40|$|Objective : The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the results of virtual {{bronchoscopy}} (VB) images in defining tracheobronchial pathologies with those of fiber-optic bronchoscopy (<b>FOB)</b> in patients with clinical indication for bronchoscopy. Methods : Twenty-two patients with bronchoscopy indication were evaluated with <b>FOB</b> and VB. The VB results were evaluated blindly, independent of the <b>FOB</b> results. Results : In 19 of the 22 patients, tracheobronchial abnormalities were present on <b>FOB,</b> whereas 3 patients had normal findings on <b>FOB.</b> In 17 of 19 patients, VB demonstrated the <b>FOB</b> diagnosis of tracheobronchial abnormality. While <b>FOB</b> detected 11 endoluminal lesions, VB detected 6. While <b>FOB</b> detected 20 obstructive lesions, VB detected 26. In evaluating external compression, <b>FOB</b> detected 2 lesions and VB detected 15. Conclusions : VB is a non-invasive, uncomplicated, and reproducible examination method in patients with an indication for thorax examination. Virtual bronchoscopy could find a clinically broader field of application in the future...|$|R

40|$|AIM: Evaluate {{the role}} of {{positron}} emission tomography (PET), fiberopticbronchoscopy (<b>FOB)</b> and PET+FOB in the diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN). METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 58 patients (6 were excluded) with SPNwho underwent PET and <b>FOB</b> for lesion differentiation. <b>FOB</b> included transbronchial pulmonary biopsy (TBB), trans-bronchial pulmonary needle aspiration (TBNAp) and bronchial washing (BW). PET was positive when the standardized uptake value was ≥ 2. 5, and <b>FOB</b> and the PET and <b>FOB</b> combination was positive when at least TBB, TBNA or BW was positive. The results were confirmed through histology after surgery or clinical follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV of PET, <b>FOB</b> and PET+FOB were calculated. RESULTS: Out of 52 patients, PET, <b>FOB</b> and PET+FOB resulted a true positive (TP) in 42, 20 and 42 cases, respectively, true negative (TN) in 6, 7 and 6 cases, false positive (FP) in 1, 0 and 1 cases, and false negative (FN) in 5, 25 and 3 cases. PET was FP in 1 TN <b>FOB</b> case and FN in 2 TP <b>FOB</b> cases. <b>FOB</b> was FN in 25 cases; 22 out of 25 were TP PET.

30|$|Conclusion Performing <b>FOB</b> under NIV in hypoxemic ARF {{patients}} {{seems to}} be associated with an increased risk of intubation as compared to <b>FOB</b> with O 2, but without increase in their ICU mortality.

Finally, the choice to perform <b>FOB</b> under NIV by the clinician appears to be guided by this severity.|$|R
