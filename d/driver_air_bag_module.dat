40|$|An {{experimental}} study of <b>driver</b> side <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> loads for out-of-position (OOP) occupants at the ISO- 1 (chin on bag) position was performed using the 50 th per-centile THOR-NT dummy. The main objective was to observe {{the response of the}} dummy under expo-sures to various types of <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Dummy sensitivity to the <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> was evaluated in terms of upper neck loads and head acceleration. Five types of late-model fleet <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> <b>modules</b> were used in a total of ten tests (two repeat tests per <b>air</b> <b>bag).</b> Sealed tank tests were also performed to characterize the five different <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> inflators. For one bag, the THOR-NT produced very repeatable measurements. For other bag types, the THOR-NT exposed the variability of the <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> especially in its upper neck moment measurements. The high-speed videos confirmed the inflation vari-ability of those <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> The THOR-NT was able to segregate the moment at the head/neck pin joint (rep-resenting human occipital condyles) from the total head/neck cross-sectional moment. The THOR-NT performed smoothly throughout the test and was gen-erally user-friendly. A limitation is recognized that only two <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> for each model were used for repeat tests...|$|R

50|$|The G-Wagen was facelifted in 1990. In 1989, for the 10th {{anniversary of}} the G Model, a new model variant with {{permanent}} 4-wheel drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production began the following April. For 1992, a new sub-series for professional users began production. The civilian model began to offer cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and Burl Walnut wood interior trim. The same year, the 100,000th G Model was built in Graz. In 1994, the model line was officially renamed the G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a <b>driver’s</b> <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> became standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically controlled 5-speed unit. Headlamp washers, cruise control and a front passenger’s <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> were added.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study is to understand the mass limits of typical instrument panel (IP) components given standard design guidelines for head injury risk reduction. The IP components of passenger vehicles are continually changing to increase features and quality. Consequently, these changes increase {{the mass of the}} IP components. It was hypothesized that, regardless of the mounting, certain IP components possess significant inertial resistance such that injury risk values may be above accepted risk levels without modification to their internal structures. Using the FMVSS 201 test procedure, multiple IP components from several vehicles (n= 6) were tested for head injury risk both in-vehicle and as isolated suspended systems. The isolated components were tested using a simple pendulum setup with the component properly oriented and suspended from 2 m cables. The component then was impacted with a 6. 8 kg linear head impactor at a velocity of 19. 0 km/h. Initial results showed that in an isolated state, the injury values, both peak and 3 ms clip deceleration, correspond to as much as 93 % of the in-vehicle tested values. From the component and in-vehicle tests, work functions based on the component mass were developed to replicate the impact event and establish mass-based thresholds. Models studied included waveforms comprised of haversine, half-sine, triangular, trapezoidal and square functions. A simple spring-mass model was also used to characterize the impact event. Initial assessment of the model showed the energy associated with an impact to a typical 4. 5 kg tuner assembly is great enough to potentially exceed the acceptable injury risk values according to Federal regulations. Furthermore, integrated structures such as <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> <b>modules</b> have a lower mass threshold due to their internal stiffness and interaction with the IP. Based on these thresholds, some design guidelines to improve the crush characteristics of structures such as tuners, HVAC controllers, and <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> <b>modules</b> are presented...|$|R

50|$|In {{common with}} other car manufacturers, the early 1990s saw Vauxhall {{featuring}} safety as a selling point, {{and beginning to}} incorporate many new safety features into cheaper family cars that were previously only found on expensive luxury saloons. The Mark 3 Astra {{was one of the}} first such cars, being introduced ahead of the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Mondeo, two other cars with a similar new-found focus on safety. So, the Mark 3 saw the introduction of twin side impact bars, a toughened safety cage, a safely-designed steering wheel (with collapsible columns) and 'body-lock' mechanical front seat-belt pre-tensioners. After the first face-lift full-size <b>drivers</b> <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> became optional or standard (depending on the model).

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the dynamic injury tolerance {{of the male}} forearm, derived from dynamic three-point bending tests using ten male cadaver upper extremities. The impact loading conditions were chosen to be representative of those observed during upper extremity interaction with frontal <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Using matched forearm pairs, {{it was determined that}} the forearm is signicantly (p= 0. 01) stronger in the supinated position, 126 ± 13 N m, than in the pronated position, 108 ± 8 N m. Two distinct fracture patterns were seen for the pronated and supinated groups. In the supinated position the average diVerence in fracture time between the radius and ulna was not signicantly diVerent (p= 0. 24); however, the pronated tests yielded an average diVerence in fracture time that was signicantly diVerent (p= 0. 05), with the ulna breaking before the radius in every test. This trend implies that in the pronated position the ulna and radius are loaded independently, while in the supinated position the ulna and radius are loaded together as a combined structure. To produce a conservative injury criterion, only the data from the pronated tests were included for an average failure tolerance of 108 N m.

5000|$|Airbags {{were first}} {{installed}} in production vehicles in the 1980s as standard equipment instead of an option as {{was done in the}} mid 1970s (such as the Oldsmobile Toronado in 1974). In 1981, airbags were an available option on the [...] Mercedes-Benz W126 (S-Class). In 1987, the Porsche 944 Turbo became the first car to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment, and airbags were offered as an available option on the 944 and 944S. The first airbag was also installed in a Japanese car, the Honda Legend, in 1987. In 1988, Chrysler was the first United States company to install standard <b>driver's</b> side <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> in six of its passenger models.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{analysis}} provided effectiveness {{estimates of}} the driver-side <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> while controlling for severity of the crash and other potential confounders. METHODS: Data were from the National Automotive Sampling System (1993 - 1996). Injury severity was described {{on the basis of}} the Abbreviated Injury Scale, Injury Severity Score, Functional Capacity Index, and survival. Ordinal, linear, and logistic multivariate regression methods were used. RESULTS: <b>Air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment in frontal or near-frontal crashes decreases the probability of having severe and fatal injuries (e. g., Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 4 - 6), including those causing a long-lasting high degree of functional limitation. However, <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment in low-severity crashes increases the probability that a driver (particularly a woman) will sustain injuries of Abbreviated Injury Scale level 1 to 3. <b>Air</b> <b>bag</b> deployment exerts a net injurious effect in low-severity crashes and a net protective effect in high-severity crashes. The level of crash severity at which <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> are protective is higher for female than for male <b>drivers.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Air</b> <b>bag</b> improvement should minimize the injuries induced by their deployment. One possibility is to raise their deployment level so that they deploy only in more severe crashes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dynamic injury tolerances {{for the female}} humerus and forearm derived from dynamic 3 -point bending tests using 22 female cadaver upper extremities. Twelve female humeri were tested at an average strain rate of 3. 7 ± 1. 3 %/s. The strain rates were chosen to be representative of those observed during upper extremity interaction with frontal and side airbags. The average moment to failure when mass scaled for the 5 th centile female was 128 ± 19 Nm. Using data from the in situ strain gauges during the drop tests and geometric properties obtained from pretest CT scans, an average dynamic elastic modulus for the female humerus {{was found to be}} 24. 4 ± 3. 9 GPa. The injury tolerance for the forearm was determined from 10 female forearms tested at an average strain rate of 3. 94 ± 2. 0 %/s. Using 3 matched forearm pairs, it was determined that the forearm is 21 % stronger in the supinated position (92 ± 5 Nm) versus the pronated position (75 ± 7 Nm). Two distinct fracture patterns were seen for the pronated and supinated groups. In the supinated position the average difference in fracture time between the radius and ulna was a negligible 0. 4 ± 0. 3 ms. However, the pronated tests yielded an average difference in fracture time of 3. 6 ± 1. 2 ms, with the ulna breaking before the radius in every test. This trend implies that in the pronated position, the ulna and radius are loaded independently, while in the supinated position the ulna and radius are loaded together as a combined structure. To produce a conservative injury criterion, a total of 7 female forearms were tested in the pronated position, which resulted in the forearm injury criterion of 58 ± 12 Nm when scaled for the 5 th centile female.

40|$|Side <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> a {{relatively}} new technology {{designed to protect the}} head and/or torso in side-impact collisions, are becoming increasingly common in automobiles. Their efficacy in preventing US driver deaths among cars struck on the near (driver’s) side was examined using data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the General Estimates System. Risk ratios for driver death per nearside collision during 1999 – 2001 were computed for head/torso and torso-only side <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> in cars from model years 1997 – 2002, relative to cars without side <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Confounding was addressed by adjusting nearside risk ratios for front- and rear-impact mortality, which is unaffected by side <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Risk ratios were 0. 55 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 43, 0. 71) for head/torso <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> and 0. 89 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 79, 1. 01) for torso-only <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Risk was reduced when cars with head/ torso <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> were struck by cars/minivans (significant) or pickup trucks/sport utility vehicles (nonsignificant).
