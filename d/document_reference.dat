40|$|This paper studies {{temporal}} locality characteristics {{present in}} <b>document</b> <b>referencing</b> behavior at Web proxies, {{and the impact}} of this temporal locality on document caching. First, drift measures are developed to characterize how the popularity profile of "hot" documents changes on a day-to-day basis. Experiments show that although there is considerable "hot set" drift, there is also a significant number of documents that have long-term popularity. Second, a measure of short-term temporal locality is developed that characterizes the relationship between recent past and near future <b>document</b> <b>references.</b> Using this measure, it is established that temporal locality arising out of the correlations between <b>document</b> <b>references</b> in the recent past and near future does exist for popular documents. Another objective {{of this paper is to}} determine whether or not Web <b>document</b> <b>references</b> at proxy caches can be modeled as independent and identically distributed random events.

5000|$|The {{history of}} the procurator fiscal is {{similarly}} difficult to set down with exactness, though the role has developed significantly over time. The first <b>document</b> <b>reference</b> appears in the Records of the Parliament of Scotland for 22 August 1584, naming several procurators fiscal in Edinburgh. The fiscal was an officer appointed by, and accountable to, the Sheriff, who by the 18th Century was responsible for most prosecutions in local areas. By the nineteenth century advocates depute were first appointed, to assist him in conducting cases in the High Court of Justiciary and the Crown Office was first established. This became {{the centre of the}} prosecution system, and it was to the Lord Advocate now to whom the procurators fiscal were responsible, evidenced by the [...] "Book of Regulations" [...] issued by him to procurators fiscal providing instructions about how to conduct their business. The Book of Regulations is still used today in providing the framework for local prosecution in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of some extra details recorded on death certificates since 1969, the information given on certificates of birth, marriage and death has not changed since 1837, but {{the amount of information}} given in the index volumes has increased from time to time. Up until 1983, the copies received by the Registrar General were bound into volumes and three separate alphabetical indexes were prepared on a quarterly basis. The number of volumes depends on the number of people registered in each quarter. Thus there may be 10 volumes for some quarters - Vol.1 A-B, Vol.2 C-D, Vol.3 E-G and so on. From their inception, the alphabetical indexes give the surname, the forenames if registered, the registration district and the volume and the page on which the entry may be found. These details enable the appropriate record to be located. Before 1866, the indexes were written by hand on heavy parchment, though some have been replaced by printed copies. From 1984, the indexes are in annual instead of quarterly volumes from 1984. The indexes from 1984 give the month of registration as the first and second digits in the <b>document</b> <b>reference</b> number. The next two digits give the year. Thus the reference number 0485 9 2128 refers to an event registered in April 1985. From 1860 the GRO death index specifies an age of death and from 1911 the birth index also specifies the maiden name of a child's mother.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, two-layer {{approaches}} that integrate information from social networks into link-based measures on <b>document</b> <b>reference</b> networks {{such as the}} web, scientific publications or wikis gained much attention. In this paper, we extend the framework presented in [1] {{in order to achieve}} a stronger personalization of the document recommendations. Therefore, we investigate alternative approaches for bringing trust data from an author trust network “down ” to the <b>document</b> <b>reference</b> network and discuss how they can be combined in a comprehensive personalization strategy. In a simulation study, we show the effects of our personalization approach on document recommendations. Moreover, we discuss how the framework presented can be realized in practice. ...|$|E
