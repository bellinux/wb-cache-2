40|$|In {{the past}} 5 years Rhinology has evolved {{to a high}} impact Journal in Otorhinolaryngology with a {{citation}} index of. 2. 182. The result is an enormous {{increase in the number}} of papers send to the journal for review. In 2010 we expect to reach over 300 manuscripts that are send to the Journal. This forces us to some important decisions about the future of the Journal. One of those decision has been taken. Last year we published 10 case reports with subjects ranging from Nasal reconstruction in advanced sinunasal sarcoidosis, to Bilateral allergic fungal rhinosinusitis caused by Schizophillum commune and Aspergillus niger and A Pott`s puffy tumour as a late complication of a frontal sinus reconstruction (1 - 3). This year we published the last case reports we had in stock and in this issue of the Journal we publish the last case report (4). But that will not be enough. More fundamental choices have to be made. To guide the editorial team in the choices we have to make, we ask our readers to help us. On the website of Rhinology you can find a questionnaire. All readers of Rhinology are asked to fill in this questionnaire. We hope many of you will make the effort to go to the website and fill it in: www. rhinologyjournal. com/. The questionnaire contains questions on the sort of papers we want to read. The last 5 years we increased the number of papers with 50 % from around 60 papers I 2005 to around 90 papers in 2009. The increase in papers has mainly been in the clinical papers. The top cited papers in the last five years were mainly guidelines and position papers and reviews (5 - 9). In the last two years we did not publish this sort of papers and the case mix was totally different with subjects ranging from olfaction to foreign bodies and CRS with or without post nasal drip (10 - 14). We will ask you what sort of papers you are interested to read in the next years, clinical papers, surgical papers and/or basic research and on what subjects. The journal has become much thicker from 64 pages a few years ago to 80 - 128 pages now. This has resulted in a significant increase in the printing costs and next year we have to increase the subscription price. Of course the price of the journal has always been very low (74 euro) compared to other journals so we have some room for increase but how far do we want to go? Do you want a lot of space to publish your manuscripts which would mean that we have to increase the size of our Journal even further or are we aiming and even stricter selection and do we only offer you the very high quality papers? We would love to go to 6 issues to have more space and to reduce the time from acceptance to publishing but that would further increase the subscription rate. We will ask your opinion. Many of us read the Journal on the net. We can imagine that a number of people are interested in having an online subscription only. Also that question can be anwered in the questionnaire. A number of societies in Europe have a shared membership of the ERS and in some countries the Journal is send to all members of the otorhinolarynogolgy society with a grant from the pharmaceutical industry. If your rhinologic society is interested in a shared membership please let us know. In summary, Rhinology is a rising star. We are at a point that we have to decide how to proceed. We hope that you are willing to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionaire</b> on the Rhinology website to help us to make the right decisio...|$|E

Main Topics : Topics covered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionaire</b> include money management (making ends meet and keeping track of finances), forward planning, financial and product choices, mortgages, insurance and protection, savings, investments, credit cards, loans, financial advice and help, knowledge of money matters, and demographic information...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2000. This study {{investigated}} the attitudes of Grade One teachers <b>in</b> Pietermaritzburg to <b>the</b> training they have received on Outcomes Based Education (OBE). A questionaire {{was developed by the}} researcher from documentation used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> training that took the form of various workshop sessions. The study comprised 47 Grade One teachers drawn from 18 primary schools in Pietermaritzburg. This study attempted to determine the following issues: • The attitudes of Grade One teachers to the training they have received • Whether there were any significant differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attitudes of Grade One teachers from the various ex-Departments of Education to the training they have received on OBE A five point rating scale namely the Likert Scale was used to determine the attitudes of teachers. A descriptive analysis was initially employed to determine the percentagew:futeachers that strongly agreed, agreed, were uncertain, disagreed or strongly disagreed with <b>the</b> statements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionaire.</b> <b>The</b> results revealed that the majority of teachers agreed that the training had provided them with an understanding of various aspects of OBE. However, some teachers did state that they were uncertain on certain issues like the Foundation Phase policy document as well as the policy document on assessment, assessment itself and the compilation of portfolios and progress reports to be submittted to relevant persons. The area of resources was also highlighted as being problematic. Teachers disagreed that they were informed on how to use educational resources in accordance with OBE as well as where and how to obtain these resources. A descriptive analysis was also undertaken to determine what percentage of teachers from each eX-department felt about each statement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionaire.</b> Results revealed that only teachers from the ex-NED schools strongly agreed with most of the statements, whilst the highest percentage of teachers that were uncertain came from ex-DET schools. A statistical analysis was employed to determine whether significant differences existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attitudes ofteachers from the various ex-departments of education. The statistical report revealed that only four statements were significant namely the issue of the OBE assessment policy document, the Foundation Phase policy document, the compilation of Journals and progress records. Recommendations were made for further training in these areas as well as further research...|$|R
