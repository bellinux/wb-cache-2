5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E

The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is held; the parole board is easily convinced that Sideshow Bob {{is no longer a}} threat. When the Simpson family goes to the cinema, Sideshow Bob sits <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> acts obnoxiously. The Simpsons then realize that it was he who sent the letters, and Marge angrily tells him to stay away from Bart.|$|E
5|$|If one interprets each 1-cell in Rule 184 as {{containing}} a particle, these particles behave {{in many ways}} similarly to automobiles in a single lane of traffic: they move forward at a constant speed if there is open space <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> otherwise they stop. Traffic models such as Rule 184 and its generalizations that discretize both space and time are commonly called particle-hopping models. Although very primitive, the Rule 184 model of traffic flow already predicts some of the familiar emergent features of real traffic: clusters of freely moving cars separated by stretches of open road when traffic is light, and waves of stop-and-go traffic when it is heavy.|$|E

5|$|In Rotterdam, though {{reinforced}} by an infantry regiment, the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their bridgehead {{on the northern}} bank of the Maas. Despite permission from General Kurt Student, the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this bridgehead and the few German defenders held fast in a single office building, protected by a canal <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> covered by fire from the south bank. The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug. The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out, none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met with success.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 August, the weather was bad and Göring ordered a {{postponement}} of raids. However, the Dornier Do 17s of KG 2 were not informed and took off at 04:50 for their target. They were to meet with their escorts from ZG 26 over the Channel. ZG 26 received the cancellation order, but II., and III./KG 2 did not.kg 2 had formed up by 05:10, led by Geschwaderkommodore Johannes Fink. Part of the ZG 26 formation that had taken off—led by Oberstleutnant Joachim Huth—tried to warn the Dorniers of the cancellation. Unable to contact the bombers by radio, Huth tried to signal them by flying <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> performing aerobatics. Fink ignored him and flew on.kg 2 flew around the coast to his target, Eastchurch airfield on the Isle of Sheppey. Albert Kesselring had issued orders for bombers to abandon missions if their escorts did not show up, but Fink {{did not want to}} be accused on failing to obey orders and continued onward even though the Bf 110s turned back. The return leg would take KG 2 across No. 11 Group's territory, which could have been disastrous without fighter escort. But owing to the Observer Corps misjudging the direction of the bombers, owing to low-lying cloud, and the radar not picking up the direction of the German bombers, the WAAF plotted the course of the raid incorrectly and the RAF failed to prevent the target being attacked.|$|E

25|$|In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, {{ordered the}} {{execution}} of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabríz from Chihríq, so that he could be shot by a firing squad. On the morning of July 9, 1850, the Báb was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch. The Báb and a companion were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad prepared to shoot. After the order was given to shoot and the smoke cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. The soldiers subsequently found the Báb {{in another part of the}} barracks, completely unharmed. He was tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad was ranged <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.|$|E

25|$|With the {{simultaneous}} technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many {{often had to}} be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents {{that could not be}} kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to do an interpretation properly. Also, a number of interpreters were noted for protesting the idea of using vulgar language reflected in the proceeds, especially if it referenced Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.|$|E
25|$|The three moons {{mentioned}} above add new plasma into the magnetosphere. By far the strongest source is Enceladus, which ejects {{a fountain of}} water vapor, carbon dioxide and nitrogen through cracks in its south pole region. A fraction of this gas is ionized by the hot electrons and solar ultraviolet radiation and {{is added to the}} co-rotational plasma flow. Titan once was thought to be the principal source of plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere, especially of nitrogen. The new data obtained by Cassini in 2004–2008 established {{that it is not a}} significant source of nitrogen after all, although it may still provide significant amounts of hydrogen (due to dissociation of methane). Dione is the third moon producing more new plasma than it absorbs. The mass of plasma created in the vicinity of it (about 6g/s) is about 1/300 as much as near Enceladus. However, even this low value can not be explained only by sputtering of its icy surface by energetic particles, which may indicate that Dione is endogenically active like Enceladus. The moons that create new plasma slow the motion of the co-rotating plasma in their vicinity, which leads to the pile-up of the magnetic field lines <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> weakening of the field in their wakes—the field drapes around them. This is the opposite to what is observed for the plasma-absorbing moons.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 9, 1850, the Báb {{was taken to the}} {{courtyard}} of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of Christian soldiers prepared to shoot. Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result. The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall. There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb {{in another part of the}} barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary. He and Anis were tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad of Muslim soldiers was ranged <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were killed. In Bábí and Bahá'í tradition, the failure of the first firing squad to kill the Báb is believed to have been a miracle. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.|$|E

500|$|Another theory {{links the}} Rows with the debris {{left from the}} Roman {{occupation}} of Chester. [...] The rubble from the Roman buildings which had fallen into ruin was piled up alongside the streets. It is suggested that in the medieval period buildings were constructed {{along the top of}} this debris. [...] The buildings were set back from the street, a footpath passed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> wheeled vehicles passed along the street below. In time, the properties were improved and, possibly during the 13thcentury, cellars or undercrofts were excavated in the debris beneath them. [...] When the buildings were further improved, upper stories were built which overlapped the lower storey, providing a covered walkway. [...] Stalls or shelves were added on the street side of the walkway for the display of goods, and so the system of Rows was developed. In a few places, for example at the corner of Eastgate Street and Northgate Street, another building was constructed between the walkway and the street. [...] It is thought that, apart from {{a relatively small number of}} later buildings, the system of the Rows had reached its full extent by about 1350.|$|E
