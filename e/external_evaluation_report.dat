The aim of the inspections is to provide schools with information useful {{for the improvement of}} their work. The evaluation may comprise all or selected educational standards listed in the Regulation on pedagogical supervision. The participants of the inspection are students, teachers, principals, non-teaching staff, students’ parents, representatives of local authorities and school’s partners, mainly institutions from the local environment that cooperate with the school. The report that is created after the evaluation is supposed to provoke reflection on how educational processes in school are perceived by various subjects and actions that would help improve them.

However, when it comes to engineering degrees awarded in 2015, only 24 % of the Black recipients were women. A potential solution may be to introduce engineering to pre-college Black female students through extracurricular program. Being exposed to engineering education during the summer with the inclusion of mentors and/or role models has been well-documented as an avenue for increasing the enrollment and retention of Black women in engineering. ^ The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) has hosted the Summer Engineering Experience for Kids (SEEK) since 2007. As of 2015, over 15, 000 students between the third and twelfth grades had participated in the program. The 2015 SEEK <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> stated that the single-sex (SS) sites had higher scores for the academic outcomes and select interest outcomes in comparison to the coeducation (CoEd) sites. The purpose of this dissertation was to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between various outcomes for female participants at SS sites versus CoEd sites and determine if there is a relationship between the pre-post-assessment questions and the site type. ^ A quantitative analysis was conducted to answer three research questions related to female participant outcomes at both site types. The three areas of focus and research questions included (1) academic outcomes and perceptions of STEM knowledge, (2) interest outcomes and (3) perceptions of mentors. Independent t-tests, chi-square tests and descriptive statistics were used to investigate the potential influence of site types on female participants’ experiences within the SEEK program. The data was analyzed using Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) framework. ^ Results showed that female participants at SS sites had statistically significant differences in their favor for several of the outcomes, while females at CoEd sites had similar results but for a smaller number of outcomes. For perceptions of mentors, all five questions showed a trend of higher mean averages for SS sites, with two of the five showing differences that were statistically significant. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{perceptions}} of teachers who participated in the Satellite Education and Environmental Research (SEER) Program Water Project, a curriculum design course developed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The distance education course was a complex intervention which used the Nebraska Mathematics and Science Initiative 2 ̆ 7 s Model Program criteria for inquiry-based curriculum. Teachers formed communities of inquiry, experienced scientific inquiry processes, integrated different disciplines to create new thematic science curricula, and were encouraged to employ innovative pedagogical practices. National Science Education Standards and Nebraska Mathematics and Science Frameworks were consulted to develop important science process skills and concepts. Multicultural science education was addressed through investigation of local water issues. Teachers were encouraged to form community partnerships, supported with testing materials for conducting scientific research, and expected to use computer technology. ^ Grounded theory was used to examine interviews of 26 participants for their perceptions of the effects of the intervention on their teaching strategies. The self-reports were triangulated through the <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>report,</b> classroom artifacts, and a limited number of observations of classroom and field activities. Open coding was used to categorize the interview responses and to propose relationships among them. The central phenomenon that emerged from the axial and select coding was the changed focus: teaching science more thematically. Three theoretical propositions were posed to guide further inquiry: (1) teachers need opportunities and resources to experience science as an authentic, tenable, and realistic process if they are to develop curriculum and focus classroom activities on scientific inquiry; (2) autonomous learning communities must be fostered at downlink sites if distance learning experiences are to affect teachers 2 ̆ 7 practices; (3) teachers from homogeneous white communities are more willing to alter their practices if multicultural science education experiences with processes (learning to teach in a more functionally multicultural style) precede multicultural content (learning about contributions and perspectives various individuals and ethnic groups may have on science issues). ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The ‘Sponsoring National Processes for Evidence-Informed Policy Making in the Health Sector of Developing Countries’ {{program was}} {{launched}} by the Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research, WHO, in July 2008. The program aimed to catalyse the use of evidence generated through health policy and systems research in policymaking processes through (1) promoting researchers and policy advocates to present their evidence {{in a manner that}} is easy for policymakers to understand and use, (2) creating mechanisms to spur the demand for and application of research evidence in policymaking, and (3) increased interaction between researchers, policy advocates, and policymakers. Grants ran for three years and five projects were supported in Argentina, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Nigeria and Zambia. This paper seeks to understand why projects in some settings were perceived by the key stakeholders involved to have made progress towards their goals, whereas others were perceived to have not done so well. Additionally, by comparing experiences across five countries, we seek to illustrate general learnings to inform future evidence-to-policy efforts in low- and middle-income countries. Methods We adopted the theory of knowledge translation developed by Jacobson et al. (J Health Serv Res Policy 8 (2) : 94 – 9, 2003) as a framing device to reflect on project experiences across the five cases. Using data from the projects’ <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>reports,</b> which included information from semi-structured interviews and quantitative evaluation surveys of those involved in projects, and supplemented by information from the projects’ individual technical reports, we applied the theoretical framework with a partially grounded approach to analyse each of the cases and make comparisons. Results and conclusion There was wide variation across projects in the type of activities carried out as well as their intensity. Based on our findings, we can conclude that projects perceived as having made progress towards their goals were characterized by the coming together of a number of domains identified by the theory. The domains of Jacobson’s theoretical framework, initially developed for high-income settings, are of relevance to the low- and middle-income country context, but may need modification to be fully applicable to these settings. Specifically, the relative fragility of institutions and the concomitantly more significant role of individual leaders point to the need to look at leadership as an additional domain influencing the evidence-to-policy process...|$|R

Examined tender documentations contained serious drawbacks, namely incomplete and inexact definitions of expected outputs, missing list of required methods for the evaluation and also missing scale of statistical samples for the research. Quantitative tests also did not prove any dependence of estimated price of the evaluation stated by the tenderers on pre-defined cost-effective factor.

Under current law it is defined as "practical evaluation examination carried out at schools or institutions. " The evaluation is aimed at improving school performance and building a coherent policy development of the educational system, based on empirical experiences. Evaluation is a social study, comprises collecting and analysing information in the studied areas, and determining the level of school compliance with requirements defined in Polish law. After the evaluation, schools receive a report containing findings and conclusions of the evaluation and information about the level of compliance with state requirements. With respect to some the requirements, the determination of their compliance at the lowest level leads to the introduction of school rehabilitation programmes. All requirements, procedures, research tools, reports containing quantitative and processed qualitative data are publically available. <b>External</b> <b>evaluation</b> is carried out by a team of evaluation inspectors, and it is planned in consultation with the school headmaster. Subject to the evaluation are students, teachers, headmaster, non-teaching staff, parents, local government representatives and school partners. First, schools receive a preliminary <b>report</b> from the <b>evaluation.</b> During meetings with inspectors, school staff refer to the contents of the preliminary report, submit their comments on the report and work to improve the school performance. Inspectors do not formulate guidelines or recommendations, only conclusions. Upon completion of the evaluation process, the headmaster and teachers have the opportunity to comment on the examination progress in an anonymous survey (carried out on-line). This article aims at a re-definition of the adopted <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> approach. The study used data available at the beginning. What was analysed: a) <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> assumptions, under the existing legislation b) the interim <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> relating to the project whose main objective is to support the implementation of a new model of pedagogical supervision for the Polish education system ("Programme to strengthen the effectiveness of the pedagogical supervision and evaluation of school performance, stage III") and a report on the use of <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> by schools {{to improve the quality of}} work, c) materials associated with the project in progress (mainly conceptualisation of evaluation, examination procedures, training materials for inspectors) d) literature produced during the last three years, on <b>external</b> <b>evaluation</b> at Polish schools.
