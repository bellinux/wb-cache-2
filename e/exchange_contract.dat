50|$|During trial, Judge T. S. Ellis III {{ruled that}} the entire {{contract}} was susceptible to the False Claims Act, and not just part {{of it in the}} previous case.

40|$|This paper compares {{a number}} of {{strategies}} for managing foreign exchange exposures.

The results are mixed and show that for the period 1992 to 2003 the Australian exporter is better off always hedging while the Singapore and Japanese exporters are better off never hedging. The various management strategies are compared using Sharpe’s model and the minimum variance model though it seems the results are not sensitive to use of either.

40|$|According to the Islamic jurisprudence, al-rahn is {{pledging}} a non-fungible {{property as}} surety against debt whereby the debt shall be paid from the pledged item {{in case of}} default. However, Muslim jurists differed in determining the nature of al-rahnu contract. The Hanafi, Shafi`i and Hanbali jurists viewed al-rahn as a charitable contract while the Maliki jurists considered it {{as a form of}} an <b>exchange</b> <b>contract.</b> These differences originated from their different interpretation of the verse 2 : 283 in the Qur'an. Using the taxonomical classification approach by Rosch (1976), this paper examines the pattern of reasoning adopted by the jurists of the main schools of Islamic jurisprudence. Rosch's model is chosen as it can assist the researcher to categorize the aspects of discussion between the al-rahn nature, conditions and rulings. While the model consists of superordinate and subordinate relationships, the paper enhances the conceptual framework of al-rahn into the discussion of conditions and rulings. Thus, the harmonized effort of taxonomical classification is developed to discuss the related rulings resulted from the position of al-rahn as a form of charity or <b>exchange</b> <b>contract.</b> The study shows that Maliki and Shafi`i are seen to be the most consistent schools in holding their stance about al-rahn nature. The consistency can be identified through the examination of al-rahn rulings that matched with their original position. It is also found that the rulings of Maliki jurists are more lenient in stipulating conditions in the contract while Shafi`i stood otherwise...|$|E

Doing so, the classical notion of domination via coalitions is transmitted onto systems (webs) of contracts and onto allocations, whose stability is investigated. This way, the proposed concept of a core for incomplete markets is described as a set of allocations realized by the webs of contracts that have a special kind of stability relative to the breaking of existing contracts and relative to the ability to sign new contracts. This concept converts into classical core when the market turns complete. Under perfect competition conditions, core allocations are equilibria. These properties prove that the studied core concept is valid. Russia, incomplete markets, core, contract, contractual allocation, competitive equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|Constitutional economists {{perceive}} a constitution {{as a complex}} <b>exchange</b> <b>contract.</b> All citizens grant rights {{to each other and}} surrender some of their own options because they hope to benefit from their fellow citizens doing the same. Like a simple <b>exchange</b> <b>contract</b> a constitution is considered to be legitimate if all partners can agree to it in a voluntary and informed manner. Reform efforts have to meet the Pareto criterion. This approach works reasonably well in the context of microeconomic model-building because here the necessary individual preferences and cognitions are simply taken as given. To get a similar basis for any real world question, however, an unrealisable collection of information would be required. Therefore, economists often achieve their results in using stylised constructions of individual preferences and cognitions. For many questions this is useful. But especially in the context of European integration another application may be advocated: Constitutional economists can also take the idea of a Pareto-optimal social contract as a regulative idea to provide a purpose to the public discourse on Europe's constitution. Starting from the intention to improve the rules of the game, all citizens can then discuss differing viewpoints without determining beforehand what others should want and think. They can then use the converging results to determine conjointly public goods and discuss ways to provide them. Seen from this angle, economists are no longer hard-nosed experts telling idealists how people really behave and how they should be treated within by appropriate institutions. They rather provide a more or less uncontroversial framework allowing citizens of equal status to deliberate on the best ways to look at their situation and the possibilities to improve itconstitution building; political economy; polity building; sociological institutionalism...|$|E
