If the question were put to me I should probably evade it {{by pointing out that}} Mr. Frowde is issuing an edition based upon this, in which the spelling is frankly that of to-day. But if the question were pressed, I think a sufficient answer might be found. To begin with, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> even Prof. Masson, who in his excellent edition argues the point and decides in favour of modern spelling, allows that there are peculiarities of Milton's spelling which are really significant, and ought therefore to be noted or preserved. But who is to determine exactly which words are spelt according to the poet's own instructions, and which according to the printer's whim? It is notorious that in Paradise Lost some words were spelt upon a deliberate system, and it may very well happen that in the volume of minor poems which the poet saw through the press in 1645, there were spellings no less systematic. Prof. Masson makes a great point of the fact that Milton's own spelling, exhibited in the autograph manuscript of some of the minor poems preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge, does not correspond with that of the printed copy. [Note: This manuscript, invaluable to all students of Milton, has lately been facsimiled under the superintendence of Dr. Aldis Wright, and published at the Cambridge University press]. This is certainly true, as the reader may see for himself by comparing the passage from the manuscript given in the appendix with the corresponding place in the text. Milton's own spelling revels in redundant e's, while the printer of the 1645 book is very sparing of them. But in cases where the spelling affects the metre, we find that the printed text and Milton's manuscript closely correspond; and it is upon its value in determining the metre, quite as much as its antiquarian interest, that I should base a justification of this reprint. Take, for instance, such a line as the eleventh of Comus, which Prof. Masson gives as:-- ...|$|E

Settlements could be interpreted as flock of sheep; houses are gathered close together to battle against dry and cold wind burja. Stone is main material of housing of settlements in the region. Kras could be understood as rocky relief with many holes where resources of water are scarce.

40|$|Countries such as Iran and Turkey {{do not fit}} comfortably {{into the}} {{democratic}} and authoritarian categories. In these countries, elections are held regularly, and {{the will of the}} people is accepted as one source of sovereignty. At the same time, both constitutionally and in practice the elected officials have to share the exercise of political power with institutions that do not draw their power directly from {{the will of the people}}. In such systems, the judiciary has two important political functions. First, the judiciary acts as a politically insulated decision-maker through which the unelected head can exercise some degree of control over the actions of the elected head. Second, the judiciary's direct involvement in the political arena increases political tensions and legitimates the continuation of the two-headed system. In systems based on divided sovereignty, the tensions created by the judicialization of politics contribute to the stability of the regime. The first two sections of the article develop the theoretical framework of the study. I will then look at the constitutional structures of Iran and Turkey and discuss the role assigned to the judiciary in the two systems. The final section examines the politically important court cases of Recep Tayyip Erdoǧan, a former mayor of Istanbul (1994 - 98), and his Iranian counterpart Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a former mayor of Teheran (1990 - 98). However, at the outset <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> my interest is not in establishing the guilt or innocence of the individuals involved.

40|$|Most design {{academics}} I have met, over my 20 -year {{career in}} academia, could readily provide anecdotal {{accounts of the}} frustration they and their students feel in trying to reconcile their experience of their design practice and the academic requirements to write. I share those frustrations. During the past 15 to 20 years of my research I have frequently looked for concrete visual examples of techniques that would help reconcile the inclination to work visually {{with the process of}} writing, only to be disappointed that little existed. The majority of the growing body of published material, on the disjuncture between creative visual practices and writing, are predominantly text-based explications of the ‘problem’, its history and causes, strategies for resistance, or responses to harness and/or overcome it – sometimes with a few images thrown in for good measure. This literature is emblematic of the crucial yet nascent maturation of the design discipline within the academy and there is much that is good, rebellious, re-assuring or instructive contained within it. Although there is still resistance at the fringes there is a consensus emerging that writing is good for creative practitioners. In this chapter I will first cover some of the existing literature concerning this topic then cover some of the techniques I have developed through my own research and practice to help me develop my writing. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I am not claiming my approach is the only way of tackling this issue.

40|$|This talk {{is about}} two {{processes}} that have the same name. Their most obvious common property {{is that they are}} currently having negative effects on the welfare of ordinary people around the world. What I want to do here is ask whether there is any value in thinking about them together, and what kind of anthropological perspectives might help us to do that. But before I get to that point, I need to say quite a lot more about the two forms of “securitization ” in their own right. The first and rather easier to digest meaning is in the field of international relations, whose so-called global security subfield {{is now one of the}} most fundable branches of social sciences. Indeed, this is such a big and inclusive feast that even anthropologists are still being actively encouraged to join it in the UK, despite the fact that we didn’t much like the look of the original menu that was drawn up for the Economic and Social Research Council by some officials from the Foreign Office. In fairness to the latter, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> I subsequently discovered that they had expected academics to transform their strikingly direct prose of counter-insurgency into a more appropriate dish for our delicate stomachs before the call for proposals went out. In any event, the good thing about securitization in international relations is that we know where we are with the concept. The term was coined in the mid- 1990 s by Ole Wæver and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen School of International Relations. Their approach is constructivist. When an issue is “securitized ” it passes from the realm of ordinary politicized questions into an issue that threatens the very survival of states and their citizens. Object to securitization and you will be told that you are an irresponsible citizen who doesn’t recognize the risk that your loved ones might be killed or maimed by terrorists. Because this is a constructivist theory, the Copenhagen school pay attention to the problem of who has the power to define an issue as one of security. Although they argue that in principle anyone can do this through an appropriate discursive strategy, if related issues are already perceived in securitized terms in the public sphere, they reach the reasonable conclusion that som...|$|E
40|$|Ageing {{pressure}} {{is considered to}} be a critical subject to the pension system in its own right and a vast amount has been written under this heading. This paper s empirical section is based on two datasets: one is the 2001 ' Shanghai Fifth National Population Census (SFNPC); the other is the 1990 's Shanghai Floating Population Census (SFPC). My main aim here is trying to project & test: under current rapid migration, is so called replacement migration a feasible solution to sharply declining and ageing China urban population? Also from the replacement migration point of view, my paper briefly analyzes how China's urban pension system would react in the future. Some concepts that will frequently be used in this paper are defined as follows. The "Floating Population"(FP) here refers to the people who temporally or permanently live in urban (i. e. Shanghai), but without "residence permit"(in Chinese, which called "Hukou"). In general, the floating population can't benefit from the pension system sponsored by the government, but should pay tax just as same as what urban residents do under current "Floating Population Regulation". According to some specific standards, we could divide the FP into two subgroups, one is the People who just temporally live in urban (Temporary Floating Population or TFP), and the other is the ones who permanently live in urban (Permanent Floating Population or PFP). The analyses begin with an interesting contradiction. According to some former population projections from the 1990 s, Shanghai should have experienced a rapid ageing, and such trend should continue until 2030 s when it reaches its peak. But, in fact, according to 2001 ' Fifth National Population Census (note 1), the ratio of dependency (60 +) seems to remain constant (maybe even decline) compared with that of the 1990 s. What is the explanation? The answer is simple! All the Shanghai population projections so far are based on the assumption that the migration is strictly & perfectly controlled, and that it has an insignificant effect on Shanghai's population variation (note 2). Now, we can see that this is an extremely unrealistic assumption. Meanwhile, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> there were no data about the FP, especially about the PFR, before the Fifth National Population Census (FNPC). This greatly limited the related empirical research. The basic idea of my thesis is below. Previous related research was always based on the assumption of a closed population; intuitively, such precondition is too unrealistic due to last ten years migration. At present, it is possible & necessary to include the factor of migration into population projections. Furthermore, from this point of view, almost all urban economic indexes (such as the GDP per capita, etc; and in some popular pension models, for example in RMSM (Revised Minimum Standard Model) model developed by World Bank, these per-capita-indexes are crucial and sensitive to final conclusion) need carefully revised when we realize the FP s significant effect. In this paper, I will firstly attempt to estimate the level of FP, and then use FP-adjusted data to test & re-estimate some popular belief about the Chinese urban pension system under a general theoretical analysis framework. 1. The best important feature of 2001 Fifth National Population Census is that the FP who have continually lived somewhere other than hometown for 6 months or above should participate the current-lived place s registration. Formerly, all FP need go back hometown attend census. To some extend, this adjustment of census policy also reflect the significant fact that there are great migration from rural to city take place during last decade. 2. Before the economic reform, legal migration in China required removal certificates from place of origin, documentation of job offers, etc, and in fact the policy of forced rustication stopped the possibility of migrating from rural areas to the city...|$|E

40|$|The development, engineering, {{and testing}} of ceramic armour systems and {{materials}} {{has been carried out}} during the past 50  years and dates back to the pioneering work of M. L. Wilkins and his colleagues [1]. Arguably, the first indications that such armour would be ballistically efficient were seen much earlier than Wilkins when, in 1918 Maj Neville Monroe‐Hopkins found that a thin layer of enamel improved the ballistic performance of a thin steel plate [2]. Indeed, many early designs employed a hard ceramic face backed by a relatively ductile material, thereby employing the disruptor (or ‘disturber’) /absorber recipe that is still used in modern armour systems today. Since the work of Wilkins, as in so many areas of engineering and science, our understanding of the behaviour of ceramic materials under impact loading conditions has been enhanced by analytical models and finite element simulations coupled with laboratory testing techniques that probe the high strain‐rate response. However, despite the numerous studies on the impact response of these materials, we still have a lot to learn and there are still rich avenues of study to pursue, ranging from their quasi‐static behaviour to the shock response of these materials where strain‐rates of 105 – 106  s− 1 are common. Current themes of research include: attempts to understand the flow characteristics of the comminuted material; methods for enhancing interface‐defeat; strength behaviour under shock‐loading and particularly the processing techniques to enhance their performance. The key to all of this is to understand the mechanisms by which a projectile penetrates (or ‘interacts’) with the ceramic and thereby deduce the important properties that maximise performance. This may appear a trivial task but the time durations during which a penetrator is in contact with a ceramic are typically short and this often makes analysis difficult. Furthermore, ceramic materials are required to cope with diverse threats from bullets to shaped‐charge jets where the mechanism of interaction is quite different. Consequently, the properties that are useful in defeating shaped‐charge jets (such as the fragmentation and subsequent flow characteristics of the material) differ from those that are best for defeating high‐velocity bullets such as hardness, acoustic impedance and particularly, how the armour system is engineered. Even if we consider one particular threat regime, it has been known for some time that it is not one, isolated material property that defines the behaviour of a ceramic during penetration, which is why it is important to study these materials using a range of different techniques. Consequently, this special issue contains papers written by researchers from a range of different backgrounds, including modellers, material scientists, engineers and physicists. Contained within this special issue are several papers examining the mechanisms by which projectiles penetrate ceramic targets. In particular, there is an examination of the modes by which penetrators can be defeated via dwell. Importantly, there are contributions that consider the mechanical properties of ceramics including an examination of the strain‐rate response of aluminium nitride doped silicon carbide. The properties and ballistic performance of explosively‐damaged alumina are also presented and these data are very important for when we design ceramic armour systems to cope with multiple impacts. There is also a comprehensive review on the historical development of ceramic armour that covers the major breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties that govern ballistic performance. This review comes highly recommended for its attention to detail and extensive reference list. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> ceramic materials do not offer a panacea for ballistic protection – mainly due to their low toughness and tensile strength. Nevertheless, they are very important materials, used for saving lives, where a limited number of impacts are expected. Most importantly, ceramics tend to offer a weight‐efficient armour solution – particularly for body armour where the mass of the armour needs to be low. Correspondingly, they are widely used in the design of aircraft armour, and vehicle protection where there is an ever‐increasing requirement to reduce the mass of the vehicle for strategic deployment reasons. Hopefully the papers presented here will stimulate further discussion and ideas for research on how best to produce more cost‐effective and weight‐efficient ceramic‐based armour systems.

In {{the first part}} I hope to {{elucidate}} the relationship of political, legal, and social status associated with land ownership to the unique legal remedies - specific performance and non-recovery of damages - which society created in respect to exchanges of land (and thus exchanges of status) for money. In the conclusion I examine the transformation of legal rules applied to agreements in which labour is exchanged for money. If, in fact, property rules in contract evolved {{in response to the}} political, legal, and social attributes of land ownership, then one may be able to perceive a metamorphosis in the nature of labour entitlements as the meaning and place of labour in society has evolved. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> as well that the purpose of this essay is not to deny that land contracts ought no longer to be protected by property rules. It is less ambitious than that. My intent is to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that many of the underlying social and political forces which created the traditional boundaries of specific performance are no longer extant. Other contracts which have nothing at all to do with real property may have replaced, or at least joined, land contracts as the focal point of social expectations and obligations. Wealth exists in numerous guises, many of which were unknown or even illegal when contract law developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Private property, be it in tangible assets or contracts, is a delicate institution. If the law closes its eyes to social change and protects only one form of wealth to the exclusion of all others, it exists only to protect those who possess the former...|$|R
