40|$|In {{the modern}} theory of finance, the {{valuation}} of derivative assets is commonly {{based on a}} replication argument. When there are transaction costs, this argument is no longer valid. In this paper, we try to address the general problem of finding the optimal portfolio among those which dominate a given <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> at maturity. We derive an interval for its price. the upper bound is the minimum amount one has to invest initially {{in order to obtain}} proceeds at least as valuable as the <b>derivative</b> <b>asset.</b> the lower bound is the maximum amount one can borrow initially against the proceeds of the <b>derivative</b> <b>asset.</b> We show that, in some instances, this interval may be strictly bounded above by the price of the replicating strategy. Prima facie, the cost of a dominating strategy should appear to be higher than that of the replicating one. But because trading is costly, it may pay to weigh the benefits of replication against those of potential savings on transaction costs. Copyright 1992 Blackwell Publishers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} pricing methodology in finance values derivative securities as redundant assets {{that have no}} impact on equilibrium prices and allocations. This paper demonstrates that, when the market is incomplete, primary and <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> markets, generically, interact: the valuation of derivative and primary security prices depend on the contractual characteristics of the derivative assets available. In {{a version of the}} Mossin mean-variance model, the authors analyze an equilibrium in which a call option (<b>derivative</b> <b>asset)</b> is traded and the equilibrium stock price (primary asset) increases when the options market is opened.

40|$|Professor Stout's {{brilliant}} {{concept of}} disagreement-based speculation (in "Risk, Speculation, and OTC Derivatives: An Inaugural Essay for Convivium") calls for further developments and studies concerning implications for stability and resilience {{of the financial}} system over time. Moreover, it also suggests rediscovering and situating the socio-economic function of finance (and financing) {{in the economy and}} society. To complement this approach, we recall the European acceptance of "paying differences" since late nineteenth century. <b>Derivative</b> <b>assets</b> were traded in Europe, but the underlying assets (stocks and bonds) on which derivatives are built were authorized beforehand. Marteau and Morand (2010) recently appealed for reintroducing an a priori authorization procedure before new <b>derivative</b> <b>assets</b> can be marketed: this view thus inherits a century-long tradition. Eventually, it seems that a priori authorization allows for administration of systemic risk while common law-inherited rejection of disagreement-based speculation is a strong foundation for both supervisory and legal (a posteriori) decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this survey}} we discuss models with level-dependent and {{stochastic}} volatility {{from the viewpoint}} of <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> analysis. Both classes of models are generalisations of the classical Black-Scholes model; they have been developed in an effort to build models that are flexible enough to cope with the known deficits of the classical BlackScholes model. We start by briefly recalling the standard theory for pricing and hedging derivatives in complete frictionless markets and the classical Black-Scholes model. After a review of the known empirical contradictions to the classical Black-Scholes model we consider models with level-dependent volatility. Most of this survey is devoted to <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> analysis in stochastic volatility models.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{new evidence}} {{on the extent to}} which non-financial firms use financial derivatives to avoid taxes. In particular, I use the fair value of derivatives segregated by hedging and non-hedging designation to identify derivative activities that are used to benignly and/or aggressively avoid taxes. I use new derivative disclosures required by SFAS 161 to collect detailed information about firms’ use of derivatives. I find a negative association between cash effective tax rates and the fair value of hedging <b>derivative</b> <b>assets.</b> This finding implies that firms defer recognition of gains on hedging derivatives to lower cash taxes. Furthermore, I find an association between cash effective tax rates and both non-hedging <b>derivative</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. This finding is consistent with firms aggressively avoiding cash taxes using non-hedging derivatives by selectively choosing when to recognize gains and losses. In addition, I find no association between GAAP effective tax rates and derivatives, implying that firms in my sample do not use derivatives to manage earnings through the tax expense...|$|R

40|$|A superreplicating hedging {{strategy}} {{is commonly used}} when delta hedging is infeasible or is too expensive. This article provides an exact analytical solution to the superreplication problem for a class of <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> payoffs. The class contains common payoffs that are neither uniformly convex nor concave. A digital option, a bull spread, a bear spread, and some portfolios of bull spreads or bear spreads, are all included as special cases. The problem is approached by first solving for the transition density of a process that has a two-valued volatility. Using this process to model the underlying asset and identifying the two volatility values as σmin and σmax, the value function for any <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> in the class is shown to solve the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation. The subreplication problem and several related extensions, such as option pricing with transaction costs, calculating superreplicating bounds, and superreplication with multiple risky assets, are also addressed.

40|$|We {{consider}} a general discrete-time dynamic financial market with three assets: a riskless bond, a security and a derivative. The market is incomplete (a priori) and at equilibrium. We assume {{also that the}} agents of the economy have short-sales constraints on the stock and that the payoff at the expiry of the <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> is a monotone function of the underlying security price. The derivative price process is not identified ex ante. This leads the agents {{to act as if}} there were no market for this asset at the intermediary dates. Using some nice properties of the pricing probabilities, which are admissible at the equilibrium, we prove that it suffices to consider the subset of the risk-neutral probabilities that overestimate the low values of the security and underestimate its high values with respect to the true probability. This approach greatly reduces the interval of admissible prices for the <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> with respect to no-arbitrage, as showed numerically...|$|E
40|$|The paper studies <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> {{analysis}} in structural credit risk models where the asset {{value of the}} firm is not fully observable.

We transform this problem to a filtering problem for a stopped diffusion process and we apply results from the filtering literature to this problem. In this way we obtain an SPDE-characterization for the filter density. Moreover, we characterize the default intensity under incomplete information and we determine the price dynamics of traded securities. Armed with these results we study <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> {{analysis in}} our setup: we explain how the model {{can be applied to the}} pricing of options on traded assets and we discuss dynamic hedging and model calibration.

40|$|Jackson {{for their}} comments. In this paper {{we present a}} model of the term {{structure}} of interest rates with imperfect information and stochastic differential utility, a form of non-additive recursive utility. A principal feature of recursive utility, that distinguishes it from time-separable expected utility, is its dependence on the timing of resolution of uncertainty. In our model, we parametrize the non-linearity of recursive utility in a way that corresponds to preferences for the timing of resolution. This way we show explicitly the dependence of prices on the rate of information, {{as a consequence of the}} nature of utilities. State prices and the term structure of interest rates are obtained in closed form, and are shown to have a form in which <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> pricing is tractable. ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> is a {{security}} whose payoff is entirely {{determined by the}} prices {{of one or more}} underlying securities. Call and put options on stocks are simple examples. Since 1973, when Black and Scholes published their path-breaking option price formula, a rapidly growing literature has dealt with the valuation of derivatives for various models of the underlying price processes. Some researchers have studied the converse problem. They seek in infer properties of the underlying asset price from given prices of derivatives. The properties of the underlying price which are relevant for valuation purposes can be summarised in what are referred to as Arrow- Debreu state prices. These are the prices of elementary securities that pay one unit if the realisation of the underlying price path belongs to some specified set, and nothing otherwise. Breeden and Litzenberger showed in 1978 that a subset of these state prices can indeed be inferred from a sufficiently large collection of option prices. In a similar spirit, the present paper investigates the restrictions which a pricing formula for a <b>derivative</b> <b>asset</b> imposes on the underlying price processes. The valuation formulae considered satisfy a partial differential equation which is common in the literature on derivatives. It is shown that such formulae uniquely determine the full set of state prices. In contrast to Breeden and Litzenbergers work, the approach chosen does not rely on the particular payoff profiles of standard options, but allows for arbitrary derivative assets. In {{the last part of the}} paper, the general result is used to analyse two types of valuation formulae for options on pure discount bonds. The analysis yields a characterisation of the interest rate behaviour implicit in the valuation formulae and highlights the shortcomings of either type of formula. ...|$|E
