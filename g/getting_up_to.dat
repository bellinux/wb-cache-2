5|$|In {{the first}} match, Cesaro {{defeated}} Sami Zayn. In {{the first half}} of the match, Zayn dove through the ropes looking for a tornado DDT, only for Cesaro to intercept with a European uppercut. Cesaro went on to target Zayn's left knee. In the second half of the match, Cesaro attempted to superplex Zayn from the apron into the ring, but Zayn countered and tried to perform a frankensteiner to Cesaro. Cesaro countered to try a superbomb, but Zayn reversed to successfully perform the frankensteiner. Zayn then hit his signature Helluva Kick to Cesaro, but Cesaro kicked out of the resulting pin. Cesaro then repeatedly implored Zayn to stay down, but Zayn kept <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> receive more European uppercuts. Cesaro attempted his signature Neutralizer, but Zayn countered and went on to hit a sunset flip powerbomb, but it was not enough to win the match. Cesaro then hit a European uppercut after throwing Zayn into the air, but Zayn kicked out of a pin at one. Cesaro hit a discus European uppercut and then performed the Neutralizer on Zayn for the victory. After the match, Cesaro hugged Zayn.|$|E

This serenity really reflects Pixie's performance in this section.|$|E
25|$|Following on, Laborit {{considered}} whether chlorpromazine {{may have}} a role in managing patients with severe burns, Raynaud's phenomenon, or psychiatric disorders. At the Villejuif Mental Hospital in November 1951, he and Montassut administered an intravenous dose to psychiatrist Cornelia Quarti who was acting as a volunteer. Quarti noted the indifference, but fainted upon <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go to the toilet, and so further testing was discontinued (orthostatic hypotension is a possible side effect of chlorpromazine). Despite this, Laborit continued to push for testing in psychiatric patients during early 1952. Psychiatrists were reluctant initially, but on January 19, 1952, it was administered (alongside pethidine, pentothal and ECT) to Jacques Lh. a 24-year-old manic patient, who responded dramatically, and was discharged after three weeks having received 855mg of the drug in total.|$|E

25|$|A {{brilliant}} Commons performance {{made his}} career. On 27 March 1952, having been called {{fifth in the}} debate rather than third as originally scheduled, he spoke after former Health Minister Aneurin Bevan. Beginning his speech with the words “I wish to deal closely and with relish with the vulgar, crude and intemperate speech to which the House of Commons has just listened”, he attacked Bevan with facts and figures and commented that a health debate without Bevan would be like “Hamlet without the first gravedigger”. Churchill, who had been <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> leave, stayed to listen and was heard to ask the Chief Whip, Patrick Buchan-Hepburn, who the promising young backbencher was. When summoned to 10 Downing Street on 7 May {{he claimed to have}} been half-expecting a reprimand for his refusal to serve a second term as a British representative at the Council of Europe, a job he found boring, but he was instead appointed Minister of Health, which was not a Cabinet position at that time.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E
500|$|The Tyneside Theatre company {{presented}} a stage version of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It {{was directed by}} Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone. The music and lyrics were composed by Iwan Williams using medieval carols, such as the Boar's Head Carol, as inspiration and folk instruments such as the Northumbrian pipes, whistles and bhodran to create a [...] "rough" [...] feel. Stone had referred Bogdanov to Cuchulain and the Beheading Game, a sequence which is contained in The Grenoside Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go to the Green Chapel. The dancers made the knot of the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords. The interlacing of the hunting and wooing scenes was achieved by frequent cutting of the action from hunt to bed-chamber and back again, while the locale of both remained on-stage.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 1920s, the NHL faced {{competition}} for players from two other major leagues: the PCHA and the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). As a result, ice hockey players {{were among the}} best paid athletes in North America. By the mid-1920s, the NHL emerged as the sole major league in North America; the PCHA and WCHL having merged in 1924, only to disband two years later. The Victoria Cougars are the last non-NHL team to win and challenge the Stanley Cup, having defeated the Canadiens in 1925, and lost to the Montreal Maroons in 1926, respectively. The NHL continued to expand, adding the Maroons and its first American team, the Boston Bruins in 1924, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 teams by 1926. Defence dominated the NHL, and in the 1928–29 season, Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in 44 games. In response, the NHL began to allow forward passing in the offensive zone, which caused the offense to increase by approximately 2.5 times; to stem the tide, the NHL introduced the offside rule, which prevents offensive players to enter the opponent's zone before the puck crosses the [...] "blue line".|$|E

2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he felt sick. Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look at me, and he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2013, {{after months}} of {{speculation}} dating back to {{before the start of}} the season, Greater Western Sydney shocked the football public by withdrawing their offer of $1.2 million per year for six years, announcing that they were of the belief that Franklin was set to sign with the Sydney Swans. The Sydney Swans' chairman, Andrew Ireland, said later that day that the contract offered to Franklin was a nine-year deal worth $10 million, and that Franklin's management first approached the Swans about the move shortly after the 2012 AFL Grand Final, when Franklin played in a losing side against the Swans. The next day, Franklin said that he did not make his decision to move to Sydney [...] "until the last minute". He also said, [...] "I'm looking forward to <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Sydney. It's a great footy club and, as I said, I had to pack my bags up at Hawthorn and saying goodbye to the boys is something very tough, and upsetting, too". Franklin's manager, Liam Pickering, also revealed that the nine-year contract was so back-ended that he would be making less money with the Swans in 2014–15 than he was at Hawthorn in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, she {{appeared}} in her first film, a six-part direct to video documentary called The Legend of Atlantis: Return of the Lightmasters. The Australian television programme 60 Minutes challenged Jasmuheen to demonstrate how she could live without food and water. The supervising medical professional Dr Beres Wenck found that, after 48 hours, Jasmuheen displayed symptoms of acute dehydration, stress, and high blood pressure. Jasmuheen claimed {{that this was a}} result of [...] "polluted air". On the third day, she was moved to a mountainside retreat about 15 miles from the city, where she was filmed enjoying the fresh air, claiming she could now successfully practice Inedia. But as filming progressed, Jasmuheen's speech slowed, her pupils dilated, and she lost over a stone (6kg or 14lb) in weight. After four days, she acknowledged that she had lost weight, but stated that she felt fine. Dr. Wenck stated: [...] "You are now quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 11%." [...] The doctor continued: [...] "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risk if she goes any further is kidney failure." [...] Jasmuheen's condition continued to deteriorate rapidly due to acute dehydration, despite her contrary insistence. Dr Wenck concluded that continuing the experiment would ultimately prove fatal. The film crew agreed with this assessment and stopped filming.|$|E

2500|$|Mousey (voiced by Jane Bassett) - Mousey is an {{anthropomorphic}} talking mouse {{who lives}} under the floorboards {{of the flat}} that Bodger rents from Series 5-7. She and Badger are great friends, both constantly <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> mischief. Mousey's presence is only known by Bodger in the first episode of Series 5 when he sets traps to try to catch her. After Badger makes friends with Mousey, he deceives Simon into believing Mousey has gone from the house. When Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford to run their hotel in Series 8, Mousey moves with them and takes up residence in the airing cupboard rather than under the floorboards. Even though Badger is known to several of the human characters, Mousey is kept a secret from everyone, although Mrs Dribelle spots her on two occasions in Bodger's flat and Mrs Melly on one occasion who tried to capture {{her when she was}} disguised as a rare bird to fool Miss Piper. She appears to be a fan of royalty, especially in the episode [...] "Mrs. Dribelle and The Queen" [...] where she thinks she's going to live in Buckingham Palace with the Queen unaware that it is Mrs. Dribelle in disguise. When Mousey speaks, it is clear Badger understands her perfectly, however in episode 1 of series 5 it is implied Bodger can only interpret her language as the normal squeaking of a field mouse or house mouse.|$|E
