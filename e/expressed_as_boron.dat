40|$|Results of a U. S. S. R. [...] U. S. {{cooperative}} laboratory {{effort to}} improve and validate experimental techniques used to assess subtle reproductive effects in male laboratory animals are reported. The present studies attempted to evaluate the reproductive toxicity of cadmium as cadmium chloride and boron as borax (Na 2 B 4 O 7) and to investigate the mechanism of toxicity in the rat following acute and subchronic oral exposure. In vitro cell separation techniques, in vivo serial mating tests, and plasma assays for hormones were utilized. Effects on the seminal vesicle and prostate were evaluated with chemical and enzyme assays. Clinical chemistry was monitored routinely. Acute oral doses, <b>expressed</b> <b>as</b> <b>boron</b> were 45, 150, and 450 mg/kg while doses for cadmium equivalent were 6. 25, 12. 5, and 25 mg/kg. Rats were also allowed free access to drinking water containing either boron (0. 3, 1. 0, and 6. 0 mg/l.) or cadmium (0. 001, and 0. l mg/l.) for 90 days. Randomly selected animals were studied following 30, 60, and 90 days of treatment. These initial studies, utilizing {{a variety of methods}} to assess the reproductive toxicity of environmental substances in male animals, suggest that cadmium and boron at the concentrations and dose regimens tested are without significant reproductive toxicity...|$|E

50|$|Another {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of UHTCs is the borothermic reduction of ZnO2, TiO2, or HfO2 with B. At temperatures higher than 1600 °C, pure diborides {{can be obtained from}} this method. Due to the loss of some <b>boron</b> <b>as</b> <b>boron</b> oxide, excess boron is needed during borothermic reduction. Mechanical milling can lower the reaction temperature required during borothermic reduction. This is due to the increased particle mixing and lattice defects that result from decreased particle sizes of ZnO2 and B after milling. This method is also not very useful for industrial applications due to the loss of expensive <b>boron</b> <b>as</b> <b>boron</b> oxide during the reaction.|$|R
