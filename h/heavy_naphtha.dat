2500|$|... straight-run gasoline, usually {{also called}} naphtha is {{distilled}} directly from crude oil. Once the leading source of fuel, its {{low octane rating}} required lead additives. It is low in aromatics (depending on the grade of crude oil), containing some cycloalkanes (naphthenes) and no olefins (alkenes). Between 0 and 20% of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline, because the supply of this fraction is insufficient and its RON is too low. The chemical properties (namely octane and RVP) of the straight-run gasoline can be improved through reforming and isomerisation. However, before feeding those units, the naphtha needs to be split in light and <b>heavy</b> <b>naphtha.</b> Straight-run gasoline can be also used as a feedstock into steam-crackers to produce olefins.|$|E

The catalytic reforming unit by using Hysys-refinery software was simulated. The results are validated by operating data, which is taken from the Esfahan oil refinery catalyticreforming unit. Usually, in oil refineries, flow instability in composition of feedstock can affect theproduct quality. The attention of this paper was focused on changes of the final product flow rate andproduct’s octane number with respect to the changes in the feedstock composition. Also, the effects oftemperature and pressure on the mentioned parameters was evaluated. Furthermore, in this study,Smith kinetic model was evaluated. The accuracy of this model was compared with the actual dataand Hysys-refinery’s results. The results showed that if the feed stream of catalytic reforming unitsupplied with the <b>Heavy</b> Isomax <b>Naphtha</b> can be increased, more than 20 % of the current value,the flow rate and octane number of the final product will be increased.

40|$|AbstractLight {{and middle}} {{atmospheric}} distillate petroleum substances are blended to produce fuels used in transportation and heating. These substances represent the majority by volume {{of crude oil}} refined products in the United States. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop biodegradability and aquatic toxicity data for four substances; <b>heavy,</b> straight-run <b>naphtha</b> (HSRN), hydro-desulfurized kerosene (HDK), hydro-cracked gas oil (HCGO), and catalytic-cracked gas oil (CCGO). Ready biodegradability tests demonstrated rapid and extensive microbial oxidation of these test substances, indicating a lack of persistence in the aquatic environment. Differences in biodegradation patterns reflected compositional differences in the constituent hydrocarbons. Results of aquatic toxicity tests on alga, cladocera, and fish demonstrated that toxicity was greatest for catalytic-cracked gas oil, which contained a high proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons are more soluble, and hence more bioavailable, resulting in higher toxicity. When expressed on the basis of loading rates, acute toxicity values (LL/EL 50) ranged between 0. 3 and 5. 5 mgL− 1 for all three species, while chronic no-observed-effect loading rates (NOELR) ranged between 0. 05 and 0. 64 mgL− 1. PETROTOX estimates for acute and chronic toxicity ranged from 0. 18 to 2. 3 mgL− 1 and 0. 06 to 0. 14 mgL− 1, respectively, which were generally more conservative than experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Substitution of {{hazardous}} substances against less hazardous ones {{is a central}} requirement of the European Chemical Regulation REACH (European Regulation 1907 / 2006 /EC). Hazardous substances emitted from products may not only affect the worker; drift off and distribution in the environment may finally result in exposure of the general population. This potential threat to health is covered by the impact category “toxicity” in Life Cycle Assessments. In this paper, we present {{a case of a}} substitution of volatile organic compounds in a reactive varnish, and compare the “old” formulation with the “new” formulation against health risk to the worker, and concerning the Life Cycle Assessment impact category “toxicity”. The “old” formulation contained <b>Naphtha</b> (petroleum), hydrodesulfurized, <b>heavy</b> and Solvent <b>naphtha</b> (petroleum), light, aromatic. In the new formulation, both naphthas were replaced by n-Butylacetate, 1 -Ethoxy- 2 -propyl acetate and Ethyl- 3 -ethoxy propionate. In the European Union, the naphthas are classified as mutagens and carcinogens category 1, officially. However, if benzene is below 0. 1 %, registrants in the EU proposed to omit this classification, and todays naptha products on the market obviously have benzene contents below 0. 1 %. On a first glance, the improvement for workplace safety introduced by the substitution, therefore, is comparatively small, as it is for toxicity in Life Cycle Assessment. However, when background knowledge concerning chemical production processes of naphtha is included, benzene below a content of 0. 1 % needs to be taken into consideration, and the benefit of substitution is more obvious...|$|R
50|$|Distillation {{of crude}} oil is {{typically}} performed either under atmospheric pressure and under a vacuum. Low boiling fractions usually vaporize below 400 °C at atmospheric pressure without cracking the hydrocarbon compounds.
