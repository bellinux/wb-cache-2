Tree-ring {{samples were}} taken <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> a pine tree (Pinus pinea) growing in Villar de Peralonso, {{a rural area}} 50 km west {{of the city of}} Salamanca, Spain. All samples were {{processed}} to extract -cellulose and the radiocarbon concen-tration in each annual ring was measured using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the University of Nagoya, Japan. The data set covers a growth period between 1979 and 2006, and represents the concentrations of 14 C in a “clean area. ” The aver-age difference between 14 C concentrations in Villar de Peralonso and NH zone 1 for the period 1979 – 1999 is 4. 1 ± 1. 3 ‰. A sample was taken to obtain the reference level of 14 C for the Iberian Peninsula, for a study of anthropogenic emission of CO 2 in urban areas. As part of the initial study, 14 C concentration data in tree rings from the city of Valladolid were used to recal-culate the fossil fuel component (cfoss) using reference data from Villar de Peralonso...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{application}} of artist driven colour mixing and multi-layering of pigments using inkjet printing. A standardised colour managment workflow is essential for predicable and repeatable colour for inkjet printing. With the correct implementation of a print methodology, input colour values are rendered through the print driver {{in order to determine}} the combinations of ink channels from which the colours will be constructed. Through this automation, the user surrenders control in the colour mixing process. From an artists' perspective this is counter-intuitive to artistic colour mixing methods, this research considers possibilities for colour printing by approaching the inkjet printing process <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> a more traditional colour mixing methodology. This research investigates the implementation of multi-layering for inkjet printing by reflecting on photomechanical art historical processes from the 19 th Century and {{the application of}} layering of pigments as demonstrated in old master paintings. By mixing inks in ways that are considered to be non-conventional for inkjet printers, but instead by implementing a layering process similar to traditional printing and painting processes, we aim to improve colour output when printing inkjet reproductions of original artworks...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to begin to explore some of the recent trends and {{attributes}} of sole parenting in New Zealand, but <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> a child-centered rather than a parentfocused perspective. Reports that the proportions of children living in sole parent families have significantly increased have been the source of much concern, and even ‘moral panic’, over recent quinquennia. Sole parent households made up nine per cent of all households in 1976, and were up to 19 per cent by 1991. Advocates of family values allege that the traditional family unit is breaking down, and that this will have negative consequences for society and for our children. Previous research into the issue of sole parent families has been largely based on census information, producing snapshot-like pictures of the situation at one point in time. This paper begins to offer a more thorough look into some of the trends and processes at work by adopting the benefits of a longitudinal, retrospective survey that traces cohorts of children through their childhood. By following different cohorts through their family experiences during childhood, we can begin to build up a picture about if and how experiences of sole parenting have changed over time, and can begin to speculate about the situation for today’s children...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in the automatization level of industrial production, the three-dimensional laser scanning system has been applied in industrial production more and more widely with its advantages of high identification rate, non-destructive capability, and so on. In order to increase the product quality, product testing becomes an important and indispensable link in the industrial production. The research aim of this thesis is, to develop an automatic on-line testing system, based on 3 D laser scanner technology. Such a system can contribute to the realization of a complete automatic process from measuring the product to calculating its form error and further judging whether the product is satisfactory or not. This thesis, starting from the data points obtained <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> 3 D scanner, after filtering the noise points in the right and left CCD, makes use of NURBS surface to fit these point data, and reconstruct the surface of the measured object. Based on the principle of the Least Region to assess the form error of the surface, we obtain a mathematic model of the form error of the surface, and further making use an improved Genetic Algorithm, calculate the form error of the object. According to the given acceptable scale of the error, we can judge whether the product is satisfactory or not. Finally, the program design work of the whole system is realized through the use of VC++ 6. 0, with a user interface to calculate form error being implemented. This research can be applied in the industrial production in order to increase the product quality and the level of automatization. Other potential applications include artificial intelligence, medicine, etc...|$|E
40|$|A solo {{exhibition}}. The exhibition {{opens with}} the five short texts of Le Lever, torn <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> an auction catalogue description of an engraving after a painting by Pierre-Antoine Baudouin, the son-in-law of Boucher, who, like his father-in-law, depicted the voluptuous eroticism of the ancien régime, transformed into chapters. The servant girl kneels before her mistress, holding her satin mule. Stuffed animals (aristocratic greedy squirrels who take everything from themselves, a mob of stoats, sporting Phrygian bonnets, cunning radical foxes who have read Marx) proliferate. In La Forme-valeur, Marx’s Capital is read, chapter three on exchange-value, {{in an attempt to}} find a woman speaking, yet all is found is an object speaking in the charming voice of a commodity in the chorus of goods going to market. Scent bottles (Allure and Chanel No. 5) might become Molotov cocktails, the material that may be soaked and ignited is French wedding tulle, which is rather expensive. The repetitive (and as the artist is the first to admit, dull and amateur) films of Mes coquetteries follow silk-clad bodies while a voiceover recalls the radio transmissions of the Resistance and from the Underworld via the car radio of Cocteau’s film Orphée. In Encore un effort a banner carries the breathless descriptions of the new fashions for 1968, when anything goes and details place the accent on this or that part of the body and its adornment: a pair of shoes that have come off in a struggle, for example, the heel of one snapped off; a checked shirt, with two buttons undone; a light-coloured trench coat (perfect for a May day); a blouson- style jacket that allows easy freedom of movement; pale casual slacks worn with an ankle boot. Beauty is in the streets as fashion becomes democratic (or so say the houses of haute couture), while the philosopher of the boudoir extorts us once again to take action. To an assembled crowd of sensitive men and women, which petit-maître or dangerous man of principles would suggest that the only moral system to reinforce political revolution is that of libertinage, the revenge of nature’s course against the aberrations of society? The exhibition included an outpost of Artwords Bookshop, with selected titles, the installation of part of Kivland's library with artist Chris Gibson as weekly librarian-in-residence, a reading room, the screening of the full-length version of Peter Watkin's film La Commune (Paris 1871) at Sands Fims, an agit-disco by Stefan Szczelkun, a performance at the opening by fourteen women, and a publication. </p...|$|E

40|$|Developing {{a better}} {{understanding}} of client resistance, and better evidence-based practise principles for dealing with resistance, have the potential to increase the efficacy of psychotherapy. There has been very limited research into client resistance, and even less which has investigated the link between therapist behaviours and resistance. The limited research to date has been conflicting and has primarily focused on narrowly operationalised definitions of resistance, as well as limiting measurement of therapist behaviours to therapist technical skills rather than interpersonal skills. There is little research investigating specific therapist relational skills that contribute to or reduce the likelihood of client resistance, and how this in-session interpersonal dynamic takes place. This study utilised a multi-method design to investigate the relationship between a number of therapist relational skills (therapist empathy-perspective taking, therapist empathy-attunement, and therapist resistance) and client resistance. Resistance was defined as oppositional behaviour within the session, or lack of engagement with the other member of the dyad, and perceived as the outcome of an interpersonal process. DVDs of therapy sessions were accessed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> a Short Motivational Programme run by the Department of Corrections in New Zealand. Each of the DVDs was coded on a minute by minute basis, using measures of therapist interpersonal skills and client resistance. The study also measured the working alliance. The analysis combined: a group analysis of broad patterns across the dyads; a single case analysis involving a visual analysis of graphed data, supplemented with descriptive statistics; and a narrative analysis of client-therapist dialog. The results showed that therapist resistance and client resistance were strongly and positively related. The relationship between the two variables was also found to be temporally proximal at the level of a one minute segment. There was also a strong, but inverse relationship, between therapist empathy and client resistance, and again, the relationship was temporally proximal {{at the level of the}} one minute segment. Therapist resistance, especially, was closely synchronised to client resistance in terms of the timing of onset and cessation, and was also synchronised in terms of the level (intensity) of the two measures. The findings provide evidence for the idea that client resistance is often the result of an interpersonal dynamic, rather than simply an intrapersonal characteristic, and can be contributed to by poor therapist relational skills. The results showed that either therapist or client resistance can appear first, and tend to elicit resistance from the other member of the dyad (and lack of perspective taking by the therapist), which in turn elicits further resistance from the other dyad member. This appears to set in place a conflictual interpersonal dynamic that tends not to cease until the therapist stops resisting the client’s message, and takes a more empathic-perspective taking stance. The results also suggested that therapist perspective taking and therapist resistance may be specific interpersonal dynamics contributing to successful/unsuccessful therapist confrontations...|$|E
40|$|Preventing the {{introduction}} of invasive species is {{the first line of}} defense against invasions. However, even the best prevention efforts will not stop all invasive species introductions. Early detection and rapid response (ED 2 ̆ 6 RR) efforts increase the likelihood that invasions will be addressed successfully while populations are still localized and population levels are not beyond that which can be contained and eradicated. Once populations are widely established, all that might be possible is the partial mitigation of negative impacts. In addition, the costs associated with ED 2 ̆ 6 RR efforts are typically far less than those of long-term invasive species management programs. The charge of the National Invasive Species Council (Council) is to assist in the coordination of invasive species efforts. Because certain invasive species can spread rapidly, there is a critical need to coordinate ED 2 ̆ 6 RR efforts. The 57 action items in the Council’s National Invasive Species Management Plan (Plan) provide a “blue-print” for coordinated action on invasive species (National Invasive Species Council. 2001. Meeting the Invasive Species Challenge: National Invasive Species Management Plan. 74 pp. available at: www. Invasivespecies. gov). In the Plan, ED 2 ̆ 6 RR is identified as a high priority. For example, Plan action items # 23 and # 24 deals with the development of guidelines and systems for the coordinated detection and response to incipient invasions. The Plan also calls for working with state, local, tribal, and private entities to draft proposals that will, among other things, provide permanent funding for ED 2 ̆ 6 RR efforts. The Council approved these guidelines in June 2003 to provide information to those who wish to establish or evaluate ED 2 ̆ 6 RR systems for invasive species. They are based on the work of the federal and non-federal members of the ED 2 ̆ 6 RR Subcommittee (see appendix 4) of the Invasive Species Advisory Committee (ISAC) of the Council. The guidelines contain information <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>from</b> a wide range of subject matter experts, people with direct experience in ED 2 ̆ 6 RR efforts, and stakeholders that included members of the ISAC and representatives of Council member agencies. Information was drawn from documents that analyze existing or proposed systems including but not limited to: work by the Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds (FICMNEW), a report by Jim Worrall of the U. S. Forest Service, the work of the Western Regional Panel of the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, the definition of “rapid response” developed by the Council, and information on ED 2 ̆ 6 RR systems from New Zealand and Australia. It is anticipated that these guidelines (Version 1) will be revised as science, technology, and experience with systems and species advance. The hallmarks of successful ED 2 ̆ 6 RR efforts include: 1) potential threats are being identified in time to allow risk-mitigation measures to be taken; 2) new invasive species are being detected in time to allow efficient and environmentally sound decisions to be made; 3) responses to invasions are effective and environmentally sound and prevent the spread and permanent establishment of invasive species; 4) adequate and timely information is being provided to decision-makers, the public, and to trading partners concerned about the status of invasive species within an area; and 5) lessons learned from past efforts are being used to guide current and future efforts. Detecting and responding to invasions requires a complex series of interlacing, coordinated, and sustained actions that can be grouped into three main categories: 1) Early Detection, 2) Rapid Assessment, and 3) Rapid Response. Actions may include: reviewing relevant legal authorities; coordinated planning; identification of high priority species and at-risk sites; routinely monitoring certain areas; prevention and containment efforts; surveillance, detection, and reporting activities including data collection and management; the collection, identification, and storage of voucher specimens; determining if newly-detected invasive populations are still localized; determining the relative and potential risk associated with an introduction; priority setting; sharing resources across jurisdictional boundaries; monitoring, treating and removing populations; restoring habitats; coordinated public communication efforts; training volunteers and professionals in detection, identification, and removal techniques; sharing information; and developing case studies. In addition, research, adequate staffing and funds, and effective public communication are essential to support ED 2 ̆ 6 RR activities. The following identifies components of early detection, rapid assessment, and rapid response systems that experts consider either essential (i. e., must be present) or important to a system 2 ̆ 7 s success.
