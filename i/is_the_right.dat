5|$|The {{concept of}} syadvada allows the Jains {{to accept the}} truth in other philosophies from their perspectives, thus inculcating a {{tolerance}} for other viewpoints. Anekantvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that only Jainism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> religious path.|$|E
5|$|Again, it is {{required}} that the set of infinite matrices obtained this way stand in one-to-one correspondence with the original -matrices and that the multiplication table <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> one – {{the one of the}} -matrices. It should be emphasized that in the infinite-dimensional case, the concern is rarely the complete matrices. They are exposed here only to highlight the common thread. But individual matrix elements are frequently computed, especially for the Lie algebra (below).|$|E

However, there is only ever a single thyroid gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans is common to many other species.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{featured}} alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) visiting the Wild West, where they encounter a town which is {{cut off from the}} rest of the frontier until they hand over Kahler-Jex, an alien doctor, to a cyborg called the Gunslinger. However, the Gunslinger is a product of experiments by Jex to win a civil war on his planet, and the Doctor is unsure of what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do.|$|E
5|$|The panel <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> wing of a devotional and hinged triptych; {{the lost}} center panel is {{recorded}} in sixteenth-century inventories as a Virgin and Child. The panels were commissioned by Tommaso, {{a member of}} a prominent Florentine family. Tommaso was an intimate of Charles the Bold and an ambitious manager of the Bruges branch of a bank controlled by Lorenzo de' Medici, and a well known and active patron of Flemish art. Tommaso eventually lost his position due to a series of large and risky unsecured loans given to Charles.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E

5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E

5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them that it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At {{the conclusion of the}} episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they have been fired.|$|E
5|$|The first Sky {{television}} rights {{agreement was}} worth £304million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated {{to start from}} the 1997–98 season, rose to £670million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320million {{from the sale of}} its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6million, a 63percent increase on the £105million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.|$|E
