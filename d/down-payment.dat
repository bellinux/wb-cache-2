[...] Its findings generally corroborated those of the earlier government reports and studies. [...] Specifically, the GAO found that (i) the percentage of FHA insured loans that had received <b>down-payment</b> assistance from nonprofit organizations was increasing and that, by 2004, they accounted for approximately one in every three new loans insured by the FHA, (ii) the seller-funded programs created an [...] "indirect stream" [...] of funds from sellers to buyers that caused the home buyers to pay higher prices, and (iii) loans that received <b>down-payment</b> assistance had higher delinquency and default rates than those that did not receive it (and that seller-funded <b>down-payment</b> assistance programs comprised about 95% of all FHA insured loans that received any type of <b>down-payment</b> assistance from a nonprofit organization).

500|$|The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") took {{public action}} in 2005. [...] In mid year, it {{released}} two private letter rulings, {{each of which}} described an organization that was conducting operations {{in a manner similar}} to the Nehemiah Program. [...] Each ruling found that (i) the organization's operations did not exclusively serve a charitable purpose but, instead, served to promote [...] "the private interests of home sellers and other private parties" [...] and, consequently, (ii) the payments made by home sellers to the organization would not qualify as [...] "charitable contributions" [...] for which the seller could claim a tax deduction. [...] And in November 2005, the Department of Justice filed suit in Chicago on behalf of the IRS, seeking an injunction against an Illinois-based seller-funded <b>down-payment</b> program. [...] The injunction sought to bar that program from [...] "falsely advising" [...] home sellers that they could claim their payments to the program as charitable-contribution tax deductions. [...] The IRS made its findings applicable to all seller-funded <b>down-payment</b> assistance programs when it issued a revenue ruling in May 2006. [...] That ruling, Revenue Ruling 2006–27, contrasted the tax treatment of seller-funded programs with the treatment accorded to other types of <b>down-payment</b> assistance. [...] Seller-funded programs, the ruling stated, were [...] "not operated exclusively for charitable purposes". [...] Furthermore, payments made by the seller to the organizations were to be treated not as charitable contributions, but either as rebates to the home buyer or as reductions in the sales price of the home. [...] Shortly after the revenue ruling was issued, Nehemiah published an open letter from its president, in which it noted its opposition to the ruling but added that the ruling did not prevent the Nehemiah Program from continuing its operations. The letter did note, however, that Nehemiah might have to pay [...] "appropriate business taxes on the revenue generated by its downpayment assistance program".|$|E
40|$|The Parliament's Standing Committee on Transport and Communication {{decided in}} Februry 2007 to procure a {{state-of-the-art}} report {{with respect to}} Public Private Partnerships (PPP). The purpose was to let committee members share experiences and research results from PPP projects that have been implemented elsewhere in Europe and overseas, well before that the Parliament {{is to take a}} decision on the future use of such contracts in spring 2008. VTI was commissioned to do this job, and the present report provides the conclusion from the mission. The document demonstrates that a transfer from today's model for paying for infrastructure - i. e. that the public sector budget is paying all costs during the year(s) that an investment is built - to a PPP model and thereby making <b>down-payments</b> from the budget over a contract period to pay for the costs, creates some scope for increased spending in this or other sectors during a transition period. The possibility to spend extra will, however, gradually shrink once the volume of <b>down-payments</b> grows. PPP is therefore not a new instrument for infrastructure financing. Provided that the contract between the public sector procurer and the private sector agent (the entrepreneur) is appropriately crafted, PPP may however improve cost efficiency in the construction industry. This is particularly pertinent in view of the industry's weak productivity performance, with virtually zero growth of output per hour of labour input during the last ten years. The few ex post studies that have been made of the outcome of PPP indicate that such projects are built on time or even opened before schedule, and that cost overruns are fewer than for standard projects. It has however been difficult to document actual cost savings. The report identifies a number of aspects that should be accounted for when the contract between the public and private sector is designed...|$|R

[...] This program, the Nehemiah Program, became popular and was widely emulated, giving birth to {{what came to be}} known as the seller-funded <b>down-payment</b> assistance industry.

40|$|Many {{factors have}} contributed to the {{development}} of credit markets, easing access of households to credit. This paper considers the implications of easier credit for the influence of higher house prices on consumer expenditure. It argues that with poorly developed credit markets, the effect is likely to be negative, but becomes positive as access to housing collateral increases and <b>down-payments</b> for first time home buyers fall in relation to values. The implications for differences between countries and changes in consumer behaviour over time are explored. Previous studies are reviewed: the omission of credit liberalization and other controls has often biased estimates of housing ‘wealth’ effects on consumption. New empirical estimates for the UK and US suggest that there was no housing ‘wealth effect’ before credit market liberalization, but that the housing collateral effect is now significant, larger than the stock market wealth effect, and about twice as large in the US as the UK. consumer expenditure; credit channel; housing wealth...|$|R

[...] But the interviewees also generally corroborated some of the claims made by detractors of the programs—that sellers were routinely raising their sales prices to recoup the payment made to the nonprofit organization, and that the price increases led to higher loan costs for the buyers along with a higher risk of default on their loans. [...] The study was not restricted to the Nehemiah Program; no particular program was singled out {{in the body of the}} report.

40|$|Manuel Aalbers {{argues that}} the actions of {{mortgage}} lenders {{can play an important}} role in understanding the trajectories of some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in Western cities. Mortgage lenders use the notion of the neighbourhood as a means to reduce their risk or to extract profit, and as such can exercise destructive powers over the neighbourhood. Through the practice of redlining, mortgage lenders may write of whole neighbourhoods as being too risky for investment. In some neighbourhoods, mortgage lenders are only willing to provide finance against higher interest rates and <b>down-payments.</b> Aalbers calls this yellowlining if these practices are based on place-based factors, and is an example of sub-prime predatory lending. He argues that redlining and place-based predatory sub-prime lending are not opposites as is sometimes argued, but are two adjacent positions on a continuum of exclusionary lending practices. The practices of redlining and predatory lending disproportionally hit the same socio-economic groups: low-income groups and ethnic minorities. Redlining is named explicitly as a form of an institutionalised discriminatory practice leading to segregation in both the US and the Netherlands. Although the key factor in redlining is place-based, it is suggested that the underlying cause, in some cases, may be race-based. status: publishe...|$|R
