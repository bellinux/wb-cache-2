25|$|An {{oil burner}} is a heating device which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through a nozzle {{to produce a}} <b>fine</b> <b>spray,</b> which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the oil burner in the oil fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound-assisted {{extractive}} electrospray ionization {{mass spectrometry}} (EESI-MS) {{has been developed}} at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) by Zhu et al., (2008) for a rapid detection of melamine in untreated food samples. Ultrasounds are used to nebulize the melamine-containing liquids into a <b>fine</b> <b>spray.</b> The spray is then ionised by extractive electrospray ionisation (EESI) and analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). An analysis requires 30 seconds per sample. The limit of detection of melamine is a few nanograms of melamine per gram of milk.|$|E
25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a <b>fine</b> <b>spray</b> mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a spray head.|$|E
40|$|A breath activated, {{pressurized}} {{metered dose inhaler}} (pMDI) device (Oxette®) {{has been}} developed to replace the traditional cigarette. In this paper, internal and external spray characters are measured by high speed imaging along with sizing the residual droplets at {{the distance from the}} discharge orifice where the human oropharynx locates. Two different formulations with 95 % and 98 % mass fraction of HFA 134 a and two prototype cigarette alternatives with different expansion chamber volumes have been analyzed. The internal and external flows issuing from early stage prototype Oxette® are discussed along with boiling and evaporation phenomena. The expansion and entrainment regions of the jet are observed and discussed with comparison to the turbulent round jet of a single phase. From the visualizations of internal flows in the earlier design, a small expansion chamber can hardly generate small bubbles, which is difficult to produce <b>fine</b> <b>sprays.</b> The larger the expansion chamber volume, the more room for the propellant evaporation, recirculation, bubble generation and growth, all of which produces <b>finer</b> <b>sprays.</b> Therefore the later prototype of Oxette® 2 made a significant improvement to produce <b>fine</b> <b>sprays</b> and facilitated development of the cigarette alternative. Furthermore, the characters of the spray generated by Oxette® are compared to that issuing from a pMDI by previous researchers, where the residual MMD is larger than that of a pMDI, because the Oxette® has a smaller expansion chamber and the geometry provides less opportunity for the recirculation due to restrictions of the design space. Although the formulation with higher mass fraction of HFA 134 a can generate smaller droplets, it cannot produce steady puffs with relatively low mass flow rat...|$|R

40|$|The {{injection}} of a plain jet of kerosene Jet A- 1 fuel into a crossflow of air was investigated experimentally regarding fuel placement, spray characteristics, and evaporation. The test conditions chosen were {{a test case}} relevant to LPP (lean premixed prevaporized combustion) for gas turbines (pair= 15. 5 bar, Tair= 750 K) and the corresponding cold test condition in terms of air density (pair= 6 bar, Tair= 290 K). Both test cases were investigated in the absence {{as well as in}} the presence of a filmer plate on which part of the nascent fuel spray impinges. The nozzle diameter was 0. 45 mm and the fuel flowrate was 2. 94 g/s, so that the fuel-to-air momentum flux ratio q (q=(rliq*uliq 2) /(rair*uair 2)) assumed a value of 6. Measurement techniques employed include time-resolved shadowgraphs and Phase-Doppler-Anemometry (PDA). In the absence of the filmer plate, spray penetration is noticeably lower at the hot test condition than at the cold test condition. The presence of the plate causes the placement of the fuel to be better defined regardless of test case. Film formation on the plate and evidence of some sort of reflection of the fuel by the plate (e. g. splashing) were observed at both test conditions. At the cold test condition, the filmer plate leads to an overall <b>finer</b> <b>spray.</b> At the hot test condition, however, the plate does not generate a <b>finer</b> <b>spray</b> or accelerate evaporation, which is about 70 % complete at a location 80 mm downstream from the point of injection...|$|R
500|$|Males of many species, {{ranging from}} the widely {{introduced}} ring-necked pheasant to Africa's many whydahs, have one or more elongated pairs of rectrices, which play an often-critical role in their courtship rituals.

2500|$|ESI {{interface}} for LC-MS systems {{was developed}} by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface [...] {{can be used for}} the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized {{at the tip of the}} capillary and a <b>fine</b> <b>spray</b> of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged. The use of 1–3nbsp&mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation [...] is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 μl/min range.|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his days in}} the isolation ward, Lukwiya would sit {{with members of the}} WHO, CDC and other medical teams that had set up in the hospital compound to offer assistance and take blood samples that allowed them to map the course of the disease. [...] His main question for them was how to stop his staff members from becoming infected. [...] The likely explanation in most cases are momentary lapses. [...] Health workers at St. Mary's worked 14 hours shifts for weeks in a row while in layers of protective clothing that were stifling in the equatorial country. [...] All that would be required for infection is for a health worker to lose focus for a moment and, after touching a patient, slip a gloved finger under their mask to scratch an itchy nose or rub an eye. [...] One infected St. Mary's health worker who may have been infected in this way was nurse Simon Ajok. [...] In the early morning of 20 November, Ajok was in the Ebola ward and critical, bleeding from both his nose and gums. [...] Fighting to breathe, Ajok pulled off his oxygen mask and coughed violently, sending a <b>fine</b> <b>spray</b> of blood and mucus against the nearby wall. [...] He then astonished and terrified the night-shift by rising to his feet and staggering into the hallway. [...] The night nurse on duty called Dr. Lukwiya for help. [...] Woken out of bed, Lukwiya put on protective clothing, mask, cap, gown, apron and two pairs of gloves, but not goggles or a face shield to protect the eyes. [...] Explanations for this range from grogginess at being newly awoken or haste to reach a colleague that he had helped train. [...] While it will never be known for certain, the care for Simon Ajok, who died one hour after the physician arrived, is the most likely candidate for Lukwiya's infection.|$|E

50|$|Deionized {{water is}} used in water-fog fire-extinguishing systems used in {{sensitive}} environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The 'sprinkler' nozzles use much <b>finer</b> <b>spray</b> jets than other systems, and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The extremely fine mist produced takes the heat out of a fire rapidly, and the fine droplets of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and {{are less likely to}} damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{structures}} of the port injector spray dominates the mixture preparation process and strongly affect the subsequent engine combustion characteristics {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions in port-injection gasoline engines. All these spray characteristics are determined by particular injector design and operating conditions. In this paper, an experimental study is made to characterize the breakup mechanism and spray characteristics of a injector with multi-disc nozzle (SAGEM,D 2159 MA). A comparison was made on injection characteristics of the multi-hole injectors and its effects on various fuel pressure and temperature. The distributions of the droplet size and velocity and volume flux were characterized using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) technique. Through this work, {{it was found that the}} injector produces a <b>finer</b> <b>spray</b> with a wide spray angle in higher fuel pressure and temperature. ...|$|R

The objective is to clarify the role of turbulence in producing {{a wide spectrum of}} particle sizes and numbers in the spray. The output signal from hot film contained multispikes with different amplitudes and thickness which has been correlated to the drop number density and the droplet size through the use of probability density function. Generally it is found that an increase of the guide relative position enhances the mixing process and produces <b>finer</b> <b>spray.</b> This is attributed to the utilization of high wave number eddies in shortening the liquid jet break up length.

40|$|Abstract—The {{effects of}} {{asbestos}} wet-stripping agents on {{the efficiency of}} niters used in asbestos removal have been assessed by field measurements, simulations and laboratory studies. Pleated glass-fibre paper filters, the type most commonly used in industry, are unaffected by wet-stripping agents beyond a slight and usually transitory increase in airflow resistance. Resin-wool niters are unaffected by the relatively coarse sprays that we observed in wet-stripping, but are degraded by very <b>fine</b> <b>sprays</b> of wetting agents or penetrating agents, though not by water or encapsulating agent. Both louvres and prefilters significantly reduce the quantity of sprays that reach a filter cartridge during real or simulated wet-stripping. Filter degradation neither progresses nor recovers after exposure to sprays has stopped, and so aerosol penetration measured at any time after exposure should equal the maximum obtained in use. Slurry applied to the surfaces of the filters does not release particles or penetrate through the filters. Crown copyright © 1996 Published b...|$|R
40|$|High-Z {{materials}} such as tungsten are currently the potentially best candidates for plasma-facing components (PFCs) in future fusion devices. However, the threat of melting under uncontrolled conditions and the associated material redistribution and loss can place strict limits on the lifetime of PFCs and plasma operation conditions. In particular, material losses {{in the form of}} <b>fine</b> <b>sprayed</b> droplets can provide a very intensive source of impurities in the plasma core. In this paper, the plasma response to radiation losses from impurity particles produced by droplet evaporation is modelled for the conditions found in the tokamak TEXTOR. The interplay between tungsten spraying and plasma behaviour, resulting in the reduction of power transferred to the limiter and diminution of droplet production, is taken into account. Calculations predict, in agreement with experimental observations, that this evolution results in a new steady state with significantly reduced central temperature and peaked impurity radiation profile. The efficiency of melt conversion into droplets, estimated by comparing experimental and computed plasma temperatures, is in reasonable agreement with the predictions from models for droplet generation...|$|R
