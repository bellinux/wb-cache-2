25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} to act quickly when he learned of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E
25|$|However, Bohr {{had argued}} that the {{uranium-235}} isotope was {{far more likely to}} capture neutrons and fission even from neutrons with the low energies produced by fission. Frisch began experimenting uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium-235. When he used Peierls' formula to calculate its critical mass, he received a startling answer: less than a kilogram would be required. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum in March 1940. They reported that a 5 kilogram bomb would be the equivalent to several thousand tons of dynamite, and even a one kilogram bomb would be impressive. Because of the potential radioactive fallout, they thought that the British might find it morally unacceptable.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} critics who viewed the episode when it aired were equally taken with [...] "Asian F". The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called it Glee [...] "best ever", while others, {{including}} Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly {{said it was}} the best one of the new third season. Vanity Fair Brett Berk wrote, [...] "This week's episode stands out {{as one of the most}} cohesive and well acted in the series's pantheon", though <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> had happened to the show's humorous side, something also noted by Futterman, who found it to be a significant problem: [...] "Glee's own identity crisis of not knowing whether or not it's a sitcom has made it hard to get deeply invested in its characters." [...] Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the producers hit every note (emotional, musical, character, plot) as squarely as Rachel Berry auditioning for a coveted role", and the episode [...] "had emotional truth, character growth, new revelations and really good musical numbers: the kind that seem to emerge organically from the plot and deepen and advance it." [...] AOLTV Crystal Bell said the episode delivered on the setup in the previous [...] "I Am Unicorn" [...] outing, and said [...] "it definitely seems to echo the glory days" [...] of the first season. TV Guide later included [...] "Asian F" [...] in its list of 2011's Top TV Episodes.|$|E

2500|$|LaHaye {{indicates}} that {{the idea for the}} series came to him one day circa 1994, while he was sitting on an airplane and observed a married pilot flirting with a flight attendant. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would befall the pilot if the Rapture happened at that moment. The first book in the series opens with a similar scene. He sold the movie rights for the Left Behind series and later stated he regretted that decision, because the films turned out to be [...] "church-basement videos", rather than [...] "a big-budget blockbuster" [...] that he had hoped for.|$|E
