50|$|In 1998, Lab.gruppen {{engineers}} undertook {{the long-term}} {{development of a}} new amplifier platform.

5000|$|Modern {{data centers}} are {{challenged}} with disconnects between the facility and IT infrastructure architectures and processes. These challenges {{have become more}} critical as virtualization creates a dynamic environment within a static environment, where rapid changes in compute load translate to increased power consumption and heat dispersal. If unanticipated, rapid increases in heat densities can place additional stress on the data center's physical infrastructure, resulting in a lack of efficiency, {{as well as an}} increased risk for overloading and outages. In addition to increasing risks to availability, inefficient allocation of virtualized applications can increase power consumption and concentrate heat densities, causing unanticipated [...] "hot spots" [...] in server racks and areas. These intrinsic risks, as well as the aforementioned drivers, have resulted in an increase in market demand for <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> and management solutions capable of [...] "bridging the gap between IT and facilities" [...] systems.|$|E
50|$|Bearingless speed sensors may {{be found}} in almost every {{wheelset}} of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for wheel slide protection and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the wheel slide protection system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable.One special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for wheel slide protection is their <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to take off the wheel slide protection signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the wheel slide protection electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized.|$|E

UNEP/MAP and HELCOM expert groups have also developed guidelines on <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> of chemicals and their effects for the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea. This document provides the technical information {{for one of the}} biological effects measurements, the lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), which {{is a part of the}} above mentioned <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> approaches. Lysosomes are cytoplasmic, single membrane organelles whose condition is sensitive to stress whether it be due to environmental conditions or exposure to a wide array of contaminants. Two different methodologies have been developed to assess LMS in mussels: an enzyme cytochemical method using cryostatic sections of digestive gland tissue, and an in vivo cytochemical method (using haemolymph cells). In this document, different aspects of the operational procedures have been standardized and harmonized, with particular reference to the in vivo cytochemical method. New graphical material has been added to clarify criteria of interpretation and new external quality assurance programmes for measurements of lysosomal membrane stability have been proposed. Background (BAC) and environmental (EAC) assessment criteria to assess the LMS data are provided. Additionally, a new scoring procedure to enhance the sensitivity of the LMS measurements using the in vivo assay is provided. Versión del edito...|$|E

40|$|An ageing and deteriorating bridge stock {{presents}} the bridge owners {{with the growing}} challenge of maintaining the structures at a satisfactory level of safety, performance and aesthetic appearance within the allocated budgets. This task calls for optimized bridge management based on efficient methods of selecting technical and economical optimal maintenance and rehabilitation strategies. One of the crucial points {{in the assessment of}} the current condition and future development and performance. Selecting the optimal maintenance and rehabilitation strategy within the actual budget is a key point in bridge management for which an accurate assessment of performance and deterioration rate is necessary. For this assessment, the use of <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> system has several advantages compared to the traditional approach of scattered visual inspections combined with occasional on site testing with portable equipment and laboratory testing of collected samples. For this reason, attention is more focusing on the development of permanent <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> system for durability assessment of concrete bridges. It is estimated that with the implementation of such <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, {{it should be possible to}} reduce the operating costs of inspections and maintenance by 25 % and the operator of the structures will be able to take protective actions before damaging processes start. This paper indentifies the main bridge owner requirements to <b>integrated</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems and outlines how monitoring systems may be used for performance and deterioration rate assessment to establish a better basis for selecting the optimal maintenance and rehabilitation strategy...|$|E

HCSE DFBlasers are conventional edge-emitting buried heterostructure (BH) DFB lasers with an integrated 45 deflection mirror at the front facet providing a beam deflection in the vertical direction. A careful optimisation of the devices towards extremely low operation currents allows for an operation of the device using commercially available VCSEL drivers. To our knowledge this has never been demonstrated so far. The devices can be directly modulated at bitrates ranging from 1 Gb/s to 10 Gb/s. Furthermore it could be shown, that the <b>integrated</b> <b>monitor</b> diode allows for a temperature independent control of the emitted optical output power.
