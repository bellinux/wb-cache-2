5|$|The turtle starts its day at sunrise, {{emerging}} from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage.

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|Adan met Ya'iri at Adan's former command post. Adan briefly {{explained}} the situation and, {{in a short}} discussion, Ya'iri laid out his plan. He was tasked with clearing Akavish and Tirtur. At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting {{with a sense of}} urgency, had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two years significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who {{were randomly assigned to}} the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E
5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, Either/Or received {{new life}} as a grand philosophical work {{with the publication of}} Alasdair MacIntyre's After Virtue (1981), where MacIntyre situates Either/Or as an attempt to capture the Enlightenment spirit set forth by David Hume and Immanuel Kant. After Virtue renewed Either/Or as an important ethical text in the Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> adopt an ethical way of life, many scholars have since replied to MacIntyre's accusation in Kierkegaard After MacIntyre.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He {{then opened the}} bowling and castled home captain Les Berry <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> {{make the first}} move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E
5|$|NSAIDs are {{the usual}} {{first-line}} treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly {{more or less}} effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two weeks. They are not recommended, however, in those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been {{the most commonly used}} NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects.|$|E

5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|The second-ever Elevation X {{match was}} held between Rhino and James Storm, who was {{accompanied}} by Jackie Moore. The bout lasted thirteen minutes and eighteen seconds. In an Elevation X match, both opponents fight on a scaffolding several feet above the ring, in which {{the only way to}} win is <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> fall off and down to the ring. The two brawled at ringside during the opening minutes. Rhino won the match after kicking Storm off the scaffold and down to the ring through a table.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, {{the inspiration for the}} form of the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumeré. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sit on a person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{young are}} born blind, gaining sight after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at three months, but {{remain in the}} birth den for six months before leaving to {{accompany}} their mother on hunts. They will continue in their mother's company <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two years before leaving to establish a territory for themselves. Young males are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.|$|E
5|$|The young may all hatch in {{a single}} night. Crocodilians are unusual among {{reptiles}} {{in the amount of}} parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and stay close to their mother. For spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan llanos, individual mothers are known to leave their young in the same nurseries, or crèches, and one of the mothers guards them. Hatchlings of many species tend to bask in a group during the day and disperse at nightfall to feed. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two years, while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.|$|E
5|$|Today at Omaha jagged {{remains of}} the harbor {{can be seen at}} low tide.

The beachfront is more built-up and the beach road extended, villages have grown and merged, but the geography of the beach remains as it was and the {{remains of the}} coastal defenses can still be visited. At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery. In 1988, particles of shrapnel, as well as glass and iron beads resulting from munitions explosions were found in the sand of the beach, and the study of them estimated that those particles would remain in the sand of the beach <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> two centuries.|$|E
