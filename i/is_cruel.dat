5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She <b>is</b> <b>cruel</b> and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
5|$|Babe {{is invited}} {{to return to work}} by Linda and is pleased when Abi is sacked after making an error. Babe visits Sylvie, who now lives with Tina, and belittles her. Later in the evening, Babe is locked in the Vic's kitchen freezer by an unknown assailant, {{although}} Linda and Whitney discover Babe and she makes a quick recovery. Linda accuses Claudette of being the culprit so Claudette exposes Babe's blackmailer secret to her. Mick and Linda are mortified, but forgive Babe. She later informs her family that Sylvie locked her in the freezer, but it transpires that Abi is the culprit and Babe realises this, but wants to readmit Sylvie into a care home. Linda later demands Babe return the money to the Cokers to avoid police interference, but Babe neglects the task so Mick warns her. She tries to earn the money by gambling and blackmailing Abi, but she mocks Babe's desperation. Linda issues Babe with a final warning so Babe decides to go to the bank, however she is delayed by Lee. Linda grows tired and evicts Babe, despite her returning all of the money. They later have a heart-to-heart where Babe explains that the money was placed into a bank account for Linda's infant son, Ollie Carter (Charlie) and says how she <b>is</b> <b>cruel</b> because it makes her feel better. Linda subsequently allows Babe to move back into the Vic.|$|E
5|$|Most {{animals are}} euthanized after {{being used in}} an experiment. Sources of {{laboratory}} animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority {{are caught in the}} wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights and some animal welfare organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it <b>is</b> <b>cruel</b> and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of animals}} in the circus has been {{controversial}} since animal welfare groups have documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals. Numerous instances of animal abuse in circuses have been documented such as confining enclosures, lack of regular veterinary care, abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies. Animal trainers have argued that some criticism {{is not based on}} fact, including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is going to hurt them, that caging <b>is</b> <b>cruel</b> and common, and the harm caused by the use of whips, chains or training implements.|$|E
25|$|Baddour {{subsequently}} sentenced Lovette to life {{in prison}} without the possibility of parole. Neither Lovette nor Carson's parents spoke before the sentence was handed down. On February 5, 2013, the North Carolina Court of Appeals vacated Lovette's life sentence and ordered a new sentencing hearing. The decision relied on Miller v. Alabama, where the Supreme Court ruled that a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole for defendants under 18 at the time of a crime <b>is</b> <b>cruel</b> and unusual punishment. On June 3, a re-sentencing hearing was held. After Baddour considered mitigating circumstances, Lovette was again sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{animal rights}} activists, {{such as those}} from the Flemish Bird Protection Society, accuse {{trainers}} of [...] "brainwashing" [...] birds into singing more than is natural or healthy by playing looped recordings of finch calls, and that caging birds in the intentionally small and dark contest boxes <b>is</b> <b>cruel.</b> The finch is a popular aviary bird in many countries and it is forbidden in the European Union to catch birds in the wild, despite vinkeniers purporting that wild birds sing better than captive ones. Though chaffinch populations are currently {{not considered to be}} threatened, a 2002 court case at the Belgian Constitutional Court upheld a 1979 EU law banning the capture of wild finches.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{introduction}} of muzzling for greyhounds in 1993, deaths to hares are less common, falling {{from an average of}} 16% to about 4% of hares coursed (reducing to around 150–200 hares per year). Muzzled dogs are more likely to buffet a hare than to bite it, a factor that may still affect the hare's subsequent survival. Hares can either die due to injuries sustained by contact with the much larger dogs or due to capture myopathy. The report from the official Countryside ranger at the Wexford Coursing Club meeting in December 2003 confirms that, exceptionally, 40 hares died at the event and the report of the veterinary surgeon who examined the hares blames the [...] "significant stress" [...] of being [...] "corralled and coursed". Coursing supporters deny that hare coursing <b>is</b> <b>cruel</b> and say that hares that are injured, pregnant or ill are not allowed to run. Hares are reported to be examined by a vet before and after racing.|$|E

500|$|Besides {{his growing}} {{attachments}} to {{the works of}} 20th century masters, Britten – along with his contemporary Michael Tippett – was devoted to the English music of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in particular the work of Purcell. In defining his mission as a composer of opera, Britten wrote: [...] "One of my chief aims {{is to try to}} restore to the musical setting of the English Language a brilliance, freedom and vitality that have been curiously rare since the death of Purcell". Among the closest of Britten's kindred composer spirits – even more so than Purcell – was Mahler, whose Fourth Symphony Britten heard in September 1930. At that time Mahler's music was little regarded and rarely played in English concert halls. Britten later wrote of how the scoring of this work impressed him: [...] "...entirely clean and transparent... the material was remarkable, and the melodic shapes highly original, with such rhythmic and harmonic tension from beginning to end". He soon discovered other Mahler works, in particular Das Lied von der Erde; he wrote to a friend about the concluding [...] "Abschied" [...] of Das Lied: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>cruel,</b> you know, that music should be so beautiful". Apart from Mahler's general influence on Britten's compositional style, the incorporation by Britten of popular tunes (as, for example, in Death in Venice) is a direct inheritance from the older composer.|$|E
500|$|Bart names his new {{elephant}} Stampy {{and ties}} {{him to a}} post in the backyard. Lisa begins complaining that keeping an elephant as a pet <b>is</b> <b>cruel,</b> while Homer is concerned that Stampy will eat him out of house and home. In an effort to offset food costs, Bart and Homer exhibit Stampy by charging customers to pet and ride him, but they fail to {{make enough money to}} cover the elephant's food costs for one day. Homer and Marge decide that their house is unsuitable for an elephant to live in, and that Stampy is way too expensive to maintain as a pet, and tell the children the elephant must go. The family is visited by a representative of a game reserve, who says their acres of open land similar to African Savannah would be a good habitat for the elephant to live in. However, as the family is pondering what to do about Stampy, a wildlife poacher named Mr. Blackheart offers to buy Stampy. Homer wants to take the money, but Lisa is against the idea — particularly since Mr. Blackheart openly admits he plans to have Stampy killed for his ivory tusks. Just as Homer and Mr. Blackheart reach a deal, [...] Stampy and Bart run off, wreaking havoc throughout Springfield, and are soon nowhere to be found. The family begins searching and finds them at the Springfield Tar Pits, where Homer gets stuck in one of the tar pits. Homer is freed by Stampy, and gratefully agrees to donate the elephant to a wildlife reserve.|$|E
