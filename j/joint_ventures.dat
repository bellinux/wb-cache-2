5|$|Starting {{with the}} parish of Olney, Buckinghamshire in 1714 several dozen {{small towns and}} {{individual}} parishes established their own institutions without any specific legal authorization. These were concentrated in the South Midlands and in the county of Essex. From the late 1710s the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge began to promote the idea of parochial workhouses. The Society published several pamphlets on the subject, and supported Sir Edward Knatchbull in his successful efforts to steer the Workhouse Test Act through parliament in 1723. The act gave legislative authority {{for the establishment of}} parochial workhouses, by both single parishes and as <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> between two or more parishes. More importantly, the Act helped to publicise the idea of establishing workhouses to a national audience. By 1776 some 1,912 parish and corporation workhouses had been established in England and Wales, housing almost 100,000 paupers. Perhaps one million people were receiving some kind of parish poor relief {{by the end of the}} century. Although many parishes and pamphlet writers expected to earn money from the labour of the poor in workhouses, the vast majority of people obliged to take up residence in workhouses were ill, elderly, or children whose labour proved largely unprofitable. The demands, needs and expectations of the poor also ensured that workhouses came to take on the character of general social policy institutions, combining the functions of creche, and night shelter, geriatric ward and orphanage. In 1782, Thomas Gilbert finally succeeded in passing an Act that established poor houses solely for the aged and infirm and introduced a system of outdoor relief for the able-bodied. This was the basis for the development of the Speenhamland system, which made financial provision for low-paid workers. Settlement Laws were altered by the Removal Act 1795 which prevented non-settled persons from being moved on unless they had applied for relief.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} dynamic {{evolution}} of a <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> that is initially formed due to the complementary strengths of two firms. We analyze {{the impact of the}} investment choices of the two partner firms on the fate of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture.</b> Investments that improve a firm 2 ̆ 7 s efficiency in the activity it performs in the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> (complementary investments) suffer from an incentive problem since benefits of such investments are shared between the two firms. To minimize the inefficiency caused by this incentive problem, the firm whose input is more valuable to the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> should receive a larger share of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> revenues. When each firm invests in learning about the activity performed by its partner (competing investments), the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> may itself fail since such investments reduce the synergy arising from complementarity. If firms can choose between the two types of investments, the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> suffers from a coordination problem and two type of equilibria coexist: one in which both firms make complementary investments and the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> survives with increased complementarity and another in which firms make competing investments and the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> is taken over by one of the partners...|$|R
