40|$|AbstractTraditional {{methods of}} {{transgene}} delivery in livestock are inefficient. Recently, {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV- 1) based lentiviral vectors {{have been shown to}} offer an efficient transgene delivery system. We now extend this method by demonstrating efficient generation of transgenic pigs using an equine infectious anaemia virus derived vector. We used this vector to deliver a green fluorescent protein expressing transgene; 31 % of injected/transferred eggs resulted in a transgenic <b>founder</b> <b>animal</b> and 95 % of founder animals displayed green fluorescence. This compares favourably with results using HIV- 1 based vectors, and is substantially more efficient than the standard pronuclear microinjection method, indicating that lentiviral transgene delivery may be a general tool with which to efficiently generate transgenic mammals...|$|E
40|$|In cultured {{mammalian}} cells, foreign DNA can {{be integrated}} into the host genome. Foreign DNA is frequently de novo methylated in specific patterns with successive cell generations. The sequence-specific methylation of promoter sequences in integrated foreign DNA is associated with the long-term inactivation of eukaryotic genes. We have now extended these experiments to studies on transgenic mice. As in previous work, a construct (pAd 2 E 2 AL-CAT) has been used which consists of the late E 2 A promoter of adenovirus type 2 (Ad 2) DNA fused to the prokaryotic gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). This construct has been integrated in the non-methylated in the 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' premethylated form in the genomes of transgenic mice. DNA from various organs was analyzed by HpaII/MspI cleavage to assess the state of methylation in 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' sequences. The results demonstrate that the transgenic construct is in general stable. Non-methylated constructs have remained partly non-methylated for four generations or can become de novo methylated at all or most 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' sequences in the <b>founder</b> <b>animal.</b> Preimposed patterns of 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' methylation have been preserved for up to four generations beyond the <b>founder</b> <b>animal.</b> In the testes of two different founder animals and two F 1 males, the transgenic DNA has become demethylated by an unknown mechanism. In all other organs, the transgenic DNA preserves the preimposed 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' methylation pattern. In the experiments performed so far we have not observed differences in the transmission of methylation patterns depending on whether the transgene has been maternally or paternally inherited. The 5 '-CCGG- 3 ' premethylated transgene does not catalyze CAT activity in several organs, except in one example of the testes of an animal in which the transgenic construct has become demethylated. In contrast, when the nonmethylated construct has been integrated and remained largely non-methylated, CAT activity has been detected in extracts from some of the organs...|$|E

Two of the <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> passed the transgene to progeny, and one line was bred to homozygosity. The line of mice homozygous for the transgene expressed E 1 A-specific RNA at a low level in their eyes; no expression could be deteded in other tissues that were tested. Either the <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> or their progeny exhibited developmental abnormalities of their eyes, including a small eye phenotype, retinal dysplasia, anterior cleavage syndrome, and retinal pigment epithelium dysplasia.

40|$|Transgenic mice {{have been}} {{generated}} which carry the early region of lymphotropic papovavirus (LPV). Eight of eleven <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> died before 3 {{months of age}} after developing {{one or both of}} two distinct proliferative disorders. Of the three surviving animals, two are known to have rearranged or partial copies of the LPV genes. The majority of the <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> (six) developed debilitating choroid plexus tumors by 26 to 42 days. Although this is the same tumor type induced by the simian virus 40 T-antigen gene, those induced by LPV appeared at a much younger age. The LPV early region was expressed in the brain tumors of these mice, {{as well as in the}} thymus and spleen. Expression in the latter two tissues reflects the cell-type specificity of the LPV enhancer demonstrated in cultured cells (i. e., lymphoid cells). Two <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> (LP 41 and LP 50) gave rise to lines of mice that routinely develop lymphoproliferative disorders. LP 50 and its LPV-positive offspring developed aggressive lymphomas and choroid plexus tumors. The transgenic offspring of LP 41 also developed lymphomas. High levels of LPV RNA were expressed in the lymphomas of these mice as well as in the spleens and thymuses. The origin of the lymphomas from B- and T-cell lineages suggests that the LPV early genes are expressed in and can transform both of these cell types in vivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of the causative genetic variants in quantitative trait loci (QTL) influencing phenotypic traits is challenging, especially in crosses between outbred strains. We have previously identified several QTL influencing tameness and aggression in a cross between two lines of wild-derived, outbred rats (Rattus norvegicus) selected for their behavior towards humans. Here, we use targeted sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing of all genes in the strongest QTL in the <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> of the cross. We identify many novel sequence variants, several of which are potentially functionally relevant. The QTL contains several regions where either the tame or the aggressive founders contain no sequence variation, and two regions where alternative haplotypes are fixed between the founders. A re-analysis of the QTL signal showed that the causative site {{is likely to be}} fixed among the tame <b>founder</b> <b>animals,</b> but that several causative alleles may segregate among the aggressive <b>founder</b> <b>animals.</b> Using a formal test for the detection of positive selection, we find 10 putative positively selected regions, some of which are close to genes known to influence behavior. Together, these results show that the QTL is probably not caused by a single selected site, but may instead represent the joint effects of several sites that were targets of polygenic selection.

40|$|We {{describe}} a protocol for high-efficiency germline transgenesis and sustained transgene expression in two important biomedical models, the mouse and the rat, {{by using the}} Sleeping Beauty transposon system. The procedure is based on co-injection of synthetic mRNARNARNA encoding the SB 100 X hyperactive transposase, together with circular plasmid DNANA carrying a transgene construct flanked by binding sites for the transposase, into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes. Upon translation of the transposase mRNARNARNA, enzyme-mediated excision of the transgene cassettes from the injected plasmids followed by permanent genomic insertion produces stable transgenic animals. Generation of a germline-transgenic <b>founder</b> <b>animal</b> by using this protocol takes ~ 3 months.

40|$|Two {{transgenic}} mice {{were produced}} by microinjection {{of the entire}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome as a 3. 2 -kilobase EcoRI DNA fragment into one-cell embryos. Each animal contained a single, unique locus of HBV sequence. One <b>founder</b> <b>animal,</b> G 7, contained a partially deleted HBV genome lacking both putative HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) promoters. The other animal, G 26, contained greater-than-genome-length HBV sequences organized as a partial head-to-tail dimer. Both transgenic animals transmitted the HBV sequences in a Mendelian fashion, and all subsequent transgenic animals had detectable HBsAg in the serum. Expression of HBV sequences in tissues from G 7 - and G 26 -derived mice showed preferential expression of the 2. 1 -kilobase HBsAg RNA transcript in liver and kidney tissues by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. These data {{are consistent with the}} notion that HBV DNA contains cis-acting regulatory sequences which are responsible for the predominant expression of HBsAg transcripts in the liver and kidney of transgenic mice...|$|E

In addition, the rabbit is the smallest livestock animal that is used to transgenically produce pharmaceutical proteins in its milk. Here we describe a protocol for high-efficiency germline transgenesis and sustained transgene expression in rabbits by using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system. The protocol is based on co-injection into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes of synthetic mRNARNARNA encoding the SB 100 X hyperactive transposase together with plasmid DNANA carrying a transgene construct flanked by binding sites for the transposase.

40|$|A small genetic region {{near the}} {{telomere}} of ovine chromosome 18 was previously shown {{to carry the}} mutation causing the callipyge muscle hypertrophy phenotype in sheep. Expression of this phenotype is the only known case in mammals of paternal polar overdominance gene action. A region surrounding two positional candidate genes was sequenced in animals of known genotype. Mutation detection focused on an inbred ram of callipyge phenotype postulated to have inherited chromosome segments identical-by-descent with exception of the mutated position. In support of this hypothesis, this inbred ram was homozygous over 210 Kb of sequence, except for a single heterozygous base position. This single polymorphism was genotyped in multiple families segregating the callipyge locus (CLPG), providing 100 % concordance with animals of known CLPG genotype, and was unique to descendants of the <b>founder</b> <b>animal.</b> The mutation lies in a region of high homology among mouse, sheep, cattle, and humans, but not in any previously identified expressed transcript.

40|$|It {{had been}} {{observed}} that many male Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) on Kodiak Island, Alaska, had abnormal antlers, were cryptorchid, and presented {{no evidence of}} hypospadias. We sought {{to better understand the}} problem and investigated 171 male deer for phenotypic aberrations and 12 for detailed testicular histopathology. For the low-lying Aliulik Peninsula (AP), 61 of 94 deer were bilateral cryptorchids (BCOs); 70 % of these had abnormal antlers. Elsewhere on the Kodiak Archipelago, only 5 of 65 deer were BCOs. All 11 abdominal testes examined had no spermatogenesis but contained abnormalities including carcinoma in situ–like cells, possible precursors of seminoma; Sertoli cell, Leydig cell, and stromal cell tumors; carcinoma and adenoma of rete testis; and microlithiasis or calcifications. Cysts also were evident within the excurrent ducts. Two of 10 scrotal testes contained similar abnormalities, although spermatogenesis was ongoing. We cannot rule out that these abnormalities are linked sequelae of a mutation(s) in a <b>founder</b> <b>animal,</b> followed by transmission over many years and causing high prevalence only on the AP. However, based on lesions observed, we hypothesize that {{it is more likely that}} this testis–antler dysgenesis resulted from continuing exposure of pregnant females to an estrogenic environmental agent(s), thereby transforming testicular cells, affecting development of primordial antler pedicles, and blocking transabdominal descent of fetal testes.

40|$|A {{widespread}} {{increase in}} SpmS (spermine synthase) activity has been produced in transgenic mice using a construct {{in which the}} human SpmS cDNA was placed {{under the control of}} a composite CMV-IE (cytomegalovirus immediate early gene) enhancer–chicken β-actin promoter. Four separate founder CAG/SpmS mice were studied. Transgenic expression of SpmS was found in all of the tissues examined, but the relative SpmS activities varied widely according to the <b>founder</b> <b>animal</b> and the tissue studied. Very large increases in SpmS activity were seen in many tissues. SpdS (spermidine synthase) activity was not affected. Although there was a statistically significant decline in spermidine content and increase in spermine, the alterations were small compared with the increase in SpmS activity. These results provide strong support for the concept that the levels of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine are not determined only by the relative activities of the two aminopropyltransferases. Other factors such as availability of the aminopropyl donor substrate decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine and possibly degradation or excretion must also influence the spermidine/spermine ratio. No deleterious effects of SpmS overexpression were seen. The mice had normal growth, fertility and behaviour up to the age of 12  months. However, breeding the CAG/SpmS mice with MHC (α-myosin heavy chain) /AdoMetDC (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase) mice, which have a large increase in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase expression in heart, was lethal. In contrast, breeding the CAG/SpmS mice with MHC/ODC (L-ornithine decarboxylase) mice, which have a large increase in cardiac ornithine decarboxylase expression, had a protective effect in preventing the small decrease in viability of the MHC/ODC mice...|$|E

Here, we report a process of CRISPR/Cas-mediated knock-in via non-homologous end joining by the direct injection of Cas 9 /gRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) in the crustacean Daphnia magna, which is a model organism for studies on toxicology, ecology, and evolution. First, we confirmed the cleavage activity of Cas 9 RNPs comprising purified Cas 9 proteins and gRNAs in D. magna. We used a gRNA that targets exon 10 of the eyeless gene. Cas 9 proteins were incubated with the gRNAs and the resulting Cas 9 RNPs were injected into D. magna eggs, {{which led to a}} typical phenotype of the eyeless mutant, i. e., eye deformity. The somatic and heritable mutagenesis efficiencies were up to 96 % and 40 %, respectively. Second, we tested the CRISPR/Cas-mediated knock-in of a plasmid by the injection of Cas 9 RNPs. The donor DNA plasmid harboring the fluorescent reporter gene was designed to contain the gRNA recognition site. The co-injection of Cas 9 RNPs together with the donor DNAs resulted in generation of one <b>founder</b> <b>animal</b> that produced fluorescent progenies. This transgenic Daphnia had donor DNA at the targeted genomic site, which suggested the concurrent cleavage of the injected plasmid DNA and genomic DNA.

The abil-ity to propagate a <b>founder</b> <b>animal</b> by application of assisted re-productive technologies is pressing, but an even greater need in many studies is access to genetically identical animals. In an effort to create genetically identical monkeys, we evaluated two approaches to monozygotic twinning; blastomere separation, and blastocyst bisection. Embryos were produced by intracyto-plasmic sperm injection of oocytes recovered following con-trolled ovarian stimulation. The quality of demiembryos pro-duced in these efforts was evaluated by quantitating the effi-ciency of creating identical pairs for embryo transfer, by mor-phological assessment, by the allocation of cells to the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) in the blastocyst, and by the outcome of embryo transfer to synchronized host animals. Pairs were produced in high yield (85 %– 95 %) by both twinning methods. Demiembryos resulting from blastomere separations at the 2 - or 4 -cell stage grew to blastocysts at the control frequen-cy. Demiblastocysts contained, on average, half the number of cells of the intact controls while maintaining the same ICM:TE or ICM:total cell ratio. The equivalency of demiblastocysts with-in a set was also evaluated by differential cell counting. Embryo transfers of identical sets led to a 33 % clinical pregnancy rate, with two twin pregnancies initiated.

40|$|Three founder {{transgenic}} mice {{were generated}} with a 108 kb human genomic fragment containing the entire autosomal dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD) gene, PKD 1, plus the tuberous sclerosis gene, TSC 2. Two lines were established (TPK 1 and TPK 3) each with approximately 30 copies of the transgene. Both lines produced full-length PKD 1 mRNA and polycystin- 1 protein that was developmentally regulated, similar to the endogenous pattern, with expression during renal embryogenesis and neonatal life, markedly reduced {{at the conclusion of}} renal development. Tuberin expression was limited to the brain. Transgenic animals from both lines (and the TPK 2 <b>founder</b> <b>animal)</b> often displayed a renal cystic phenotype, typically consisting of multiple microcysts, mainly of glomerular origin. Hepatic cysts and bile duct proliferation, characteristic of ADPKD, were also seen. All animals with two copies of the transgenic chromosome developed cysts and, in total, 48 of the 100 transgenic animals displayed a cystic phenotype. To test the functionality of the transgene, animals were bred with the Pkd 1 (del 34) knockout mouse. Both transgenic lines rescued the embryonically lethal Pkd 1 (del 34 /del 34) phenotype, demonstrating that human polycystin- 1 can complement for loss of the endogenous protein. The rescued animals were viable into adulthood, although more than half developed hepatic cystic disease in later life, similar to the phenotype of older Pkd 1 (del 34 /+) animals. The TPK mice have defined a minimal area that appropriately expresses human PKD 1. Furthermore, this model indicates that over-expression of normal PKD 1 can elicit a disease phenotype, suggesting that the level of polycystin- 1 expression may be relevant in the human disease...|$|E

40|$|We {{identified}} a congenital mechanobullous skin disorder in six calves {{on a single}} farm of an endangered German cattle breed in 2010. The condition presented as a large loss of skin distal to the fetlocks and at the mucosa of the muzzle. All affected calves were euthanized on humane grounds due to the severity, extent and progression of the skin and oral lesions. Examination of skin samples under light microscopy revealed detachment of the epidermis from the dermis {{at the level of}} the dermo epidermal junction, leading to the diagnosis of a subepidermal bullous dermatosis such as epidermolysis bullosa. The pedigree was consistent with monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance. We localized the causative mutation to an 18 Mb interval on chromosome 22 by homozygosity mapping. The COL 7 A 1 gene encoding collagen type VII alpha 1 is located within this interval and COL 7 A 1 mutations have been shown to cause inherited dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) in humans. A SNP in the bovine COL 7 A 1 exon 49 (c. 4756 C. T) was perfectly associated with the observed disease. The homozygous mutant T/T genotype was exclusively present in affected calves and their parents were heterozygous C/T confirming the assumed recessive mode of inheritance. All known cases and genotyped carriers were related to a single cow, which is supposed to be the <b>founder</b> <b>animal.</b> The mutant T allele was absent in 63 animals from 24 cattle breeds.

These new technologies include producing GE animals by somatic cell cloning, zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) - and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) -mediated genome engineering, and extensive genetic modification by sequential gene targeting. Using GE animals to address unmet medical needs, such as producing large quantities of fully human therapeutic antibodies in a transchromosomic (Tc) bovine system, has become a reality. There is great potential in using GE animals for biomedical applications. However, while tremendous breakthroughs and technological innovations continue, maneuvering through highly innovative research and development into regulatory approval and commercialization of valuable animal biotechnology products that are needed and wanted by consumers, physicians, and patients is challenging. Many complicated, rigorous, and often expensive steps are required, which should be considered during early stages of developing applications in GE animals.

This captive population was derived from seven founders. In order to compare the genetic structure of the Gir Forest population {{with that of the}} captive SSP population, a genetic survey of 46 electrophoretic allozyme systems resolved from extracts of lion blood was undertaken by using 29 SSP Asiatic lions and 28 wild-caught or captive-bred lions maintained at the Sakkarbaug Zoo in India but originally derived from the Gir Forest. The Gir lion population was found to be genetically monomorphic at each of 46 allozyme loci.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a common}} disease in which loss of bone mass results in {{skeletal}} fragility. The development of therapies for this disorder has been hampered {{by the lack of}} a convenient animal model. Here we describe a disorder in bone homeostasis in transgenic mice that inappropriately express the cytokine interleukin 4 (IL- 4) {{under the direction of the}} lymphocyte-specific proximal promoter for the lck gene. Bone disease in lck-IL- 4 mice appeared to result from markedly decreased bone formation by osteoblasts, features strikingly similar to those observed in cases of severe low-turnover human involutional osteoporosis. By 2 months of age, female and male lck-IL- 4 mice invariably developed severe osteoporosis of both cortical and trabecular bone. Osteoporosis was observed in two independently derived <b>founder</b> <b>animals,</b> indicating that this phenotype was directly mediated by the IL- 4 transgene...|$|R
30|$|Although founder # 8 and # 9 both harbored W 272 stop {{conversion}} at Tyr locus, none of {{the nine}} newborns (Experiment 1) displayed the albino phenotype of white skin indicating incomplete gene disruption (Fig.  1 E). For those pups from BE 3 combined with Tyr-sg 1 + 2 + 7 and Pdcd 1 -sg 1 + 2 + 3, 8 out of 11 newborns (Founder # 1, # 2, # 4, # 5, # 15 – 18) displayed Tyr-deficient mice phenotype indicating the increased Tyr gene disruption efficiency mediated by multiple sgRNA i-stop strategy. Interestingly, all of the phenotypic mice show white skin over whole body instead of black-and-white skin, the mosaic phenotype which displayed by mice harboring mosaic gene disruption of Tyr as previous reported (Zuo et al., 2017). These data further suggest multiple sgRNAs facilitated i-stop conversion and gene disruption, which allows phenotype analysis of <b>founder</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
40|$|Independent {{transgenic}} mouse lines carrying the mouse Mos protooncogene {{linked to a}} retroviral transcriptional control sequence display behavioral abnormalities including circling, head tilting, and head bobbing. This dominant phenotype shows various degrees of penetrance in different transgenic <b>founder</b> <b>animals</b> and lines. Neuronal and axonal degeneration, gliosis, and inflammatory infiltrates are found in all {{transgenic mouse}} lines in which behavioral traits are present. Recordings of auditory-evoked potentials in mice {{of one of these}} lines demonstrate that transgenic mice are deaf; in these mice spiral ganglia degenerate and most of the cochlear hair cells are absent. By using an S 1 nuclease protection assay, we have detected RNA expression of the transgene in all tissues examined and, in particular, at high levels in brain. In situ hybridization experiments show that Mos expression can be detected in specific areas of the central nervous system. Lesions are present in areas with demonstrable overexpression of Mos...|$|R
