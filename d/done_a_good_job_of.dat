500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] Which is my roundabout way of saying that while I wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A+", its fourth such rating for the series, after [...] "An Echolls Family Christmas", [...] "Clash of the Tritons", and [...] "M.A.D.".|$|E
500|$|Margarita with a Straw premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, and {{was also}} {{screened}} at Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, 19th Busan International Film Festival, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The film garnered positive reviews, and Koechlin widespread attention and universal acclaim for her portrayal of a disabled person. While Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter made a detailed note of her [...] "bravura performance in both physical and emotional terms", NDTV film critic Saibal Chatterjee straightforwardly deemed her [...] "absolutely brilliant". Firstposts Deepanjana Pal ascribed her screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, and wrote [...] " [...] has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> miming the physicality but what is truly remarkable {{is the lack of}} artifice in her expressions". John Beifuss compared her performance to Eddie Redmayne's act as Stephen Hawking in the biographical drama, The Theory of Everything, in his review for The Commercial Appeal. He gave Koechlin the highest praise writing that her performance would have attracted Academy Award notice in a major film studio production. The view was echoed by Variety critic Guy Lodge, who was particularly impressed by her range. Koechlin won several accolades for the film, including the Best Actress Award at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Jury Award at the 63rd National Film Awards.
