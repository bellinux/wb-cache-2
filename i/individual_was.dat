5|$|To that point, {{the federal}} government, through Elections Canada, assumed {{responsibility}} for ensuring that every eligible elector was registered for each electoral event. For the 1988 federal general election, this required about 110,000 enumerators, who would canvass door-to-door so {{the cost and}} effort to the <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> minimal.|$|E
30|$|Different from NSGA-II, the {{parallel}} selection {{method is adopted}} for random population optimization to improve the convergence speed of a GA. The specific strategies are as follows: (1) a population with M <b>individuals</b> <b>is</b> randomly generated for iMTSP and (2) the M <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> ordered by different objectives and the best m individuals of each objective function are preserved. If the number of <b>individuals</b> <b>is</b> not achieved, the best m+ 1 <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> preserved until M <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> generated. It {{is worth noting that}} duplicate <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> deleted in the preservation of optimal individuals. The new population is the initial population of the subsequent genetic algorithm.|$|R

30|$|In this work, the {{big five}} factors model is opted for {{measuring}} personality traits that classify personality of users into five agents: Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience. Highly extraverted <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> self-assured and warm, rather than calm and cautious. Agreeable <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> coordinated and courteous. Conscientious <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> organized and precise. Neurotic <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> not prone to be emotionally resilient. Lastly, highly openness <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> receptiveness and prefer innovation to the routine. The Big Five can state {{as much of the}} variation in individuals’ personalities as possible, using a small set of trait dimensions.|$|R
5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House {{was that of}} a 'community where every <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> {{encouraged}} to feel that she had a real object'. Having seen the benefit, in the United States and at Octavia Hill, she combined medical interventions with education and recreational approaches. She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia is a genus of therocephalian therapsid {{that lived}} during the Late Permian, {{approximately}} 255 million years ago, {{in what is}} now South Africa. The genus contains a single species, E. mirabilis, named by paleontologist Robert Broom in 1931 from a skull missing the lower jaws; a second skull, belonging to an immature <b>individual,</b> <b>was</b> later described. It {{is a member of the}} family Akidnognathidae, which historically has also been referred by as the synonymous Euchambersiidae (named after Euchambersia).|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Hungarian {{newspaper}} Life and Literature {{revealed that}} Szabó {{had been an}} informant of the Communist regime's secret police. Between 1957 and 1961, he submitted forty-eight reports on seventy-two people, mostly classmates and teachers at the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. According to historian Istvan Deak, only in one case did Szabó's informing cause significant damage, when an <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> denied a passport.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the secular politics that impacted them, papal elections during this period were marked by a strategy among elite families to acquire prestige and power.

5|$|On 17 October 2011 a man fell at {{approximately}} 17:40 or 17:50 from the 17:04 service from London to Brussels {{as it passed}} through Westenhanger and Cheriton in Folkestone, near the entry to the Channel Tunnel. The <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> an Albanian who had been refused entry to the United Kingdom and was voluntarily returning to Brussels. The line was handed back at 22:09 after being closed for several hours following the incident. The train itself returned north to Ashford International, where passengers were transferred to a Eurostar service operating from Marne-la-Vallée to London, where passengers arrived again {{at approximately}} 22:30.|$|E
5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} hole in the jugal which appears to be a puncture wound that was sustained while this <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the hole in the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Within these stages, both <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> {{interacting}} {{in a game}} {{which is}} never explicit, this is because if either <b>individual</b> <b>were</b> to be rejected this would damage their self-esteem. Therefore, when seducing, the overarching aims and goals are never vocalised to the other desired <b>individual.</b> This <b>is</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} paradoxical exhibition.|$|R

5|$|Salanoia durrelli, {{also known}} as Durrell's vontsira, is a Madagascan mammal in the family Eupleridae of the order Carnivora. It is most {{closely related to the}} brown-tailed {{mongoose}} (Salanoia concolor), with which it forms the genus Salanoia. The two are genetically similar, but morphologically distinct, leading scientists to recognize them as separate species. After an <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> observed in 2004, the animal became known to science and S.durrelli was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the Lac Alaotra area.|$|E
5|$|The Bubal {{hartebeest}} {{has been}} declared extinct since 1994. German explorer Heinrich Barth, in his works of 1857, cites firearms and European intrusion among {{the reasons for the}} decrease in its numbers. It was extinct in Tunisia by the late 19th century.

5|$|The Lahaut {{assassination}} was not solved, and {{it remains}} contentious as the only political murder in Belgian history apart from {{the death of the}} socialist politician André Cools in 1991. Leopoldists were suspected, but no <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> prosecuted in the aftermath. An enquiry by historians Rudy Van Doorslaer and Etienne Verhoeyen named an alleged culprit. A final report, commissioned by the Belgian government, was submitted in 2015.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study the comet assay was {{performed}} in buccal epithelial cells to evaluate DNA damage among pan masala or gutkha chewers and smokers. The assay is a rapid, suitable and sensitive method for detecting various forms of DNA damage at individual cell level. The study comprises 300 individuals of which 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> gutkha chewers along with smoking, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> pan masala chewers along with smoking, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> gutkha chewers, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> pan masala chewers, 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> smokers and 50 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> non-users (control) or not having any addiction. Comet tail length was observed to measure the extent of DNA damage. In all groups {{a significant increase in}} the tail length was observed as compared to the non-users (control). The highest tail length was observed among gutkha chewers along with smoking (36. 9 ± 3. 60). The results of {{the present study}} suggest that the panmasala and gutkha are genotoxic agents and induce DNA damage...|$|R

50|$|In an {{autosomal}} recessive disease, if an <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> heterozygous for the mutant allele, {{they are a}} carrier because the disease is recessive. If homozygous, they have the disease. All offspring of an affected <b>individual</b> <b>are</b> either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutated allele. Consequently, all unaffected (heterozygous) offspring of an affected <b>individual</b> <b>are</b> obligate carriers of the disease because they will necessarily carry the mutated allele.|$|R
5|$|Thelema is a {{rarely used}} in {{classical}} Greek. There {{are very few}} documents, the earliest being Antiphon the Sophist (5th century BCE).

5|$|They are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{and sometimes}} eat carrion, making them {{one of the}} few snakes to do so. Campbell and Lamar (2004) described having seen them feeding on fish heads and viscera that had been thrown into the water from a dock.

5|$|Waxwings can eat {{huge numbers}} of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> found with a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and {{cochineal}} insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This <b>individual</b> <b>was</b> even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel.
