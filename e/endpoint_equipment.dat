The ICPT program 2012 covers the following topical interests - front-end dielectrics - front-end metals - <b>equipment,</b> <b>endpoint</b> and control - 3 D, TSV & MEMS - consumables metrology - fundamentals - new CMP applications - consumable...|$|R
50|$|Aside from {{changes to}} the network (wires and {{switching}} and management) a well designed future-proof wireless network may not require much change at the <b>endpoints.</b> All <b>equipment</b> used in a wireless backhaul configuration supports simultaneous dual band communication (one band for user communication, another for the backhaul). Almost all such equipment also supports wired connections, typically using power over Ethernet or (less often in outdoor applications) unpowered Ethernet. So assuming reasonable software flexibility, both bands can be repurposed to user connectivity while the backhaul shifts to a wired connection. Unless nodes are entirely self-powered, they are connected at least indirectly to an AC or DC power source, suggesting that the single-cable solutions (power over Ethernet DC and IEEE P1901 AC) for both power and data should dominate for low-power shorter-range nodes, especially municipal Wi-Fi projects in low usage rural areas.|$|R
