60|$|In the spring, indeed, {{the valleys}} are brightened by many flowers--wild tulips, peonies, crocuses and {{several kinds of}} polyanthus; and among the fruits the water melon, some small grapes and {{mulberries}} are excellent, although in their production, nature is unaided by culture. But during the campaign, which these pages describe, the <b>hot</b> <b>sun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer had burnt up all the flowers, {{and only a few}} splendid butterflies, whose wings of blue and green change colour in the light, like shot silk, contrasted with the sternness of the landscape.|$|E
60|$|This {{apparent}} {{waste is}} explained by some naturalists by the statement that these scattered eggs are intended for the food of the young ones when they are hatched. This may be true; but in that case young ostriches cannot be very particular about {{the flavor of the}} eggs they eat. A few days in the <b>hot</b> <b>sun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert would be very likely to make eggs of any kind taste rather strongly. But ostrich eggs are so large, and their shells are so thick, that they may keep better than the eggs to which we are accustomed.|$|E
60|$|Just {{beyond the}} second ridge of rock which Maka had discovered, the stream {{ran into a}} little bay, and the shores near its mouth showed evident signs that they had {{recently}} been washed by a flood. On points of rock and against {{the sides of the}} sand mounds, he saw bits of debris from the Rackbirds' camp. Here were sticks which had formed the timbers of their huts; there were pieces of clothing and cooking-utensils; and here and there, partly buried by the shifting sands, were seen the bodies of Rackbirds, already desiccated by the dry air and the <b>hot</b> <b>sun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region.

60|$|You figure her, I hope, {{with her}} white bundle, {{a sort of}} erect black ant, hurrying along the little white path-thread athwart the downland slopes under the <b>hot</b> <b>sun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summer afternoon. On she {{struggled}} after her resolute indefatigable nose, and the poppies in her bonnet quivered perpetually and her spring-side boots grew whiter and whiter with the downland dust. Flip-flap, flip-flap went her footfalls through the still heat of the day, and persistently, incurably, her umbrella sought to slip from under the elbow that retained it. The mouth wrinkle under her nose was pursed to an extreme resolution, and ever and again she told her umbrella to come up or gave her tightly clutched bundle a vindictive jerk. And at times her lips mumbled with fragments of some foreseen argument between herself and Skinner.|$|E
60|$|But my father; {{my beloved}} and most wretched father? Would he die? Would he never {{overcome}} the fierce passion that now held pityless dominion over him? Might he not many, many years hence, when age had quenched the burning sensations {{that he now}} experienced, might he not then be again a father to me? This reflection unwrinkled my brow, and I could feel (and I wept to feel it) a half melancholy smile draw from my lips their expression of suffering: I dared indulge better hopes for my future life; years must pass but they would speed lightly away winged by hope, or if they passed heavily, still they would pass and I had not lost my father for ever. Let him spend another sixteen years of desolate wandering: let him once more utter his wild complaints to the vast woods and the tremendous cataracts of another clime: let him again undergo fearful danger and soul-quelling hardships: let the <b>hot</b> <b>sun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south again burn his passion worn cheeks and the cold night rains fall on him and chill his blood.|$|E

60|$|It {{is curious}} and {{interesting}} to note the apparently insignificant instruments which God has seen fit {{to use in the}} carrying out of his plans. The smallest coral insect that builds its little cell in the southern seas exercises an influence in the production of the Gulf Stream. It has been said, with some degree of truth, that one such insect is capable of setting in motion the entire ocean! The coral insect has, in common with many other marine creatures, been gifted with the power of extracting from sea water the lime which it contains, in order to build its cell. The lime thus extracted leaves a minute particle of water necessarily destitute of that substance. Before that particle can be restored to its original condition of equality, every other particle of water in the ocean must part with a share of its superabundant lime! The thing must be done. That bereaved particle cannot rest without its lime. It forthwith commences to travel for the purpose of laying its brother-particles under contribution; and it travels far and wide--round and round the world. Myriads upon myriads of coral insects are perpetually engaged in thus robbing the sea water of its lime; shells are formed in a similar manner: so that our particle soon finds itself in company with innumerable other particles of water in a like destitute condition. It rises to the surface. Here the sun, as if to compensate it for the loss of its lime, bestows upon it an unusual amount of heat; and the surrounding particles, not to be outdone, make it almost unlimited presents of salt. Full to overflow with the gifts of its new companions, it hastens to bestow of its superabundance on less favoured particles; joins the great army of the ocean's currents; enters, perchance, the Gulf of Mexico, where it is turned back, and hastens along with the Gulf Stream, with all its natural warmth of character, to ameliorate the climate of Great Britain and the western shores of Europe. Having accomplished this benevolent work, it passes on, with some of its heat and vigour still remaining, to the arctic seas--where it is finally robbed of all its heat and nearly all its salt, and frozen into an icicle--there for many a long day to exert a chilling influence on the waters and the atmosphere around it. Being melted at last by the <b>hot</b> <b>sun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short arctic summer, it hurries back with the cold currents of the north to the genial regions of the equator, in search of its lost caloric and salt, taking in a full cargo of lime, etcetera, as it passes the mouths of rivers. Arrived at its old starting-point, our wanderer receives once more heat and salt to the full, parts with its lime, and at once hastens off on a new voyage of usefulness--to give out of its superabundance in exchange for the superabundance of others: thus quietly teaching man the lesson that the true principles of commerce were carried out {{in the depths of the}} sea ages before he discovered them and carried them into practice on its surface.|$|E
