50|$|The {{division}} {{fought in}} Tunisia, where Montgomery launched his major attack, Operation Pugilist, against the Mareth Line {{in the night}} of 19 March 1943 - 20 March 1943. The 69th Infantry Brigade part of 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, with difficulty, penetrated the Italian <b>held</b> <b>line</b> near Zarat. The terrain and heavy rain, however, prevented deployment of tanks and anti-tank guns and the 15th Panzer Division's counter-attack on 22 March recaptured much of the bridgehead.|$|E
50|$|The first {{operation}} {{planned for}} the Desert Mounted Corps was to breakthrough the Turkish lines, in southern Palestine, which stretched for 30 mi from Beersheba in the east to the Mediterranean coast at Gaza in the west. Once Beersheba was secured the mounted troops would be concentrated on the British right to cut off and destroy the retreating Turkish forces. Any mounted attack on Beersheba would require a march of 70 mi over dry and unknown country. So prior to the attack a reconnaissance of the Turkish positions was carried out mapping tracks and wadi crossings. Chauvel deployed his corps, with one division forward occupying a lightly <b>held</b> <b>line</b> between Shellal and El Gamli. Which was also responsible for short patrols into no man's land and longer patrols to reconnoitre the Turkish defences. A second division supported the front line based around Abasan el Kebir. While the third division was resting at Tel el Marrakeb. Each month the divisions moved around so no one division spent longer at the front than was necessary.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is described for reducing miss latency in coherent-cache sharedmemory parallel computers. Miss latency {{is reduced by}} speculatively invalidating and downgrading (copying an exclusively <b>held</b> <b>line</b> back to memory) cache lines at one processor that might be needed at another processor. A line becomes a candidate for speculative invalidation when another line last accessed by the same instruction is invalidated. A line becomes a candidate for speculative downgrading under corresponding conditions. The technique can be implemented by constructing linked lists of lines for recent memory access instructions. The amount of memory needed by an implementation {{is little more than}} 11 % the size of the cache. No time need be added to cache hits. In execution-driven simulations of such systems running programs from the SPLASH 2 suite invalidations and downgrades are reduced by 50 % or more.

40|$|A {{framework}} is developed to calculate reliability from the passengers perspective in a multilevel public transit network. The major variables that impact reliability for transfers passengers are identified as: scheduled transfer time, headways of connecting lines, variation of vehicle operations, transfer walking time and proportion of transferring passengers. These variables are {{examined in the}} context of changing the scheduled transfer time in a hypothetical network and in the case that a holding strategy is added at the transfer point. It is shown that a trade-off exists between scheduled transfer time and reliability. Holding at a transfer point can be beneficial to passengers transferring to the <b>held</b> <b>line,</b> depending on the scheduled transfer time. The calculation method is applied to a cost-benefit analysis to a small example using data from the tram network in The Hague, Netherlands. Benefits to passengers are quantified from changes to the magnitude of a passenger’s travel time, including scheduled travel time and additional travel time, as well as the width of the travel time distribution using the reliability ratio as a value for reliability. Although it is difficult to set a schedule that benefits different groups of transferring passengers, it is possible to realize travel time and reliability benefits through scheduling.
