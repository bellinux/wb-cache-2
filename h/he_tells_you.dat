500|$|Dalglish {{was pleased}} with Liverpool's game and told the press: [...] "The most {{important}} thing is that we got our own standard of football right. We were the better team in all departments and we know that if we get it right then we will be there or thereabouts." [...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> where to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of White's [...] "showmanship" [...] and affectations. Since the beginning, critics have debated the [...] "riddle" [...] of White's {{self-awareness}} against his claims of authenticity, with people falling {{on both sides of the}} issue. Joe Hagan of The New York Times asked in 2001, [...] "Is Mr. White, a 25-year-old former upholsterer from southwest Detroit, concocting this stuff with a wink? Or are the White Stripes simply naïve?" [...] Alexis Petridis, of The Guardian, said that White [...] "makes for an enigmatic figure. Not because he's particularly difficult or guarded, but simply because what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> suggests a lifelong penchant for inscrutable behaviour." [...] White himself confesses, [...] "Sometimes I think I'm a simple guy, but I think the reality is I'm really complicated, as simple as I wish I was".|$|E
2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and {{wants to talk to you}} about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group. But the really interesting possibility is that he may be all three and that none of those three institutions have any problem with the arrangement." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> so?" [...] The {{question}} left Rowland's lips {{before he}} could stay it, which {{he would have done}} on a moment's reflection.|$|R
6000|$|... "He lunched with us one {{day when}} father had gout. Didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about it? <b>He</b> said {{he was coming to}} see you that afternoon." ...|$|R
2500|$|Such {{views were}} shared by politologist Julie Anderson {{who said the}} same person can be a Russian {{intelligence}} officer, an organized criminal, and a businessman, who quoted the former CIA Director James Woolsey as saying: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business.

6000|$|... "Down there. I'm {{going to}} ask my father. I suppose you'll believe it if <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> I suppose you'll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows what--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have as {{much chance}} of earning fifteen hundred a year, Regina, as I have of being made King of England. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{his health}} which frightens me. I am sure--I am quite sure that he has {{something}} upon his mind. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of the imp {{behind the}} log {{and of the}} miserable devil who went over the fall--or of the wretch in the tree?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You soon will. You see how <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> {{you are to}} be a comfort; {{and if you are}} a good boy, you'll quickly {{leave the}} dunce behind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{in another}} place, {{modestly}} excluding {{himself from the}} number of poets, because he only writ odes and satires, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> a poet is such an one, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simply do what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> {{whether it}} is wrong or right. If it's right, {{it ought to be}} done, and if it's wrong, it will not be your fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad William is coming. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> sent me his manuscript? I think it's wonderful--I think he's almost {{good enough}} for you, Katharine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you knew}} he was going to the House, Giles?" [...] she said, turning her large tender eyes anxiously upon him. [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Catherine {{listened to}} this {{with her eyes}} fixed upon her aunt, and {{continued}} to gaze at her for some time afterwards. [...] "Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to say that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{remarkable}} girl, Cynthia," [...] said Miss Lucretia, involuntarily. Then {{she paused for}} a moment. [...] "Suppose <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> they are true? You surely can't live with him again, Cynthia." ...|$|E
60|$|Warn. Of {{more than}} their flattery can make good, sir; 'tis true <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> they have flattered him; but, in my conscience, {{he is the most}} down-right simple-natured {{creature}} in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{your son}} {{been talking to}} you about--about what was said between him and me the other day? I am sure he has, for I know <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> everything,--as he ought to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! Didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> Well, perhaps <b>he</b> {{would be}} afraid of its {{worrying}} you. It would be like Charley Leland, and here I have been giving him away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if he saw}} them, why didn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Whitney?" [...] Mr. Blount said. [...] "Tired as our horses were, {{they could}} have got up a gallop for a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he did," [...] said Mrs. Hasketh, in a crest-fallen sort, [...] "But we thought--we thought--you {{might know}} where he was. And Fay--Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what <b>he</b> was going to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will marry}} on {{anything}} or nothing. And if {{you speak to}} him <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> of how the young ravens were fed. But he always forgets that he's not a young raven himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that [...] "the {{topic of}} {{instructions}} has occasioned much altercation and uneasiness in this city"; and he expresses himself (if I understand him rightly) {{in favor of}} the coercive authority of such instructions.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no wish to}} do {{anything}} of the sort," [...] Lutchester assured her. [...] "Make a bargain with me. Mr. Haskall will be here soon. Unfasten the little package you are carrying somewhere about your person, hand him the envelope and watch his face. If <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> that what you have offered him is a coherent and possible formula for an explosive, then you can look upon me for ever afterwards as the poor, foolish person you sometimes seem to consider me.

6000|$|... 'Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how I pressed him?' There was no {{red tide}} this time, nor ever again whilst the {{interview}} lasted. To bow in affirmation was insufficient; {{with an effort}} he answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> dear?" [...] Mrs. Gildersleeve asked, with that frightened air, as of a startled wild thing, growing deeper than ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she nodded. [...] "That's {{just what}} he would call it. And {{whenever}} <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> you are standing on your foot watch out for him. Now I must go. Good bye, and thank you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, indeed, Albinia,' {{answered}} her brother, seriously, 'I fully believe that Gilbert imagines all that <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> but you cannot suppose {{that either the}} tutor or doctor could fail {{to see if he}} were so very ill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know. It is {{not worth}} while to think about that. He sends me in, and so of course I must go. And <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> to take me, and so of course you must take me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not plain now," [...] cried Lu-don, [...] "that this {{creature}} is no god. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> {{was the son}} of god?" [...] he almost shouted, turning suddenly upon Pan-at-lee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{as though}} it were a thing of course. But I noticed it. It was not when he bade me poke the fire, but the next time. Did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the fire?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Strether {{took a turn}} {{before he}} answered. [...] "Hasn't he given you Jim? Hasn't he before this 'done' him for you?" [...] He was {{a little at a}} loss. [...] "Doesn't <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> things?" ...|$|R
