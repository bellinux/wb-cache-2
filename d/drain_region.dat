This mode {{of operation}} was first experimentally reported in the lateral four layer device (SCR) by B. W. Scharf and J. D. Plummer in 1978. This {{mode of operation}} was also experimentally discovered in vertical device in 1979 by B. Jayant Baliga.

50|$|A second {{prominent}} approach {{involves the}} use of a silicon-rich solid solution, especially silicon-germanium, to modulate channel strain. One manufacturing method involves epitaxial growth of silicon on top of a relaxed silicon-germanium underlayer. Tensile strain is induced in the silicon as the lattice of the silicon layer is stretched to mimic the larger lattice constant of the underlying silicon-germanium. Conversely, compressive strain could be induced by using a solid solution with a smaller lattice constant, such as silicon-carbon. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,023,018. Another closely related method involves replacing the source and <b>drain</b> <b>region</b> of a MOSFET with silicon-germanium.|$|E

5000|$|In a FET, the {{drain-to-source current}} flows via a {{conducting}} channel {{that connects the}} source region to the <b>drain</b> <b>region.</b> The conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals; hence the current flowing between the drain and source {{is controlled by the}} voltage applied between the gate and source. As the gate-source voltage (VGS) is increased, the drain-source current (IDS) increases exponentially for VGS below threshold, and then at a roughly quadratic rate (IDS ∝ (VGS − VT)2) (where VT is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins) in the [...] "space-charge-limited" [...] region above threshold. A quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices, for example, at the 65 nm technology node.|$|E
50|$|The second thrust area is {{noise and}} {{reliability}} of nanoelectronic devices. In the early 1980s, {{as a graduate student}} under the supervision of Professor Thomas Hsiang, Celik-Butler has developed one of the first 1/f noise theories based on McWhorter Noise Model and applied to Metal-Oxide Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs). Most recently, the same model has been revised to account for low-frequency noise observed on multi-stack gate MOSFETs, specifically high-k dielectric gate oxides. The research group has also investigated and developed noise models for polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors, lateral pnp bipolar transistors and sige heterojunction bipolar transistors. One of the contributions of the research group is the demonstration of Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) noise as a non-destructive characterization and reliability tool in nanoelectronics. Today, this research thrust area is investigating the effect of extended <b>drain</b> <b>region</b> on noise {{and reliability of}} LDMOS structures.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} semianalytical model for {{monolayer}} graphene field-effect transistors in the ballistic limit. Two types of devices are considered: {{in the first}} device, the source and <b>drain</b> <b>regions</b> are doped by charge transfer with Schottky contacts, while, in the second device, the source and <b>drain</b> <b>regions</b> are doped electrostatically by a back gate. The model captures two important effects that influence the operation of both devices: (i) the finite density of states in the source and <b>drain</b> <b>regions,</b> which limits the number of states available for transport and can be responsible for negative output differential resistance effects, and (ii) quantum tunneling across the potential steps at the source-channel and drain-channel interfaces. By comparison with a self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function solver, we show that our model provides very accurate results for both types of devices, in the bias region of quasi-saturation {{as well as in}} that of negative differential resistance.

40|$|We {{describe}} the geomorphology {{of a large}} (∼ 10000 km 2) internally <b>draining</b> <b>region</b> within the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt of Fars province, Iran. A series of wind gaps through fold crests and a continuous line of low-slope pixels in digital elevation models indicate {{the presence of an}} older, and now abandoned, through-going river system. We suggest, from the presence of the wind gaps, that the original through-going river system was abandoned {{as a direct result of}} fold growth. At present, through-going drainage in Fars is restricted to only two major rivers, the Kul and the Mand, which bound the margins of the internally <b>drained</b> <b>region.</b> The low gradients of the Kul and the Mand rivers are similar to those in topographic profiles drawn along the course of the abandoned drainage. The Mand and Kul rivers may be defeated in the future, causing an expansion of the internally <b>drained</b> <b>region,</b> and resulting in a profound change in the distribution of sediment and surface elevations within the Zagros. The internally draining part of the Zagros resembles the Central Iranian Plateau both in its geomorphology and in the apparently slow rates of deformation within it. We speculate that the development of internally drained basins and distribution of shortening within the range may be causally linked. The geomorphology that we describe might, therefore, record a stage in the southward expansion of the non-deforming and topographically high Central Iranian Plateau. © 2011 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
