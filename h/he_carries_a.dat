5|$|Otonashi is {{the protagonist}} of Angel Beats!. Due to his past, he has a caring {{personality}} and does not want anyone to experience pain or sadness. After dying, he lost his memories {{of the time when}} he was still alive, but later regains them. He had a younger sister, , who died of cancer and whom he cared for very much. When she died, he decided to go to school to become a doctor, but died in a train accident before he could take the entrance exam to college. Initially unskilled in any equipment, he starts to practice his marksmanship, and pulls through for the team when they are in danger. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> Glock 17.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E

5|$|Optimus {{is given}} the task of {{removing}} the Dark Energon from Cybertron's core by the council. Optimus and his old friend Ironhide, along with rookie Autobot soldier Warpath first attempt to rescue Omega Supreme from the Decepticons, who is being tortured by Dark Energon. They call in Ratchet who heals Omega Supreme. The Autobots free Omega Supreme and gain access to Cybertron's core. Struggling against a mysterious corrupted worm and countless Decepticons, Optimus then speaks with Cybertron's core, which informs him {{that it has been}} heavily damaged by the Dark Energon. It states that it can repair itself by shutting down, but the process will take millions of years during which Cybertron will become cold, barren, and lifeless. The core then tells Optimus that if <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> small piece of the core with him, the core can still survive during the repairs. Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership.|$|E
5|$|Stela 31 is the {{accession}} monument of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, also bearing two {{portraits of}} his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, {{as a youth}} dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> spearthrower {{in one hand and}} bears a shield decorated with the face of Tlaloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.|$|E

Occasionally Abraxas is depicted driving a chariot drawn by four horses, probably representing the elements.|$|E
25|$|The Undying – The Undying {{has endured}} long where others have fallen. He {{is said to}} be the oldest of the Ringwraiths, and the last to succumb to the wasting {{influences}} of the Rings of Power. Through an obsessive mastery of evil magics, the Undying has learnt to draw sustenance from the magics of others, fortifying himself with the magical energy that flows around him. Tolkien repeatedly wrote of the Nazgûl as being powerful sorcerers, and The Undying was added into the game in the wake of those statements. His model is unique, in that <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> staff and not a sword.|$|E
25|$|The Earl Marshal is {{considered}} the eighth of the Great Officers of State, with the Lord High Constable above him and only the Lord High Admiral beneath him. Nowadays, the Earl Marshal's role has mainly {{to do with the}} organisation of major state ceremonies such as coronations and state funerals. Annually, the Earl Marshal helps organise the State Opening of Parliament. The Earl Marshal also remains to have charge over the College of Arms and no coat of arms may be granted without his warrant. As a symbol of his office, <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> baton of gold with black finish at either end.|$|E

5000|$|Ricardo [...] "Rico" [...] Tubbs {{was armed}} with a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun in the first season. In Season 2, he used an Ithaca 37 sawed-off pump shotgun called an Ithaca Stakeout, which <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> on <b>a</b> halter under his jacket. Beginning in Season 3 (and for the {{remainder}} of the show), <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> modified, short-barreled Remington 870. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> backup, <b>he</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> Smith & Wesson Model 38 Bodyguard with Pachmayr grips. He can also be seen using a SIG P228 in the series finale 'Freefall' and a Smith & Wesson Model 36 in the pilot episode.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the youths}} who becomes {{a member of the}} Legion is Lar Gand, a {{teenager}} whom Superboy first knows as Mon-El when he crash-lands on Earth in Superboy's era. The teenager, who has powers identical to Superboy, initially has amnesia, and because <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> message from Jor-El, Superboy believes him to be his big brother and dubs him Mon-El. When Mon-El is exposed to lead, his memory returns. He reveals that he is actually a Daxamite named Lar Gand, and for Daxamites, lead is more deadly than Kryptonite. To save his life, Superboy projects Mon-El into the Phantom Zone, where Mon-El would linger for a millennium before being freed by the Legion. In the Legion, the two teens remain close friends. The alternate Superboy from the Pocket Universe would die in Mon-El's arms.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} {{crosspiece}} {{of the central}} cross are back to back statues (géminée) depicting Mary Cléophas, a piéta and Mary Magdalene on one side with Saint John, a statue of the risen Christ and Saint Peter on the other. On the upper crosspiece are two men on horseback, Saint Longinus and Stephaton, the two soldiers {{who were at the}} crucifixion. It was Longinus who pierced Jesus' side so <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> lance whilst Stephaton carries a sponge as he was the soldier who gave Jesus a sponge soaked in vinegar. On the reverse side of the two horsemen is a depiction of Jesus tied with ropes ("Christ lié"). Jesus hangs from the central cross and is sculpted back to back with an Ecce Homo. The crucified Jesus is surrounded by four small angels who are collecting the blood running from his wounds. Note that Jesus was nailed to the cross but the two thieves were tied to their crosses with rope.|$|E
25|$|Spender {{returns to}} the rest of the expedition. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> gun and, {{claiming}} to be the last Martian, shoots six of his crew-mates, including one with sympathy towards the Martians from his Cherokee ancestry. Captain Wilder approaches under a white flag and has a short discussion with Spender during which the archaeologist explains that if he manages to kill off the expedition it may delay human colonization of the planet for a few more years, possibly long enough that the expected nuclear war on Earth will protect Mars from human colonization completely. Although he opposes Spender's methods, Captain Wilder somewhat agrees with his attitude towards colonization and wishes for him a humane death. He {{returns to the}} others and joins them as they pursue Spender, and Wilder shoots Spender in the chest during the fight before he has the opportunity to be killed by anyone else. The captain later knocks out the teeth of Parkhill, another expedition member, after catching him in the act of shooting at the ruined cities' towers and windows for target practice.|$|E

500|$|Ōyama is an {{ordinary}} boy {{who has no}} special talents. He does not excel at anything, but is as capable as any normal person; in other words, he is a Jack of all trades. He is an innocent boy whose feelings are hurt from things like making fake confession or watching his teammates [...] "die". <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> Remington 700 sniper rifle or a P226 handgun.|$|E
500|$|Ethnic Cleansing is a standard, short-length first-person shooter set in {{a single}} level. The player can select a neo-Nazi, a Skinhead, or a Klansman to control. They run through a ghetto that has been {{compared}} to New York City and shoot African-Americans and Latinos, before descending into a subway system to kill Jews. Finally, the player reaches the [...] "Yiddish Control Center", where a fictionalized version of Ariel Sharon, then Prime Minister of Israel, is directing plans for world domination. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> rocket launcher; the player must kill him to complete the game. The heads-up display contains a map of nearby enemies and a counter of remaining ammunition.|$|E
500|$|The protagonist is a nameless middle-aged soldier {{living the}} life of a [...] "junker"—scavenging useful items among ruined cities to survive. He enters a {{derelict}} city searching for undamaged goods and finds an abandoned planetarium on the roof of a building he first thinks is a military facility. There, he meets Yumemi Hoshino, a gynoid designed to look like a young girl who annoys him greatly due to her constant talking. The protagonist has a tough personality that comes from trying to survive in a dystopic world. <b>He</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> grenade launcher with him and covers himself with a waterproof coat to protect his skin from the toxic rain. For drinking water, his canteen has a water purifier that can purify the rain. He is constantly searching for rarer substances such as cigarettes and alcohol which can be sold at high prices.|$|E

50|$|As a Toa Inika, Matoro {{wore the}} Kanohi Iden, Mask of Spirit, which allowed his spirit to {{physically}} leave his body. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> <b>an</b> Energized Ice Sword and a Multi-Shot Zamor Sphere Launcher as his Toa tools. As a Toa Mahri, {{he wore the}} Kanohi Tryna, Mask of Reanimation, which allowed him to give life to and control dead beings. <b>He</b> <b>carried</b> <b>a</b> Twin Cutter and a Cordak Blaster, transformed from his previous weapons.|$|R
500|$|Although scoring {{decisions}} were {{widely believed to}} favor the hitter over the defense, many players believed this bias shifts {{in favor of the}} pitcher when <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> no-hitter (where a pitcher throws a complete game without giving up a hit) into the late innings. Infielder Dave Johnson said, [...] "I've been involved in five or six no-hit games, and all of them were suspected of being helped by hometown scoring." [...] One of the last controversies of the writer-scorer era was seen in a 1978 game at St. Louis. In that game, St. Louis pitcher Bob Forsch was pitching a no-hitter in the 8th inning against Philadelphia when a hard ground ball hit into the hole between shortstop and third was narrowly missed by third baseman Ken Reitz. The official scorer Neal Russo (who was a writer for the local newspaper) judged the play to be an error rather than a hit, and Forsch went on to pitch the first no-hitter of the 1978 season.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times commented that [...] "Ben is a taciturn hero, and Mr. Stahl does a remarkable job of wordlessly conveying his character's moods and yearnings, {{as well as his}} ungainly grace." [...] The Boston Globe regarded [...] "Stahl, with his watchful eyes, [...] one of the show's strengths. He has a boyish face, but the grim expression of a worn-out elder", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said Stahl [...] "speaks volumes with his eyes and weary frown, so much so that his understated portrayal almost carries the series." [...] In a season 1 DVD review, DVD Talk thought that [...] "as the two leads, Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown are nothing short of brilliant. Ben Hawkins is a very isolated and quiet character, and yet <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> significant part of the series on his shoulders. Without the right actor it could be disastrous, but Stahl brings a level of thoughtful emotion to the character such that a glance or a stare speaks volumes." [...] DVDverdict felt in a season 2 review that [...] "both Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown deliver perfect performances. Stahl's gradual acceptance of his own power, and his subsequent struggle, are fascinating." ...|$|E
500|$|Of {{the many}} {{characters}} similar to him, the Green Knight of Sir Gawain {{is the first}} to be green. Because of his strange colour, some scholars believe him to be a manifestation of the Green Man figure of medieval art, or as a representation of both the vitality and fearful unpredictability of nature. That <b>he</b> <b>carries</b> <b>a</b> green holly branch, and the comparison of his beard to a bush, has guided many scholars to this interpretation. The gold entwined in the cloth wrapped around his axe, combined with the green, gives him both a wild and an aristocratic air. Others consider him as being an incarnation of the Devil. In one interpretation, it is thought that the Green Knight, as the [...] "Lord of Hades", has come to challenge the noble knights of King Arthur's court. Sir Gawain, the bravest of the knights, therefore proves himself equal to Hercules in challenging the Knight, tying the story to ancient Greek mythology. Scholars like Curely claim the descriptive features of the Green Knight suggest a servitude to Satan such as the beaver-hued beard alluding to the allegorical significance of beavers for the Christian audience of the time who believed that they renounced the world and paid [...] "tribute to the devil for spiritual freedom." [...] Another possible interpretation of the Green Knight views him as combining elements from the Greek Hades and the Christian Messiah, at once representing both good and evil and life and death as self-proliferating cycles. This interpretation embraces the positive and negative attributes of the colour green and relates to the enigmatic motif of the poem. The description of the Green Knight upon his entrance to Arthur's Court as [...] "from neck to loin… strong and thickly made" [...] is considered by some scholars as homoerotic.|$|E
