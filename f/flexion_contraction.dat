The rise time of muscle moment in the model was for the greater part determined by the amplitude of the first EMG burst. For dynamic jumplike movements of the ankle joint, however, no relationship between rise time of muscle moment in the experiment and muscle moment predicted by the model on the basis of GM EMG signals was found.

Eight participants completed three separate sessions: isometric flexor contractions of the left wrist at 20 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) simultaneously with PAS (20 s intervals; 14 min duration) delivered at the right median nerve and left primary motor cortex (M 1); isometric contractions at 20 % of MVC; and PAS only (14 min). Eight further participants completed two sessions of longer duration PAS (28 min) : either alone or in conjunction with <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions</b> of the left wrist. Thirty motor potentials (MEPs) were evoked in the right flexor (rFCR) and extensor (rECR) carpi radialis muscles by magnetic stimulation of left M 1 prior to the interventions, immediately post-intervention, and 10 min post-intervention. Both 14 and 28 min of combined PAS and (left wrist <b>flexion)</b> <b>contractions</b> resulted in reliable increases in rFCR MEP amplitude, which were not present in rECR. In the PAS only conditions, 14 min of stimulation gave rise to unreliable increases in MEP amplitudes in rFCR and rECR, whereas 28 min of PAS induced small (unreliable) changes only for rFCR. These results support the conclusion that changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway induced by PAS interact with those associated with contraction of the muscles ipsilateral {{to the site of}} cortical stimulation. Furthermore, focal contractions applied by the opposite limb increase the extent and muscle specificity of the induced changes in excitability associated with PAS...|$|R

Although this technique {{has been shown to}} give reproducible measurements across days, it has been criticized for its potential limitation associated with inadvertent activation of the antagonists.

Sixteen trained, young adult males pulled a constant load of 40 % MVC (maximum voluntary elbow <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction)</b> by ballistic elbow flexion under the following two preliminary conditions: 1) the static relaxed muscle state (SR condition) and 2) using the SSC (SSC condition). Muscle power was determined from the product of the pulling velocity and load mass by a power measurement instrument with a rotary encoder. The 1 RM bench press (1 RM BP) and isokinetic maximum strength under elbow flexion with the Cybex- 325 were measured as indicators of dynamic maximum strength. 1) The early power output exerted under the SSC condition showed a significant and high correlation with the 1 RM BP (r = 0. 83), but only moderate correlation with the isokinetic muscle strength (r = 0. 50 - 0. 67). 2) The contribution of the 1 RM BP to the early muscle contraction velocity exerted under the SSC condition was large.

Nonetheless, regional variations in neuromuscular activity seem to occur in numerous conditions, from standing to passive muscle stretching. In this study, we show how local activation of skeletal muscles can be automatically tracked from EMGs acquired with a bi-dimensional grid of surface electrodes (a grid of 8 rows and 15 columns was used). Grayscale images were created from simulated and experimental EMGs, filtered and segmented into clusters of activity with the watershed algorithm. The number of electrodes on each cluster and the mean level of neuromuscular activity were used to assess the accuracy of the segmentation of simulated signals. Regardless of the noise level, thickness of fat tissue and acquisition configuration (monopolar or single differential), the segmentation accuracy was above 60 %. Accuracy values peaked close to 95 % when pixels with intensity below ~ 70 % of maximal EMG amplitude in each segmented cluster were excluded. When simulating opposite variations in the activity of two adjacent muscles, watershed segmentation produced clusters of activity consistently centered on each simulated portion of active muscle and with mean amplitude close to the simulated value. Finally, the segmentation algorithm was used to track spatial variations in the activity, within and between medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, during isometric plantar <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction</b> and in quiet standing position. In both cases, the regionalization of neuromuscular activity occurred and was consistently identified with the segmentation method...|$|E

The role of FDI was assessed in two thumb postures, thumb ‘down’ (thumb abducted) and thumb ‘up’ (thumb extended), and at different thumb carpometacarpal angles. These postures were designed to change acutely the flexion moment arm for FDI. The flexion twitch force evoked by supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve was measured in the two postures and the change in moment arm was assessed by ultrasonography. Subjects also made voluntary <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions</b> of the index finger of ∼ 5 N in both postures during which neural drive to FDI and the long finger flexor muscles was measured using surface EMG. Recordings of FDI EMG were normalized to the maximal M wave. Five of the 15 subjects also had a radial nerve block to eliminate any co-contraction of the extensor muscles, and extensor muscle EMG was monitored in subjects without radial nerve block. Compared to thumb up, flexion twitch force was ∼ 60 % greater, and the flexion moment arm was ∼ 50 % greater with the thumb down. There was minimal effect of altered carpometacarpal angle on flexion twitch force for either thumb posture. During voluntary <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions,</b> normalized FDI EMG was ∼ 28 % greater with thumb down, compared to thumb up, with no consistent change in neural drive to the long flexors.

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether the activity of the BR can be assessed with surface EMG without interference from the biceps brachii (BB). With eight subjects we measured surface EMG of the arm flexor synergists, BR, BB, and brachioradialis (BRR) during two isometric voluntary contraction types: (1) pure elbow flexion and (2) elbow flexion with a superimposed forearm supination. Since the BR and BB have a distinct biomechanical function, an individual activity of the BR can be expected for the second contraction type, if the BR can be assessed independently from the BB. The correlation coefficients between EMG amplitudes and flexion force (supination torque) were determined. During pure flexion the activities of all synergists were similarly correlated with the flexion force (r = 0. 96 ± 0. 02). During flexion + supination the activity of the BR was distinct from the activity of the BB, with a 14 % higher correlation for the BR with the flexion force and a 40 – 64 % lower correlation with the supination torque. The BB predicted supination torque substantially better than the BR and BRR (r = 0. 93 ± 0. 02).

40|$|Muscle {{stiffness}} estimated using {{shear wave}} elastography can provide an index of individual muscle force during isometric contraction and may therefore be a promising method for quantifying co-contraction. We estimated the shear modulus of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle using supersonic shear wave imaging and measured its myoelectrical activity using surface electromyography (sEMG) during graded isometric contractions of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion (n= 7). During dorsiflexion, the average shear modulus was 26 +/- 6 kPa at peak sEMG amplitude, which was significantly less (P= 0. 02) than that measured at the same sEMG level during plantar flexion (42 +/- 10 kPa). The passive tension during contraction was estimated using the passive LG muscle shear modulus during a passive ankle rotation measured at an equivalent ankle angle to that measured during contraction. The passive shear modulus increased significantly (P < 0. 01) from the plantar flexed position (16 +/- 5 kPa) to the dorsiflexed position (26 +/- 9 kPa). Once this change in passive tension from joint rotation was accounted for, the average LG muscle shear modulus due to active contraction was significantly greater (P < 0. 01) during plantar flexion (26 +/- 8 kPa) than at sEMG-matched levels of dorsiflexion (0 +/- 4 kPa). The negligible shear modulus estimated during isometric dorsiflexion indicates negligible active force contribution by the LG muscle, despite measured sEMG activity of 19 % of maximal voluntary plantar <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction.</b> This strongly suggests that the sEMG activity recorded from the LG muscle during isometric dorsiflexion was primarily due to cross-talk.

However, these afferents may have a more widespread effect on other muscles in the exercising limb. We examined if the firing of fatigue-sensitive afferents from elbow extensor muscles in the same arm reduces torque production and voluntary activation of elbow flexors. In nine subjects we examined voluntary activation of elbow flexors by measuring changes in superimposed twitches evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex during brief (2 – 3 s) maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). Inflation of a blood pressure cuff following a 2 -min sustained MVC blocked {{blood flow to the}} fatigued muscle and maintained firing of small-diameter afferents. After a fatiguing elbow <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction,</b> maximal flexion torque was lower (26. 0 ± 4. 4 %versus 67. 9 ± 5. 2 % of initial maximal torque; means ±s. d.; P < 0. 001) and superimposed twitches were larger (4. 1 ± 1. 1 %versus 1. 8 ± 0. 2 % ongoing MVC, P= 0. 01) with than without ischaemia. After a fatiguing elbow extensor contraction, maximal flexion torque was also reduced (82. 2 ± 4. 9 %versus 91. 4 ± 2. 3 % of initial maximal torque; P= 0. 007), superimposed twitches were larger (2. 7 ± 0. 7 %versus 1. 3 ± 0. 2 % ongoing MVC; P= 0. 02) and voluntary activation lower (81. 6 ± 8. 2 %versus 95. 5 ± 6. 9 %; P= 0. 04) with than without ischaemia. After a fatiguing contraction, voluntary drive to the fatigued muscles is reduced with continued input from small-diameter muscle afferents. Furthermore, fatigue of the elbow extensor muscles decreases voluntary drive to unfatigued elbow flexors of the same arm.

This increase can {{be the result of}} both muscle atrophy and reciprocal facilitation mechanism. It remains however unclear to what extent increased antagonist muscles activation could be rather attributable to central vs. peripheral changes during voluntary contractions achieved by SCI participants. Methods: We investigated the activations of elbow extensors and flexors during isometric elbow <b>flexion</b> and extension <b>contractions</b> performed at 3 force levels by 10 healthy participants and 8 participants with cervical SCI (cSCI). Results: At similar force level and absolute net torque in flexion, the antagonist muscles activation was increased for the participants with cSCI. At similar absolute net torque in extension, the activations of agonist and antagonist muscles were increased for the participants with cSCI. Conclusion: During <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions,</b> increased antagonist muscles activation may be explained by extensors atrophy or reciprocal facilitation. During extension contractions, increased antagonist muscles activation may reflect the importance of reciprocal facilitation as antagonist muscles were evaluated as intact by clinical testing and maximal net joint torque recording. Significance: These results in cSCI participants revealed an increased activation of antagonist muscles, which may reflect a reorganization of the spinal reflexes and their supraspinal control involved during isometric elbow contractions.

40|$|Ultrasound imaging {{can be used}} {{to study}} tendon {{movement}} during muscle contraction to estimate the tendon force-length relationship in vivo. Traditionally, such tendon displacement measurements are made manually (time consuming and subjective). Here we evaluated a Lucas-Kanade-based tracking algorithm with an optic flow extension that accounts for tendon movement characteristics between consecutive frames of an ultrasound image sequence. Eleven subjects performed 12 voluntary isometric plantar <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions</b> on a dynamometer. Simultaneously, the gastrocnemius medialis tendon was visualized via ultrasonography. Tendon displacement was estimated manually and by using two different automatic tracking algorithms. Maximal tendon elongation (manual: 17. 9  ±  0. 3  mm, automatic: 17. 0  ±  0. 3  mm) and tendon stiffness (209  ±  4  N/mm, 218  ±  5  N/mm) generated by the developed algorithm correlated with those obtained with the manual method (0. 87  ≤ R ≤  0. 91), with no differences between methods. Our results suggest that optical flow methods can potentially be used for automatic estimation of tendon movement during contraction in ultrasound images, which is further improved by adding a penalty function...|$|R
40|$|The global {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to confirm the validity of the interpolated twitch technique (ITT) to voluntary torque model (first study) and then to utilize this technique in developing definitive criterion measures enhancing the study of training strategies on central fatigue (second study) and velocity specific (third study) voluntary activation (VA) and force production outcomes. The first study assessed the contribution of non-stimulated synergists to the non-linearity of the ITT voluntary torque relationship for elbow <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction.</b> Since multiple synergist stimulation was found not to significantly improve the ITT to voluntary torque relationship, follow-up pilot work was conducted in which the quadriceps femoris was identified as a valid ITT test model muscle. The first training study investigated the effects of high volume, maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) resistance training of the quadriceps femoris on MVIC levels of force and VA prior to, during, and recovery from a standardized fatigue test protocol. Results showed significant increases in pre-fatigue MVIC VA and force, increases in resistance to early fatigue, but also increased overall rate of fatigue resulting in non-significant changes in total force volume and endurance time. Post-fatigue analysis showed significant training increases in rate and level of recovery for both MVIC VA and force production. The second training study investigated the effects of high resistance ramp versus ballistic type MVIC strength training of the quadriceps femoris on central adaptations in submaximal and maximal levels of MVIC VA and force production. Results showed similar ramp and ballistic group training increases in MVIC force and VA on both ramp and ballistic tests. Ballistic group, ballistic test change scores were significant but not for the ramp test, suggesting ballistic group test-training specificity. The ballistic group showed significant force increases on the submaximal 150 ms ballistic test, while the ramp group showed non-significant training changes, further supporting test-training specificity for the ballistic group. Results support utility of the ITT and provide valuable information with regard to training and test-training specificity considerations...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} care of muscle fatigue with exercise therapies aim at {{quality of life}} improvement and usually involve unilateral exercises or neuromuscular electrical stimulation to compensate impaired muscle function in both healthy and health-compromised people. The overall objective of this thesis was to study the effect of neuromuscular activation strategies during muscle fatigue, endurance and muscle performance after unilateral fatiguing voluntary and electrically evoked contractions (NMES) in healthy and health-compromised populations such as children with cerebral palsy (CP) and patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). A unilateral fatiguing exercise impaired the maximal torque production of the contralateral non-exercising limb, but {{the time course of}} torque production loss differed between limbs, being delayed in the non-exercising limb. This cross-over effect could be a compensatory strategy to reduce the gap of muscle performance between the weaker, exercised, limb and the non-exercised one likely to warrant interlimb coordination. A NMES protocol delivered over the nerve trunk, maintaining constant or increasing the current intensity induced similar peripheral and central adaptations of muscle fatigue. Therefore, for similar energy expenditure, maintaining the current intensity constant, as when increasing it, would yield the same adaptations to muscle fatigue. Also, we found that even though strength and time to task failure were similar in both groups, the children with CP exhibited a lower increase in EMG (electromyographic) amplitude compared to typically developing peers. This suggests that the children with CP were not able to recruit additional motor units to compensate for muscle fatigue during a sustained low-force level isometric elbow <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction.</b> Finally, no tibialis anterior muscle strength, endurance and motor function improvements were observed after a NMES training in a group of patients with FSHD. Maybe, the NMES protocol was not strenuous enough and/or parameters of stimulation were not adequate as no improvements were observed in healthy participants either. However, the group of patients with FSHD showed lower force losses during the 2 -minute sustained MVC, suggesting that they were experiencing a lower amount of muscle fatigue compared to the healthy participants group. Limiting muscle fatigue and developing rehabilitation strategies is needed and further research should be conducted regarding the muscle activation patterns with muscle fatigue, especially in neuromuscular disorders. The potential beneficial cross-over and NMES effects should be further investigated with regards to the variety of neuromuscular disorders and the associated muscle activation impairments.

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to describe and explore pain-related aspects of neck muscle performance, functioning and psychosocial factors in individuals with cervical radiculopathy (CR). Methods: Participants were 157 patients with CR. Also Study II included 33 asymptomatic age-and gender-matched controls. Study I, a prospective randomized controlled pilot trial, investigated outcomes after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with interbody cage with (n= 17) or without (n= 16) cervical collar in CR. In Study II and III, ventral and dorsal neck muscle fatigue was recorded with surface electromyography (EMG) during isometric endurance (NME) tests. Study II compared a CR group (n= 46) with healthy controls (n= 34). In Study III, results after neck-specific training or prescribed physical activity (n= 50) were analyzed. Pain was estimated using visual analogue scales (VAS) and perceived fatigue rated with Borg CR- 10 scales before, {{during and after the}} tests. Cross-sectional, Study IV, identified dimensions underlying measures of impairments, disability, personal factors, and health status in patients with CR (n= 124). Results: Study I, Both groups improved in all outcome measures, with a significant improvement from baseline to two years after surgery. Cervical collar worn for six weeks postoperatively, were associated with enhanced neck function and less neck pain even at long-term. Study II showed altered neck muscle endurance investigated with greater negative median frequency slope, variability, side imbalance, lower endurance time, and higher experience of fatigue among in the CR group compared to the healthy controls. Patients with CR had significantly shorter endurance time. In Study III, significant improvement in flexor NME was found after training, but with no difference between training groups. For the neck-specific training group only, there less activation of the splenius capitis during neck flexion after 14 weeks and one year, indicating reduced co-activation of the neck muscles. In Study IV, the PCA model provided three-components: Pain and functioning, Health, beliefs, and kinesiophobia, and Mood state and catastrophizing. These accounted for 73 % of the cumulative percentages. Conclusions: Cervical collar post-surgery can help deal with initial post-operative pain and reduce disability. Shorter endurance and higher experience of fatigue was perceived among patients with CR compared to healthy subjects. Exercises increased flexor NME regardless of exercise group. The neck-specific group indicated reduced compensation of antagonist muscles during <b>flexion</b> <b>contraction.</b> To capture a broad picture of patients with CR pain, their functioning, fear avoidance beliefs, and anxiety are important factors in a clinical perspective...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo assess {{alterations}} {{in the regional}} perfusion and oxygenation of the calf muscles in individuals with diabetes. MethodsAge-matched individuals with (n = 5) and without diabetes (n = 6) were investigated. Skeletal muscle perfusion, oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen consumption rate were measured by newly developed noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. The subjects lay supine on the MRI table with their foot firmly strapped to a custom-built isometric exercise device. The measurements were performed at rest and during an isometric plantar <b>flexion</b> muscle <b>contraction.</b> ResultsIndividuals without diabetes had up to a 10 -fold increase in muscle perfusion, 25 % elevation in muscle oxygen extraction fraction, and a 12 -fold increase in oxygen consumption rate in the calf during the plantar <b>flexion</b> isometric <b>contraction.</b> In patients with diabetes, the increases in these parameters were only up to sixfold, 2 %, and sixfold, respectively. Exercise oxygen consumption rate was inversely associated with blood HbA 1 c levels (r 2  =. 91). ConclusionsThis is the first study to quantify regional skeletal muscle oxygenation in patients with diabetes using noncontrast MRI and warrants additional study. Attenuation of perfusion and oxygenation during exercise may have implications for understanding diabetic complications in the lower extremities...|$|R
40|$|Background: While chronic β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation (≥ 2 wk) lowers {{exercise}} induced muscle damage, its acute or timing {{effects have}} not been examined. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the acute and timing effects of oral HMB supplementation on serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), muscle soreness, and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Methods: Sixteen non-resistance trained men (22 ± 2 yrs) were assigned to HMB-Pre or HMB-Post groups. In a crossover design, all subjects performed 55 maximal eccentric knee extension/ <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions</b> on 2 occasions on either the right or left leg. HMB-Pre (N = 8) randomly received 3 grams of either a placebo or HMB before and a placebo after exercise. HMB-Post (N = 8) received a placebo before and either 3 grams of HMB or a placebo after exercise. Muscle damage tests were recorded before, at 8, 24, 48, and 72 hrs post exercise. Results: There was a reduction in MVC and an increase in soreness in the quadriceps and hamstrings following exercise (p < 0. 001). Although HMB-Pre approached significance in attenuating soreness for the quadriceps (p = 0. 07), there was no time × group effect. Serum indice...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Advances in surface {{electromyography}} (sEMG) techniques {{provide a}} clear indication that refinement of electrode location relative to innervation zones (IZ) is {{required in order to}} optimise the accuracy, relevance and repeatability of the sEMG signals. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the IZ for the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscles to provide guidelines for electrode positioning for future clinical and research applications. Methods: Eleven volunteer subjects participated in this study. Myoelectric signals were detected from the sternal and clavicular heads of the stemocleidomastoid and the anterior scalene muscles bilaterally using a linear array of 8 electrodes during isometric cervical <b>flexion</b> <b>contractions.</b> The signals were reviewed and the IZ(s) were identified, marked on the subjects 2 ̆ 7 skin and measurements were obtained relative to selected anatomical landmarks. Results: The position of the IZ lay consistently around the mid-point or in the superior portion of the muscles studied. Conclusions: Results suggest that electrodes should be positioned over the lower portion of the muscle and not the mid-point, which has been commonly used in previous studies. Recommendations for sensor placement on these muscles should assist investigators and clinicians to ensure improved validity in future sEMG applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.
