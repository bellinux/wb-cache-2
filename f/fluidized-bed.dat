5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a <b>fluidized-bed</b> incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

5000|$|APFBC. In more {{advanced}} second-generation PFBC systems, a pressurized carbonizer is incorporated {{to process the}} feed coal into fuel gas and char. The PFBC burns the char to produce steam and to heat combustion air for the gas turbine. The fuel gas from the carbonizer burns in a topping combustor linked to a gas turbine, heating the gases to the combustion turbine's rated firing temperature. Heat is recovered from the gas turbine exhaust {{in order to produce}} steam, which is used to drive a conventional steam turbine, resulting in a higher overall efficiency for the combined cycle power output.

5000|$|One way to {{increase}} the temperature, and thus the specific impulse, is to isolate the nuclear fuel elements so {{they no longer have}} to be of the rigid fuel rod type. This is the basis of the particle-bed reactor, also known as the <b>fluidized-bed,</b> dust-bed, or rotating-bed design. In this design the fuel is placed in a number of (typically spherical) elements which [...] "float" [...] inside the hydrogen working fluid. Spinning the entire engine forces the fuel elements out to walls that are being cooled by the hydrogen. This design increases the specific impulse to about 1000 seconds (9.8 kNÂ·s/kg), allowing for thrust-to-weight ratios greater than 1:1, although at the cost of increased complexity. Such a design could share design elements with a pebble-bed reactor, several of which are currently generating electricity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fluidized-bed</b> {{combustion}} {{evolved from}} {{efforts to find}} a combustion process able to control pollutant emissions without external emission controls (such as scrubbers-flue gas desulfurization). The technology burns fuel at temperatures of 1,400 to 1,700 Â°F (750-900 Â°C), well below the threshold where nitrogen oxides form (at approximately 2,500 Â°F / 1400 Â°C, the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the combustion air combine to form nitrogen oxide pollutants); it also avoids the ash melting problems related to high combustion temperature. The mixing action of the fluidized bed brings the flue gases into contact with a sulfur-absorbing chemical, such as limestone or dolomite. More than 95% of the sulfur pollutants in coal can be captured inside the boiler by the sorbent. The reductions may be less substantial than they seem, however, as they coincide with dramatic increases in carbon (monoxide?) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons emissions.|$|E
50|$|Nanoscale metal {{catalysts}} {{are important}} ingredients for fixed- and <b>fluidized-bed</b> CVD synthesis of CNTs. They allow increasing the growth efficiency of CNTs and may give {{control over their}} structure and chirality. During synthesis, catalysts can convert carbon precursors into tubular carbon structures but can also form encapsulating carbon overcoats. Together with metal oxide supports they may therefore attach to or become incorporated into the CNT product. The presence of metal impurities can be problematic for many applications. Especially catalyst metals like nickel, cobalt or yttrium may be of toxicological concern. While unencapsulated catalyst metals may be readily removable by acid washing, encapsulated ones require oxidative treatment for opening their carbon shell. The effective removal of catalysts, especially of encapsulated ones, while preserving the CNT structure is a challenge and has been addressed in many studies. A new approach to break carbonaceaous catalyst encapsulations is based on rapid thermal annealing.|$|E

5000|$|Gasifiers are {{of three}} main types - entrained flow, moving bed, and {{fluidized}} bed. [...] Entrained flow gasifiers (e.g., GE Energy, Shell, E-Gasâ„¢, Siemens) could attract early interest for fuel cell power system applications {{because they are}} relatively well developed and are used in current integrated gasification combined cycle power system designs and applications. Entrained flow gasification typically proceeds at relatively high process temperatures, requires oxygen input at relatively high rates, steam input at low to moderate rates, and it produces a syngas product with very small methane content, typically less than 1% (vol). Cold gas efficiencies for entrained flow gasification are usually in the 80% range.The moving-bed gasifier (e.g., Lurgi) operates at moderate temperature levels, and with moderate oxygen and steam supply requirements. The cold gas efficiency achieved by this gasifier is higher, circa 90%, and its syngas product stream will have methane content nominally in the 4-5% (vol) range. <b>Fluidized-bed</b> gasification (e.g., KBR Transport) proceeds with similar characteristics, but will exhibit somewhat lower syngas methane content, typically in the 2-3% (vol) range.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{processes}} {{can greatly}} reduce {{the volume of}} the sludge, as well as achieve remediation of all or some of the biological concerns. Direct waste-to-energy incineration and complete combustion systems (such as the Gate 5 Energy System) will require multi-step cleaning of the exhaust gas, to ensure no hazardous substances are released. In addition, the ash produced by incineration or incomplete combustion processes (such as <b>fluidized-bed</b> dryers) may be difficult to use without subsequent treatment due to high heavy metal content; solutions to this include leaching of the ashes to remove heavy metals {{or in the case of}} ash produced in a complete-combustion process, or with biochar produced from a pyrolytic process, the heavy metals may be fixed in place and the ash material readily usable as a LEEDs preferred additive to concrete or asphalt.Examples of other ways to use dried sewage sludge as an energy resource include the Gate 5 Energy System, an innovative process to power a steam turbine using heat from burning milled and dried sewage sludge, or combining dried sewage sludge with coal in coal-fired power stations. In both cases this allows for production of electricity with less carbon-dioxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power stations.|$|E
