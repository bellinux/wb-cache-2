C. difficile is currently a leading <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infection</b> in the UK, and rivals MRSA as the most common organism to cause hospital acquired infections in the US It is responsible for a series of intestinal health complications, often referred to collectively as Clostridium difficile Associated Disease (CDAD).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} incidence {{rates of}} <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> {{and to develop}} preventive measures {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections.</b> METHODS: Prospective surveillance for <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> was performed during a 5 -year period in the wards housing general and vascular, thoracic, orthopedic, and general gynecologic and gynecologic-oncologic surgery of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Data were collected from patients with and without infections, using criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: The infection control team recorded 648 <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> affecting 550 (14 %) of 3, 845 patients. The incidence density was 17. 8 per 1, 000 patient-days. Patients with <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> were hospitalized for 19. 8 days versus 7. 7 days for patients without <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections.</b> Prolongation of stay among patients with <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> may have resulted in 664 fewer admissions due to unavailable beds. Different specialties were associated with different infection rates at different sites, requiring a tailor-made approach. Interventions were recommended for respiratory tract infections in the thoracic surgery ward and for surgical-site infections in the orthopedic and gynecologic surgery wards. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance in four surgical wards showed that each had its own prominent infection, risk factors, and indications for specific recommendations. Because prospective surveillance requires extensive resources, we considered a modified approach based on a half-yearly point-prevalence survey of <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> in all wards of our hospital. Such surveillance can be extended with procedure-specific prospective surveillance when indicate...|$|R

[...] Although S. aureus can be present on the skin of the host, a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears. The ability of the nasal passages to harbour [...] S. aureus results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacterium's ability to evade host innate immunity. Nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections.|$|E

The aim of this study is to undertake a pilot study in two healthcare facilities in North Queensland about patients' knowledge and perceptions about <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections.</b> Methods: We used a questionnaire previously used in the United Kingdom, adapted with permission, in a tertiary-level North Queensland hospital and a smaller, remote facility in Far North Queensland. A convenience sample of surgical inpatients in each facility was invited to complete the questionnaire. Results: Forty-two of the 51 respondents (29 men, 22 women) were from the large hospital. The majority (n= 42) were aware of the risk of <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> before their surgery and had adequate information (n= 36) and understanding (n= 41). Sources of their information were diverse, with doctors, the hospital and television most frequently being nominated, although many indicated that the media did not accurately portray <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections.</b> Knowledge of specific bacteria was quite poor. Staff and visitors using alcoholic hand-rub and involving patients more in their own care were the most frequently offered options for preventing <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections.</b> Conclusion: We plan to administer the questionnaire to a larger number of patients across more Australian facilities. Responses will inform interventions to further improve the knowledge and understanding of <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> of future patients...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the {{thoughts}} and experiences of critical care nurses in regard to <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> and patient safety. This study uses a qualitative design based on focus group interviews. Inclusion criteria for the focus group panels were the following: nurses with advanced training in anesthesiology, intensive care or operating room nurses. The findings show that respect for hygiene protocols becomes reduced over time and this affects patient safety. A busy and stressful work environment can also be a problem when having to adhere to these protocols. They also pointed out the consequences of poor role models in that it was everyone’s responsibility to adhere to hygiene protocols. Finally, the more experienced nurses had often not up-dated their education. In conclusion, critical care nurses have experienced that <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> and a decrease in patient safety can be result of poor hand hygiene, failure to comply with established protocols, poor role models and a busy and stressful environment. Thoughts and experiences of critical care nurses should be considered in clinical practices in order to reduce <b>hospital-acquired</b> <b>infections</b> and preserve patient safety...|$|R
