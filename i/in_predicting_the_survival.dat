MethodsPlasma EBV-DNA and serum VCA-IgA in 506 NPC patients in this retrospective study were detected by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay, respectively. The value of positivity for EBV-DNA and/or VCA-IgA <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> of patients with NPC was analyzed. ResultsPatients with positivity for both EBV-DNA and VCA-IgA had significantly shorter periods of relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than those with positive single measure or negative for both measures, and patients with positive single measure had significantly shorter periods of RFS and OS than those with negative for both. Multivariate analysis indicated that the positivity for EBV-DNA and/or VCA-IgA were significant risk factors for shorter periods of RFS and OS. ConclusionThese data indicated that positivity for both EBV-DNA and VCA-IgA was a better biomarker for {{the prognosis of}} patients with NPC.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} mindset on the accuracy and bias of relationship evaluations. Because deliberation about important decisions {{is a time when}} people are more realistic and impartial in processing information about themselves and the world, a deliberative mindset was expected to increase the predictive accuracy of relationship appraisals compared to an implemental mindset. Four studies using different methodologies tested this hypothesis. In Study 1, relationship mindset assessed via content coding interacted with commitment <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> of the relationship 4 months later. In Study 2, mindset assessed via closed questions about academic goals interacted with explicit forecasts <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> of the relationship 9 months later. In studies 3 and 4, an experimental manipulation of mindset interacted with explicit forecasts or relationship assessments of relationship constructs in predicting relationship survival 6 months later. Overall, a deliberative mindset increased the accuracy of relationship predictions and the validity of relationship constructs in predicting the dissolution of a relationship compared to an implemental mindset. Importantly, deliberatives were not more pessimistic than were implementals; they were more realistic. Nonetheless, a deliberative mindset about an important goal in the relationship can be threatening. Previous work found that boosting perceptions of partner superiority is one way to cope with such threat (Gagne & Lydon, 2001, Study 1). Study 5 further showed that participants in a deliberative mindset boosted their perceptions of partner superiority only if they were sufficiently committed to their relationships. Those in an implemental mindset boosted their perceptions of partner superiority irrespective of their commitment level. In sum, a deliberative mindset about the relationship increases the accuracy of evaluations serving epistemic needs (i. e., relationship predictions) while...|$|E

Significant among these new sources are copy number variation (CNV) datasets, which typically enumerate several hundred thousand CNVs distributed throughout the genome.

To address this issue, the extensive toolsets used for analyzing expression data in cancerous and noncancerous tissue (e. g., gene set enrichment analysis and phenotype prediction) could be redirected to extract a great deal of predictive information from CNV data, in particular those derived from cancers.

Present study was designed to determine effective genes on survival time for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients and <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> time using these selected genes. Materials & Methods: Present study is a cohort study was conducted on 40 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For these patients, 2042 gene expression was measured. <b>In</b> order to <b>predict</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> time, <b>the</b> composition of <b>the</b> semi-parametric additive <b>survival</b> model with two gene selection methods elastic net and lasso were used. Two methods were evaluated by plotting area under the ROC curve over time and calculating the integral of this curve. Results: Based on our findings, the elastic net method identified 10 genes, and Lasso-Cox method identified 7 genes.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the value of}} pre-operative contrast-enhanced MR imaging (CE-MRI) <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> disease-free and overall survival in breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 50 consecutive patients with histopathologically verified primary breast cancer who pre-operatively underwent CE-MRI examination between 1992 and 1993. A three-time point MR examination was performed where the enhancement rates (C 1 and C 2), signal enhancement ratio (SER=C 1 /C 2) and washout (W=C 1 -C 2) were calculated. The relation of these MR parameters to disease-free and overall <b>survival</b> was investigated. <b>The</b> median follow-up for surviving patients was 95 months. Univariate and multivariate {{statistical analyses were performed}} to evaluate the impact of different factors on prediction of <b>survival.</b> RESULTS: Of <b>the</b> MR parameters examined at univariate analysis, increased C 1 (p= 0. 029), W (p= 0. 0081) and SER values (p= 0. 0081) were significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival, and only C 1 (p= 0. 016) was related significantly to overall survival. Multivariate analysis for disease-free <b>survival</b> showed that <b>the</b> SER (p= 0. 014) and tumor size (p= 0. 001) were significant and independent predictors. Age (p= 0. 003), lymph node status (p= 0. 014), tumor size (p= 0. 039) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen index (p= 0. 053) remained independently associated with overall survival at multivariate analysis.

Previous studies used frozen biopsy tissues to identify crucial genes as prognostic markers. We explored the prognostic value of peripheral blood (PB) molecular signatures in patients with advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fractions from patients with advanced NSCLC were applied for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the expression profiling of eight genes: DUSP 6, MMD, CPEB 4, RNF 4, STAT 2, NF 1, IRF 4, and ZNF 264. Proportional hazard (PH) models were constructed to evaluate the association of the eight expressing genes and multiple clinical factors [e. g., sex, smoking status, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ] with overall survival. Results: One hundred and forty-one patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled. They included 109 (77. 30 %) patients with adenocarcinoma, 12 (8. 51 %) patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and 20 (14. 18 %) patients with other pathological lung cancer types.

METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the survival of 172 cirrhotic patients. The model was constructed using clinical (ascites, encephalopathy and variceal bleeding) and biochemical (serum creatinine and serum total bilirubin) variables that were selected from a Cox proportional hazards model. It was applied to estimate 12 -, 52 - and 104 -wk survival. The model’s calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was computed at 104 wk in a validation dataset. Finally, the model’s validity was tested among an independent set of 85 patients who were stratified into 2 risk groups (low risk ≤ 8 and high risk > 8). RESULTS: In the validation cohort, all measures of fit, discrimination and calibration were improved when the biochemical and clinical model was used. The proposed model had better predictive values (c-statistic: 0. 90, 0. 91, 0. 91) than the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh (CP) scores for 12 -, 52 - and 104 -wk mortality, respectively. In addition, the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) statistic revealed that the biochemical and clinical model (H-L, 4. 69) is better calibrated than MELD (H-L, 17. 06) and CP (H-L, 14. 23).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{prediction}} of prognosis for cancer patients {{is important for}} good clinical decision making in therapeutic and care strategies. The application of prognostic tools and indicators could improve prediction accuracy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed {{to develop a new}} prognostic scale to predict survival time of advanced cancer patients in China. METHODS: We prospectively collected items that we anticipated might influence survival time of advanced cancer patients. Participants were recruited from 12 hospitals in Shanghai, China. We collected data including demographic information, clinical symptoms and signs, and biochemical test results. Log-rank tests, Cox regression, and linear regression were performed to develop a prognostic scale. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty patients with advanced cancer were recruited. Fourteen prognostic factors were included in the prognostic scale: Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) score, pain, ascites, hydrothorax, edema, delirium, cachexia, white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, sodium, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values.

MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fractions from patients with advanced NSCLC were applied for RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the expression profiling of eight genes: DUSP 6, MMD, CPEB 4, RNF 4, STAT 2, NF 1, IRF 4, and ZNF 264. Proportional hazard (PH) models were constructed to evaluate the association of the eight expressing genes and multiple clinical factors [e. g., sex, smoking status, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ] with overall survival. ResultsOne hundred and forty-one patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled. They included 109 (77. 30 %) patients with adenocarcinoma, 12 (8. 51 %) patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and 20 (14. 18 %) patients with other pathological lung cancer types. A PH model containing two significant survival-associated genes, CPEB 4 and IRF 4, could help <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>survival</b> of patients with advanced stage NSCLC [hazard ratio (HR)  =  0. 48, p <  0. 0001). Adding multiple clinical factors further improved the prediction power of prognosis (HR =  0. 33; p <  0. 0001). ConclusionMolecular signatures in PB can stratify the prognosis in patients with advanced NSCLC. Further prospective, interventional clinical trials should be performed to test if gene profiling also predicts resistance to chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{aimed to}} {{validate}} the prognostic models for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in Chinese patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), and to compare their performances <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> long-term <b>survival.</b> METHODS: Chinese patients with PBC from a tertiary center were identified via electronic search of hospital medical registry. Risk factors associated with adverse events (liver transplantation or death from liver-related causes including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver decompensation) were determined. Transplant-free survival was defined as survival free of liver-related death or transplantation. RESULTS: Of the 144 patients, 41 (28. 5 %) had baseline cirrhosis. The median age at diagnosis was 57. 8 years. During a median follow-up of 7. 0 years, 40 patients died (21 liver-related; 19 non-liver-related), 12 developed HCC, and 10 underwent transplantations. The 5 -, 10 -, and 15 -year transplant-free survival probabilities were 91. 0 %, 78. 1 %, and 58. 9 %, respectively. Independent risk factors for adverse events were increasing age (hazard ratio (HR) 1. 05), cirrhosis (HR 8. 53), and suboptimal treatment response (HR 3. 06). Aspartate aminotransferase/platelet ratio index at 1 year (APRI-r 1) in combination with treatment response optimized the risk stratification. The performances of the GLOBE, UK-PBC scores, Rotterdam criteria, and APRI-r 1 were comparable <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> adverse events. <b>The</b> area under receiver operating curves within 5, 10, and 15 years were as follows-GLOBE score: 0. 83, 0. 85, and 0. 85, respectively; UK-PBC score: 0. 89, 0. 83, and 0. 79, respectively; Rotterdam criteria: 0. 82, 0. 76, and 0. 80, respectively; APRI-r 1 : 0. 80, 0. 83, and 0. 77, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The UK-PBC, GLOBE scores, Rotterdam criteria, and APRI-r 1 had good and comparable prognostic prediction values for Chinese PBC patients receiving UCDA. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{consensus}} as to which staging system is best <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aims of this study were to identify independent predictors of survival and to compare 7 available prognostic staging systems in patients with HCC. A total of 239 consecutive patients with cirrhosis and HCC seen between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003, were included. Demographic, laboratory, and tumor characteristics and performance status were determined at diagnosis and before therapy. Predictors of survival were identified using the Kaplan–Meir test and the Cox model. Sixty-two percent of patients had hepatitis C, 56 % had more than 1 tumor nodule, 24 % had portal vein thrombosis, and 29 % did not receive any cancer treatment. At the time of censorship, 153 (63 %) patients had died. The 1 - and 3 -year survival of the entire cohort was 58 % and 29 %, respectively. The independent predictors of survival were performance status (P <. 0001), MELD score greater than 10 (P =. 001), portal vein thrombosis (P =. 0001), and tumor diameter greater than 4 cm (P =. 001). Treatment of HCC was related to overall survival. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system had the best independent predictive power for survival when compared with the other 6 prognostic systems. In conclusion, performance status, tumor extent, liver function, and treatment were independent predictors of survival mostly in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. The BCLC staging system includes aspects of all of these elements and provided the best prognostic stratification for our cohort of patients with HCC. (H EPATOLOGY 2005. ...|$|E
40|$|Non-small cell lung cancers {{are among}} the leading causes of cancer {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. The prognosis is usually based on traditional pathohistological parameters and clinical stage, but additional prognostic survival factors have also been sought. The aim of this retrospective {{study was to explore}} the membranous expression of HER- 2 /neu and estrogen receptors in nonsmall cell lung cancers and their relation to survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancers and to traditional prognostic factors. The sample consisted of 132 consecutive, surgically resected patient tissues of non-small cell lung cancers, and the following parameters were examined: HER- 2 /neu and estrogen receptor expression, as well as the related clinical and pathological features: tumor, nodes, and metastases stage, level of tumor necrosis, histological and nuclear grade, lymphocytic infiltrate, and number of mitoses. HER- 2 /neu was positive in 28. 8 % of tumor samples, and estrogen receptor expression was positive in 29. 5 % of tumors, but neither was significantly associated with the outcome of non-small cell lung cancers. There was a significant association between HER- 2 /neu and nuclear grade (P= 0. 01). In addition, the association between estrogen receptor expression and histological type of tumor (P= 0. 04) and mitotic rate (P= 0. 008) was found. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a significant association of patients’ overall survival with the tumor node metastasis stage (P< 0. 001) and the degree of tumor necrosis (P= 0. 02). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that male gender (P= 0. 01), histological type (P= 0. 03), high degree of necrosis (P= 0. 006), and higher histological grade (P= 0. 037) were associated with the patients’ survival. Our findings indicate that the expression of HER- 2 /neu and estrogen receptor is less reliable than traditional histological parameters <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> of patients with non-small cell lung cancers...|$|E
40|$|The {{tissues from}} 70 Chinese {{patients}} with oesophageal {{squamous cell carcinoma}} were prospectively collected to study for the pattern of p 53 mutations and its relationship with clinico-pathological features and prognosis using immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. p 53 over-expression and p 53 mutations were detected in 73 % and 44 % of the patients. These p 53 aberrations had no relationship with the patient age, sex, smoking/drinking habits and tumor site, size or stage. The p 53 over-expression was more intense in moderately/poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas. Thirty-three p 53 mutations were noted in 31 patients; 18. 2 % in exon 5, 15. 2 % in exon 6, 33. 3 % in exon 7 and 33. 3 % in exon 8. Mutations were primarily point mutations and common in codons 248, 273 and 285. There were 46 % transversions, 36 % transitions and 18 % frameshift. The survival of the patients depended mainly {{on the extent of}} resection. In patients with stage III oesophageal cancer, the median survival of those with p 53 mutations was 6. 8 months whereas those without was 12. 5 months. The results were of clinical importance although the value did not reach statistical significance. Thus, there was a definite role of p 53 mutations in the pathogenesis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. p 53 mutations were not synonymous with p 53 over-expression. The distribution of p 53 mutations in oesophageal cancers suggested that the etiologic contribution might be complex and probably involve different exogenous and endogenous exposures. p 53 mutations also appear to play a role <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> of patients with stage III oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the efficacy of four severity-of-disease scoring systems <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> 28 -day <b>survival</b> rate among patients with acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (AECOPD) requiring emergency care. Clinical data of patients with AECOPD who required emergency care were recorded over 2 years. APACHE II, SAPS II, SOFA, and MEDS scores were calculated from severity-of-disease indicators recorded at admission and compared between patients who died within 28 days of admission (death group; 46 patients) {{and those who did not}} (survival group; 336 patients).

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{performed}} of 40 bone marrow trephine biopsies from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Histology, more specifically the abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP), cytology and karyotype analysis were correlated with <b>survival</b> time and <b>the</b> prognostic value of these factors was determined. The {{presence or absence of}} ALIP proved to be highly significant <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> duration of <b>survival</b> (P = 0. 007) : the presence of ALIP predisposes patients to early death with high probability of developing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), whereas the absence of ALIP carries a better prognosis with more long-term survivors and low probability of transformation to AML. The presence or absence of ALIP was not correlated with increased mortality from infection and/or bleeding. In contrast with ALIP, the main histological parameter, {{we were not able to}} obtain statistically significant prognostic information for cytology (FAB classification) or karyotype analysis (normal or abnormal chromosomes). We conclude that bone marrow biopsy provides useful information for the prognosis of MDS and that the presence of ALIP has greater predictive value than the more commonly used parameters deduced from cytology and karyotype. status: publishe...|$|R
