5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen {{watching}} the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with Stephen Hawking. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> admits it is just an act, before deciding to go surfing at the nearby beach.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> starts {{leaving out}} the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then {{turns around and}} sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two {{set out to find}} out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Spooner, alone, stands <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{attempts}} to leave, {{but the door}} is locked. Briggs soon enters to deliver Spooner food and champagne, rambling on about how he met Foster and ignoring Spooner's desire {{to know why the}} door was locked. Spooner thinks of a quick excuse to leave; however, when Briggs mentions that both Foster and Hirst are poets, Spooner shows vague recognition of this fact.|$|E
60|$|Old as he was, he sprang <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> white <b>and</b> trembling.|$|R
60|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} {{he leaped}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> reddened, <b>and</b> went to look-out at the window, for some one had tapped at the door.|$|R
60|$|The wild lord's face saddened. He hesitated; rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> restlessly, <b>and</b> {{walked away}} to the window; returned, and {{made up his mind}} to reply.|$|R
25|$|While in the garden, the {{children}} are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled and angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company. The children conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret, so as to surprise his father, who is travelling abroad. As Colin's health improves, his father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Mrs Sowerby, he takes the opportunity finally to return home. He walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, and his son healthy. The servants watch, stunned, as Mr Craven and Colin walk back to the manor together.|$|E
2500|$|On August 19, 1970, John Norman Collins was {{unanimously}} {{found guilty}} of the first-degree murder of Karen Sue Beineman; he remained impassive upon hearing the jury foreman announce the verdict, although many spectators gasped audibly, and his mother and sister left the courtroom in tears. Formal sentencing was scheduled for 8:30a.m. August 28. On this date, Collins was formally sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Prior to his passing sentence, Judge Conlin asked Collins if he wished {{to address the court}} before mandatory life sentencing was imposed. In response, Collins rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> made the following speech: ...|$|E
2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - I {{carefully}} move father <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, and wait," [...] Mat reiterated, in quick, fierce, quietly uttered {{tones of}} command, rising <b>from</b> <b>his</b> own <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{pointing}} peremptorily {{to the seat}} just vacated by {{the master of the}} house.|$|R
60|$|Draining a final {{glass of}} grog, he rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> said grace, <b>and</b> {{staggered}} on deck.|$|R
60|$|So Leofric was {{received}} back, in full chapter, by abbot and prior {{and all the}} monks. But when he asked them to lay a penance upon him, Ulfketyl arose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> high <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> spoke.|$|R
2500|$|Hopper {{was unable}} to {{capitalize}} on his Easy Rider success for several years. In 1970 he filmed The Last Movie, cowritten by Stewart Stern and photographed by Laszlo Kovacs in Peru, and completed production in 1971. It won the prestigious CIDALC Award at that year's Venice Film Festival, but Universal Studios leaders expected a blockbuster like Easy Rider, and {{did not like the}} film or give it an enthusiastic release, while American film audiences found it confounding - as convoluted as an abstract painting. On viewing the first release print, fresh from the lab, in his screening room at Universal, MCA founder Jules Stein rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I just don't understand this younger generation." [...] During the tumultuous editing process, Hopper ensconced himself at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos, New Mexico, which he had purchased in 1970, for almost an entire year. In between contesting Fonda's rights to the majority of the residual profits from Easy Rider, he married Michelle Phillips in October 1970.|$|E
60|$|He rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{dropped his}} {{cigarette}} into the ash-tray.|$|E
60|$|The Baronet started <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> nearly {{knocked down}} a table.|$|E
60|$|That taunt of his mother's stirred Gian Maria. He rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> ducal <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> descended <b>from</b> {{the dais}} {{on which it}} stood, possessed by a tempestuous mood that would not brook him to sit still.|$|R
60|$|The porter rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hooded <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{put down}} the newspaper, but Tancred had {{advanced}} when he heard his name, and bowed, and followed {{the young man in}} spectacles, who invited Tancred to accompany him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Burge assented, <b>and</b> rising <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> yawned loudly <b>and</b> {{stretched}} himself. In {{the small}} room with his huge arms raised he looked colossal.|$|R
60|$|Douglas rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> walked restlessly up {{and down}} the room.|$|E
60|$|Phipps rose at once <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{made his}} way towards the door.|$|E
60|$|With that {{declaration}} he rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{waited for}} Mr. Vimpany's departure.|$|E
60|$|Then he rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> office <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> I got up, too. My head swam, {{there was}} no doubt about it, and I felt a certain {{heaviness}} of limbs as if they had grown bigger since I had sat down on that chair. I made my bow.|$|R
50|$|He retired <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{mathematics}} <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> left India. He {{settled in}} Madrid and accompanied his ninety-year-old mother until she {{died at the}} age of 101. He continued to write in Gujarati, and began translating and writing in English and Spanish focused on his experiences in India and in Latin America.|$|R
6000|$|Braile limbered himself <b>from</b> <b>his</b> splint-bottom <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> {{came forward}} {{to the edge of}} the porch, as if to be sure of {{spitting}} quite under the claybank's body. Not until he had folded himself down into his seat again and tilted it back did he ask, [...] "Goin' to order a suit?" ...|$|R
60|$|The chauffeur's face brightened. He got up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> solemnly shook Dan'l's hand.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Silk, with a smothered exclamation, {{started up}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{regarded}} him eagerly.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Van Decht rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{shook hands}} solemnly {{with the young}} man.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'M none for worreting," [...] said Mr. Poyser, rising <b>from</b> <b>his</b> three-cornered <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> {{walking slowly}} towards the door; [...] "but I should be loath to leave th' old place, and the parish where I was bred and born, and Father afore me. We should leave our roots behind us, I doubt, and niver thrive again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am happy}} to say that I do not class myself with Prots," [...] said the curate, getting up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> very carefully, <b>and</b> then {{consulting}} his watch. [...] "I must run away now--" ...|$|R
6000|$|He got up <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> again <b>and</b> {{looked away}} {{out of the}} window, while Dinah stood with {{compassionate}} patience. In {{a minute or two}} he turned round and said, [...] "I will come, Dinah...to-morrow morning...if it must be. I may have more strength to bear it, if I know it must be. Tell her, I forgive her; tell her I will come--at the very last." ...|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{was without}} doubt agitated. He rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> paced the room restlessly.|$|E
60|$|The Roman proconsul rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> motioned {{that the}} {{audience}} was at an end.|$|E

60|$|The {{doctor was}} among the listeners, almost the only dry-eyed one, {{but he was not}} dry-eyed because he felt the artless story least. Again and again he rose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> restlessly, <b>and</b> Grizel thought he scowled at her when he was really scowling at himself; as soon as she had {{finished}} he cleared the room brusquely of all intruders, and then he turned on her passionately.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} Jim {{suddenly}} sprang <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> at Lilly, <b>and</b> gave him {{two or three}} hard blows with his fists, upon {{the front of the}} body. Then he sat down in <b>his</b> own <b>chair</b> again, saying sheepishly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Harold, after a moment, arose <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> gaunt <b>and</b> {{unsteady}} as he was. [...] "That's what I'm fitted for, Mary. That solves my problem. I {{know these}} cattlemen, they know me. I am the white chief of Talfeather's people. If {{you can stand}} it to live there with me, Mary, I will go. We can do good; the women need some one like you to teach 'em to do things." ...|$|R
