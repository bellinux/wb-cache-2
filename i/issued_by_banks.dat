25|$|Card-issuing bank: The {{financial}} institution or other organization that issued {{the credit card}} to the cardholder. This bank bills the consumer for repayment and bears {{the risk that the}} card is used fraudulently. American Express and Discover were previously the only card-issuing banks for their respective brands, but as of 2007, this is no longer the case. Cards <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>banks</b> to cardholders in a different country are known as offshore credit cards.|$|E
25|$|The {{fractured}} {{nature of}} the U.S. banking system under the Glass–Steagall Act meant that credit cards became an effective way {{for those who were}} traveling around the country to move their credit to places where they could not directly use their banking facilities. There are now countless variations on the basic concept of revolving credit for individuals (as <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>banks</b> and honored by a network of financial institutions), including organization-branded credit cards, corporate-user credit cards, store cards and so on.|$|E
25|$|Subordinated {{bonds are}} those that have a lower {{priority}} than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the liquidator is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds {{can be found in}} bonds <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>banks,</b> and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.|$|E

25|$|Also {{during the}} 1810s, St. Louis merchants began facing {{the problem of}} too little bullion {{currency}} {{and an increase in}} the supply of unreliable paper currency <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>banks</b> in Kentucky and Ohio. To improve upon the de facto barter economy of St. Louis, in December 1816 a group of merchants formed the Bank of St. Louis, which was chartered by the territorial legislature and accepted furs as collateral. However, the bank failed as a result of mismanagement and fraud on the part of its cashier. In early 1817, another group of merchants formed the Bank of Missouri, which initially was successful and became a United States depository bank with $150,000 in guaranteed deposits. However, the Second Bank of the United States contracted its currency policy in late 1818, causing the Panic of 1819 and the eventual closure of the Bank of Missouri.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{continued}} {{to attack the}} banking system. His Specie Circular of July 1836 rejected paper money <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>banks</b> (it {{could no longer be}} used to buy federal land), insisting on gold and silver coins. [...] Most businessmen and bankers (but not all) went over to the Whig party, and the commercial and industrial cities became Whig strongholds. Jackson meanwhile became even more popular with the subsistence farmers and day laborers who distrusted bankers and finance.|$|E

Emergency circulating notes (also termed [...] "guerrilla pesos") were also <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>banks</b> and local governments, using crude inks and materials, which were redeemable in silver pesos {{after the end of the}} war. The puppet state under José P. Laurel outlawed possession of guerrilla currency and declared a monopoly on the issuance of money and anyone found to possess guerrilla notes could be arrested. Because of the fiat nature of the currency, the Philippine economy felt the effects of hyperinflation.|$|E

40|$|Douglas W. Diamond (1991) {{argues that}} a firm's {{reputation}} determines whether it borrows directly or through an intermediary. The authors test the Diamond model by examining the quantity response of commercial paper <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>bank</b> holding companies to a rating downgrade. From 1986 to 1991, cumulative abnormal declines averaged 6. 69 {{percent in the first}} two weeks after the downgrade and 11. 05 percent in the subsequent twelve weeks. In contrast to commercial paper <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> <b>bank</b> holding companies, large CDs <b>issued</b> <b>by</b> affiliated <b>banks</b> did not change significantly in the period around a downgrade, suggesting that deposit insurance may have removed market discipline from the CD market.
