Hydrocarbon gases were further divided into coal-type gas, oil-type gas, and biogas according to the kerogen types and formation mechanisms. The oil-type gases were divided into mature oil-type gas (oil-associated gas), highly mature oil-type gas.

The samples from the Sargelu and Upper Neyriz zones contain similar amounts of fractions. Their saturated and polar components are around 54.4 – 61.6 % and 24 – 30 %, respectively (Table  2). Aromatic fractions range from 14.4 to 15.6 % (Table  2; Fig.  5). However, the Lower Neyriz zone contains relatively high amounts of polar component (61.3 %) and saturated and aromatic fractions of 21.4 % and 17.3 %, respectively (Fig.  5). The chemical composition of bitumen extracts depends on the parent organic matter and thermal maturity (Tissot and Welte 1984).

Based on investigation of gas composition, carbon isotope ratios, light <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>properties,</b> as well as geological analysis, natural gases in the Jiyang Depression are classified into two types, one is organic gas and the other is abiogenic gas. Abiogenic gas is mainly magmatogenic or mantle-derived CO 2. Organic gases are further divided into coal-type gas, oil-type gas, and biogas according to their kerogen types and formation mechanisms. The oil-type gases are divided into mature oil-type gas (oil-associated gas) and highly mature oil-type gas. The highly mature oil-type gases can be subdivided into oil-cracking gas and kerogen thermal degradation gas. Identification factors for each kind of hydrocarbon gas were summarized. Based on genesis analysis results, the genetic types of gases buried in different depths were discussed. Results showed that shallow gases (< 1, 500  m) are mainly mature oil-type gases, biogas, or secondary gases. Secondary gases are rich in methane because of chromatographic separation during migration and secondary biodegradation. Secondary biodegradation leads to richness of heavy carbon isotope ratios in methane and propane. Genesis of middle depth gases (1, 500 – 3, 500  m) is dominated by mature oil-type gases. Deep gases (3, 500 – 5, 500  m) are mainly kerogen thermal degradation gas, oil-cracking gas, and coal-type gas.|$|E

For offshore activities, subsurface is an area below the seabed. These data consists of geological and geophysical (G&G) elements to analyze the hydrocarbon accumulations or prospects area. Surface consists of the data covered from the water column to the seabed data such as platform, pipeline and infrastructure data which support the E&P activities.

40|$|Differences in {{molecular}} properties between linear and branched alkanes as well {{as between}} compounds with branched alkyl groups is of relevance due to the large number of branched isomers of environmentally relevant compounds (e. g. fuels, fuel additives, surfactants). For branched alkane vapor pressures, the McGowan specific volume is a poor predictor. Therefore, in this study a correction on the McGowan specific volume is derived {{in terms of the number}} of branches and the number of pairs of vicinal branches to improve the prediction of branched alkane vapor pressures. This branching correction also brought branched /alkane solvent accessible volumes, octanol/water partition coefficients, air/hexadecane partition coefficients, and aqueous solubilities {{as well as}} alkyl-branched substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon air/hexadecane partition coefficients more in line with corresponding linear <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>properties</b> when compared on a McGowan specific volume basis. Even for air-hexadecane partition coefficients of substituted aliphatic hydrocarbons with substituents at non-terminal carbons, application of the branching correction to the carbon bearing the substituent caused these partition coefficients to be more in line with those for linear compounds. Values for the Abraham A and B solvation parameters for nonlinear aliphatic ethers, amines, and alcohols, recalculated using branching corrected McGowan specific volumes, turned out to be closer to chemical expectations based on linear aliphatic ether, amine and alcohol values compared to previously reported experimental values obtained using uncorrected McGowan specific volumes. A comparison of alkylbenzene and alkene partition coefficient estimates from two different linear solvation energy relations, one containing a McGowan specific volume term and one without such a term, suggests that no branching correction is needed for alkyl groups at sp 2 carbons.

40|$|AbstractReservoir pore spaces (incl. pores, {{fractures}} and vugs) are {{too complex}} to be predicted {{by use of}} the traditional interrelationships between the four properties of reservoirs, thus more and more contradictions occur in reservoir evaluation. A great number of case studies were made to reveal the causes of these contradictions and the corresponding solutions were also proposed. For the reservoirs with complex pore spaces, we found four common types of contradictions between porosity and permeability, porosity and water saturation, absolute permeability and effective permeability, and electrical <b>property</b> and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>property.</b> These contradictions are mainly caused by variation of pore types, pore-throat sizes and fracture occurrence. On this basis, the concept of geometrical property was presented and methods were discussed for qualitatively or quantitatively describing the geometrical properties of pores, fractures and vugs. The following findings were achieved. (1) For pores, two relationships were established between pores & throat sizes and rock textures, physical property & fluid property, and between pore types and fluid property & logging responses. (2) For fractures, five relationships were established between occurrence and pore texture index (m), radial extension and deep/shallow borehole resistivity, openness and fracture permeability, occurrence and matrix water saturation, and between development index and lithology. (3) For vugs, two relationships were established between size & connectivity and m value & three porosities derived from logging responses (neutron, density and sonic wave), and filling degree and logging responses.

The results of an evaluation of thrust fault evolution and hydro-carbon sealing behaviour in the Lenghu 5 thrust belt of the Qaidam basin of NW China are reported. A multi-scale methodology, ranging from regional- to micro-scale, is utilized in this work to identify the detailed thrust fault architecture and its effect on <b>hydrocarbon</b> sealing <b>properties.</b> Regional-scale sections and 3 D modelling are used to evaluate the evolution of faults within this thrust system and as a platform for detailed seal analysis. The results allow assessment of the timing of deformation, shortening and shorten-ing strain rate. Trishear models are used to assess deformation in the Lenghu 5 thrust belt. Based on trishear propagation geometric models, the Lenghu 5 de-formation history is simulated using forward trishear modelling. A range of trishear modelling parameters is used to interpret the various structural styles presented. This provides new insights to the potential application of trishear mechanism in complex natural structures developed in different environments. Meso-scale detailed structural maps of exceptionally well-exposed outcrops are used to extract information on local fault geometry. Main thrust faults, minor thrust faults and accommodation normal faults are all mapped in detail, making it possible to evaluate the differences of fault architectures between different types of faults.
