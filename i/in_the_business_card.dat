40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of the SmartBadge; an electronic replacement for the standard paper name badge worn at conferences and similar events. Both hardware and software have been designed for the SmartBadge; the hardware has been developed around a CC 1010 microcontroller and RF transceiver. Attached to this are an infrared transceiver, an LCD display, some LEDs, buttons and a piezoelectric buzzer. There is also an antenna for the RF transceiver whose design is the result of SuperNEC [1] simulations. Protocol software development has focussed on the communication between a SmartBadge and other badges and base stations, yet there is still space available in the CC 1010 s flash memory to develop applications beyond the business card exchange example developed to demonstrate the communication software. The SmartBadge communicates with other badges by using the infrared transceiver. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>card</b> application a SmartBadge is worn by a person and is collecting the ID and a time counter from SmartBadges worn by other facing people as this person mingles through a conference or similar event. This data is then collected in real time using the RF transceiver to communicate with base stations which would be scattered around the venue. The RF network has been designed as a single hop network and a new Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has been designed to allow the SmartBadges to share the links to the base stations while conserving as much energy as possible. This protocol is called Uplink MAC (or U-MAC) and is described in section 6. 2. i i...|$|E

Extraction of text regions and segmenting them into characters is one of such challenges.

Then, various rule based techniques are applied on the Connected Components (CC) to filter out the noises and picture regions. The CCs identified as text are then binarized using an adaptive but light-weight binarization technique.

Of <b>the</b> episodes <b>in</b> Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan during the 2000 s, Korea experienced the most serious boom-bust cycle in 2003.

Data definition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scoring ware based on passed facts that create delinquency risks as the benchmark. The target of this enhancement is the customer profile and transaction authorization processing. Scoring ware results used two system concepts in Information System, that which only create supporting data (Decision Support System-DSS) and that which directly made up decision (Expert System-ES). Customer Profile Scoring ware would behave as a DSS while the customer profile score was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> judgment rating range, but it would behave as an ES while the score over the minimum rating or below the declined rating.

The Sheffield Pavilion was a totally new variation on a small series of city or location-specific interpretations of the national pavilion construct which aimed to challenge the notion that art practice in non-metropolitan areas operates on a provincial or parochial level or conversely suggest that the international art world is simply another such parish. The construct of the ‘Pavilion’ (a temporary structure used for leisure, entertainment or exhibition) was again used in 2009 to structure the project and the artists’ contributions.

40|$|The present work {{studies the}} {{application}} of two group discriminant analysis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of credit scoring. The view here given provides a completely different approach to how this problem is usually targeted. Credit scoring is widely used among financial institutions and is performed {{in a number of}} ways, depending {{on a wide range of}} factors, which include available information, support data bases, and informatic resources. Since each financial institution has its own methods of measuring risk, <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which an applicant is evaluated for the concession of credit for a particular product are at least as many as credit concessioners. However, there exist certain standard procedures for different products. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> credit <b>card</b> <b>business,</b> when databases containing applicant information are available, usually credit score cards are constructed. These score cards provide an aid to qualify the applicant and decide if he or she represents a high risk for the institution or, on the contrary, a good investment. Score cards are generally used in conjunction with other criteria, such as the institution's own policies. In building score cards, generally parametric regression based procedures are used, where the assumption of an underlying model generating the data has to be made. Another aspect is that, in general, score cards are built taking into consideration only the probability that a particular applicant will not default. <b>In</b> this thesis, <b>the</b> objective will be to present a method of calculating a risk score that, does not depend on the actual process generating the data and that takes into account the costs and profits related to accepting a particular applicant. The ultimate objective of the financial institution should be to maximise profit and this view is a fundamental part of the procedure presented here.
