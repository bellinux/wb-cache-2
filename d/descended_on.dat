5|$|Another ice {{famine in}} 1870 then {{impacted}} both Boston and the Hudson, with a further famine following in 1880; {{as a result}} entrepreneurs <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the Kennebec River in Maine as an alternative source. The Kennebec, along with the Penboscot and Sheepscot, was widely opened up for the ice industry, becoming an important source, particularly in warm winters, {{for the rest of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|As Allied forces <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> Zagreb, Blažeković {{left the}} city on 6 May 1945 and fled from Slovenia into Austria. He was {{subsequently}} placed in a refugee camp in Salzburg. On 28 August, American forces arrested him and sent him to a detainment camp before having him extradited to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. Blažeković was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.|$|E

5|$|Once the new king, Edward III, {{came of age}} {{and assumed}} {{personal}} control of government, he annulled the charges against his uncle. The title and estates of the Earl of Kent <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> Edmund's son, also called Edmund. When this Edmund died, in 1331, his brother John became earl. Though he was officially exonerated, Edmund did not enjoy a great reputation during his life and afterwards, due to his unreliable political dealings.|$|E

Just before dawn on 21 August, about 200 men from the 11th took part in an attack around Mouquet Farm; {{casualties}} amounted to 20 killed and 40 wounded and afterwards the battalion was moved to Belgium. The 11th Battalion spent the remainder of 1916 in the Ypres sector, in Flanders, but was {{moved back to the}} Somme {{at the end of the}} year as the worst winter in 40 years <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the front.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the absence}} {{of support from the}} Royal Navy, the New England {{expedition}} set out in March 1745 for Louisbourg. More than 4,000 men on more than 90 transports (mainly fishing boats and coastal traders), escorted by six colonial guard ships, <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> Canso, where the expedition waited for the ice to clear from Gabarus Bay, the site just south of Louisbourg that had been chosen for the troop landing. Starting on 22 April the expedition was joined by four Royal Navy warships under the command of Commodore Warren, who received orders (issued in January, but not received until after his previous refusal) to assist the expedition.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, {{out of sight of the}} rest of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The {{obligations}} and offices {{that came with}} {{being one of the}} largest local landowners <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> Mason as they had on his father and grandfather. In 1747, he was named to the Fairfax County Court. Mason was elected as a vestryman for Truro Parish, serving 1749–1785. He took a position among the officers of the county militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by more senior members of the court and he was not then successful, but he would win in 1758.|$|E

Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> earth {{in the shape of}} white elephants with six tusks, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{reversed}} {{the election results}} after a dispute, incensed Republicans armed themselves and <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> Frankfort. Taylor's Democratic opponent, William Goebel, was shot and died after being sworn in on his deathbed. Taylor exhausted his finances in a legal battle with Goebel's running mate J. C. W. Beckham over the governorship. Taylor ultimately lost the battle, and was implicated in Goebel's assassination. He fled to neighboring Indiana. Despite eventually being pardoned for any wrongdoing, he seldom returned to Kentucky. Taylor died in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1928.|$|E

Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern {{was not to be}} caught in the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E

Despite the restrictive 6:30pm time slot, Neighbours has also covered many serious {{problems such as}} teenage pregnancy, marital breakdown, imprisonment, career problems, financial problems, pregnancy, abortion, eating disorders, alcoholism, adultery, drug use and drug trafficking, robbery, stalking, kidnapping, accidental death, hit-and-runs, murder, shootings, stabbings, and incest. In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and alzheimer's disease. In September 2014, the show featured a natural disaster storyline, in which a tornado <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> Erinsborough and Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{established}} a shipyard on the Sheepscot River at Merrymeeting Bay in Maine in 1675 at {{the outbreak of}} King Philips War. The shipyard was successful, turning {{out a number of}} small boats and building its first large merchant ship in 1676. As he was preparing for its maiden voyage in August 1676, planning to deliver a load of lumber to Boston, a band of Indians <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the area during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1676). Rather than take on his cargo, he took on board as many of the local settlers as he could. Although he was financially ruined (the Indians destroyed the shipyard and his intended cargo of masts and lumber), Phips was considered a hero among the colonists in Boston.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of a royal prince was a great provocation to the seventeen-year-old Edward III, {{who had not been}} informed about the decision, and it probably contributed to the king's decision to rise up against his protector. In 1330, Edward III carried out a coup installing himself in personal control of government, and Mortimer was executed. Among the charges against Mortimer was that of procuring Edmund's death, and the charges against the late earl of Kent were annulled. In late 1325, Edmund had married Margaret Wake, sister of Thomas Wake, Baron Wake of Liddell, and the couple had several children. His lands and titles <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> his oldest son by the same name, but this Edmund himself died in October 1331. The earldom then passed to the younger son John.|$|E

5|$|The {{expeditionary force}} left Bombay on 17 September, {{intending}} to rendezvous at Muscat the following week. However, the force was repeatedly delayed during their passage, first with providing escorts to convoys of country {{ships in the}} Arabian Sea and subsequently with rescuing survivors of the Stromboli, which was so rotten that she fell apart in the ocean swell with considerable loss of life. When the force eventually arrived at Muscat in October, Sultan Sa'id informed Wainwright that over 20,000 Bedouin warriors had <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the coast to join the Al Qasimi. Understanding that a protracted land campaign would be impossible with the forces available, Wainwright determined to make {{a series of small}} raids against the principle pirate bases {{in the area of the}} Straits of Hormuz, beginning with Ras al-Khaimah, to the north of the Strait on the Arabian coast.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Parnell's speech in Ennis, a process server and {{seventeen}} {{members of the}} Royal Irish Constabulary began the attempt to serve Boycott's eviction notices. Legally, {{they had to be}} delivered {{to the head of the}} household or his spouse within a certain time period. The process server successfully delivered notices to three of the tenants, but a fourth, Mrs Fitzmorris, refused to accept the notice and began waving a red flag to alert other tenants that the notices were being served. The women of the area <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the process server and the constabulary, and began throwing stones, mud, and manure at them, succeeding in driving them away to seek refuge in Lough Mask House.|$|E
5|$|William de Ufford's first marriage, to Joan Montagu, {{brought him}} {{significant}} land holdings in Norfolk. With Joan {{he had at}} least five children, none of whom survived him, and his second marriage, to Isabel, was apparently childless. The lands he had acquired through Joan were reunited with the earldom of Norfolk, while his patrimony reverted to the crown. According to the late earl's will, much of the Suffolk lands – though not the title – <b>descended</b> <b>on</b> the Willoughby family, who were connected to the Uffords through marriage. In 1385, the earldom of Suffolk was restored for Michael de la Pole, who received a great portion of Ufford's lands to support his title.|$|E
