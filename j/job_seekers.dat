5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering ecotourism. Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although the manufacturing sector remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E

A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style. E-mail is rapidly replacing traditional letter-writing because of its convenience, speed and spontaneity. It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. <b>Job</b> <b>seekers</b> are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers.

30|$|Beyond this, {{there are}} other factors that play equally {{important}} roles in an individual’s decision on job search strategies. For example, women {{were significantly more likely to}} adopt the informal channel relative to the use of either the formal or joint channel, which implies the great impact of the patriarchal culture on women’s employment in Chinese society. Effects of age and era of job entry reflected the significant changes in individual job search behaviors within the context of China’s transitional economy. With the quadratic term of age as well as other covariates controlled, age had a significant impact on one’s chance of using the formal channel versus the informal channel, since every 1 -year increase in one’s age increased this odds ratio by 14 %. In other words, the older the <b>job</b> <b>seeker</b> was, the more likely it would be for the <b>job</b> <b>seeker</b> to adopt the formal channel, suggesting the influence of the previously dominant state-controlled job assignment system on older generations’ job search behaviors. Furthermore, the later the <b>job</b> <b>seeker</b> entered the current workplace, the less likely it would be for the <b>job</b> <b>seeker</b> to adopt the formal channel compared to using either the informal or the joint channel, suggesting the growing importance of social contacts in job search success in the formation process of a free labor market in China.|$|R

This paper {{is the first to}} assess how individual search effort, job finding and job stability react to this constraint. Standard job search theory predicts that requirements affect each <b>job</b> <b>seeker</b> relative to her unconstrained effort choice. Therefore, the behavioral treatment intensity of interest is the incremental effort necessary to comply with the requirement. Using novel Swiss register data, we measure this intensity as the difference between the individual requirement threshold and the search effort provided just before requirement imposition. Our econometric approach exploits that 9 ̆ 6 conditional on a broad set of choice fixed effects 9 ̆ 6 the match between the <b>job</b> <b>seeker's</b> unconstrained effort choice and the caseworker's requirement setting behavior is arbitrary. Therefore, it provides exogenous variation in the treatment assignment. We find that binding search requirements that exceed the <b>job</b> <b>seeker's</b> unconstrained effort choice, increase job finding in a substantial way. These effects are highly heterogeneous with respect to the <b>job</b> <b>seeker's</b> characteristics. They come at the cost of increased non-compliance and sanction imposition rates. Moreover, binding requirements have striking negative effects on job stability. Finally, we find that non-binding requirements can also affect search outcomes. This suggests that requirements can operate as signals, thereby generating behavioral effects that are not predicted by standard job search theory...|$|R
