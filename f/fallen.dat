40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the relationship between <b>falls</b> efficacy, perception of <b>fall</b> risk and <b>fall</b> prevention behavior in frail elderly. The data was collected from 300 elderly through the questionnaire. 1) the mean score of <b>fall</b> efficacy was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, perception of <b>fall</b> risk was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, and <b>fall</b> prevention behavior was 17. 7 ± 2. 75. 2) <b>Fall</b> efficacy was significantly different according to <b>falls</b> experience(t= 2. 905, p<. 05). Perception of <b>fall</b> risk was significantly different according to <b>falls</b> experience (t= 2. 704, p<. 05) and <b>Fall</b> prevention behavior was significantly different according to <b>falls</b> experience (t= 2. 706, p<. 05). 3) It showed the negative relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy and perception of <b>fall</b> risk. It showed the positive relation between <b>falls</b> efficacy and <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors, and <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors and perception of <b>fall</b> risk. According to this study, it showed relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy, perception of <b>fall</b> risk and <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors.
