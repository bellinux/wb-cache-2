5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision.

The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for hunting, <b>for</b> <b>avoiding</b> threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids {{may be explained by}} the {{difference in}} their habitats. The octopus is demersal (bottom-dwelling) with excellent camouflage capabilities. Bigfin reef squids, on the other hand, are usually in open water with limited hiding places. Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators. The ability to hear is particularly relevant <b>for</b> <b>avoiding</b> mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti (particularly dolphins), who use echolocation to find prey.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sergey Kitaev [4] {{has shown}} that the {{exponential}} generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> the generalized pattern σ-k, where σ is a pattern without dashes and k is one greater than the largest element in σ, is determined by the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> σ. We show that the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> the partially ordered pattern k-σ-k also is determined by the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> σ. Avoidance of k-σ-k is equivalent to simultaneous avoidance of (k + 1) -σ-k and k-σ-(k + 1). Using this we construct a bijection between bicolored set partitions and permutations avoiding the pattern 3 - 12 - 3, and a bijection between Dowling lattices and permutations avoiding the pattern 3 - 121 - 3. 1...|$|R
40|$|Sergey Kitaev {{has shown}} that the {{exponential}} generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> the generalized pattern σ-k, where σ is a pattern without dashes and k is one greater than the biggest element in σ, is determined by the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> σ. We show that this also holds <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> all the generalized patterns σ_ 1 -k_ 1, [...] ., σ_n-k_n, where σ_ 1, [...] ., σ_n are patterns without dashes and k_i is one greater than the biggest element in σ_i. Similarly the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> the partially ordered generalized patterns k_ 1 -σ_ 1 -k_ 1, [...] ., k_n-σ_n-k_n can be determined from the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> the generalized patterns σ_ 1, [...] ., σ_n, where σ_ 1, [...] ., σ_n are patterns without dashes and k_i is one greater than the largest element in σ_i. Using this we construct a bijection between bicolored set partitions and permutations avoiding the partially ordered generalized pattern 3 - 12 - 3 (that is, permutations avoiding both the patterns 3 - 12 - 4 and 4 - 12 - 3). By using this method twice, we find a closed formula for the exponential generating function <b>for</b> permutations <b>avoiding</b> the partially ordered generalized pattern 3 - 121 - 3. Finally, we give a complete classification of when single partially ordered generalized patterns have the same set of avoiders...|$|R
40|$|After {{reviewing}} the Kyoto Protocol rules for carbon sequestration accounting {{and the different}} carbon accounting methods proposed in the literature for forest management, for reforestation and, more recently, <b>for</b> <b>avoided</b> deforestation or degradation, we discuss possible carbon accounting rules for a post-Kyoto world. We then apply {{the results of this}} discussion to micro-applications in an Annex I country (Spain) and in a non-Annex I country (Tunisia), comparing avoided degradation with reforestation alternatives. In both areas we focus on Mediterranean forest, one of the world's hotspots of biodiversity. We calculate CO 2 break-even prices, including in the analysis not only commercial values, but also, where these are relevant, existing subsidies. We also investigate social preferences <b>for</b> <b>avoided</b> degradation and reforestation using stated preference methods. Our results support the convenience of a change in focus for European Union subsidies from reforestation to avoided degradation. ...|$|R
5|$|A radical {{strategy}} <b>for</b> <b>avoiding</b> predators {{which may}} otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E

5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded <b>for</b> <b>avoiding</b> perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E

Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out.

5|$|Eusebius, Lactantius, and Constantine each {{allege that}} Galerius was the prime {{impetus for the}} {{military}} purge, and its prime beneficiary. Diocletian, for all his religious conservatism, still had tendencies towards religious tolerance. Galerius, by contrast, was a devoted and passionate pagan. According to Christian sources, he was consistently the main advocate of such persecution. He was also eager to exploit this position to his own political advantage. As the lowest-ranking emperor, Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents. Until {{the end of the}} Persian war in 299, he had not even had a major palace. Lactantius states that Galerius hungered for a higher position in the imperial hierarchy. Galerius's mother, Romula, was bitterly anti-Christian, for she had been a pagan priestess in Dacia, and loathed the Christians <b>for</b> <b>avoiding</b> her festivals. Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war, Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch, when Diocletian had forced him to walk {{at the front of the}} imperial caravan, rather than inside it. His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance; from 302 on, he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians. Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti-Christian clique of counsellors, these suggestions must have carried great force.|$|E
