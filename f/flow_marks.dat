40|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used manufacturing methods for the production of polymer-based components such as car bumpers and other automotive details. The surface appearance of these products is of great importance since it is directly connected to the perceived quality. Injection-moulded thermoplastics can exhibit a number of surface defects which lower their quality impression. To a large extent, this work deals with characterisation of flow-induced surface defects called tiger stripes or <b>flow</b> <b>marks.</b> They consist in alternating glossy and dull bands which appear on the surface of injection-moulded polymers, especially when long flow lengths are involved. The <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> are approximately perpendicular to the flow direction and they are often opposite in phase on the two sides of the moulded object. The materials typically used for injection moulding of car components, and studied in the present work, are elastomer-modified polypropylene grades containing fillers. Two main theories behind the formation of the <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> are discussed here: a slip-stick phenomenon and a snake-like flow which can initiate an unstable flow front during the filling of the mould. Several techniques were used in order to characterise the banded regions. Stereographic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as gloss evaluation, revealed that the dull regions were rougher and less glossy than the other type of bands. SEM micrographs of the cross section of the stripes indicated differences in the filler distribution between the different bands; the dull bands seemed to contain a lower amount of filler in the proximity of their surface. A course of events leading to this difference is suggested. Rheological studies of the polymer melts suggested that a higher melt elasticity is beneficial since it reduces the propensity for the defects generation. The effect of ageing on the severity of the <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> is discussed in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness and thermal stability. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer is another engineering polymer widely used to produce vehicle interior components as well as domestic appliances, toys, etc. ABS is known to be sensitive towards ageing especially when exposed to UV-light. The effect of ageing on the appearance of injection-moulded ABS samples was studied here, in particular colour changes were evaluated. Natural coloured and grey coloured ABS specimens, containing the same type and the same amount of stabilisers, were exposed to a heat ageing treatment and to artificial weathering. In general, the natural coloured ABS suffered the most severe discolouration and the artificial weathering produced the strongest effect. Interestingly, an imposed surface texture appeared to affect the colour change induced by ageing. Chemical and mechanical changes on the surface layers of the investigated samples were reported...|$|E

However, the proliferation of anonymous communication systems on the Internet has posed significant challenges to providing such traceback capability. In this paper, we develop {{a new class of}} <b>flow</b> <b>marking</b> technique for invisible traceback based on Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), utilizing a Pseudo-Noise (PN) code. By interfering with a sender’s traffic and marginally varying its rate, an investigator can embed a secret spread spectrum signal into the sender’s traffic. The embedded signal is carried along with the traffic from the sender to the receiver, so the investigator can recognize the corresponding communication relationship, tracing the messages despite the use of anonymous networks. The secret PN code makes it difficult for others to detect the presence of such embedded signals, so the traceback, while available to investigators is, effectively invisible. We demonstrate a practical <b>flow</b> <b>marking</b> system which requires no training, and can achieve both high detection and low false positive rates. Using a combination of analytical modeling, simulations, and experiments on Tor (a popular Internet anonymous communication system), we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DSSS-based <b>flow</b> <b>mark...</b>|$|R

Injection molded parts can show several types of surface defect. It is believed that wall slip {{may be associated with}} some types of defect, because wall slip can modify the distributions of velocity, wall shear stress, pressure and heat flux. The work described here involves an experimental study of the occurrence of <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> during injection molding of linear polyethylene, and the possible relationship between these defects and wall slip. It also involves the investigation of the feasibility of incorporating wall slip models in the 2. 5 D computer simulation of the injection molding process...|$|E
40|$|Polymer-based {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in the automotive industry for producing vehicle parts, for instance car bumpers, dash boards etc. A common manufacturing process for such components is injection moulding. Injection-moulded thermoplastics can however exhibit a number of surface defects such as <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> (or tiger stripes), weld lines, air traps and sink marks. All these imperfections lower the perceived quality of the final products. The attention is here focused on the surface defect commonly denoted “flow marks” or “tiger stripes”. Tiger stripes are alternating glossy and dull bands on the polymer surface. They are approximately perpendicular to the flow directions and often opposite in phase. In other words, if {{one side of the}} moulded part shows a dull area, the corresponding region on the opposite side will be glossy. The reasons for the appearance of these stripes are not entirely clear; however a slip-stick phenomenon and/or an unstable flow front during the mould filling are two main hypotheses which might account for their formation. Materials typically used for injection moulding of car components are often based on elastomer-modified polypropylene (PP) containing talc as a filler. The PP-grades in this work here contained between 10 and 15 wt% talc and a very low amount of elastomeric particles. By means of stereographic scanning electron microscopy, it was observed that the surface of the dull bands was rougher than that of the glossy bands. Furthermore, the surface regions of the dull bands contained less filler particles than the corresponding regions of the glossy bands. In order to further understand the relation between the surface topography and the gloss of textured polymeric surfaces, the same SEM technique, combined with a filtering procedure, was used to characterize the surface structure of a number of injection-moulded specimens. The results indicated that small differences in gloss in the low gloss region could be associated with small-scale variations in the surface topography. It is to be expected that the rheological properties of the polymer melts can influence the generation of the <b>flow</b> <b>marks.</b> Hence, the flow properties, mainly in shear, of three different grades of elastomer-modified PP containing mineral fillers were correlated with their propensity for defect generation. It was noted that a higher melt elasticity, as reflected in the pressure losses during flow through a capillary, the degree of die swell and to some extent the dynamic-mechanical behaviour, led to less severe <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> or retarded the formation of such defects. Elongational draw-down experiments also indicated a more stable behaviour {{in the case of the}} melt exhibiting the highest elasticity...|$|E
40|$|Debris flow {{is one of}} the {{shattering}} natural disasters, mostly ensuing in mountainous areas. Rational {{estimation of}} debris flow velocity {{is one of the}} key issues in debris hazard mitigation. Among the various procedures, back-calculation of debris flow velocity is a widely used approach. Back-calculation procedure includes determinations of super-elevation and channel properties, and velocities are calculated using the forced-vortex equation (??=√gRΔ?/kb). A debris mass, when travels through a curved flume, leaves the highest flow mark on the outer bend, and the difference between the flow depths of outer and inner bends is referred to as ‘super-elevation’. However, in a post-flow field investigation, only the highest <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> on both inner and outer bends are visible, which does not portray the actual maximum super-elevation that must have been reached in the unsteady flow event, and eventually leads to a misjudgment of the real velocity. Another important parameter of forced vortex equation is the channel radius of curvature. Any natural channel has hardly been a circle, rather it has varying curvature. How the curve is approximated can affect velocity estimation. Considering the unsteady nature of debris flows, this research work aims to figure out a coherent way of estimating debris flow velocities. Therefore, a series of numerical curved flume tests using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) are carried out to check the aptness of the mud-marks derived velocities. Estimated velocities from <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> underestimate the actual velocities near the source, while they converge on the actual velocities as the distance to source increases. Based on the simulations, a best fit curve is proposed to adjust the mud-marks derived velocities. Law of similarity allows to apply the findings from these small scale simulations to the real debris flow problems. Three debris flow events in Japan are taken for the validation of the proposed procedure and adjusted velocities are proven to be consistent with verbal evidences and previous analyses...|$|E

The prediction of the parameter evolution during material forming requires a fair understanding of the interaction between the material properties and the process.

40|$|Several new {{technologies}} to assist plastic injection moulding companies have been developed in the last twenty years. A number of computer software programs are now available which could revolutionise mould design. The most exciting aspect of the Computer Aided Mould Design (CAMD) software is the effect it has on reducing the lead time required to produce a working mould from a product concept. The application of the new technology for designing moulds, however, has been slow in New Zealand. One {{of the main reasons}} for the slow progress is the perceived value of the software or consulting services. Many injection moulding companies who design and manufacture moulds do not realise the great potential of CAMD software to save many hours of mould changes and volume of polymer material, even when the program is used after the mould has been made. However, the true benefits are only seen when the mould is designed using CAMD before the mould has been manufactured. Moulds manufactured correctly the first time save a great deal of time, energy and money. The value of the software is not completely understood by injection moulding manufacturers. They perceive the immediate benefits, however, the ongoing benefits are not recognised. A project was carried out to demonstrate the potential of CAMD software in determining moulding problems in existing injection moulded products. Four products, two of which were supplied by an injection moulding company, that had moulding problems, were simulated using Moldflow, a CAMD software package. The results of the simulation were compared with the actual moulding problems. It was found that the Moldflow simulation results described the problems occurring in the moulds accurately. Moulding problems included warpage, air traps and weld lines in poor positions and <b>flow</b> <b>marks.</b> Warpage is a major problem in injection moulded products. Even simple products can warp if not designed correctly. The only problems Moldflow did not identify, and does not claim to, were the <b>flow</b> <b>marks</b> caused by jetting and splashing of plastic as it entered the cavity. The designer must be aware of the problems caused by jetting and design gates to avoid it. Moldflow, and other CAMD software, are beneficial tools for the mould designer. The advantages of CAMD include short mould development time, shorter lead times from concept to production, reduction in the amount of material used, fewer changes to machine settings and predictable, repeatable quality. These benefits are not only savings in the mould design and manufacture, they also continue on into the processing of the product since less material is used in the product and machine down time caused by moulding problems is greatly reduced...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the fundamental problem}} of bandwidth allocation among flows in a packet-switched network. The classical max-min rate allocation has been widely regarded as a fair rate allocation policy. But, for a flow with a minimum rate requirement and a peak rate constraint, the classical max-min policy no longer suffices to determine rate allocation since it is not capable of supporting either the minimum rate or the peak rate constraint from a flow. In this paper, we generalize {{the theory of the}} classical max-min rate allocation with the support of both the minimum rate and peak rate constraints for each flow. Additionally, to achieve generalized max-min rate allocation in a fully distributed packet network, we present a distributed algorithm that uses a feedback-based flow control mechanism.

The activity of 458 gully heads was assessed in the field by pre-defined criteria such as sharp edges, presence of a plunge pool, tension cracks, recent deposited sediments, <b>flow</b> <b>marks,</b> and vegetation re-growth. The results showed that land use has {{a significant impact on}} bank gully head activity. Recent land-use changes involving the extension of almond cultivation appears to intensify bank gully head activity. Also, lithology has a clear impact on the bank gully extension. It was further investigated whether the gully heads were important sediment sources that contributed to reservoir sedimentation. The density of (very) active bank gully heads along the study reach was one per 17 m of channel length. Average annual retreat volumes were derived from measurements at 46 active gully heads (4. 0 m(3) y(- 1)). By selecting all the channel sections in the catchment of the Puentes Reservoir with a similar pattern of bank gullies using aerial photographs, an estimate of basin-wide sediment production of bank gully heads was established. It was estimated that the retreat of active bank gully heads alone in the 12, 760 ha study area (representing 12 % of the total catchment area of the Puentes Reservoir) produced 6 % of the sediment filling up the reservoir. Considering that the sediment is also derived from other sources such as channel walls, channel beds, and hillslopes, the overall conclusion is that bank gully expansion in Southeast Spain is a major point source of sediment and therefore, a major process of land degradation.

Mold embedding for this technology is currently done on wafer level up to 12 "/ 300 mm diameter. For higher productivity and therewith lower costs larger mold embedding form factors are forecasted for the near future. Following the wafer level approach then the next step will be a reconfigured wafer size of 450 mm. An alternative option would be leaving the wafer shape and moving to panel sizes leading to Fan-out Panel Level Packaging (FOPLP). Sizes for the panel could range up to 24 "× 18 " or even larger. For reconfigured mold embedding, compression mold processes are used in combination with liquid, granular or sheet compound. As a process alternative also lamination as used e. g. in PCB manufacturing can be taken into account. =Within this paper the evaluation of panel level compression molding with a target form factor of 24 ”* 18 ” / 610 × 457 mm 2 is described. The large panel size equals a typical PCB manufacturing full format and is selected to achieve process compatibility with cost efficient PCB processes. Here not only conventional compression molding is considered but also the new process compression mold lamination is introduced as a tool-less mold alternative. Panel level molding is compared to 8 ” and 12 ” wafer molding as well as to low cost PCB 24 ”× 18 ” lamination focusing on manufacturing challenges, high volume capability and estimated cost. Technological focus of this study will be the evaluation of liquid, granular and sheet molding compound. This includes thorough material analysis regarding the process relevant material properties as reactivity or viscosity.
