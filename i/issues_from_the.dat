5|$|The cusp at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root at the front and two large roots at the back (one labial, one lingual) there is a small additional labial root.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{suffered}} {{its final}} disappointment {{of the season}} on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed to improve on their <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} historians {{to deal with}} the reign of Edward II – William Stubbs, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Conway Davies – added little to the {{understanding}} of Gaveston. While generally agreeing with the chronicles, they allotted him no importance within their own main field of interest, that of constitutional history. For later generations of historians, the focus shifted from constitutional to personal <b>issues.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> 1970s onwards, the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown, and the distribution of patronage. It is to this school of thought that Hamilton's biography belongs, in which he argues that it was Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage that was {{the driving force behind the}} baronial animosity towards him. Chaplais, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II. According to Chaplais, Edward was more or less indifferent to the practice of kingship, and essentially delegated the job to Gaveston. As an alternative to a homosexual relationship, Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood. This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist, platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan, and also existed in the Middle Ages, as exemplified in The Song of Roland, the story of Roland and Olivier.|$|E

25|$|Released after The King of Fighters XII, {{the game}} was {{directed}} by Kei Yamamoto who wanted to bring elements from prior The King of Fighters titles and fix <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prior game. This title significantly modifies the gameplay from its predecessor, removing some modes, and adding ones formerly used in the series. It also expands the character roster, re-grouping the playable characters into three-member teams as in the prior installments. The ports are notable for including more content than the original version such as new characters, stages and game modes.|$|E
25|$|The console {{version is}} based on the 1.1 update of The King of Fighters XIII arcade which fixed several <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} version. It also contains a story mode that influenced by the player's actions with various perspectives being available. The mode is presented in visual novel style alongside fights, something considered to be hard to include in the arcade version by the SNK Playmore staff. Other modes shown are Arcade, Practice and Challenge. The online gameplay {{is based on}} the one included in later versions of The King of Fighters XII, which fixed the issues the initial one had.|$|E

25|$|The {{staff in}} charge wanted to pay {{attention}} to the number of details given to the game's graphics. Regarding the story, they paid attention to its flow, mentioning the final version was not significantly different from the first one. Because the prior game, The King of Fighters XII, suffered from various technical issues, developers also worked in fixing them to improve the gameplay. However, the initial arcade version from the game suffered from four notable bugs which led to special rules forbidding players to use them in at Japan's Tougeki– Super Battle Opera fighting game tournament. An updated version 1.1 was later released for arcades, fixing all the bugs and <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original game.|$|E
25|$|One however {{needs to}} view these <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{context within which}} Pozderac operated. Being part of the {{communist}} system Pozderac saw political ascendance possible only within the system. If one adds to this the patriarchic nature of the Balkans, his strong leadership was proven {{to be the only}} potent power that could make the difference in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the communist era. He was the follower of the conviction that political, legal, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic and other progress is based on the economic progress. He is credited for implementing processes that led the economic revitalization of Bosnia and Herzegovina that contributed to strengthening of the cultural independence and identity of Bosnia within Yugoslav federation.|$|E
25|$|George Ramos of the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that many Cypress Park residents were {{angered by the}} negative portrayal of their community in the media; the perceived {{lack of attention to}} gang <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> municipal government and their council member, Mike Hernandez; and the Los Angeles Times for posting large images of Stephanie Kuhen and her brother {{on the front page of}} the newspaper, stating that the media does not do this with ethnic minority children. Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one is not from Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime in his or her own neighborhood rather than in Cypress Park.|$|E
