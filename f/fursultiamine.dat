It has also been investigated in improving energy metabolism during exercise and reducing exercise-induced fatigue with conflicting results.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fursultiamine</b> (INN; Adventan, Alinamin-F, Benlipoid, Bevitol Lipophil, Judolor, Lipothiamine), {{chemically}} thiamine tetrahydrofurfuryl disulfide (TTFD), is a disulfide {{derivative of}} thiamine, or an allithiamine. It was synthesized in Japan in the 1960s {{for the purpose}} of developing forms of thiamine with improved lipophilicity for treating vitamin B1 deficiency (i.e., beriberi), and was subsequently commercialized not only in Japan but also in Spain, Austria, Germany, and the United States. As a vitamin, it is available over-the-counter as well.|$|E
40|$|Anemia of {{inflammation}} (AI) {{is common}} in patients with infection, autoimmune diseases, cancer, and chronic kidney disease. Unless the underlying condition can be reversed, treatment options are limited to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents with or without intravenous iron therapy, modalities that are not always effective and can cause serious adverse effects. Hepcidin, the iron regulatory hormone, {{has been identified as}} a pathogenic factor in the development of AI. To explore new therapeutic options for AI and other iron-related disorders caused by hepcidin excess, we developed a cell-based screen to identify hepcidin antagonists. Of the 70, 000 small molecules in the library, we identified 14 compounds that antagonized the hepcidin effect on ferroportin. One of these was <b>fursultiamine,</b> a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved thiamine derivative...|$|E
40|$|A 70 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to hospital because ofmultiple injuries from a traffic collision. On day 16 after admission, he started to complain of pain, weakness and numbness in his right leg. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the lumbar spine showed a displaced sacral fracture with compres-sion of the S 1 ventral ramus (Appendix 1, available at www. cmaj. ca /cgi /content /full/cmaj. 091534 /DC 1). The patient’s symptoms persisted despite treatment with diclofenac, chlor-zoxazone, <b>fursultiamine</b> and betamethasone. Severe tingling pain and allodynia (pain with light touch) developed seven days later. Thirty days after admission, several painful grouped erythematous plaques with vesicles were found on his right buttock and the posterior aspect of his right leg (Figure 1). The distribution {{was consistent with the}} S 1 dermatome, and a diagnosis of herpes zoster was made. The patient was prescribed valacyclovir hydrochloride, 500 mg three time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Lipid-soluble {{thiamine}} precursors have a {{much higher}} bioavailability than genuine thiamine and therefore {{are more suitable for}} therapeutic purposes. Benfotiamine (S-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate), an amphiphilic S-acyl thiamine derivative, prevents the progression of diabetic complications, probably by increasing tissue levels of thiamine diphosphate and so enhancing transketolase activity. As the brain is particularly sensitive to thiamine deficiency, we wanted to test whether intracellular thiamine and thiamine phosphate levels are increased in the brain after oral benfotiamine administration. Results Benfotiamine that is practically insoluble in water, organic solvents or oil was solubilized in 200 mM hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and the mice received a single oral administration of 100 mg/kg. Though thiamine levels rapidly increased in blood and liver to reach a maximum after one or two hours, no significant increase was observed in the brain. When mice received a daily oral administration of benfotiamine for 14 days, thiamine derivatives were increased significantly in the liver but not in the brain, compared to control mice. In addition, incubation of cultured neuroblastoma cells with 10 μM benfotiamine did not lead to increased intracellular thiamine levels. Moreover, in thiamine-depleted neuroblastoma cells, intracellular thiamine contents increased more rapidly after addition of thiamine to the culture medium than after addition of benfotiamine for which a lag period was observed. Conclusion Our results show that, though benfotiamine strongly increases thiamine levels in blood and liver, it has no significant effect in the brain. This would explain why beneficial effects of benfotiamine have only been observed in peripheral tissues, while sulbutiamine, a lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivative, that increases thiamine derivatives in the brain as well as in cultured cells, acts as a central nervous system drug. We propose that benfotiamine only penetrates the cells after dephosphorylation by intestinal alkaline phosphatases. It then enters the bloodstream as S-benzoylthiamine that is converted to thiamine in erythrocytes and in the liver. Benfotiamine, an S-acyl derivative practically insoluble in organic solvents, should therefore be differentiated from truly lipid-soluble thiamine disulfide derivatives (allithiamine and the synthetic sulbutiamine and <b>fursultiamine)</b> with a different mechanism of absorption and different pharmacological properties. </p...|$|E
