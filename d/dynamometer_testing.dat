40|$|Abstract: In this paper, some vehicle models {{used for}} <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> bench are put forward to adapt {{different}} performance tests of two-axle vehicle. Firstly, the vehicle driving model with two {{degrees of freedom}} is established by analyzing the force condition of a moving vehicle. And it can be used in performance tests which do not need complex road condition, such as acceleration test. Secondly, considering pitching motion of vehicle, the driving model with three degrees of freedom is proposed and applied to performance tests which need complex road condition, like thermal balance test or road simulation experiment. Finally, in order to do steering performance <b>test</b> in <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> bench, the driving model is modified by considering the influence caused by steering and combines steering model to become a whole steering model of vehicle. Those models mentioned above provide theoretical support in <b>dynamometer</b> <b>test</b> bench researching...|$|R

50|$|There {{has never}} been a {{mechanical}} VVA system that had either the duration range at full lift or the high RPM capability to do anything like this. “Camless” electromagnetic/hydraulic systems do have similar duration/lift ranges to the Helical Camshaft but at present their high RPM ability is strictly limited. On a possibly somewhat more practical level, <b>dynamometer</b> <b>testing</b> of road engines has shown that even with the Helical Camshaft limited to only about 30 degrees increase in duration, a typical road engine can increase its power by 25% to 30% at the same RPM power peak as the standard cam - and the idle and low RPM behaviour are totally normal.|$|E
50|$|A {{company was}} formed in Ottawa in early 1963 called Hyland Electronics {{building}} CD ignitions using the Winterburn design. The discharge capacitor within the CD ignition {{had the ability to}} provide a powerful spark in excess of 4 times the spark power of the Kettering system using the same coil, with the exception that spark energy could be maintained at high rpm unlike the Kettering system. The Hyland unit consumed only four amperes at 5000rpm (8cyl) or 10,000rpm(4cyl). <b>Dynamometer</b> <b>testing</b> during 1963 and 1964 showed a minimum of 5% increase in horsepower with the system, with 10% the norm. One example, a Ford Falcon, had an increase in horsepower of 17%. Spark plug lifespan was increased to at least 50,000 miles and points lifespan was greatly extended from 8,000 miles to at least 60,000 miles. Points lifespan became a factor of rubbing block (cam follower) wear and the life cycle of the spring with some lasting almost 100,000 miles.|$|E
5000|$|However, that {{an engine}} [...] "pulls hard" [...] {{all the way}} to its redline and running the engine to the redline before {{shifting}} does not automatically guarantee maximum performance and efficiency. Tachometer redlines generally indicate the maximum safe operating speed of the engine, rather than their peak efficiency and power production speed. Engine and chassis <b>dynamometer</b> <b>testing</b> nearly always reveals decreasing returns in torque and horsepower as an engine nears its redline, as volumetric efficiency and parasitic loads result in diminishing returns relative to fuel and air consumed. Engine builders and tuners strive for maximum area [...] "under the curve", referring to the horsepower curve resulting from engine testing. Horsepower is the rate at which an engine is performing work rather than a measurement of an engine's actual power output at a given time, which is actually indicated by torque, or the twisting force available at the crankshaft. Torque is what performs the actual work, and high torque output over a large [...] "power band" [...] indicates better engine [...] "balance" [...] and tuning.|$|E
