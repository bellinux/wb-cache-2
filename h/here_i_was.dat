25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E

Acting alongside Heath Ledger (who died before filming had finished), Cole, in an interview for the Daily Telegraph admitted that, at times, she felt out of her depth in the role- saying [...] "I'd only done a couple of films and <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> surrounded by amazing actors like Christopher Plummer and Heath Ledger, and it was intimidating at times," [...] also describing the role as [...] "the biggest role I've ever done".|$|E
500|$|As Travolta did {{not attend}} to collect his trophies, an action figure of Terl, his character, {{accepted}} them in his place. Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
6000|$|After a {{complete}} ablution and assuming the ihram, we performed two prayer-flections, and recited the meritorious sentences {{beginning with the}} words “Labbaik Allah huma labbaik!” “Here <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> O God, <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> O Unassociated One, <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> for unto Thee belong praise, grace, and empire, O Unassociated One!” ...|$|R
5000|$|Muhammad {{then told}} him to {{continue}} with his plans and perform umrah as prescribed in Islamic rites. When he reached the valley of Mecca, he began shouting in a resonant voice: [...] "Here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at Your command O Lord, <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> No partner have You. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Praise, bounty and Dominion belong to You.

500|$|On 8December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's Farthest South {{record of}} 88°23′. As they neared the pole, they looked for any {{break in the}} {{landscape}} that might indicate another expedition had got there ahead of them. While camped on 12 December they were momentarily alarmed by a black object that appeared on the horizon, but this proved to be their own dogs' droppings off in the distance, magnified by mirage. Next day they camped at 89°45′S, [...] from the pole. On the following day, 14December 1911, with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled {{in front of the}} sledges, and at around 3pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole. They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau [...] "King Haakon VII's Plateau". Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement: [...] "Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes. The area around the North Pole—devil take it—had fascinated me since childhood, and now <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the South Pole. Could anything be more crazy?" ...|$|E
500|$|Matters {{came to a}} {{head when}} Ernest {{returned}} for what would prove to be his only visit to England as King of Hanover, in 1843. He was welcomed warmly, everywhere but at the Palace. At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The 50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a [...] "strong push", and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred {{on the grounds that they}} might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, [...] "When I lived <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me." [...] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, [...] "Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs." [...] This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, [...] "No, I shall not, unless the Devil prompts me!" [...] The Queen also recorded that though King Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{preceding}} decades the Ngā Puhi from the Bay of Islands had obtained muskets and made devastating attacks on their southern neighbours. The Mahia peninsula became {{a place of}} refuge for various Māori that felt threatened at an intensification of tribal warfare, decimation, enslavement and migration. Burns wrote: [...] "So <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> amongst a set of cannibals ... not knowing the moment when they might take my trade from me, and not only my trade, but my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Frere-Jones' {{inspiration}} for the typeface came from time spent walking block-by-block through Manhattan with a camera to find source material, and he based the font on the lettering seen in older buildings, especially {{the sign on the}} Eighth Avenue façade of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. [...] "I suppose there's a hidden personal agenda in the design," [...] Frere-Jones said, [...] "to preserve those old pieces of New York that could be wiped out before they're appreciated. Having grown up <b>here,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always fond of the 'old' New York and its lettering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee Wallace, the film's art director, spoke admirably about Carpenter during post. [...] " [...] {{asked if}} I could cut sound effects. The answer, {{of course was}} 'Sure!' Once again, <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> a {{perfectly}} green recruit, yet John made {{a leap of faith}} … he further insisted we get the best processing money could, which at that time was the legendary MGM color labs. Finally, he insisted we get the best postproduction sound money could buy, which was Samuel Goldwin Sound, another legend. The expense for this unorthodox approach ate up a huge amount of the budget. The production manager fumed that we were exploiting people to pay for processing— and it was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Managed by Newt Joseph, {{the team}} also {{included}} Byron [...] "Mex" [...] Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer and <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way I could {{to get the ball}} {{up to the plate and}} get it over, maybe even for a strike. But even that made my arm ache like a tooth was busting every time I threw. And the balls I was throwing never would fool anybody in the Negro leagues, not without a fast ball to go with them." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ramage {{pursed his}} rather loose lips and shrugged his shoulders, {{with his eyes}} fixed {{steadily}} upon her. [...] "Well anyhow--I don't see the force of your objection, you know. That's my advice to you. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Consider you've got resources deposited with me. Perhaps at the first blush--it strikes you as odd.

2500|$|In 1945, Bess Myerson {{became the}} first Jewish-American and the first Miss New York (competing as Miss New York City, a {{competition}} organized by a local radio station) to win the Miss America pageant as Miss America 1945. As the only Jewish contestant, Myerson was encouraged by the pageant directors to change her name to [...] "Bess Meredith" [...] or [...] "Beth Merrick", but she refused. After winning the title (and as a Jewish Miss America), Myerson received few endorsements and later recalled that [...] "I couldn't even stay in certain hotels [...] there would be signs that read no coloreds, no Jews, no dogs. I felt so rejected. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> chosen to represent American womanhood and then America treated me like this." [...] She thus cut short her Miss America tour and instead traveled with the Anti-Defamation League. In this capacity, she spoke against discrimination in a talk entitled, [...] "You Can't Be Beautiful and Hate." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Chris Brown {{winning a}} Grammy for his [...] "F.A.M.E" [...] album, in the {{category}} [...] "Best R Album of the Year", Eric Bellinger, who co-wrote [...] "Say it With Me" [...] for the album, admitted he was like, [...] "Wow, I'm actually doing something <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing something right {{because so many people}} get nominated and that's it; but {{to be a part of}} a project that actually won was the moment I realized I was in the right business." [...] Bellinger also told Billboard Magazine that he stayed with Brown in the studio everyday for about two months. Then, RoccStar and PK played the beat and he immediately thought about Michael Jackson. So they said, [...] "Go in the booth and do some Michael-type stuff." [...] In another interview, Bellinger said, [...] "He [...] really, really went back to the days of Sam Cooke, but we were still able to keep it 2013 at the same time." [...] Bellinger also cited Justin Timberlake as another influence for the song and Brown's upcoming album [...] "X".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Watson flew to Los Angeles {{to record}} his album That's Life. On the flight, {{he told his}} {{producer}} that he was experiencing terrible pressure inside his skull. When they landed, his producer suggested a game of tennis to clear his head. Watson {{could not see the}} ball at all. After a visit to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and an MRI scan, he was advised that he had a developing pituitary adenoma, which was the size of two golf balls. According to Watson, [...] "Since an early age I've had an in-built premonition, a vision that I wouldn't make 40. For the previous seven years I'd have a recurring nightmare in which my head exploded. And <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> with a brain tumour on the eve of my 40th birthday; I thought, 'This is it, I was right, I knew it'." [...] Watson recalled that the tumours were [...] "like a figure of eight, one filling the frontal cavity of my skull, the other forced through into the top of my nose." [...] He stayed in Los Angeles for two days and continued recording his album while tests confirmed whether the tumour was malignant or not – {{it turned out to be}} benign.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, General Hospital {{was close}} to {{cancellation}} owing to low viewership. At that time, they were ranked lowest in the Nielsen ratings. To save the show, ABC executive Jackie Smith hired Gloria Monty as the show's executive producer and Douglas Marland as head writer. Monty wanted to attract a youth-based audience {{as a way of}} garnering higher ratings. To do this, she and Marland brought troubled teenager Laura Vining (Genie Francis) to the forefront of the series. The character went from appearing {{a couple of times a}} week to having fifty pages of script a day. [...] "Gloria put sex and romance into Laura's life," [...] Francis said, [...] "and it bowled me over. <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing things in front of 20 million people that I had never done in my life." [...] Her early stories included killing her older lover, David Hamilton, for cheating on her with her mother and a popular romance with Scott [...] "Scotty" [...] Baldwin. In response, General Hospital's ratings rose as younger viewers began watching for Laura. Teenagers connected with her because she was their age and experienced some of the same problems they did, yet also lived [...] "the life of a 28 year old".|$|E
