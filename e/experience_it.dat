5|$|Band of Gypsys is a live album by Jimi Hendrix and {{the first}} without his {{original}} group, the Jimi Hendrix <b>Experience.</b> <b>It</b> was recorded on January 1, 1970, at the Fillmore East in New York City with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, frequently {{referred to as the}} Band of Gypsys. The album mixes funk and rhythm and blues elements with hard rock and jamming, an approach which later became the basis of funk rock. It contains previously unreleased songs and was the last full-length Hendrix album released before his death.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} July 2006 after work was {{completed}} on Titan Quest, with preparatory work beginning prior to this. Staff members returned while assuming different roles {{to the original}} game: Michael Verrette produced, Michael Sheidow acted as art director, the script was written by Dean O'Donnell, while Arthur Bruno took over as main designer. Scott Morton returned to compose new tracks. The concept was to both expand upon the narrative of Titan Quest and improve the gameplay <b>experience.</b> <b>It</b> also went for a darker aesthetic compared to the original. Announced in November 2006, it released to a positive critical reception and favorable sales.|$|E
5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through <b>experience.</b> <b>It</b> was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the <b>experience.</b> <b>It</b> {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E
5|$|In October 1840, their {{paternal}} grandfather Kamanawa II requested his grandsons {{to visit}} him {{on the night before}} his execution for the murder of his wife Kamokuiki. The next morning the Cookes allowed ʻĪʻī to bring Kaliokalani and his brother Kalākaua to see Kamanawa for the last time. It is not know if their sister was also taken to see him. Later sources, especially in biographies of Kalākaua indicated that the boys witnessed the hanging of their grandfather at the gallows. Historian Helena G.

Without the Gemini <b>experience,</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} not {{intended}} to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human <b>experience,</b> <b>it</b> is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.|$|E
5|$|The program {{originally}} focused {{almost exclusively}} on Scoutcraft skills, some elements of the Patrol Method, and First Class Boy Scout requirements. In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul that emphasized a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem-solving skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping <b>experience.</b> <b>It</b> {{is a key element}} of the overall leadership training program.|$|E
5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated {{for the first time}} experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions, including toxic or allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} vaccination (erythema multiforme), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past <b>experience,</b> <b>it</b> is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military <b>experience.</b> <b>It</b> had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of supply-side and demand-side factors on the compensation of information technology (IT) professionals and considers the human capital and institutional explanations. We focus on returns to an MBA and the IT-related <b>experience</b> of <b>IT</b> professionals and use the largest data set of IT professionals that has been compiled to date in the United States to answer our research questions. We find that firms pay a significant premium for an MBA. Although firms value the <b>IT</b> <b>experience</b> of <b>IT</b> professionals, they value an MBA significantly more. The {{results of this study}} cast doubt on the belief that IT skills have a large firm-specific component. Although <b>IT</b> <b>experience</b> is valued more than non-IT <b>experience</b> for <b>IT</b> professionals, firms value <b>IT</b> <b>experience</b> at other firms much more than they value firm-specific <b>IT</b> <b>experience.</b> Likewise, contrary to popular perception, we do not find evidence for complementarities between an MBA education and <b>IT</b> <b>experience.</b> Among institutional effects, firms in IT and IT-intensive industries pay significantly more to IT professionals than do other firms, and dot-com firms also paid a significant premium in 1999 and 2000. However, these firms do not value an MBA or firm-specific <b>IT</b> <b>experience</b> any more than other firms. We discuss the implications of these findings for further research, for firms' compensation practices, and for individual IT professionals.
