40|$|Background: Nuclear {{protein in}} testis (NUT) midline carcinomas (NMC) are rare, <b>highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{epithelial}} <b>neoplasms,</b> characterised by protein expression of NUT-fusion proteins which reflects the genetic translocation between chromosome 15 and 19. NMC occurs mainly in midline structures, {{but there are}} reports regarding occurrence in structures outside the midline. We investigated specimens from 519 surgically resected lung carcinomas and carcinoid tumours {{for the presence of}} NUT protein using immunohistochemistry. Normal testis and two previously confirmed NMCs served as positive controls. Findings: All 483 evaluable cases (278 adenocarcinomas, 140 squamous cell carcinomas, 30 large cell carcinomas, 7 small cell carcinomas, 10 undifferentiated carcinomas and 18 carcinoids) were completely negative for expression of NUT protein.

40|$|Predicting the {{clinical}} course of osteosarcoma patients {{is a crucial}} prerequisite for a better treatment stratification in these <b>highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>neoplasms</b> of bone. In search of new and reliable biomarkers we recently identified cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP 1) to have significant prognostic impact in gastric cancer and therefore decided to investigate its role also in osteosarcoma. For this purpose we analyzed 223 pretherapeutic and well characterized osteosarcoma samples for their immunohistochemical expression of CRIP 1 and correlated our findings with clinico-pathological parameters including follow?up, systemic spread and response to chemotherapy. Interestingly and contrarily to gastric cancer, we found CRIP 1 expression more frequently in patients with long?term survival (10 -year survival 73 % in positive vs. 54 % in negative cases, p = 0. 0433) and without metastases (p = 0. 0108) indicating a favorable prognostic effect.

40|$|Melanomas are <b>highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>neoplasms</b> {{resistant}} to most conventional therapies. These tumors {{result from the}} interaction of altered intracellular tumor suppressors and oncogenes with the microenvironment in which these changes occur. We previously demonstrated that physiologic skin hypoxia contributes to melanomagenesis in conjunction with Akt activation. Here we show that Notch 1 signaling is elevated in human melanoma samples and cell lines and is required for Akt and hypoxia to transform melanocytes in vitro. Notch 1 facilitated melanoma development in a xenograft model by maintaining cell proliferation and by protecting cells from stress-induced cell death. Hyperactivated PI 3 K/Akt signaling led to upregulation of Notch 1 through NF-κB activity, while the low oxygen content normally found in skin increased mRNA and protein levels of Notch 1 via stabilization of HIF- 1 α. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Notch 1 is a key effector of both Akt and hypoxia in melanoma development and identify the Notch signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in melanoma treatment...|$|R

40|$|Tumors {{require a}} blood supply {{for growth and}} hematogenous dissemination. Much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the role of angiogenesis—the recruitment of new vessels into a tumor from pre-existing vessels. However, angiogenesis may not be the only mechanism by which tumors acquire a microcirculation. <b>Highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> and metastatic melanoma cells are capable of forming highly patterned vascular channels in vitro that are composed of a basement membrane that stains positive with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent in the absence of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. These channels formed in vitro are identical morphologically to PAS-positive channels in histological preparations from <b>highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> primary uveal melanomas, in the vertical growth phase of cutaneous melanomas, and in metastatic uveal and cutaneous melanoma. The generation of microvascular channels by genetically deregulated, aggressive tumor cells was termed “vasculogenic mimicry” to emphasize their de novo generation without participation by endothelial cells and independent of angiogenesis. Techniques designed to identify the tumor microcirculation by the staining of endothelial cells may not be applicable to tumors that express vasculogenic mimicry. Although it is not known if therapeutic strategies targeting endothelial cells will be effective in tumors whose blood supply is formed by tumor cells in the absence of angiogenesis, the biomechanical and molecular events that regulate vasculogenic mimicry provide opportunities for the development of novel forms of tumor-targeted treatments. The unique patterning characteristic of vasculogenic mimicry provides an opportunity to design noninvasive imaging techniques to detect <b>highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>neoplasms</b> and their metastases...|$|R

The present study was carried out on 21 adenomas and 139 mammary car-cinomas. Of the carcinomas, 66 were not reported to have metastasized, while the remaining 73 had evidence of regional lymph node metastasis at the moment of diagnosis. The relationship was examined between the expression of the E-cadherin–b-catenin complex and basal (CK 5 / 6, CK 14) and luminal (CK 8 / 18) cytokeratin expression. In the medical literature, carcinomas expressing basal cytokeratins are reported as having a poor prognosis in human breast cancer. Results revealed that preservation of the expression of E-cadherin and b-catenin is a significant feature of carcinomas without metastasis, whereas carcinomas with metas-tasis reveal the loss of one or both adhesion molecules. Additionally, basal cytokeratin expression was statistically associated with the presence of regional metastasis. Furthermore, the expression of E-cadherin–b-catenin was significantly correlated with the high expression of CK 18 and low expression of CK 5 / 6.

40|$|AbstractProgression {{of cancer}} is often {{associated}} with interactions between cancer cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding them. Increasing evidence has suggested that accumulation of hyaluronan (HA), a major component of ECM, provides a favorable microenvironment for cancer progression.

Several studies have shown efficacy of inhibitors of HA synthesis or signaling for the treatment of PDAC.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Uterinesarcomas {{comprise}} {{three main}} types: carcinosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Carcinosarcomas are <b>highly</b> <b>aggressive</b> <b>neoplasms</b> with a biphasic histology of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. It is now generally accepted that carcinosarcomas are biphasic tumors {{that have to}} be regarded as endometrial carcinomas where metaplasia occurs. Mutations of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, located on 10 q 23, {{play a significant role in}} the pathogenesis of the endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10 q has been reported in uterine leiomyosarcoma. Since little is known about the molecular pathobiology, our goal was to investigate the potential role of the PTEN gene in the carcinogenesis of uterine sarcomas. METHODS: We examined 21 carcinosarcomas, 21 leiomyosarcomas, and 5 endometrial stromal sarcomas using exon-by-exon polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Overall 8. 5 % (4 / 47) of uterine sarcomas were found to harbor somatic PTEN mutations. Of these, approximately 17 % (3 / 18) were carcinosarcomas with endometrioid-type carcinoma components and approximately 5 % (1 / 21) were leiomyosarcomas. No mutations were detected in carcinosarcomas with nonendometrioid carcinoma components (0 / 3) and in endometrial stromal sarcomas (0 / 5). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that intragenic PTEN mutations are involved in the genesis of uterine carcinosarcomas with endometrioid-type carcinoma components but rarely contribute to the pathobiology of uterine leiomyosarcomas. status: publishe...|$|R

The aggressive multimodality treatment is recommended for the management of these tumors. The purpose of our study is to review our experiences in the diagnoses and treatment of PNET of the kidneys. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of all the patients, who were treated for the PNET of the kidneys at our institute between April and March 2011 and compared with the available literature. Results: A total of eight patients were treated for PNET of the kidney. Out of the eight patients, four were males and four females. Nearly 50 % of our patients had inferior vena caval thrombus at the time of presentation. The diagnosis was made on histopathology supported by IHC. Out of the eight patients, one patient had intraoperative death due to massive pulmonary thromboembolism and another died on the 7 th post-operative day due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. Rest six patients were treated with post-operative chemotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. For these six patients, overall median survival was 45 months with a 3 year disease-free survival of 66 % and 5 year survival of 44 %. Conclusions: PNET of the kidneys are rare peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with an aggressive clinical course. These tumors carry a very poor prognosis.
