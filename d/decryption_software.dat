40|$|Abstract — Software {{protection}} is increasingly necessary for uses in commercial systems, digital content distributors, and military systems. The Secure Software (SecSoft) architecture {{is one of}} several architectures attempting to provide hardware enforced software protection. The advantage of the SecSoft architecture is increased software protection without alteration to the fundamental interaction of software, operating systems, and developer tools. This work presents the design, implementation, and performance analysis of a fast, flexible hardware Encryption Management Unit (EMU) for such architectures. The EMU provides selective <b>decryption</b> of <b>software</b> instructions residing in page–sized sections of memory, without modification to the core processor. Results are derived from a FPGA based prototype platform containing different cryptographic routines operating with a standard processor. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper presents, a {{simulator}} {{that aims}} {{the development and}} design of cellular-automata based cryptographic algorithms. This software is necessary mainly in order to choose a (large) set of local rules as possible keys that should be integrated in hardware. The software accepts linear and two-dimensional cellular automata having variable dimensions, limited to 100 / 100 cells (that gives a maximum of 104 bits for two-dimensional encryption algorithms). In addition to the cellular automata simulation, the software completely emulates the algorithms for encryption and <b>decryption.</b> The <b>software</b> is an efficient tool for empirical analysis as well as statistic studies of all stages of the cryptographic schemes. An attractive software facility is the computation of {{the map of the}} basins of attractions, which stands only for small dimension linear cellular automata but can be qualitatively extrapolated for larger systems having the same rule...|$|R

5000|$|Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes {{is one of}} {{the first}} cases that tested the DMCA in dealing with the {{legality}} of unlicensed CSS <b>decryption</b> <b>software.</b> In this case, the movie studios sought for an injunction against the distribution of DeCSS, a program made to allow the copying of DVD content onto the hard drive.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011, German {{researcher}} Karsten Nohl {{revealed that}} it was possible to hack into mobile phone voice and text messages on many networks with free <b>decryption</b> <b>software</b> available on the Internet. He blamed the mobile phone companies for relying on outdated encryption techniques in the 2G system, and said that the problem could be fixed very easily.|$|E
40|$|We {{implement}} an {{encrypted file}} system {{that uses a}} Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to securely store file encryption keys. Key management is centralized. We identified {{the ability of a}} key server to verify deletion of file encryption keys on clients {{to reduce the amount of}} re-encryption necessary on key revocation. We place the TPM on the file-read datapath and encrypt files with RSA. In benchmarking filesystem performance, we found that read and write speeds were orders of magnitude slower than without encryption. <b>Software</b> <b>decryption</b> was about twice as fast as hardware decryption via TPM. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} DVD rippers which {{operate in a}} similar fashion. Unlike CDs, DVDs do contain data {{formatted}} in files for use in computers. However, commercial DVDs are often encrypted (for example, using Content Scramble System/ARccOS Protection), preventing {{access to the files}} without using the ripping <b>software's</b> <b>decryption</b> ability, which may not be legal to distribute or use. DVD files are often larger than is convenient to distribute or copy to CD-R or ordinary (not dual-layer) DVD-R, so DVD ripping software usually offers the ability to re-encode the content, with some quality loss, so that it fits in smaller files.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{purpose of}} DCAS was to {{implement}} DRM protection in software, supported by future OCAP-compliant consumer {{devices such as}} digital televisions, DVRs, and set-top boxes (still required to support legacy non-OCAP-compliant devices). This would secure the information transmitted in {{the link between the}} cable company and the consumer device. Besides <b>decryption,</b> the DCAS <b>software</b> would control how the content is used—whether it must be deleted immediately after viewing, or after a set period of time, which devices it may be transferred to and if transfer or recording is permitted. The scheme could possibly be used more broadly and was being advanced by Rupert Murdoch's company NDS as a DRM method useful also for portable media players and other devices not attached to cable networks. An allegedly working DCAS prototype was created by Samsung and NDS for the cable industry and was demonstrated to the FCC in November 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Many DVD-Video {{titles are}} {{encrypted}} with Content Scramble System (CSS). This is a data encryption and communications authentication method {{designed to prevent}} copying video and audio data directly from the DVD-Video discs. Decryption and authentication keys needed for playing back encrypted VOB files are stored in the normally inaccessible lead-in area of the DVD and are used only by CSS <b>decryption</b> <b>software</b> (e.g., in a DVD player or software player). If someone is trying to copy the contents of an encrypted DVD-Video (e.g., VOB files) to a hard drive, an error can occur, because the DVD was not authenticated in the drive by CSS <b>decryption</b> <b>software.</b> Authentication of the disc allows the copying of individual VOB files without error, but the encryption keys will not be copied. If the copied undecrypted VOB files are opened in a player, they will request the keys from the DVD-ROM drive and will fail. [...] There are many CSS-decrypting programs, or ripping software, such as libdvdcss, DeCSS, DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD or DVD Shrink which allow a protected DVD-Video disc to be played without access to the original key or copied to hard disk unscrambled. In some countries, their usage can {{be a violation of}} law (e.g. for non-personal use).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of reducing the computational load by use of restricted key parameters in the RSA system. We present various methods for generating RSA key parameters that can produce the secret key with much smaller binary weight than the ordinary case. This will greatly {{reduce the number of}} multiplications required for RSA <b>decryption</b> in both <b>software</b> and hardware implementations. Security will be the most critical issue for their practical use. We also present preliminary analysis for every possible attack we could imagine. 1 Introduction Most public key systems widely used in practice, such as RSA [38], Diffie-Hellman [11] and ElGamal [14], are based on the difficulty of factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms. There are subexponential time algorithms to solve these problems. The most notable algorithm is the general number field sieve, which has the best asymptotic running time estimate (see [21] for a collection of related papers). The progress [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Since 2000, {{different}} {{efforts have}} been made in order to crack the A5 encryption algorithms. Both A5/1 and A5/2 algorithms have been broken, and their cryptanalysis has been revealed in the literature. As an example, [...] developed a number of rainbow tables (static values which reduce the time needed to carry out an attack) and have found new sources for known plaintext attacks. He said {{that it is possible to}} build [...] "a full GSM interceptor...from open-source components" [...] but that they had not done so because of legal concerns.

50|$|Back at the apartment, Chuck and Sarah {{welcome the}} Turners. Craig {{tells a story}} about a mission which irritates Laura when he {{mentions}} a Russian double-agent Craig had an affair with, and it is also revealed the Turners have divorced and remarried three times. Chuck and Sarah are then briefed on their assignment set for that night. They are to observe while Craig and Laura infiltrate the mansion of Otto von Vogel (Udo Kier) to recover a decryption key he has developed which can render any government security useless. Vogel is hosting a party that night, which he is using as a front to try and sell the device. The Turners are to access the master suite at Udo's home, where they will retrieve the <b>decryption</b> <b>software</b> and escape. The mission, however, does not go as planned. Craig is a philanderer and Laura is revealed to be an alcoholic, at which point the two get into a heated argument. With the Turners incapacitated and with their covers at risk, Chuck and Sarah step in to complete the mission themselves. They successfully access the master suite, only to confront Vogel's enormous pet tiger, Sasha. Chuck flashes and determines the software key is hidden on her collar. When the tiger falls asleep, Chuck steals the collar, and he and Sarah narrowly escape when Sasha awakens and gives chase. However, as they flee the party, they are intercepted by the Turners, who reveal their behavior during the party was a ruse and steal the software at gunpoint before fleeing.|$|E
50|$|The MPAA's concerted {{efforts at}} {{fighting}} content sharing began in 1975 {{with the establishment}} of the Film Security Office, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films in order to prevent duplication. The MPAA has continued to pursue a number of initiatives to combat illegal distribution of Hollywood films, especially in response to new technologies. In the 1980s, it spoke out against VCRs and the threat that the MPAA believed they represented to the movie industry, with MPAA president Jack Valenti drawing a parallel between the threat of the VCR and that of the Boston Strangler. In 1986, the MPAA asked Congress to pass a law that would require VCRs to come equipped with a chip to prevent them from making copies. Legal efforts at stopping homemade copies of broadcast television largely ended, however, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that such copying constituted fair use. The MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop bootleg production and distribution of videos tapes and laserdiscs into the 1990s, and in 2000 took legal action against individuals posting DVD <b>decryption</b> <b>software</b> on the Internet. Following the release of RealDVD—an application that enabled users to make copies of DVDs—RealNetworks sued the DVD Copy Control Association and the major studios in 2008 over the legality of the software; RealNetworks accused the MPAA of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, but the judgment found there were no grounds for the claim and dismissed the suit. As of 2013, the MPAA has continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online. The MPAA and its British counterpart, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), also funded the training of Lucky and Flo, a pair of Labrador Retrievers, to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.|$|E
