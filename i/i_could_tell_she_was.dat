40|$|I met Margaret Berger in 1974, {{when she}} had just joined the Brooklyn Law School faculty, {{one of the first}} three young women to do so. At that time, I had no {{affiliation}} with the law school, but was lucky enough to meet Margaret, because I was just starting out as a clerk for Judge Jack B. Weinstein, and Margaret was a distin-guished alumnus of his chambers. Margaret understood that I was new to clerking and to Brooklyn, and she reached out to me and helped me with the transition from student to clerk. Immediately, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> special. For one thing, she was warm and friendly and supportive. For another, she was “hooked ” on teach-ing and legal scholarship. Margaret wanted only the best for Brooklyn Law School and she expected the best from herself. She talked about her goal of producing superior scholarship and her ideas for strengthening the School. Although I was barely out of law school, Margaret convinced me to think about becoming a professor at Brooklyn. I think the rest of the faculty were somewhat less sanguine about my candi-dacy at the time⎯after all, I hadn’t even taken the bar exam and was not quite sure what lay in my future. But, years later, Marga-ret, still my friend, urged me once again to consider joining the faculty. I have now had the pleasure of being Margaret’s colleague for twenty-two years. My initial assessment of her talents was cor-rect. She is first-rate. Margaret has been a leader at the law schoo...|$|E

60|$|Was it my own excited imagination--or {{the misty}} {{influence}} of the atmosphere--or the uncertain twilight of the chamber--or the gray draperies which fell around her figure--that caused in it so vacillating and indistinct an outline? <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> spoke no word; and I--not for worlds <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have uttered a syllable. An icy chill ran through my frame; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me; a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul; and sinking back upon the chair, I remained for some time breathless and motionless, with my eyes riveted upon her person.

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Hissink and J.R. Rotem, who has additionally worked with Britney Spears, Rick Ross, Leona Lewis, Jason Derülo, and Iyaz. In an interview with MTV News, Rotem discussed the track, stating that it almost {{did not make the}} cut for Pink Friday and was the last addition to the album after Minaj heard how inspirational it was. He stated, [...] "Near the tail end of her project, I came into the studio and I had some tracks her. That was one of the ones I was excited about. When I played it for her, she knew instantly: 'Yes, this is the record.' She connected with it immediately. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> was excited by it, which excited me." [...] The demo version of the song featured a studio-vocalist that would have later been an uncredited vocalist on the track, however Minaj decided to ask Rihanna to do the track. Rotem reminisced on the moment, stating that he told Minaj [...] "'That would be great, but getting Rihanna to do a hook for you is easier said than done.' I think that speaks to Nicki's star power. I said, 'Yeah, she's definitely first choice. It took time because she was promoting her own album and traveling overseas. It happened, and I heard it when Nicki gave me the record and it really was one of those incredible things that was really a blessing. It manifested. She said she wanted it and it happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{my way to}} {{the hotel}} I passed the end of the square in which Mrs. Catherick lived. Should I go back to the house, and make another attempt to see her. No. That news of Sir Percival's death, which was the last news she ever {{expected}} to hear, must have reached her hours since. All the proceedings at the inquest had been reported in the local paper that morning--there was nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her which <b>she</b> did not know already. My interest in making her speak had slackened. I remembered the furtive hatred in her face when she said, [...] "There is no news of Sir Percival that I don't expect--except the news of his death." [...] I remembered the stealthy interest in her eyes when they settled on me at parting, after she had spoken those words. Some instinct, deep in my heart, which I felt to be a true one, made the prospect of again entering her presence repulsive to me--I turned away from the square, and went straight back to the hotel.|$|R

[...] As they sat in the bath together, Harris strangled her and held her under the water for 3 or 4 minutes. [...] "It could have been her, it could've been anybody. She was just unlucky...I just thought she would be easy, to target, she wouldn't put up a fight or ... she would be relatively easy to kill". Asked how he felt after the murder he said [...] "powerful, angry, just anger, pure anger. Not, not that she, there was no sex or anything, I was angry at the world.

60|$|The little railway {{carriage}} {{in which we}} sat rocked with speed as we flew through the French landscape. I caught glimpses of solid, Norman farm buildings, of towers and keeps and delicate steeples, and quaint towns; of bare poplars swaying before the March gusts, of green fields ablaze in the afternoon sun. I took it all in distractedly. Here was Maude beside me, but a Maude I had difficulty in recognizing, whom I did not understand: who talked of a life she had built up for herself and that seemed to satisfy her; one with which I had nothing to do. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> how <b>she</b> regarded my re-intrusion. As she continued to talk, a feeling that was almost desperation grew upon me. I had things to say to her, things that every moment {{of this sort of}} intercourse was making more difficult. And I felt, if I did not say them now, that perhaps I never should: that now or never was the appropriate time, and to delay would be to drift into an impossible situation wherein the chance of an understanding would be remote.|$|R

We tried personal description of course; and strange to say, the only young lady formerly staying at Aldborough who answered the description was, of {{all the people in the}} world, the lady you have married! If she had not had an uncle and aunt (both of whom have left the place), I should have begun to suspect that you had married your cousin without knowing it! Is this the clew to the mystery? Don't be angry; I must have my little joke, and I can't help writing as carelessly as I talk. The end of it was, our inquiries were all baffled, and I traveled back with Miss Vanstone and her attendant as far as our station here. I think I shall call on the Tyrrels when I am next in London.

I saw him often with his parents at Sunday mass. The grace of God preserved him and made him quite a gentleman in Paris. Perhaps it will touch Rita’s heart, too, some day. But she was awful then. When I wouldn’t listen to her complaints she would say: ‘All right, sister, I would just as soon go clothed in rain and wind.’ And such a bag of bones, too, like the picture of a devil’s imp. Ah, my dear young Monsieur, you don’t know how wicked her heart is. You aren’t bad enough for that yourself. I don’t believe you are evil at all in your innocent little heart. I never heard you jeer at holy things. You are only thoughtless. For instance, I have never seen you make {{the sign of the cross}} in the morning.

60|$|She flushed a little, {{embarrassed by}} the passion in his tone. His letters {{had told me that}} he was very much in love with his wife, and I saw that he could hardly take his eyes off her. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> if <b>she</b> loved him. Poor pantaloon, he was not an object to excite love, but the smile in her eyes was affectionate, and it was {{possible}} that her reserve concealed a very deep feeling. She was not the ravishing creature that his love-sick fancy saw, but she had a grave comeliness. She was rather tall, and her gray dress, simple and quite well-cut, did not hide the fact that her figure was beautiful. It was a figure that might have appealed more to the sculptor than to the costumier. Her hair, brown and abundant, was plainly done, her face was very pale, and her features were good without being distinguished. She had quiet gray eyes. She just missed being beautiful, and in missing it was not even pretty. But when Stroeve spoke of Chardin it was not without reason, and she reminded me curiously of that pleasant housewife in her mob-cap and apron whom the great painter has immortalised. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> imagine her sedately busy among her pots and pans, making a ritual of her household duties, so that they acquired a moral significance; I did not suppose that she was clever or could ever be amusing, but there was something in her grave intentness which excited my interest. Her reserve was not without mystery. I wondered why she had married Dirk Stroeve. Though she was English, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not exactly place her, and it was not obvious from what rank in society she sprang, what had been her upbringing, or how she had lived before her marriage.
