5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Perfume is {{described}} in a musical metaphor as having three sets of notes, making the harmonious scent accord.

These notes are created carefully {{with knowledge of the}} <b>evaporation</b> <b>process</b> of the perfume.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{refractory}} oxides and carbides undergo fragmentation {{during their}} evaporation by the electron beam, {{resulting in a}} stoichiometry {{that is different from}} the initial material. For example, alumina, when evaporated by electron beam, dissociates into aluminum, AlO3 and Al2O. Some refractory carbides like silicon carbide and tungsten carbide decompose upon heating, and the dissociated elements have different volatilities. These compounds can be deposited on the substrate either by reactive evaporation or by co-evaporation. In the reactive <b>evaporation</b> <b>process,</b> the metal is evaporated from the ingot by the electron beam. The vapors are carried by the reactive gas, which is oxygen in case of metal oxides or acetylene in case of metal carbides. When the thermodynamic conditions are met, the vapors react with the gas {{in the vicinity of the}} substrate to form films. Metal carbide films can also be deposited by co-evaporation. In this process, two ingots are used, one for metal and the other for carbon. Each ingot is heated with a different beam energy so that their evaporation rate can be controlled. As the vapors arrive at the surface, they chemically combine under proper thermodynamic conditions to form a metal carbide film.|$|E
25|$|<b>Evaporation</b> <b>processes</b> are {{the most}} {{widespread}} for brine treatment as they enable the highest degree of concentration, as high as solid salt. They also produce the highest purity effluent, even distillate-quality. <b>Evaporation</b> <b>processes</b> are also more tolerant of organics, hydrocarbons, or hardness salts. However, energy consumption is high and corrosion may be an issue as the prime mover is concentrated salt water. As a result, evaporation systems typically employ titanium or duplex stainless steel materials.|$|R

The pressure and volumetric changes that accompany such processes allow substantial work potential to be achieved in cyclic nonsteady devices, such as internal combustion engines and pulsed combustion or detonation engines.

500|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} supplements {{the measurement}} of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based definition of a desert. The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula P − PE ± S, wherein P is precipitation, PE is potential evapotranspiration rates and S is amount of surface storage of water. Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants. Potential evapotranspiration, then, {{is the amount of}} water that could evaporate in any given region. As an example, Tucson, Arizona receives about [...] of rain per year, however about [...] of water could evaporate {{over the course of a}} year. In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain. Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the <b>evaporation</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{hybrid cycle}} {{combines}} {{the features of}} the closed- and open-cycle systems. In a hybrid, warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flash-evaporated, similar to the open-cycle <b>evaporation</b> <b>process.</b> The steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closed-cycle loop {{on the other side of}} an ammonia vaporizer. [...] The vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity. The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water (see heat pipe).|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{microscopic}} calculation of multi-nucleon transfer reactions employing the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. In our previous publication [Phys. Rev.

Here we discuss effects of particle <b>evaporation</b> <b>processes</b> on the production cross sections. Since particle <b>evaporation</b> <b>processes</b> may not be described adequately by the TDHF calculations, we evaluate them using a statistical model. As an input of the statistical model, excitation energies of the final fragments are necessary. We evaluate them from the TDHF wave function after collisions, extending the particle number projection technique. From the calculation, the particle evaporation effects are found to improve descriptions of the production cross sections. However, the production cross sections are still underestimated for processes where a number of protons are transferred. Possible origins of the discrepancy are discussed.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} EVA {{project is}} to {{investigate}} the precision of modeled emission inventories for a city based on experimental data from two field campaigns in March and October 1998 (Slemr et al., J. Atmos. Chem., 2001). According {{to the results of}} the emission inventory model (Kühlwein et al., Atmos. Environ., this issue) for the campaigns, the measured nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) should originate predominantly from <b>evaporation</b> <b>processes.</b> In this paper these model results are discussed from a meteorological point of view. The results from atmospheric dispersion calculations with a Gaussian plume model are compared with measurements of NMHCs and CO at a site few kilometers downwind of the city of Augsburg. The dispersion model results point out that the correlations of the individual NMHCs against CO lead to different qualities of correlation for NMHCs co-emitted with CO (i. e. from combustion processes) and NMHCs which are not co-emitted with CO (i. e. from <b>evaporation</b> <b>processes).</b> However, using the correlation coefficients r 2, as a measure {{of the quality of the}} correlation, the correlations of several NMHCs for which strong evaporation emissions are predicted from the emission inventory model do not show remarkable differences in the r 2 when compared with the correlations for species predominantly emitted from combustion processes. Thus, the NMHC emissions are found to be dominated by emissions from combustion processes and the influence of <b>evaporation</b> <b>processes</b> on anthropogenic NMHC emissions seems to be considerably overestimated by the emission model. This is in agreement with the results of Mannschreck et al. (Atmos. Environ., 2001) which are based on the NMHC composition of the Augsburg city plume...|$|R
