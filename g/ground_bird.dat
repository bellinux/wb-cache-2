5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a <b>ground</b> <b>bird</b> that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
25|$|The {{words are}} {{somewhat}} generic: henqêe {{may be used}} for any spotted cat, hushuee (hushuwee) for any running <b>ground</b> <b>bird.</b> 'Lion' and 'eland' use the same root.

25|$|The common ostrich is a xeric animal, due to {{the fact}} that it lives in {{habitats}} that are both dry and hot. Water is scarce in dry and hot environment, and this poses a challenge to the ostrich's water consumption. Also the ostrich is a <b>ground</b> <b>bird</b> and cannot fly to find water sources, which poses a further challenge. Because of their size, common ostriches cannot easily escape the heat of their environment; however, they dehydrate less than their small bird counterparts because of their small surface area to volume ratio. Hot, arid habitats pose osmotic stress, such as dehydration, which triggers the common ostrich’s homeostatic response to osmoregulate.|$|E

While she waited she looked about, and kept finding something curious or pleasant to interest and amuse her. First she saw a tiny rainbow in a dewdrop that hung on a blade of grass; then she watched a frisky calf come down to drink {{on the other side}} of the brook, and laughed to see him scamper away with his tail in the air. Close by grew a pitcher-plant; and a yellow butterfly sat on the edge, bathing its feet, Daisy said. Presently she discovered a little <b>ground</b> <b>bird</b> sitting on her nest, and peeping anxiously, as if undecided whether to fly away or trust her.|$|E

40|$|To {{separate}} functional from phylogenetic pelvic {{differences in}} Aves, seventy-seven birds were measured and statistically analyzed {{to define the}} characters that unite them into function groups, and to identify the characters that separate the function groups from each other. Four Major Function Groups were identified: Birds of Prey (Chapter II) Waterbirds (Chapter III), <b>Ground</b> <b>birds</b> and Stalker-wader birds (Chapter V). Birds of Prey statistically separate into Air predators and Scavengers. Waterbirds statistically divide into Surface swimmers, Wing-propelled divers, and Foot-propelled divers. A suite of pelvic characters (Level One indicators) can separate nonpasseriformes birds into function groups. These are: length to width ratio of the pelvis, iliac angle, relative iliac surface areas and pre-acetabular ilium proportions. A second suite of characters (Level Two indicators), used by themselves, shows trends, but do not completely separate the function groups. These are proportional length of lower leg components, and femur length: pelvis length ratio. Combining the identified characters in Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis produces a good split among the function groups. When all of the birds are combined into a single analysis (Chapter V), using Level one and Level Two characters, the plots generated have Stalker-wader birds at the center, with three groups radiating out. One arm is <b>Ground</b> <b>Birds,</b> another is Waterbirds, {{and the third is}} Birds of Prey. ^ Pelvic musculature dissections of a representative from each group are compared (Chapter VI). The picture drawn from the muscle data is different. The muscle data suggest that <b>Ground</b> <b>Birds</b> are the central group. <b>Ground</b> <b>Birds</b> (represented by a pigeon) have leg/pelvic muscles neither specialized for specific femoral movements, nor for specific tibiotarsal movements. No particular group of muscles is hypertrophied, and no major groups are reduced or missing. The other three function groups of birds show some degree of specialization, either by reducing or accentuating muscles, or by losing muscles completely. The result is a statistical portrait of four bird function groups that has implications for the sequence of morphological changes seen in avian radiations of the Tertiary. ...|$|R
