5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different <b>electron</b> <b>charge</b> densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1908, while a {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, Millikan worked on an oil-drop experiment in which he measured the charge on a single electron. J. J. Thomson had already discovered the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron. However, the actual charge and mass values were unknown. Therefore, if one of these two values were to be discovered, the other could easily be calculated.

40|$|This {{is another}} {{approach}} to realize Maxwell's "demon" hypothesis. Two Ag-O-Cs thermal electron ejectors, A and B, are settled {{in a vacuum}} tube.

50|$|Within {{gasoline}} and diesel, the government requires sulfur levels {{to be reduced}} from 300 - 500 ppm to 30 ppm and 15 ppm respectively. For fuel cell applications sulfur must be under 1 ppm to avoid poisoning the fuel cell. Cu(I) Y zeolite catalyst is typically used to reduce the sulfur in both situations. The hydrodesulfurization technique can remove thiols and sulfides, but cannot efficiently remove thiophenes, therefore the catalyst is used because it selectively adsorbs the sulfur compounds at ambient temperature and pressure. They selectively bind to the thiophenic compounds by pi complexation. The pi complexation involves the donation of <b>electron</b> <b>charges</b> from the thiophene pi-orbital to the vacant s orbital of the copper. At the same time, the d-orbitals of the metals donate <b>electron</b> <b>charges</b> to the anti-bonding pi-orbital. This donation to the s orbital of copper is important in adsorbing thiophene. The downfall of using the Cu(I) Y zeolite catalyst for desulfurization is that moisture exhibits strong inhibiting effects on the adsorption process because the water molecule is preferred over sulfur.|$|R
