50|$|In {{the area}} where Ruthweiler now lies, people had already settled in prehistoric times. Bearing witness to this is an archaeological ﬁnd: “stump-butted axe with whetted edge, porphyry, length 20 cm. At the {{discovery}} site, a ﬁne ash layer and two non-local agate or basalt stones were discovered. It could {{be a matter of}} a settlement ﬁnd.” This stone axe was long held to be the oldest prehistoric archaeological ﬁnd in the Kusel district, being {{from the middle of the}} New Stone Age. Author Bantelmann, who wrote the above quotation, wrongly states that the discovery site lay within the town of Kusel, but the axe was actually found in a loam pit on the east slope of the Heibelberg in {{the area where}} the Westpfalzklinikum II was later built. The incorrect <b>information</b> <b>stems</b> from a mistake made by local historians from Kusel who deposited the axe in the Town and Local History Museum. Had this mistake not been made, the axe’s ofﬁcial discovery site would have been in Ruthweiler, and thus on the other side of what was at the time a Regierungsbezirk boundary, which in turn would have required the artefact to be kept at a museum in Trier. Furthermore, archaeological ﬁnds in neighbouring municipalities show that people in the area in prehistoric times did not merely stay temporarily. In Gallo-Roman times especially, the area was relatively heavily settled, bearing witness to which are ﬁnds from the surrounding area (Giant Horseman of Diedelkopf, several villae rusticae within Thallichtenberg’s limits, the Mithraic monument in Reichweiler).|$|E

This approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. But calculating the mutual information of images needs a large amount of computation, which in some respect restricts its application. In this paper, by doing some processing on the reference image before the registration, we changed the way of calculating the mutual information to reduce the computation. The result of the experiments shows that the accuracy of registration does not change significantly, whereas the time of calculating the mutual information is decreased significantly...|$|E

The demand for information is derived from the demand for involvement, with persons who declare they want to take an active part in the medical treatment choice, showing greater demand for the clinical information about the optional treatments.

Our results suggest that not only does aggregate earnings news convey information about future labor market aggregates, but its information content is incremental to other macroeconomic variables at near-term horizons. Further, the source of this <b>information</b> <b>stems</b> primarily from two earnings components: aggregate core earnings and special items. Core earnings news signals persistent changes in economy-wide profitability that anticipate aggregate job creation and destruction up to four quarters ahead, while special items contain news only about job destruction at horizons of up to two quarters.

40|$|This {{article is}} one of the first to empirically explore the {{relationship}} between health anxiety and online health information search. Two studies investigate how health anxiety influences the use of the Internet for health information and how health anxious individuals respond to online health information. An exploratory survey study with 104 Dutch participants indicates that health anxiety is related to an increase in online health information search. Moreover, results suggest that health anxious individuals experience more negative consequences from online health information search. Findings from an experimental study (n= 120) indicate that online health information results in greater worries among health anxious individuals compared to nonhealth anxious individuals only if the <b>information</b> <b>stems</b> from a trustworthy governmental Web site. Information from a less trustworthy online forum does not lead to greater worries among health anxious individuals.

40|$|This paper {{defends the}} claim that, {{in order to}} have a concept of time, {{subjects}} must have memories of particular events they once witnessed. Some patients with severe amnesia arguably still have a concept of time. Two possible explanations of their grasp of this concept are discussed.

It is argued that a satisfactory explanation of what it is for subjects to have a concept of time must make reference to their having episodic memories such as those mentioned under (2). It is also shown how the question as to whether subjects have such memories, and thus whether they possess a concept of time, enters into our explanation of their actions. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite the ever-growing {{improvements}} on graphics processing {{units and}} computational power, classifying 3 D volume data remains a challenge. In this paper, {{we present a}} new method for classifying volume data based on the ambient occlusion of voxels. This <b>information</b> <b>stems</b> from the observation that most volumes of a certain type, e. g., CT, MRI or flow simulation, contain occlusion patterns that reveal the spatial structure of their materials or features. Furthermore, these patterns appear to emerge consistently for different data sets of the same type. We call this collection of patterns the occlusion spectrum of a dataset. We show that using this occlusion spectrum leads to better two-dimensional transfer functions that can help classify complex data sets {{in terms of the}} spatial relationships among features. In general, the ambient occlusion of a voxel can be interpreted as a weighted average of the intensities in a spherical neighborhood around the voxel. Different weighting schemes determine the ability to separate structures of interest in the occlusion spectrum. We present a general methodology for finding such a weighting. We show results of our approach in 3 D imaging for different applications, including brain and breast tumor detection and the visualization of turbulent flow...|$|E

Our approach relies on a complex preparation phase, which improves the reliability of presence, absence and environmental data correlated to the species habitat. We compare our distribution with those produced by state-of-the-art approaches (MaxEnt and AquaMaps), and use an expert-drawn map as reference. We demonstrate that our model projection is in agreement with the expert 2 ̆ 7 s map and is also compliant with several biological assessments of the species habitat and with recent observations. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be generalized as a paradigm that is applicable to other rare species...|$|E
