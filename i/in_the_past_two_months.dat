500|$|The episode's off-island storyline {{seemingly}} depicts Jin {{rushing to}} the hospital while Sun, who {{has become one of}} the [...] "Oceanic Six", goes into labor. Jin's journey to the hospital is marred by several unfortunate incidents, including difficulty in purchasing a stuffed panda and his cell phone being broken. Sun gives birth to a girl, who she names [...] "Ji Yeon", the name chosen by Jin. The final off-island scenes establish that Jin and Sun's stories are separate; Jin's story is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> into his marriage to Sun. He was {{rushing to the}} birth of a Chinese ambassador's grandchild to deliver the panda as a gift on behalf of his employer, Sun's father. In the final flashforward, Sun and her daughter are visited by Hurley (Jorge Garcia), who takes her to pay her respects to Jin. His tombstone indicates that he died on the day of the crash of Oceanic 815.|$|E
