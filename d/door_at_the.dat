5|$|The {{rear of the}} house, {{the south}} front, has the same overall design as the north front with the {{exception}} of a large central bay at ground and first-floor level. The first floor of the bay has three windows; the ground floor has two windows with a glazed door in the middle. This door is of similar design to the front <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> north of the house, and has four steps of Portland stone accompanied by balustrades also of Portland stone.|$|E
5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with fluorescent lamps after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E
5|$|Air Hong Kong was {{the launch}} {{customer}} for the Airbus A300-600F General Freighter, {{which is a}} new variant of the Airbus A300-600F. This new variant has a cargo loading system capable of handling virtually every type of container and pallet, and a side <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the lower deck capable of handling large items of general freight. The airline took its first delivery of this new aircraft in September 2004, with the eighth and final aircraft delivered on 22 June 2006. The new freighters were powered by two General Electric (GE) CF6-80C2 engines and signed a 14-year Maintenance Cost Per Hour (MCPH) programme with GE on 25 January 2005.|$|E

5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp asking for help to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) of the Ellwood House, the {{circular}} limestone water tower is about 50 feet (15.2 m) tall {{and has a}} diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are arched and include keystones in their design. The water tower was built in 1879, {{the same year as}} Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a conical roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. The arched <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the water tower was replaced with a larger square-shaped double door. The roof remained conical and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with sheet metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the cell in the center along the east wall, the door was replaced with a modern <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of nomination. Inside, a winding staircase leads to the attic. To the north is the kitchen, retaining a hewn summer beam and flared cased posts while sporting modern cabinets and wallpaper. The room to the south also has a visible hewn summer beam and its original casing on the flared posts. The attic is finished with vertically placed beaded boarding, and the roof is framed with hewn rafters.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot. Two small windows {{light the}} staircase to the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry with very large boulder quoins; {{the roof is}} made from slate with stone copings. The {{main part of the}} church is 45feet 6inches long by 15feet 3inches wide (13.87 by 4.65m); the annexe at the west end {{measures}} 20feet 6inches by 15feet 6inches (6.25 by 4.72m). At the west end of the roof of the nave, there is a bellcote with a single bell decorated with three bull heads, dated 1661; at the east end, there is a cross. There is no structural division between the nave and the chancel. The annexe at the west end is smaller and lower in height than the main building, and was built in line with it. It may have been built for use as a schoolroom. It has a 16th-century doorway at the west end, converted into a window in the 19th century, and a modern <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> east end, as well as an 18th-century fireplace. The main entrance into the church is {{on the north side of}} the nave, dating from the late 15th century. The doorway is pointed, in a square frame.|$|E

5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

25|$|The 13th-century south aisle {{contains}} the church square-paneled and plank south door, that is recessed {{to the same}} style as the chancel south door. A further small plank <b>door</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> south aisle north-east wall is within a pointed doorway with a continuous moulded surround, an entrance to a previous rood loft, defined externally by the south aisle turret. To {{the east of the}} door are twin aumbries. In the south wall is a 14th-century piscina with cusped head, set within an ogee headed recess. The north aisle, also 13th-century, contains within {{the north side of the}} chancel arch pier a further piscina with a seven-cusped arch surround with spandrels within a rectilinear frame, this sitting on a projecting ledge, with above, an entablature containing three floriate carvings; running on the entablature are crenellations. In the north wall is a further aumbry with wooden <b>door.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> west end of the north aisle sits the church organ.|$|E
