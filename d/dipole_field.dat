5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the <b>dipole</b> <b>field</b> (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a <b>dipole</b> <b>field.</b> The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its <b>dipole</b> <b>field</b> have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} field of a rotating body of conductive gas or liquid develops self-amplifying electric currents, {{and thus a}} self-generated {{magnetic field}}, due {{to a combination of}} differential rotation (different angular velocity of different parts of body), Coriolis forces and induction. The distribution of currents can be quite complicated, with numerous open and closed loops, and thus the magnetic field of these currents in their immediate vicinity is also quite twisted. At large distances, however, the magnetic fields of currents flowing in opposite directions cancel out and only a net <b>dipole</b> <b>field</b> survives, slowly diminishing with distance. Because the major currents flow in the direction of conductive mass motion (equatorial currents), the major component of the generated magnetic field is the <b>dipole</b> <b>field</b> of the equatorial current loop, thus producing magnetic poles near the geographic poles of a rotating body.|$|E

40|$|A general {{technique}} for expanding an unknown potential field {{in terms of}} a linear summation of weighted <b>dipole</b> or quadrupole <b>fields</b> is described. Computational methods were developed for the iterative addition of <b>dipole</b> <b>fields.</b> Various solution potentials were compared inside the boundary with a more precise calculation of the potential to derive optimal schemes for locating the singularities of the <b>dipole</b> <b>fields.</b> Then, the problem of determining solutions to Laplace's equation on an unbounded domain as constrained by pertinent electron trajectory data was considered...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work a general frame for the {{scattering}} theory of local, relativistic <b>dipole</b> quantum <b>fields</b> is presented and some models of interacting <b>dipole</b> <b>fields</b> are considered, i. e. local, relativistic quantum fields with indefinite metric which asymptotically do not converge to free fields, but to free <b>dipole</b> <b>fields.</b> Also, we give explicit formulae for the (nontrivial) scattering matrix of dipole in- and out- fields for these models. Furthermore we show how related dipole {{degrees of freedom}} occur in the perturbation theory of certain two dimensional models, e. g. massive sine-Gordon or sinh-Gordon models.

25|$|An {{external}} {{electromagnetic field}} at a frequency {{associated with a}} transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a <b>dipole</b> <b>field),</b> it enters a transition state which does have a <b>dipole</b> <b>field,</b> and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron's entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this {{is the process of}} stimulated emission.|$|E
25|$|George Ellery Hale first linked {{magnetic}} fields and sunspots in 1908. Hale {{suggested that the}} sunspot cycle period is 22years, covering two periods of increased and decreased sunspot numbers, accompanied by polar reversals of the solar magnetic <b>dipole</b> <b>field.</b> Horace W. Babcock later proposed a qualitative model for {{the dynamics of the}} solar outer layers. The Babcock Model explains that {{magnetic fields}} cause the behavior described by Spörer's law, as well as other effects, which are twisted by the Sun's rotation.|$|E
25|$|The blade {{geometry}} {{was highly}} {{variable in the}} tests, so {{it is likely that}} the negative dependence of the dimensionless force on Reynolds number is the major factor. This whistle has two features that separate it from the other whistles described here. The first is that there are a multiplicity of these dipole sources arrayed around the periphery, that most likely are radiating at the same frequency, but incoherently. The second is that blade motion creates a steady, but rotating, pressure field at each blade. The rotating steady force creates a rotating <b>dipole</b> <b>field</b> which has an influence in the geometric near field. The feedback is Class I (hydrodynamic) and there is no indication that stages other than Stage 1 occur.|$|E

50|$|Far {{away from}} a magnet, its {{magnetic}} field is almost always described (to a good approximation) by a <b>dipole</b> <b>field</b> characterized by its total magnetic dipole moment, m. This is true regardless of {{the shape of the}} magnet, so long as the magnetic moment is non-zero.

40|$|In {{the aquatic}} environment, living organisms emit weak <b>dipole</b> {{electric}} <b>fields,</b> which {{spread in the}} surrounding water. Elasmobranchs detect these <b>dipole</b> electric <b>fields</b> with their highly sensitive electroreceptors, the ampullae of Lorenzini. Freshwater sawfish, Pristis microdon, and two species of shovelnose rays, Glaucostegus typus and Aptychotrema rostrata were tested for their reactions towards weak artificial electric <b>dipole</b> <b>fields.</b> The comparison of sawfishes and shovelnose rays sheds light on the evolution and function of the elongated rostrum (‘saw’) of sawfish, as both groups evolved from a shovelnose ray-like ancestor. Electric stimuli were presented both on the substrate (to mimic benthic prey) and suspended {{in the water column}} (to mimic free-swimming prey). Analysis of around 480 behavioural sequences shows that all three species are highly sensitive towards weak electric <b>dipole</b> <b>fields,</b> and initiate behavioural responses at median field strengths between 5. 15 and 79. 6 nVcm 21. The response behaviours used by sawfish and shovelnose rays depended on the location of the dipoles.

40|$|By {{performing}} 2. 5 -dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate supercritical accretion onto a non-rotating, magnetized neutron star, {{where the}} magnetic <b>field</b> strength of <b>dipole</b> <b>fields</b> is 10 ^ 10 G on the star surface. We found the supercritical accretion flow {{consists of two}} parts; the accretion columns and the truncated accretion disk. The supercritical accretion disk, which appears far from the neutron star, is truncated at around ∼ 3 R_* (R_*= 10 ^ 6 cm is the neutron star radius), where the magnetic pressure via the <b>dipole</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> balances with the radiation pressure of the disks. The angular momentum of the disk around the truncation radius is effectively transported inward through magnetic torque by <b>dipole</b> <b>fields,</b> inducing the spin up of a neutron star. The evaluated spin up rate, ∼ - 10 ^- 11 s s^- 1, {{is consistent with the}} recent observations of the ultra luminous X-ray pulsars. Within the truncation radius, the gas falls onto neutron star along <b>dipole</b> <b>fields,</b> which results in a formation of accretion columns onto north and south hemispheres. The net accretion rate and the luminosity of the column are ∼ 66 L_ Edd/c^ 2 and ≲ 10 L_ Edd, where L_ Edd is the Eddington luminosity and c is the light speed. Our simulations support a hypothesis whereby the ultra luminous X-ray pulsars are powered by the supercritical accretion onto the magnetized neutron stars.
