40|$|Abstract Background Community {{learning}} and e-mentoring, learning methods used in higher education, {{are not used}} to any extent in residency education. Yet both have the potential to enhance resident {{learning and}}, in the case of community learning, introduce residents to basic lifelong learning skills. We set out to determine whether residents participating in an Internet based e-mentoring program would, with appropriate facilitation, form a community of learners (CoL) and hold regular community meetings. We also determined resident and faculty perceptions of CoL and <b>Internet</b> <b>sessions</b> as effective learning experiences. Methods A six-month e-mentoring pilot was offered to 10 Radiology residents in the Aga Khan University Postgraduate Medical Education Program in Nairobi, Kenya (AKUHN) with a Professor of Radiology, located at University of Virginia, USA, acting as the e-mentor. Monthly <b>Internet</b> case-based teaching <b>sessions</b> were facilitated by the e-mentor. In addition, residents were coached by a community facilitator to form CoL and collectively work through clinical cases at weekly face-to-face CoL sessions. Event logs described observed resident activity at CoL sessions; exit survey and interviews were used to elicit perceptions of CoL and <b>Internet</b> <b>sessions</b> as effective learning experiences. Results Resident adoption of CoL behaviors was observed, including self-regulation, peer mentoring and collaborative problem solving. Analysis revealed high resident enthusiasm and value for CoL. Surveys and interviews indicated high levels of acceptance of Internet learning experiences, although there was room for improvement in audio-visual transmission technologies. Faculty indicated there was a need for a larger multi-specialty study. Conclusions The pilot demonstrated resident acceptance of community building and collaborative learning as valued learning experiences, addressing one barrier to its formal adoption in residency education curricula. It also highlighted the potential of e-mentoring as a means of expanding faculty and teaching materials in residency programs in developing countries. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} optical tachyonic {{dispersion}} corresponding to superluminal (faster than-light) group velocities characterizes parametrically amplifying media. The turn-on of parametric amplification in finite media, followed by illumination by spectrally narrow probe wavepackets, can {{give rise to}} transient tachyonic wavepackets. In the stable (sub-threshold) operating regime of an optical phase conjugator {{it is possible to}} transmit probe pulses with a superluminally advanced peak, whereas conjugate reflection is always subluminal. In the unstable (above-threshold) regime, superluminal response occurs both in reflection and in transmission, at times preceding the onset of exponential growth due to the instability. Remarkably, the quantum information transmitted by probe or conjugate pulses, albeit causal, is confined to times corresponding to superluminal velocities. These phenomena are explicitly analyzed for four-wave mixing, stimulated Raman scattering and parametric downconversion.

40|$|Abstract Voice Over IP (VoIP) is a {{technology}} that could pass the voice traffic and data packet form over an IP network. Network {{can be used for}} intranet or Internet. Phone calls using VoIP has advantages in terms of cheaper cost of PSTN phone to more than half, because the cost is calculated by the cost of the global nature of the <b>Internet.</b> <b>Session</b> Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol at the application layer that serves to establish, modify, and terminate a multimedia session involving one or more users. This SIP signaling has SIP message in text form that is used for session management by the SIP components, such as User Agent, Registrar, Redirect Server, and Proxy Server. Building a SIP communication requires SIP Express Router (SER) to be able to receive SIP messages, for handling the basic functions of SIP messages. Problems occur when the NAT through which the voice communication affected, blocked, starting from the sound that is not sent or one side of the sound are sent (half duplex). The method {{that could be used to}} penetrate NAT is to use a given mediaproxy random RTP port to penetrate NAT. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{telepresence}} and telemanipulation systems, multimodal data is exchanged over {{a network}} allowing humans to experience and {{to operate in}} remote or inaccessible environments. To operate over the global Internet and connect to multiple telepresence systems, a flexible framework for initiating, handling and terminating Internet-based telerobotic sessions becomes necessary. In this work, we explore the use of standard <b>Internet</b> <b>session</b> and transport protocols {{in the context of}} telerobotic applications. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used to handle multimedia teleconference sessions with audio, video or text, and provides many services advantageous for establishing connections between heterogeneous haptic interfaces and telerobotic systems. We apply the session paradigm to the creation and negotiation of haptic telepresence sessions and propose to extend this framework to work with the haptic modality. The notion of a “haptic codec ” is introduced for transforming haptic data into a common format, applying data reduction or compression techniques and implementing teleoperation control architectures. The use of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) is explored for transport of teleoperation data. Finally, a prototype and demonstrator system is presented for evaluation of the proposed framework.

40|$|Wireless Internet {{technology}} {{will be the next}} milestone for modern telecommunication technology. In order to provide Internet connectivity over a wide area it is necessary to utilize the advanced features of modern cellular systems known as 3 G wireless Cellular such as UMTS and their future evolution. One problem towards such utilization is the current technological shortcomings of cellular systems that limit the data rate. One way to bypass this limitation is to use Wireless LAN in cooperation with cellular network such as GPRS/UMTS networks, an increasing number of wireless telecommunication providers are now offering both voice and data services to their users. These services and the emerging multimedia services demand higher data rates to achieve a better quality of service (QOS). So the high tier wireless systems such as UMTS provide users high mobility but less bandwidth. On the other hand wireless systems such as wireless LAN offer higher bandwidth with less mobility. To support seamless roaming between heterogeneous wireless networks {{is one of the key}} issues in the future mobile communication systems. So the 3 G will dominate the future wireless Internet access, UMTS and hotspot wireless LAN.

40|$|Abstract: As {{discussed}} in the literature [PrMü 01; Rub 04; Phi 02] e-voting faces a lot of threats. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to give a systematically ordered overview of attacks against e-voting and to show one solution to the issues. The challenge is to provide identification and anonymity at the same time and to exclude the possibility of fraudulent manipulations by the server administration, the voter, and any third party. 1 Protocol Issues 1. 1 Two-Stage Versus One-Stage Voting Protocols In a fundamental contribution, Nurmi et al. [NSS 91] identified two building blocks in an electronic voting system: (i) Voter identification and registration for e-voting and (ii) vote casting. These steps can be provided in one <b>Internet</b> <b>session</b> (one-step protocol); but here the identification may be used to trace the identity of the vote via the IP address or temporary files. This issue is avoided by a two-stage procedure, which strictly separates voter identification and vote-casting. But the advantage comes at a price, as the result of successful identification (voting token) has to be stored at the voter to be used later to cast a vote. Figures 1 a and 1 b provide an overview of the two stages. Registration phase: The voter applies for a voting token. The system performs a check of his credentials and a check for multiple application. If this is his first attempt, the voter will receive a voting token which he can use anonymously to cast a vote later. If not, the system performs a restart procedure, which always issues the same token to the applicant, which is stored in the database of the regis-tration service. At the end of the process, the voter checks the authenticity and integrity of the token and stores it either on a smart card or on another media, e. g. a USB token...|$|E
