5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E
5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E

The nearest tube stations are Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line near the street's southern end and Marble Arch on the Central line near its northern end. At Brook Gate, partway along the road, there is a traffic signal controlled pedestrian and cycle crossing connecting Hyde Park to London Cycle Route 39 the recommended cycling route from the park to the West End.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
