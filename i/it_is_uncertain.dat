5|$|Increasing sea {{temperatures}} in tropical regions (~1 degree C) {{the last century}} have caused major coral bleaching, death, and therefore shrinking coral populations since although {{they are able to}} adapt and acclimate, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> if this evolutionary process will happen quickly enough to prevent major reduction of their numbers.|$|E

5|$|An {{archaeological site}} on the Trinity River at Cox Bar, with spear points dating from 3000–6000 BC, {{has some of the}} oldest {{evidence}} of human habitation in Northern California. This site is believed {{to be part of the}} early Borax Lake Pattern culture. Archaeological evidence in the Whiskeytown area also indicates human presence as early as 5000 BC, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> at what point the ancestors of modern Native American tribes arrived here.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{forms of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA)especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays {{a central role in}} the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known autoimmune disease.|$|E

5|$|In Rome, two Epitaph {{inscriptions}} {{have been}} found bearing {{the name of an}} Artavasdes. The Epitaphs are probably of the son and the grandson of a Median Atropatenian King called Ariobarzanes. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain,</b> if the Ariobarzanes refers to Ariobarzanes I or his grandson Ariobarzanes II. Artavasdes I is mentioned in paragraphs 27 and 33 of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> {{exactly why}} Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong {{defensive}} site, it was {{some distance from the}} local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> how Oryzomys peninsulae {{arrived at}} its recent locale in Baja California Sur. In 1922, Nelson {{suggested}} {{that it may have}} been introduced from another part of Mexico in a shipment of farm products, but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from other western Mexican Oryzomys that the species exhibits.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> {{how often}} William {{actually}} stayed {{at his new}} castle.

5|$|Pterodroma petrel remains dated {{at between}} 60,000 and 25,000 years BP {{were found in}} two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more {{abundant}} form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> whether they represent {{the site of a}} former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it is simply an extension of natural variation in climate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard, Eric was killed at Trsat (Tarsatch), a {{town on the}} coast of Liburnia by the treachery of the inhabitants. Due to a lack of primary materials, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> who killed Duke Eric. Most of historians point at Croats, while some point at Byzantines. Einhard also notes the death of Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year. Croatian historian Nenad Labus refers to this event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs. Historian Pierre Riché believes that Dalmatian Croats (Guduscani) killed Eric in collusion with Avars.|$|E

5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>uncertain</b> what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E
