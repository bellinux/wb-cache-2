50|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{can be used}} as an <b>incendiary</b> <b>agent.</b> It burns at {{a temperature}} of 2,800 °C (5,000 °F). White phosphorus was used in the No 76 Special Incendiary Grenade by the British Home Guard during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The M202A1 {{features}} four tubes {{that can}} load 66 mm incendiary rockets. The M74 rockets {{are equipped with}} M235 warheads, containing approximately 1.34 pounds (0.61 kg) of an <b>incendiary</b> <b>agent.</b> The substance, often mistaken for napalm, is in fact TPA (thickened pyrophoric agent).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel glycine-nitrate process (GNP) -reduction {{method has}} been {{developed}} to fabricate ultrafine tungsten heavy alloy powders, with ammonium metatungstate (AMT), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO 3) 3 · 9 H 2 O), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O) as raw materials and gylcine as a complexant and <b>incendiary</b> <b>agent.</b> Precursor powders were obtained by self-propagation reaction in a suspension containing above materials. The precursor powders were then hydrogen-reduced to obtain composite powders with 90 W- 7 Ni- 3 Fe composition (wt. %). Phase constitution and morphology of the precursor powders and the reduced powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Chemical composition of resultant powders was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis. It was shown that the GNP-reduction method produces ultrafine 90 W- 7 Ni- 3 Fe powders with particle size of about 200 nm and highly dispersion of the composition...|$|E

5000|$|In September 1942 the United States {{standardized}} a Molotov cocktail-style {{device that}} was nominally {{designated as a}} [...] "grenade". It consisted of a pint-sized clear glass bottle with a crimped metal cap. It was dubbed [...] "frangible" [...] because {{it was made of}} glass, which is brittle and easily broken. The most common types of fillers for the M1 were not surprisingly a number of <b>incendiary</b> <b>agents.</b> The various fillers changed as the chemical technology improved, and created a number of more standardized Molotov cocktails.|$|R
5000|$|Within the U.S. Army, {{there appears}} to be {{conflicting}} advice on the use of white phosphorus against humans. According to the field manual on the Rule of Land Warfare, [...] "The use of weapons which employ fire, such as tracer ammunition, flamethrowers, napalm and other <b>incendiary</b> <b>agents,</b> against targets requiring their use is not violative of international law." [...] However, the 1999 ST 100-3 Battle Book, a student text published by the U.S. Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, states that [...] "It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets." [...] At the same time, other field manuals discuss the use of white phosphorus against personnel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cubic {{pyrochlore}} type NdxCo 2 -xZr 2 O 7 nano-crystals {{were prepared}} by salt-assistant glycine solution combustion method (SGCM), with neodymium nitrate, cobalt nitrate and zirconium nitrate as raw materials, glycine as the <b>incendiary</b> <b>agent,</b> and KCl {{as a reaction}} inert salt. The NdxCo 2 -xZr 2 O 7 nano-crystals were characterized by means of XRD (X-ray powder diffraction), FT-IR (Fourier trans-form-infrared spectroscopy), Raman spectroscopy, TEM (Transmission electron microscope) and HRTEM (High resolution transmission electron microscopy). The results showed that neodymium ions were partially substituted by cobalt ions, while maintaining the original pyrochlore structure. The nano particles obtained had a perfect crystal structure, good dispersion, and the size was about 31 nm. For Nd 1. 9 Co 0. 1 Zr 2 O 7 nanocrystals, the four strong diffraction peaks were at 2 θ= 29. 18 °, 33. 80 °, 48. 49 ° and 57. 53 °. The corresponding crystal plane distances calculated by Bragg equation λ= 2 dSinθ were 0. 306, 0. 265, 0. 188 and 0. 160 nm. Study the catalyst effect of NdxCo 2 -xZr 2 O 7 on the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) using DSC (Differential scanning calorimetry). The results showed that nano NdxCo 2 -xZr 2 O 7 had high catalytic activity during on the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate. With 2 % more nano NdxCo 2 -xZr 2 O 7, the peak temperature of AP thermal decomposition reaction dropped by nearly 88 °C. The apparent decomposition reaction heat increased from 655 J·g- 1 to 1073 J·...|$|E
5000|$|The United States used {{herbicides}} in Southeast Asia {{during the}} Vietnam War. Success with Project AGILE field tests with herbicides in South Vietnam in 1961 and inspiration by the British use of herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s {{led to the}} formal herbicidal program Trail Dust (1961-1971). Operation Ranch Hand, a U.S. Air Force program to use C-123K aircraft to spray herbicides over large areas {{was one of many}} programs under Operation Trail Dust. The aircrews charged with spraying the defoliant used a sardonic motto-"Only you can prevent forests"-a shortening of the U.S. Forest Services famous warning to the general public [...] "Only you can prevent forest fires". The United States and its allies officially claims that herbicidal and <b>incendiary</b> <b>agents</b> like napalm fall outside the definition of [...] "chemical weapons" [...] and that Britain set the precedent by using them during the Malayan Emergency.|$|R

50|$|To {{people who}} are close to a blast incident, such as bomb {{disposal}} technicians, soldiers wearing body armor, deminers or individuals wearing little to no protection, there are four types of blast effects on the human body: overpressure (shock), fragmentation, impact and heat. Overpressure refers to the sudden and drastic rise in ambient pressure that can damage the internal organs, possibly leading to permanent damage or death. Fragmentation includes the shrapnel described above but can also include sand, debris and vegetation from the area surrounding the blast source. This is very common in anti-personnel mine blasts. The projection of materials poses a potentially lethal threat caused by cuts in soft tissues, as well as infections, and injuries to the internal organs. When the overpressure wave impacts the body it can induce violent levels of blast-induced acceleration. Resulting injuries may range from minor to unsurvivable. Immediately following this initial acceleration, deceleration injuries can occur when a person impacts directly against a rigid surface or obstacle after being {{set in motion by}} the force of the blast. Finally, injury and fatality can result from the explosive fireball as well as <b>incendiary</b> <b>agents</b> projected onto the body. Personal protective equipment, such as a bomb suit or demining ensemble, as well as helmets, visors and foot protection, can dramatically reduce the four effects, depending upon the charge, proximity and other variables.|$|R

50|$|The {{eastern half}} Carroll Island {{was used as}} a testing {{location}} for open air static testing of chemical weapons since the 1950s. During tests of chemical agents and other compounds at Carroll Island, Maryland, from July 1, 1964, to December 31, 1971, nearly 6.5 ST of chemicals were disseminated on the test area including 4600 lb off irritants, 655 lb of anticholinesterase compounds such as the nerve gasses Sarin and VX, and 263 lb of incapacitants such as LSD. Simulant <b>agents,</b> <b>incendiaries,</b> decontaminating compounds, signaling and screening smokes, mustard, and herbicides were also released as well as riot control gasses. The test sites consisted of spray grids, a wind tunnel, test grids, and small buildings.|$|R
