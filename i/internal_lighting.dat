Two small ram air turbines attached to the main gondola on swinging arms supplemented electrical power for the radio room, <b>internal</b> <b>lighting,</b> the galley, and acted as a reserve. Batteries stored the electrical energy so that radio operation was independent of airspeed. The gondola also had a gasoline generator for emergency power.|$|E

500|$|For the crew's space suits, Scott was {{inspired}} to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, [...] "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [...] Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet." [...] The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, <b>internal</b> <b>lighting,</b> an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.|$|E

2500|$|A key {{disadvantage}} of relying solely on <b>internal</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is the number}} of lights required to achieve true 360 degree visibility, with most lights usually concentrated front and rear. [...] This can limit the application of vehicles for instances such as scene protection.|$|E

50|$|Simple {{types of}} LCDs {{such as in}} pocket calculators are built without an <b>internal</b> <b>light</b> source, {{requiring}} external light sources to convey the display image to the user. Most LCD screens, however, are built with an <b>internal</b> <b>light</b> source. Such screens consist of several layers. The backlight is usually the first layer from the back. Light valves then vary the amount of light reaching the eye, by blocking its passage in some way. Most use a fixed polarizing filter and a switching one, to block the undesired light.|$|R

2500|$|The {{tower is}} {{noted for its}} efforts towards {{efficient}} energy use. For instance, the building's air conditioning plant utilises variable-speed fans to consume less energy when extra cooling is unnecessary, and the floors are divided into several air conditioning zones. <b>Internal</b> <b>lighting</b> dims when natural ambient light is brighter, and the heat load of the building is reduced {{through the use of}} [...] "low emissivity" [...] glass on the building's facade. The building also implements water-saving measures through the installation in early 2008 of waterless urinals, saving an estimated [...] of water each year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} was designed {{in line with}} sustainable principles and has several distinctive architectural features. [...] "Carefully wrought but nonetheless striking", the library is formed of a [...] "slightly austere translucent glass box" [...] with an angled brise soleil and tiled side walls. [...] The [...] "lofty, noble" [...] interior [...] is open-plan, broken up only by white-painted splayed concrete columns. [...] The interior is lit by a two-storey louvre which forms the transition between the glazed façade and the interior. [...] The extensive use of solar and wind power, natural air circulation, rainwater harvesting and <b>internal</b> <b>lighting</b> which automatically adjusts to the light conditions make it [...] "one of the most energy efficient public buildings in the country".|$|E
50|$|Although reputedly {{patterned}} on {{the form}} of English village churches, {{the expression of the}} timber work and the simplified Gothic motifs give St Augustine's a delicate lightweight vernacular charm; there is a special quality of the <b>internal</b> <b>light</b> through the eaves and translucent windows.|$|R

2500|$|The {{library is}} a good example of a 21st-century {{building}} designed in line with sustainable principles: Brighton & Hove City Council describes it as [...] "one of the most energy efficient public buildings in the country", and the Building Research Establishment gave its sustainable features an [...] "excellent" [...] grade in 2002 during the construction phase. Solar and wind energy are used to heat and cool the building naturally, except during extremes of temperature. [...] Air is taken in from outside, circulates through the building through spaces in the walls and under the heat-absorbing floor, and is pushed out through roof vents. The architects planned three revolving funnels to let the air out and [...] "dramatise" [...] the roofline, but this feature was dropped before construction. Rainwater is harvested from the roof, collected in a [...] tank and used in the toilets. <b>Internal</b> <b>lighting</b> automatically adjusts to the conditions. [...] The library emits half as much carbon dioxide as buildings of comparable size.|$|E
