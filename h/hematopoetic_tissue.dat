These rapidly increase in size until they occlude small vessels, most numerous in the gills. Although this method for clearing foreign particles from circulation is effective, it causes a significant decline {{in number of}} circulating hemocytes. The goal of my study is to learn where the hemocyte-forming tissue is located, what hemocyte stem cells look like and what are early stages in hemocyte maturation. The {{first step is to}} determine location and morphology of the <b>hematopoetic</b> <b>tissue</b> using light and scanning electron microscopy. I found it as nodules in a thin tissue between the foregut and epithelium near the dorsal surface of the head. To stimulate mitosis in hematopoietic tissue, hemocytes were removed from circulation by injecting the ridgeback shrimp, Sicyonia ingentis, with 0. 1 mL of 106 bacteria, Bacillus subtilis. Hemocyte counts (cells/mL) were determined for all shrimp at the start of each experiment. Then every other day for two weeks, two shrimp were selected for a second hemocyte count and removal of hematopoietic tissue. Sections through the tissue should allow us to determine the mitotic index (#dividing cells/#cells), which should peak before circulating hemocyte levels return to pre-injection levels. Eventually, dividing cells in this tissue will be labeled with a marker that inserts into the DNA and is retained when released into circulation. We plan to use this method to determine the lifespan of circulating hemocytes...|$|E
40|$|Hematopoiesis is {{a complex}} {{cellular}} differentiation process resulting {{in the formation of}} all blood cell types. In this process, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside {{at the top of the}} hematopoiesis hierarchy and have the capacity to differentiate into all blood cell lineages (multipotency) as well as maintaining themselves (self-renewal) during the lifespan of an individual. Mouse primitive HSCs are first found in the blood islands of the extra-embryonic yolk sac at day 7. 5 of gestation. At day 10. 5 of gestation the earliest HSCs can be detected in the dorsal aorta region of aorta gonad mesonephros (AGM). The first HSC precursors cluster in the aortic endothelium and it has been shown that these definitive HSCs originate from specialized heamogenic endothelial cells (ECs) of the mouse embryonic aorta. Recently, it has been reported that similar to the AGM at day 10. 5 - 11. 5, ECs of mouse embryonic head also have hemogenic capacity and give rise to HSCs [5]. HSCs then migrate from these initial sources into the fetal liver around day 11, where they undergo dramatic expansion during fetal development. At next stage, around day 12 to 16, HSCs are mobilized from the fetal liver into the bone marrow and spleen; although the fetal liver remains an important organ of definitive hematopoiesis during the embryonic period. From birth and throughout adult life, the bone marrow becomes the major <b>hematopoetic</b> <b>tissue...</b>|$|E
40|$|Rising {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} concentration is causing global warming, which affects oceans by elevating water temperature and reducing pH. Crustaceans {{have been considered}} tolerant to ocean acidification because of their retained capacity to calcify during subnormal pH. However, we report here that significant immune suppression of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, occurs after a 4 -month exposure to ocean acidification (OA) at a level predicted for the year 2100 (hypercapnic seawater with a pH lowered by 0. 4 units). Experiments carried out at different temperatures (5, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 °C) demonstrated that the temperature within this range alone did not affect lobster immune responses. In the OA-treatment, hemocyte numbers were reduced by almost 50 % and the phagocytic capacity of the remaining hemocytes was inhibited by 60 %. The reduction in hemocyte numbers was not due to increased apoptosis in <b>hematopoetic</b> <b>tissue.</b> Cellular responses to stress were investigated through evaluating advanced glycation end products (AGE) and lipid oxidation in lobster hepatopancreata, and OA-treatment was shown to significantly increase AGEs', indicating stress-induced protein alterations. Furthermore, the extracellular pH of lobster hemolymph was reduced by approximately 0. 2 units in the OA-treatment group, indicating either limited pH compensation or buffering capacity. The negative effects of OA-treatment on the nephropidae immune response and tissue homeostasis were more pronounced at higher temperatures (12 – 18 °C versus 5 °C), which may potentially affect disease severity and spread. Our results signify that ocean acidification may have adverse effects on the physiology of lobsters, which previously had been overlooked in studies of basic parameters such as lobster growth or calcification...|$|E

40|$|Immune {{responses}} are regulated by an intricate balance between cytokine production {{and actions of}} various immune cell types. Cytokines are key regulators {{of the immune system}} and represent molecular messengers that provide extrinsic cues that direct the genesis of an immune response and its ultimate down-regulation. Here, I aim to characterize two cytokines that play distinct roles in the development of humoral immune responses. First, I describe a novel B cell cytokine, Interleukin 40 (IL- 40) that is expressed in <b>hematopoetic</b> <b>tissues</b> (fetal liver and bone marrow) and by a lymphocyte population not regularly associated with cytokine secretion (activated B cells). Interestingly, the IL- 40 gene is only present in mammalian genomes, indicating that it may participate in a mammalian-specific immune function. One such mammalian specific function which is also immune related is the process of lactation. The mammary gland undergoes extensive remodeling upon the onset of lactation. Milk ducts become defined to transport milk and the immune microenvironment undergoes significant changes that lead to the production of IgA. Importantly, IL- 40 is up-regulated immediate after lactation. An IL- 40 deficient mouse (Il- 40 -/- mouse), exhibits an altered B cell phenotype, reduced serum and mucosal IgA, and a blunted response to HI-VACV (heat-inactivated vaccinia virus). I next focus on CCL 28, a mucosal chemotactic cytokine. CCL 28 is responsible for the recruitment of IgA secreting cells to mucosal sites via its receptor CCR 10. Additionally, CCL 28 is a potent antimicrobial peptide that can inhibit gram positive/gram negative bacteria, and C. albicans. Here, I functionally characterize the first mouse with a targeted deletion of the Ccl 28 gene, (Ccl 28 -/- mouse). The Ccl 28 -/- mouse exhibits altered levels of IgA in mucosal secretions, and high susceptibility to salmonella infection. Overall, I have functionally characterized two distinct cytokine knock-out mouse models, IL- 40 and CCL 28. I predict that through my doctoral work I have laid the foundation for {{a better understanding of the}} role that these two cytokines play in the fields of B cell biology, cytokine discovery, mucosal immunology and the pathogenesis of mucosal infections...|$|R

40|$|We {{have taken}} {{observations}} on 28 cases of Panmyelopathia, {{all of which}} belonged to inpatients of our dept., statistically and clinically; results were as follows:- There were found no definite co-relations either iu age, sex. or by occupation; except 1 case of chronic X-Ray injury; for conscious symptoms, facial paleness was found almost inevitably, while fever, general languor, and palpitation were discovered to succeed it; as for the bleeding, in main it was wont {{to appear in the}} form of gingival bleeding, epistaxis, or ecchymosis; for symptoms that were discovered by others, red-cell sedimentation rate was found to be stimulated, in total cases, and such as lengthened bleeding time, anemic cardiac murmurs, together with changes in the eye ground, was recognizable in most cases. Among the blood figure. number of red cells was seen to be about a million or so in majority of cases; while, figures below 1 million was considered to point at serious prognosis. As to hemoglobin content, in most cases, it occupied 20 % or so; in respect to hemoglobin index, most of them indicated a hyperchrom, over the entire process, or in partial process. In most cases, the numher of leucocytes proved to be short of 4000, which was also supposed to keep much co-relation with the prognosis. In view to differentiation of lencocytes, a decrease of grauulocytes, an increase of lymphocytes appeared, and in general, in deceased cases, lymphocytosis was clearly observed. Number of blood platelet were apt to decrease to a certain extent. Number of reticulocytes was seen to be small in majority of cases, but it would seem unreasonable to refer to it for the state of prognosis. Heinz' body proved, in serious cases, a value pretty nigh to 1, 000 ‰, showing a great difference with that, belonging to another sort of anemic diseases, as well as people in healthy condition. No special phase was foundin the myelogramm; in respective disease, various apperances of hematopoetic functions observed. The disease could generally be divided into following 5 types. I. Type of bloodcell-arrest. II. Type of maturation-arrest III. Type of disturbanced regeneration. IV. Mixed type. V. Panmyelophthisis. By dint of Tissue Culture of bone marrow. it has been supposed that there existed certain factor that inhibited growth of parenchyma of bone marrow directly; moreover, the functions of bone marrow have suffered a marked hindrance; Having examined respiration and glycolysis in bone marrow, it was discovered that with type of blodcell-arrest, it has proved normal; with other typs, proved considerablly low value. Its sideroblastogram proved slightly to shift to the right. Generally in most cases, gastric juice showed certain hypoacidity. Among the circulatory system, no unique quality discovered, while the rise in serum iron value was seen, owing to extreme decrease of hematopoetic function. Amongst urine and cerebrospinal fluid, some anemia-causing substance has been detected. As for sugar metabolism, rate for normal and abnormal stood almost the same; while as for the basal metabolism, there was discovered some abnormality. The function test of autonomic nervous system, also showed much abnormality. As to histological view, a high degree atrophy was discovered in <b>hematopoetic</b> <b>tissue,</b> with a marked bleeding tendency...|$|E
40|$|Thymosin, {{originally}} discovered as a {{thymic hormone}} regulating maturation of T cells, {{is found in}} many <b>hematopoetic</b> and non-hematopoetic <b>tissues</b> including bone marrow, spleen, and lungs. While studying chicken monocyte- and granulocyte- associated peptides by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization / Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, we found a peptide corresponding to mass/charge ratio (m/z) of 4963. This peptide was prominently associated with monocytes {{but not with the}} granulocyte population. Experiments revealed presence of this peptide in chicken macrophage cell lines. We purified the 4963 Da peptide from the macrophages by reverse phase HPLC and identified it as thymosin β 4 (Tβ 4) by peptide mass fingerprinting. Tβ 4 binds to G- actin, and regulates its polymerization, which is essential for cell motility. Besides, it is also involved in a multitude of other functions regulating immunity and wound healing. This review surveys the physiological significance of Tβ 4 in relation to macrophage function...|$|R
