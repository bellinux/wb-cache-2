60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and {{the girl}} came in gasping, with horror in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Slowly the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{and a man}} {{entered the}} room. Barney breathed a deep sigh of relief--it was Joseph.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{with the}} same {{promptness}} as before. A villainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|As the Sultan spoke, the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{and there}} entered an aged Turk, in a flowing gown and {{coloured}} turban, with a melancholy yellow face, {{and a long}} white beard that swept to his girdle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Mr. Parr, as the <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and {{he led the}} {{way into}} the house, [...] "I'm sorry I can't give you a more cheerful welcome, but my son and daughter, for their own reasons, see fit to live elsewhere." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bertram Kneyght greeted {{his cousin}} {{and her friend}} with genuine heartiness, and readily {{accepted}} their invitation to explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their elbow. The plate-glass <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and the trio plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and loiterers.|$|R
60|$|The key {{was turned}} noiselessly in the lock; {{he raised the}} latch, and the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> with never a creak.|$|E
60|$|A {{noise in}} the other room startled them both. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and a tall, elderly, dark complexioned man, {{recently}} shaven, hurried into the room.|$|E
6000|$|He {{walked up}} and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening, {{starting}} at every trifling sound. Presently the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and a silken page said-- ...|$|E
50|$|On June 27, 1993, as the Sausages {{approached}} Milwaukee County Stadium on {{the scoreboard}} video, the left field <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and—much {{to the surprise}} of players and fans—out came the larger-than-life mascots. The three made their way to home plate with The Bratwurst (worn by Dillon) winning the first-ever live race.|$|R
5000|$|Virginia Woolf made {{reference}} to the British Museum Reading Room in a passage from her 1929 essay, A Room of One's Own. She wrote, [...] "The swing <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and there one stood under the vast dome, as if one were a thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly encircled by a band of famous names." ...|$|R
60|$|He thrust it {{into the}} lock and turned it; the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> {{smoothly}} <b>open.</b> The policeman laid his hand upon Tavernake's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come right in." [...] The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> [...] "We {{have already}} {{finished}} eating, but {{the fire is}} burning and I can get something up for you." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> Two shadowy figures, shapeless in fur {{coats and}} caps, {{appeared}} in the opening, {{and one of them}} turned sharply when Gallwey slammed the door behind him.|$|E
60|$|He made no answer. The girl's {{words had}} thrilled him. Then the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and Jimmy appeared, very pink and white, very immaculate, and looking rather more {{helpless}} than usual.|$|E
60|$|While he was {{wondering}} what it meant, the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> suddenly <b>open.</b> A man filled up the entrance, a big man in a tan uniform, blocking the way ominously.|$|R
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> quickly <b>open</b> and {{he stood}} there in the {{streaming}} sunlight of the morning--so tall he was he seemed to fill the doorway--and he smiled and extended his hands.|$|R
60|$|As Thorne was {{forcibly}} {{driven away}} from the <b>door,</b> it <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and a man sprang out on to the veranda with another close behind, while confused cries went up.|$|R
60|$|And {{as their}} heads touched the wood, {{from the other}} side came a rousing thump that jarred them. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{revealing}} Ernestine with a padded gong-stick in either hand.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b> It {{was dark}} outside, but Agravaine could {{distinguish}} a female form, and, beyond, a shapeless mass {{which he took}} correctly to be {{the remains of the}} two plug-uglies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here come {{two of them}} now," [...] said Roger, in a low voice, as {{the tavern}} <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and two young men appeared, each wearing a linen duster and a touring cap.|$|E
60|$|The {{driver had}} hardly ceased {{speaking}} before the <b>doors</b> were <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and Ninety-four was drawn {{out with a}} rush and a clatter that sounded like sweetest music in Seth's ears.|$|R
60|$|The <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{and through}} them came a {{procession}} clad in black, {{followed by the}} Shaman Simbri, who walked {{in front of a}} bier, upon which lay the body of the Khan, carried by eight priests. Behind it was Atene, draped in a black veil from head to foot, and after her marched another company of priests. In front of the altar the bier was set down and the priests fell back, leaving Atene and her uncle standing alone before the corpse.|$|R
60|$|Saxon {{started to}} take off her hat, but {{suddenly}} {{sat down on the}} bed. She sobbed softly, with considered repression, but the weak-latched <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> noiselessly <b>open,</b> and she was startled by her sister-in-law's voice.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the last bolt was withdrawn, and the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> {{revealing}} several files of soldiers with muskets, and bayonets fixed, in the passage. This sight decided {{the question of a}} rush! ...|$|E
60|$|Oak's hand {{skimmed the}} surface of the door with fingers {{extended}} to an Elymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap, which he pulled. This lifted a wooden latch, and the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{go in for}} {{squaring}} up {{with old}} Haskers," [...] he said, rather loudly. [...] "He's about as mean----" [...] And then he stopped short, as the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and the second assistant appeared.|$|E
60|$|Hardly had the {{reflection}} {{crossed my mind}} when a noise outside startled me. I had just time enough to thrust the paper into my pocket when the <b>door</b> was <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and the tramp appeared.|$|R
60|$|Instantly <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> {{at the end}} of that grey hall, {{and through}} them with {{noiseless}} steps, with shadowy wings, floated a being that bore in its arms a child. Before her it stayed, and the light of its starry head illumined the face of the child. She knew it at once--it was that baby brother whose bones lay by the shore of the African sea. It awoke from its sleep, it opened its eyes, it stretched out its arms and smiled at her. Then it was gone.|$|R
60|$|While {{the boys}} were talking the tavern <b>door</b> had <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> again, and now two other persons stepped forth. They, too, wore linen dusters and touring caps, and one carried a basket {{containing}} something to eat and to drink.|$|R
60|$|Then the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, {{ran into}} the room. He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides, and his words died on his lips. Virginia did not stir.|$|E
6000|$|The slave {{girl looked}} at her in surprise. [...] "It cannot be that you do not know!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, they are--" [...] but she got no further. The <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and an officer stood before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I'll {{take them}} myself. No one will rob me." [...] And then the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open</b> and, chuckling {{in his usual}} {{whimsical}} fashion, Uncle John came out, wearing his salt-and-pepper suit and stuffing; a bundle of papers into his inside pocket.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then there}} was a knock upon the <b>door,</b> which <b>swung</b> <b>open,</b> and a cluster of shadowy figures, with their breath {{floating}} like steam about them, appeared outside it. One of them flung a deerhide bag into the room.|$|R
60|$|On this day, then, he went {{directly}} to the door and spent hours examining it and fussing with the hinges, the knob and the latch. Finally he stumbled upon the right combination, and the <b>door</b> <b>swung</b> creakingly <b>open</b> before his astonished eyes.|$|R
5000|$|When General Knowledge {{spoke in}} the pre-show and was {{explaining}} that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of Albert Einstein, as {{the example of a}} person who used his brain and Ernest P. Worrell (a popular fictional character played by Jim Varney, who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), {{as an example of the}} opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, [...] "Where do you think you are, Disney World?! Get your strollers in line and hustle!", pointing towards the theater as the automatic <b>doors</b> <b>swung</b> <b>open.</b>|$|R
