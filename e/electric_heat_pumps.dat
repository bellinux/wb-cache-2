In air conditioning systems, overall equipment efficiencies have increased as energy codes and consumer information have begun to emphasise year-round performance rather than just efficiency ratings at maximum output. Controllers that automatically vary the speeds of fans, pumps, and compressors have radically improved part-load performance of those devices. For space or water heating, <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> consume roughly half the energy required by electric resistance heaters. Natural gas heating efficiencies have improved through use of condensing furnaces and boilers, in which the water vapor in the flue gas is cooled to liquid form before it is discharged, allowing the heat of condensation to be used. In buildings where high levels of outside air are required, heat exchangers can capture heat from the exhaust air to preheat incoming supply air.|$|E

This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} energetic and environmental performances of six heating systems installed in a low energy house: a gas-fired condensing boiler, a wood pellet boiler, a micro-combined heat and power (MCHP), an air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> an air-to-water gas absorption <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> and an exhaust air-to-air <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump.</b> The comparison is made with respect to the annual primary energy consumption and the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and carried out under various climates and electricity generation mixes. The results indicate that, based on an ideal sizing, the MCHP and the absorption <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> achieve the highest energy performances. However, both technologies suffer from small size unavailability, leading to significant oversizing which impacts their performances. Based on current size availability, the air-to-water <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> benefits from the previous systems oversizing and thus appears as the most efficient technology. However, current sizing practice also causes significant oversizing which impacts the performances of thermodynamic systems.

In this context, we will present a system model including detailed sub-models of each component of the system: heat exchangers, compressor, and expansion valve.

40|$|With {{the mass}} {{introduction}} of wind power in Northern China, wind power variability has appeared. In this article, both existing <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> (EHPs) and coal-fired {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) facilities, which are generally equipped with extraction-condensing steam turbines coupled with district heating for space heating purposes, are proposed {{to incorporate the}} variability of wind power equivalently. The authors’ proposal arises from the facts that: (1) EHPs can provide space heating in the domestic sector with little thermal comfort change (e. g., energy carriers for space heating purposes can be switched from heating water to electricity); (2) coal-fired CHP units in Northern China can usually generate more electrical power corresponding to a shaved thermal power production. Thus, it is suggested that heating water from CHP units be shaved when the wind generation is low due to the variability of wind power, so as to enable more electrical power production and compensate for the corresponding insufficient wind generation. Following this, in the future and for some space heating loads at appropriate distances, electricity used as energy carrier should be converted by <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> for space heating. Thus, more electricity consumption will be achieved so as to avoid wasting wind power when the wind generation it is high. A numerical simulation is performed in order to illustrate the authors’ proposal. It is shown that the impact of variability of wind generation can be equivalently reduced to a great extent, which enable more wind power integration instead of curtailment and potential energy conservation. Moreover, in contrast to before, both the thermal and electrical power of coal-fired CHP units are no longer constants. In addition, the ratio of electrical to thermal power of CHP units is no longer constant either, and results in less energy consumption compared with fixed ratio. Finally, electricity consumed by end users’ EHPs, which are devoted to space heating for various spatial distances and time points, is figured out...|$|E
