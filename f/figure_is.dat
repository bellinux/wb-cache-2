5|$|Altar 12 is {{carved in}} the early Maya style and archaeologists {{consider}} {{it to be an}} especially early example dating to {{the first part of the}} Late Preclassic. Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time 16 hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The 16 glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.|$|E

5|$|Stela 5 is {{reasonably}} well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest {{of these two}} dates is AD126. The right-hand <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> holding a snake, while the left-hand <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> holding what is probably a jaguar. This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next. A small seated <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> carved onto each of the sides of this stela along with a badly eroded hieroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at Izapa.|$|E

5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's publicist at that time, without any factual evidence and probably {{in an effort to}} promote album sales. From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed that Michael Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> unreal.|$|E
5|$|According to {{professor}} Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation of a}} Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice.

Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' <b>figure</b> <b>is</b> accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
