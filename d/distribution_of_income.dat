Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured {{over a number of years}} should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.|$|E

25|$|In general, this {{discussion}} {{says that the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> (and r) helps determine the measured amount of capital rather than being solely determined by that amount. It also says that physical capital is heterogeneous and cannot be added up the way that financial capital can. For the latter, all units are measured in money terms and can thus be easily summed. Even then, of course, {{the price of a}} sum of financial capital varies with interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} systematized {{supply and}} demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> It dispensed with the labour theory of value inherited from classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side. In the 20th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of ordinal utility, which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons.|$|E
25|$|Another {{cause is}} {{the rate at}} which income is taxed coupled with the {{progressivity}} of the tax system. A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases. In a progressive tax system, the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society, either increasing it or decreasing it, provided that income does not change {{as a result of the}} change in tax regime. Additionally, steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> across the board. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} way to understand the aggregation problem does not involve the Classical pricing equations. Think about {{a decrease in the}} r, the return on capital (corresponding to a rise in w, the wage rate, given that initial levels of capital and technology stay constant). This causes a change in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income,</b> the nature of the various capital goods demanded, and thus a change in their prices. This causes a change in the value of K (as discussed above). So, again, the rate of return on K (i.e., r) is not independent of the measure of K, as assumed in the neoclassical model of growth and distribution. Causation goes both ways, from K to r and from r to K. This problem is sometimes seen as analogous to the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results (e.g., by Mas-Colell 1989) in general equilibrium theory, which shows that representative agent models cannot be theoretically justified, except under restrictive conditions (see Kirman, 1992 for an explanation of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu results as an aggregation problem). Note that this says that it's not simply K that is subject to aggregation problems: so is L.|$|E
25|$|Most governments take revenue which {{exceeds that}} {{which can be}} {{provided}} by non-distortionary taxes or through taxes which give a double dividend. Optimal taxation theory is the branch of economics that considers how taxes can be structured to give the least deadweight costs, or to give the best outcomes {{in terms of social}} welfare. The Ramsey problem deals with minimizing deadweight costs. Because deadweight costs are related to the elasticity of supply and demand for a good, it follows that putting the highest tax rates on the goods for which there is most inelastic supply and demand will result in the least overall deadweight costs. Some economists sought to integrate optimal tax theory with the social welfare function, which is the economic expression of the idea that equality is valuable {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. If individuals experience diminishing returns from income, then the optimum <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> for society involves a progressive income tax. Mirrlees optimal income tax is a detailed theoretical model of the optimum progressive income tax along these lines. Over the last years the validity of the theory of optimal taxation was discussed by many political economists.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{demographic}} {{changes in the}} developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, {{in the developing world}} as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rate in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment. Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor. Thus, despite seemingly unequal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.|$|E

500|$|Chapter 4 {{examines}} American {{politics in}} light of the thesis. Cowen says Paul Krugman's The Conscience of a Liberal (2007) puts the [...] "cart before the horse" [...] in asking for high marginal tax rates, unionization, and an egalitarian <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> and wealth. The policies worked in the 1950s precisely because the real income growth was there to support them. Cowen argues that the failure to recognize the stagnation has led to poor policy ideas from the right (such as [...] "revenue generating tax cuts") and the left (redistribution of incomes). Cowen laments the [...] "exaggeration" [...] of both sides and the influence of political lobbying on economic policy. The growth in government, he says, was affordable during the period of lowhanging fruit, and the advances in transportation, industrial production, electronic communications and scientific management even facilitated it.|$|E
