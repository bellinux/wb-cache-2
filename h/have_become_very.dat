5|$|Life in Nsara (and all the Muslim nations) becomes {{increasingly}} difficult as {{they face the}} effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, {{there is a great}} shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans (Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them). The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post-war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties; hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down as people are near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a police state. However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League (who <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> powerful after their victory in the war) intervene by sending a fleet (from their naval base at Orkney) to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they do. After this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war.|$|E

Clay heaths <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> rare within the Lüneburg Heath. They are found on the Wilseder Berg and south of Niederhaverbeck.|$|E
25|$|Benaud's {{distinctive}} speaking {{style has}} been frequently parodied on the Australian comedy series Comedy Inc. and The Twelfth Man. In {{the case of}} the latter, comedian Billy Birmingham's impersonations of Benaud on The Twelfth Man comedy recordings <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> successful, spanning more than twenty years. Chris Barrie of Red Dwarf fame incorporated impressions of Benaud into his stand-up repertoire.|$|E
25|$|Scandinavian rugs {{are among}} the most popular of all weaves in modern design. Preferred by {{influential}} modernist thinkers, designers, and advocates for a new aesthetic in the mid-twentieth century, Scandinavian rugs <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> widespread in many different avenues of contemporary interior design. With a long history of adaptation and evolution, the tradition of Scandinavian rug-making is among the most storied of all European rug-making traditions.|$|E

25|$|Pedicabs operate {{mostly in}} the {{southern}} part of the park, the same part as horse carriages. Such vehicles have more recently offered visitors a more dynamic way in which to view the park; covering three to ten times the distance of a typical Central Park horse carriage ride, pedicabs <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> popular with visitors and New Yorkers alike; also, they are being eyed as another replacement for the carriage horses.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic {{programming}} {{is widely used}} in bioinformatics for the tasks such as sequence alignment, protein folding, RNA structure prediction and protein-DNA binding. The first dynamic programming algorithms for protein-DNA binding were developed in the 1970s independently by Charles DeLisi in USA and Georgii Gurskii and Alexander Zasedatelev in USSR. Recently these algorithms <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> popular in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly in the studies of nucleosome positioning and transcription factor binding.|$|E
25|$|In children, living liver donor transplantations <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> accepted. The {{accessibility}} of adult {{parents who want}} to donate {{a piece of the}} liver for their children/infants has reduced the number of children who would have otherwise died waiting for a transplant. Having a parent as a donor also has made it a lot easier for children - because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other's morale.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} {{the capture of}} fish for {{commercial}} purposes. Those who practice it must often pursue fish far from land under adverse conditions. Commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species, from tuna, cod and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid and crab, in various fisheries for these species. Commercial fishing methods <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. Individual fishing quotas and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.|$|E
25|$|The {{other type}} of explosions is the {{combustible}} gases explosion. For this to happen the fuel and the air have to be mixed before the ignition. Typical conditions are either a blackout (loss of flame) without purge of furnace or continuous operation in a substoichiometric state. To detect blackout flame monitoring devices are installed, with subsequent interlocked purge and startup. Combustible gas explosions are connected with oil/gas firing in the boiler. As also continuous O2 monitoring is practiced in virtually every boiler the noncombustible gas explosions <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> rare.|$|E
25|$|The bearded irises {{are easy}} to {{cultivate}} and propagate and <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> popular in gardens. A small selection is usually held by garden centres at appropriate times during the season, but {{there are thousands of}} cultivars available from specialist suppliers (more than 30 000 cultivars only for the tall bearded irises !). They are best planted as bare root plants in late summer, in a sunny open position with the rhizome visible {{on the surface of the}} soil and facing the sun. They should be divided in summer every two or three years, when the clumps become congested.|$|E

25|$|Having {{become aware}} that the British Army was not longer likely to order the Ultra-light, Fairey instead {{promoted}} the type for its potential use within the Royal Navy. While some trials were conducts, including one prototype being successfully tested for suitability on board an aircraft carrier, the Navy appeared to lack enthusiasm for the Ultra-light and {{it became clear that}} the Ministry would not be providing any further funding for its development. Recognising that the prospects for a military order from the British services to <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> limited, the company decided to re-orientate the Ultra-light to conform with the preferences and needs of civil operators instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the earliest groups of Indians who entered the US workforce as taxi drivers, labourers, farmers or small business owners, the later arrivals often came as professionals or completed graduate study in the US and moved into the professions. They <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> successful financially thanks to the hi-tech industry, and are thus probably the most well-off community of immigrants. They are well represented in all walks of life, but particularly so in academia, information technology and medicine. There were over 4,000 PIO professors and 84,000 Indian-born students in American universities in 2007-08. The American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin has a membership of 35,000. In 2000, Fortune magazine estimated the wealth generated by Indian Silicon Valley entrepreneurs at around $250 billion.|$|E
25|$|At {{the federal}} level, there exists both federal police, who possess full federal {{authority}} as {{given to them}} under United States Code (U.S.C.), and federal law enforcement agencies, who are authorized to enforce various laws at the federal level. Both police and law enforcement agencies operate {{at the highest level}} and are endowed with police roles; each may maintain a small component of the other (for example, the FBI Police). The agencies have nationwide jurisdiction for enforcement of federal law. All federal agencies are limited by the U.S. Code to investigating only matters that are explicitly within the power of the federal government. However, federal investigative powers <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> broad in practice, especially since the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act.|$|E

25|$|Software {{keyboards}} or on-screen keyboards {{often take}} the form of computer programs that display an image of a keyboard on the screen. Another input device such as a mouse or a touchscreen can be used to operate each virtual key to enter text. Software keyboards <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> popular in touchscreen enabled cell phones, due to the additional cost and space requirements of other types of hardware keyboards. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some varieties of Linux include on-screen keyboards that can be controlled with the mouse. In software keyboards, the mouse has to be maneuvered onto the on-screen letters given by the software. On the click of a letter, the software writes the respective letter on the respective spot.|$|E
25|$|Several Marxist insurgencies {{continued}} for decades (1967, 1979, 1989–96) led by KDP-I and Komalah, but those two organization have never advocated a Kurdish country {{as did the}} PKK in Turkey. Still, many dissident leaders, among others Qazi Muhammad and Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, were executed or assassinated. During Iran–Iraq War, Tehran has provided support for Iraqi-based Kurdish groups like KDP or PUK, along with asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds. Although Kurdish Marxist groups have been marginalized in Iran since {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, in 2004 new insurrection has been started by PJAK, separatist organization affiliated with the Turkey-based PKK and designated as terrorist by Iran, Turkey and the United States. Some analysts claim that the PJAK does not pose any serious threat to the government of Iran. Cease-fire has been established on September 2011 following the Iranian offensive on PJAK bases, but several clashes between PJAK and IRGC took place after it. Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, accusations of discrimination by Western organizations and of foreign involvement by the Iranian side <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> frequent.|$|E
500|$|The Compleat Housewife was {{the first}} cookery book to be {{published}} in America, when William Parks, an ambitious and enterprising printer (originally from Shropshire) printed it in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1742. His version of The Compleat Housewife, a [...] "cookery book of ambitious scope", was based on the fifth London edition of 1732, altered to suit American taste, and without recipes [...] "the ingredients or materials for which are not to be had in this country." [...] Copies of the 1742 edition <b>have</b> <b>become</b> <b>very</b> rare, but [...] "happily, one copy has returned to the city of its origin", and is in the Library of Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated.|$|E
