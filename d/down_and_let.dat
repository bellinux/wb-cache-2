25|$|A safety car {{caused a}} crash during the 2008 Dutch Supercar Challenge race at Spa Francorchamps. The Seat Leon was {{released}} too late, allowing the leading Marcos LM600 to pass while erroneously identifying the Audi TT DTM in 2nd and Mosler MT900R GT3 in 3rd as 'the leading pack.' Race officials immediately realized their mistake, {{and the safety}} car was instructed to slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> the entire field pass.|$|E
25|$|Devastated {{to report}} that Blur won't be {{performing}} at BDO in 2014. It's a shock that {{it has come to}} this. Only 8 weeks to go, the band feels that with the constantly shifting goalposts and challenging conditions of the organisers, they can't let it drag on any longer and want to make this announcement, to be clear to Blur fans that they won't be there. We've done our very best to work with the organisers and considered every option to make it happen, but they've let us <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> everyone else down too.|$|E

500|$|As {{well as her}} 1992 {{autobiography}} I Put a Spell on You (1992), {{written with}} Stephen Cleary, Simone {{has been the subject}} of several books.

500|$|With Unicorn's demise in 1983 Black Flag {{was able}} to release the {{material}} they had written since 1981. [...] Eager {{to get back in}} the studio but still without a bassist, Ginn took on bass duties under the pseudonym [...] "Dale Nixon" [...] and practiced the new material with Stevenson up to eight hours a day, teaching the drummer to slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> the rhythm [...] "ooze out" [...] at a pace Stevenson was unused to; the band called this approach the [...] "socialist groove", as all beats were equally spaced. [...] With Spot as producer and $200,000 in debt, Ginn, Rollins, and Stevenson headed to the studio to record My War.|$|E
500|$|During the sailors' revolt, {{the crew}} of the {{battleship}} [...] refused to move out of Dresdens way; she aimed one of her [...] gun turrets at Dresden, but then backed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> Dresden leave the port. The ship then went to Swinemünde, where she was partially scuttled and subsequently re-floated and returned to seaworthy condition. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. When informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, [...] "I no longer have a navy." [...] Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Cöln and Dresden were among the ships interned.|$|E

500|$|During the sailors' revolt, Dresden {{was ordered}} to steam to Eckernförde {{to serve as a}} relay to Kiel. Communications had been {{disrupted}} by major unrest there. The battleship [...] laid in Dresdens path, and her unruly crew refused to move out of Dresdens way; Markgraf aimed one of her [...] gun turrets at Dresden, but then her crew backed <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> Dresden leave the port. The ship then went to Swinemünde, where her crew partially scuttled her following reports that mutinous ships were en route to attack the cruisers stationed there. After these proved false, Dresden was re-floated and returned to seaworthy condition. This involved removing the ammunition for all of the guns and allowing them to air-dry. Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Dresden was among the ships interned, but owing to her poor condition following the naval mutiny, she was not able to steam {{with the rest of the}} fleet in November. She arrived on 6 December, leaking badly.|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an air gun after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break <b>Down</b> <b>and</b> <b>Let</b> It All Out written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E
2500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{wrote that}} the film [...] "will more than satisfy the show's legions of fans." [...] Chang praised the {{performances}} of Jackman, Hathaway, Barks, Tveit and Seyfried (i.e., every leading cast member except Crowe and Redmayne) but said that the film's editing [...] "seems reluctant to slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> the viewer simply take in the performances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} this stone--Isende Aha," [...] said Joe, after Nas Ta Bega had spoken. [...] "Get <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>let's</b> see." [...] Shefford dismounted, but the Indian kept his seat in the saddle.|$|R

2500|$|The character's {{demeanour}} altered somewhat circa 2000. Due to her romantic pairing with Phil Mitchell, {{she became}} [...] "mentally battered". Rupert Smith, author of EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square, classified the character as an [...] "eternal victim": one who endures misfortune and misery, an endless sufferer. He adds, [...] "She was intelligent, beautiful and young— and so, of course, Lisa {{had to lie}} [...] <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> men walk all over her [...] a snivelling, suicidal wreck." [...] Benjamin has noted that her character was [...] "constantly crying".|$|E
2500|$|The Jerilderie Letter {{has been}} {{described}} as both Kelly's [...] "manifesto" [...] and his [...] "confession". In it, Kelly admits to crimes but claims he was forced into becoming a criminal because of police persecution of himself and his family. He also gives his version of the killing of three police officers at Stringybark Creek in Victoria in October 1878, arguing that he shot the men in self-defence: [...] "... this cannot be called wilful murder for I was compelled to shoot them, or lie <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> them shoot me".|$|E
2500|$|When {{it began}} to appear that Miller had won the primary, the Libertarian Party floated the {{possibility}} of offering Murkowski its nomination; the Murkowski campaign {{said it would not}} rule out a third party run, and Murkowski said it was too premature. But on August 29, 2010, the executive board of the state Libertarian Party voted not to consider allowing Murkowski on its ticket for the U.S. Senate race. When asked about a write-in candidacy at that time, she said it was [...] "high risk". By September 7 though, she said that she was weighing the option of mounting a write-in campaign. On September 13 Libertarian candidate David Haase reiterated that he would not stand <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> Murkowski replace him on the ballot. Murkowski announced on September 17 that she would enter the general election contest as a write-in candidate, saying she had agonized over the decision, but had been encouraged to run by many voters.|$|E

2500|$|Trailing 31–14 in {{the fourth}} quarter, the Bengals managed {{to come back with}} two {{unanswered}} touchdowns. First, Cincinnati defensive back Ken Riley intercepted a pass from Stabler and returned it 34 yards to the Raiders 34-yard line, setting up Ken Anderson's 25-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Joiner. Then the Bengals defense forced Oakland to punt {{for the first time in}} the game, and Ray Guy's kick went just 38 yards. Three minutes later, Anderson's 14-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Curtis cut the score to 31–28. With 4:19 left in the game, Bengals defensive lineman Ron Carpenter recovered a Banaszak fumble on the Raiders 37-yard line. But on the next play, linebacker Ted Hendricks sacked Anderson for an 8-yard loss, pushing the Bengals out of field goal range. [...] Anderson completed a 5-yard pass to Bruce Coslet on second down, but his next two passes were incomplete, resulting in a turnover. [...] The Bengals managed to force a punt with 50 seconds left, but on a desperate attempt to block the kick that narrowly missed, linebacker Chris Devlin ran into Guy, drawing a penalty that gave the Raiders a first <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>let</b> them run out the clock.|$|E
