For the simulation experts the difficulties start when they have to deliver precise values, because a lot {{of performance}} indicators are not defined clearly enough or have different meaning, depending of industrial domain. Therefore an open discussion platform is necessary where simulation experts as well as the industrial users collect, exchange and sort their views and experiences. To facilitate this discussion we set up a wiki of terms and performance indicators which can be used to start the process of collecting and fostering terms and their definitions in the area of performance indicators...|$|R
5000|$|National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT, Taipei Tech; [...] ), a top-ranked public {{technological}} {{university in}} Taiwan, {{is located in}} the Daan District of Taipei City, Taiwan. The school was established in 1912, as School of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Instruction,</b> among one of the earliest intermediate-higher educational institute in Taiwan. During the post-war industrialization and economic growth era, the school produced some of the most influential entrepreneurs, leaders, educators, and researchers in the science and industrial field, as it is commonly referred to as [...] "The cradle of entrepreneurship"(企業家的搖籃). The university is headed by Dr. Leehter Yao, who serves as the president. It is part of the University System of Taipei, along with National Taipei University and Taipei Medical University.|$|E
50|$|The {{university}} traces {{its origins}} {{to the establishment}} of the School of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Instruction</b> (工業講習所) in 1912. This institution underwent several name changes and reorganizations during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan. By the time the (Nationalist) Republic of China central government was about to settle from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan (as an outcome of the civil war against the Communist regime), this technical institution was renamed Provincial Taipei Institute of Technology (臺灣省立臺北工業專科學校) in 1948, and served as a junior vocational technical college. In 1981, it was renamed National Taipei Institute of Technology (國立臺北工業專科學校), and in the 1990s upgraded its junior college status to that of a university, resulting in the final name change to National Taipei University of Technology (國立臺北科技大學) in 1997. The university currently has 451 full-time faculty members.|$|E

Among new professions for women established by the association was that of porcelain painting. In 1887, Donlevy was one of the committee of three to go to Albany, New York and lay before the New York State Legislature plans of free art <b>industrial</b> <b>instruction</b> for talented boys, girls and women, to be given during vacation seasons and on Saturday afternoons. The bill passed both houses. It was defeated later by eight votes when called up for reconsideration by Robert Ray Hamilton. Probably the best work of Donlevy was the aid that she personally gave to promote the interests of struggling associations and individual artists by means of free lectures and free lessons, and also by giving the latter introduction by means of public receptions at which their works were exhibited.|$|E

30|$|In {{the past}} <b>industrial</b> era, the <b>instruction</b> {{technologies}} such as lantern slides, projector, film and television set were applied in the classrooms. Those kinds of technologies can make the teachers’ instruction content spread wider, can make the teachers’ voice louder, and even can record some audio and visual information which would be learned without teachers. The audio-visual technologies promoted the classroom environment coming into the electronic era. They become an information transfer medium between teachers and students and make the teacher-centered pedagogical activities more robust and more efficient.|$|R
40|$|Background and Need for the Study The {{primary purpose}} of {{education}} is to develop happy and successful citizens. Industrial arts, being a phase of general education, should in every way possible contribute toward achieving this primary purpose. Because of the rapidly changing methods of industrial production and the increasing areas of industry, it is therefore necessary, that to keep abreast of this industrial advancement, industrial education must employ every possible means to justifiably incorporate these new industrial methods and products into the industrial education program. It is {{the intention of the}} writer that this study will bring forth evidence of the practical usability of the general shop idea in promoting more adequate <b>industrial</b> arts <b>instruction.</b> It is also the intention of the writer that by reviewing the literature of the development of the general shop, industrial education might more adequately keep abreast of the products, tools, and methods of the rapidly advancing industrial period...|$|R

The {{effectiveness of this}} approach is demonstrated here using a recently developed <b>industrial</b> distributed reconfigurable <b>instruction</b> cell based architecture [11]. The results show that schedules using this approach achieve equivalent throughput to VLIW architectures but at much lower power consumption. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{third section}} dealing with {{education}} undertook {{to educate the}} labouring classes, and to instruct the middle classes in industrial arts. The Working Men’s Institution and the Industrial School were opened on 28 November 1870. In addition to education, the Institution provided healthy entertainment opportunities. The <b>Industrial</b> School gave <b>instruction</b> {{to the middle class}} in industrial arts, or rather practical training in such crafts as carpentry, tailoring, clock and watch repairing, printing, lithography and engraving. Brahmo missionaries, headed by Sen himself took to these occupations with workman-like avidity. The present Working Men’s Institution may well be regarded as the descendant of this Institution.|$|R

5000|$|Oak Hill was {{developed}} to provide training in farming and domestic trades, and to teach Christianity to the former Choctaw slave children. According to the school's founders, [...] "young people are transplanted for a time, where they may receive Bible <b>instruction,</b> <b>industrial</b> training and a foretaste of the privileges of an enlightened christian civilization". As was typical of American Indian boarding schools the farming model was implemented, where students both learned agricultural and animal husbandry skills and grew their own food. The students cultivated land, hauled water (as their well had run dry), and tended large herds of pigs and cattle. In the early days, focus was on vocational training and the educational portion was minimal, as schooling beyond an eighth grade education was not offered.|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} part of the elementary school curriculum is the creative activity program connected with it. Educators believe that the fullest development of the child can best be attained through a program which provides a series of well selected experiences and activities. At present education considers the whole child-his abilities, needs, and interests-as vital factors {{in the development of a}} good curriculum, instead of merely the concrete and formal subject matter. Recently there has been an expressed view, by administrators of elementary school systems and many authorities and industrial arts teachers, that there is a definite need for formulating an effective plan of <b>instruction</b> for <b>industrial</b> arts in the elementary school program. This need has occured because of the varied programs and confusion of current practices that exist in the activity programs of the elementary school, and the belief that industrial arts, probably more than most other subjects, can contribute to the activity program and the development of the whole child. The problem of this study was to procure and evaluate the opnions of industrial arts authorities and the opinions of Utah school administrators on the necessary elements for desirable <b>industrial</b> arts <b>instruction</b> in the elementary schools. This investigation was not attempted for the purpose of developing a course of study of industrial arts to be considered as a part of the elementary curriculum; nor was it the purpose to go into any detail about the innumberable possible problems that would have to be considered in introducing it as a subject ara. The writer limits this study to the evaluation of effective instructional elements that could be incorporated, with modifications, into a plan of <b>instruction</b> for <b>industrial</b> arts in the elementary schools of Utah...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Emerging from my {{interest}} in past methods of drawing instruction, and personal experiences of being taught drawing in the 1960 ’s by an industrial arts teacher, {{led me to the}} study of teaching methods of Walter Smith (1836 - 1886) in the 1870 ’s. This historical study of drawing methods used in the public schools in Massachusetts when Smith was hired by the state, to implement drawing into the public schools, revealed instructional methods based on simple elements and principles of design. Smith used six methods of drawing instruction: drawing from printed copies, drawing from the blackboard, drawing from dictation, drawing from memory, drawing from objects and drawing decorative designs. His use of personal slates and small cards with step by step directions for each day of the week all followed a sequential order for students and teachers to follow. Beginning with lines, geometric shapes, and proportions, students would understand, know, and be able to accomplish assignments successfully. Students were taught how to draw and were able to retain what they had learned through clear understanding and continual practice. This study argued that Smith’s methods would benefit public middle school classrooms today. By combining methods of the past with current practices and current technological advantages this study will offer teachers an alternative way to approach drawing instruction for the diverse middle school classrooms in the present time.
