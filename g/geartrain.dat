50|$|All SA gear hubs use {{epicyclic}} (planetary) <b>geartrains</b> {{of varying}} complexity. The AW is the simplest, using {{one set of}} planetary gears with four planets. The AM uses three compound planets with differently sized cogs on a common shaft {{to engage the gear}} ring and sun gear separately, while the close-ratio three-speeds, and hubs with four or more speeds, use multiple planetary <b>geartrains.</b> Depending on the specific hub these may be in series with each other, or with one or the other set being selectable at any given time by locking a particular sun gear to the axle.|$|R
25|$|Later hidden {{headlamps}} require {{one or more}} vacuum-operated servos and reservoirs, with associated {{plumbing and}} linkage, or electric motors, <b>geartrains</b> and linkages to raise the lamps to an exact position to assure correct aiming despite ice, snow and age. Some early hidden headlamps, such as those on the Saab Sonett III, used a lever-operated mechanical linkage to raise the headlamps into position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} 1/1000 s and 1/2000 s top {{speeds of}} {{horizontal and vertical}} FP shutters are on the knife's edge of mechanical controllability - often ¼ stop too slow, even in ultra-high-quality models. Spring powered <b>geartrains</b> become inadequate to durably control and reliably time any higher accelerations and shocks. For example, some highly tensioned FP shutters could suffer from [...] "shutter curtain bounce." [...] This phenomenon is exactly {{what it sounds like}} - if the curtains are not properly braked after crossing the film gate, they might crash and bounce; reopening the shutter and causing double exposure ghosting bands on the image edge. Even the Nikon F2's ultra-high precision shutter suffered from this as an early production teething problem. As the Square-type FP shutter's blades moved faster and faster to provide shorter and shorter shutter speeds, the need for better blade timing control only increased.|$|R
5000|$|The Ultramatic was a {{hydraulic}} torque converter automatic transmission with a two-speed plus reverse epicyclic <b>geartrain</b> and torque converter lockup, called Direct Drive by Packard. The unit was hydraulically controlled with a [...] "valve body," [...] like most automatic transmissions {{before the advent of}} electronic control.|$|E
50|$|Frequently, {{the rotor}} and its {{associated}} reduction <b>geartrain</b> is encased in an aluminium, copper, or plastic enclosure; the enclosed rotor is driven magnetically through the enclosure. Such geared motors are commonly available with the final output shaft or gear rotating from 600 RPM down to as low as 1/168 revolutions per hour (1 revolution per week!).|$|E
50|$|The {{first few}} gears in the <b>geartrain</b> of an Omega Megasonic {{wristwatch}} have no teeth; instead magnetic {{north and south}} poles on neighboring gears act like the teeth and trough of neighboring spur gears, as each gear drives the next gear in the chain.Such magnetic gears, like spur gears, always have gear ratios as the ratios of small integers.|$|E
50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical <b>geartrains</b> from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or distributor shaft, which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|R
40|$|Nano {{manufacturing}} {{changed the}} way things are and opened new resolutions to long lasting issues. However, in Nano world of Fabrication, there are several problems since the start of working at the Nano scale such as accuracy and reproducibility. These problems limited the expansion of MEMS/NEMS applications (1). Therefore, most MEMS/NEMS devices currently under development are mainly based on silicon because of the available surface machining technology adapted from the silicon-­‐based microelectronics and microcircuits batch fabrication technology. However, due to the relatively poor mechanical and tribological properties of silicon, it limited its application to only areas simple devices involving bending and flexural motion such as cantilever beams, vibration sensors, accelerometers (3). Moreover, probes applications such as sensing, multiple probing, arraying and actuations have been also limited due to the short lifetime of probes due to the repetitive mechanical failure in operation and handling, pickup of sample material and particles from the samples, and wear (2). Other attractive futuristic applications might be those involving more mechanical rolling or sliding operating environments and more complex shaped components such as gears, wheels, micromotors and <b>geartrains</b> requiring high mechanical and tribological properties, and the reliable performance in such environments. Methods of lubrications as in the macro machines and gears are not considered viable due to minute scale and difficulties of maintenance (1). The problem being investigated is regarding the materials of the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) probe tips having minimal durability and low wear and friction resistance subjecting them to experience wear, flattening and fouling, or picking up the substrate materials at severe environment. Nano-­‐scale wear have been considered to be the main limiting factor for conventional atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes and other nanolithography probes that results in decreased resolution, accuracy, and reproducibility in probe-­‐ based imaging, writing, imprinting measuring, nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing applications (4) Diamond is considered the solution to the above addressed problems for its high mechanical strength, incomparable chemical inertness, and great thermal stability. For instance, the brittle fracture strength of diamond is 23 times that of Si, and the wear resistance is 1000 times higher than that of Si (1) Furthermore, earlier trials of using diamond were not practical since diamond grain size is large and hard to fabricate (1). Other methods of using relatively small grain size diamond such as diamond films and diamond-­‐like coatings were considered impractical due to the low bonding energy because of the columnar inter-­‐granular formation and high surface roughness (1). Also, the other disadvantage of this technique is the additional thickness it adds to the initial tip radius of the probes (10 – 20 nm) (2) Moreover, other attempts of using boron-­‐doped diamond layers grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) showed the feasibility of employing conductive diamond in probe manufacturing, but found not suitable for integration such that cantilevers had adhesion and stiction phenomena (2). On contrary, UNCD is the ideal probe material due to its unparalleled hardness and stiffness, its low friction and wear, and its chemical inertness. However, the nanomanufacturing of such probe tips dimensions, shape consistency and reproducibility has not been previously achieved (5) ...|$|R

Modern highlights include a slipper clutch, 48-pitch <b>geartrain,</b> compatibility with the Ultima RB’s ball diff (as an upgrade from the supplied gear diff), and wide-track front suspension. The shocks are also improved, with the smooth action expected of modern oil-filled units.|$|E
50|$|Camshafts must actuate {{the valves}} at the {{appropriate}} time in the combustion cycle. In order to accomplish this the camshaft is linked to and kept in synchronisation with the crankshaft (the main shaft upon which the pistons act) {{through the use of a}} metal chain, rubber belt, or <b>geartrain.</b> Because these mechanisms are essential to the proper timing of valve actuation they are named timing chains, timing belts, and timing gears, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The 4F27E is a {{strengthened}} 4-speed F-4EAT automatic. It {{now has a}} four-element {{torque converter}} that includes a torque converter clutch and <b>geartrain</b> with two planetary gearsets, a transfer-shaft gear final drive, and a larger differential. The hydraulic control system of the 4F27E transaxle has six electronically controlled solenoids for shift feel (through line pressure control), shift scheduling (through shift valve position control) and TCC (torque converter clutch) apply, controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM). The Mazda FS5A-EL (Ford FNR5) is the 5-speed successor to this transmission. It uses {{many of the same}} parts.|$|E
50|$|A {{servomotor}} is a packaged {{combination of}} several components: a motor (usually electric, although fluid power motors {{may also be}} used), a gear train to reduce the many rotations of the motor to a higher torque rotation, a position encoder that identifies {{the position of the}} output shaft and an inbuilt control system. The input control signal to the servo indicates the desired output position. Any difference between the position commanded and the position of the encoder gives rise to an error signal that causes the motor and <b>geartrain</b> to rotate until the encoder reflects a position matching that commanded.|$|E
5000|$|In 1962, Chrysler {{introduced}} a starter incorporating a <b>geartrain</b> between the motor and the drive shaft. The motor shaft included integrally cut gear teeth forming a pinion that meshes {{with a larger}} adjacent driven gear to provide a gear reduction ratio of 3.75:1. This permitted {{the use of a}} higher-speed, lower-current, lighter and more compact motor assembly while increasing cranking torque. Variants of this starter design were used on most rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation from 1962 through 1987. It makes a unique, distinct sound when cranking the engine, which led to it being nicknamed the [...] "Highland Park Hummingbird"—a reference to Chrysler's headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sequence}} of operation was to heat the boiler in the normal way, but using fuel oil instead of coal. The start from rest would be made with steam power, but at about five mph (8 km/h) the diesel injectors would be started and the steam turned off. The waste heat from the cylinder jackets and diesel exhaust then maintained the boiler in steam for auxiliary functions (brakes and whistle) and in readiness to supplement the diesel power if required, or for the next start. By using steam for starting, no form of variable transmission was necessary and a permanent reduction <b>geartrain</b> of 1·878 to 1 ratio was fitted.|$|E

In fact, one of Eyston's spare engines for the record attempts was on loan from Campbell. There were so few of these engines built (around 20) {{that many of them}} had illustrious careers over several different records. One of the Thunderbolt's had already powered the Schneider Trophy winner. Each engine was of 36.5 litres capacity, supercharged, and had an individual output power of [...] Handling all this power through a single driven axle required great innovation in metallurgy and in manufacturing the <b>geartrain,</b> as well as water-cooling the completed transmission.|$|E
5000|$|A radio {{frequency}} alternator differed from an ordinary electric generator in that to produce {{radio frequency}} current it rotated much faster, and had many more magnetic [...] "poles" [...] on the rotor and stator, usually 300 to 600. The Goldschmidt alternator was turned {{by a powerful}} DC electric motor attached to the shaft, through a <b>geartrain</b> which increased the motor's speed to several thousand RPM. The advantage of the Goldschmidt design was that by using external [...] "reflector" [...] capacitor banks that increased {{the frequency of the}} current to a multiple (harmonic) of the alternator's rotation speed, it allowed the rotation speed to be kept lower, simplifying the mechanical design. [...] Goldschmidt transmitters operated at longwave (LF and VLF) frequencies of about 20 to 100 kHz.|$|E
50|$|The THM350 {{was also}} {{regarded}} as a 'three speed Powerglide' and during its development, was generally called this. Although it uses the same torque converter as the THM400 (without variable pitch stator) it has a familial resemblance to the 1962-'73 aluminum Powerglide from Chevrolet and was largely derived from the Chevrolet design. One important difference in the THM350 compared to the THM400 is there is no fixed center support midway through the <b>geartrain,</b> this important difference in layout permitted THM350 to be adapted to the Corvair where the drive and driven ends are the same. This feature was not exploited. Air-cooled versions (with a baffle on the torque converter and air intakes cast into the bellhousing) of the THM350 appeared mid-1972 in Chevrolet Vega and Nova 6.|$|E
50|$|The Corvair Powerglide {{provided}} one reduction {{range and}} reverse, {{in addition to}} direct drive and neutral. Low and Reverse ranges were a 1.82 ratio reduction, using a single planetary gearset. Locking the planetary <b>geartrain</b> provided a 1:1 direct drive. The differential driven rear pump permitted push-starting the Powerglide-equipped Corvair (the last American automatic to do so), at speeds over 18 mph by creating adequate pressure to engage low band and turn over the engine via the torque converter. A multiple plate clutch engaged reverse range, low was braked using a band on the forward clutch drum, and direct provided via clutches. The torque converter of the Corvair offered 2.6:1 reduction at stall, and improved car performance when engine speeds were below ~2000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Gear {{noise is}} one of the major {{drawbacks}} of using a <b>geartrain</b> to drive cams. In order to minimise this, Honda used a spring mounted scissor gear system (essentially 2 gears slightly offset) on the gear mounted on each camshaft, as well as the lowest mounted gear in each head (driven by the crankshaft), offsetting the teeth by roughly half of the pitch. This allowed the lash to be entirely taken up by the tension of the two teeth resting on the gear below, hence eliminating some of the noise and lash inherent in this type of system. The motor still makes a whirring noise which can be heard, as this is an intrinsic property of the straight cut type of gears which were used. The gear driven cams went on to be a key feature Honda used in their line of VFR750 motorcycles throughout the remainder of the 80's and throughout the 90's.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{problems}} with the locomotives were minor and varied, although a problem with cracking in the cylinder liner around the injector hole required the engine to be changed. By November 1959, seven engines had been changed and this reduced availability first raised comparisons with the better reliability of the British Rail Class 24 Type 2. The Type 2s were averaging 30-40,000 miles per failure, the Baby Deltic {{less than a quarter}} of this. Although they suffered {{problems with}} the cylinder liners that weren't dissimilar to those of the Class 55 Deltics, most of the Class 23's early problems were a variety of failures with the engine ancillaries. The auxiliary gearbox used to drive the compressor and cooling fans was a particular problem, suffering from vibration in its <b>geartrain</b> and a resonant whirling in the long drive shaft to it at particular rpm. Many engines seized because this shaft driving the auxiliaries snapped and then whipped round, rupturing coolant hoses and causing overheating.|$|E
50|$|In {{mechanical}} horology, a remontoire, (from the French remonter, meaning 'to wind') {{is a small}} secondary {{source of}} power, a weight or spring, which runs the timekeeping mechanism and is itself periodically rewound by the timepiece's main power source, such as a mainspring. It was used in precision clocks and watches to place the source of power closer to the escapement, thereby increasing the accuracy by evening out variations in drive force caused by unevenness of the friction in the <b>geartrain.</b> In spring-driven precision clocks a gravity remontoire {{is often used to}} replace the uneven force delivered by the mainspring running down by the more constant force of gravity acting on a weight. In turret clocks it serves to separate the large forces needed to drive the hands from the modest forces needed to drive the escapement which keeps the pendulum swinging. A remontoire {{should not be confused with}} a maintaining power spring, which is used only to keep the timepiece going while it is being wound.|$|E

40|$|The {{mission of}} Project Ares is {{to design and}} {{fabricate}} an Earth prototype, autonomous flying rover capable of flying on the Martian surface. The project was awarded to California State University, Northridge (CSUN) in 1989 where an in-depth paper study was completed. The second year's group, Project Ares 2, designed and fabricated a full-scale flight demonstration aircraft. Project Ares 3, the third and final group, is responsible for propulsion system design and installation, controls and instrumentation, and high altitude testing. The propulsion system consists of a motor and its power supply, <b>geartrain,</b> and propeller. The motor is a four-brush DC motor powered by a 50 -V NiCd battery supply. A pulley and belt arrangement is used for the <b>geartrain</b> and includes light weight, low temperature materials. The propeller is constructed from composite materials which ensures high strength and light weight, and is specifically developed to provide thrust at extremely high altitudes. The aircraft is controlled with a ground-based radio control system and an autopilot which will activate in the event that the control signal is lost. A transponder is used to maintain radar contact for ground tracking purposes. The aircraft possesses a small, onboard computer for collecting and storing flight data. To safeguard the possibility of computer failure, all flight data is transmitted to a ground station via a telemetry system. An initial, unpowered, low-level test flight was completed in August of 1991. Testing of systems integration in the second low-level test flight resulted in loss of elevator control which caused considerable damage on landing. Complete failure analysis and repairs are scheduled for September of 1992...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most {{wind turbine}} {{gearboxes}} and pitch/yaw reducers consist of several planetary geartrains. Planetary geartrains allow gearboxes to be small, light, low noise, and efficient. The {{most important factors}} in the planetary <b>geartrain</b> design are load sharing among the planet gears and load distribution on the gear tooth flank. This {{study was conducted to}} analyze the load sharing and distribution in reducers with and without a slewing bearing. Load sharing and distribution of a pitch reducer without a slewing bearing were very uniform and even. However, in the other case, they were non-uniform and uneven, and the gear meshes were formed on the right or left. These results show that heavy loads act on the right or left flank of a meshed gear pair and reduce the gear life. Therefore, the slewing bearing must be considered when pitch/yaw reducers are designed and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Most {{helicopters}} now {{in service}} have a transmission with a planetary design. Studies {{have shown that}} some helicopters would be lighter and more reliable {{if they had a}} transmission with a split-torque design instead. However, a split-torque design has never been used by a U. S. helicopter manufacturer because there has been no proven method to ensure equal sharing of the load among the multiple load paths. The Sikorsky/Boeing team has chosen to use a split-torque transmission for the U. S. Army's Comanche helicopter, and Sikorsky Aircraft is designing and manufacturing the transmission. To help reduce the technical risk of fielding this helicopter, NASA and the Army have done the research jointly in cooperation with Sikorsky Aircraft. A theory was developed that equal load sharing could be achieved by proper configuration of the <b>geartrain,</b> and a computer code was completed in-house at the NASA Lewis Research Center to calculate this optimal configuration...|$|E
40|$|Split torque {{transmissions}} {{are attractive}} alternatives to conventional planetary designs for helicopter transmissions. The split torque designs can offer lighter weight and fewer parts {{but have not}} been used extensively for lack of experience, especially with obtaining proper load sharing. Two split torque designs that use different load sharing methods have been studied. Precise indexing and alignment of the <b>geartrain</b> to produce acceptable load sharing has been demonstrated. An elastomeric torque splitter that has large torsional compliance and damping produces even better load sharing while reducing dynamic transmission error and noise. However, the elastomeric torque splitter as now configured is not capable over {{the full range of}} operating conditions of a fielded system. A thrust balancing load sharing device was evaluated. Friction forces that oppose the motion of the balance mechanism are significant. A static analysis suggests increasing the helix angle of the input pinion of the thrust balancing design. Also, dynamic analysis of this design predicts good load sharing and significant torsional response to accumulative pitch errors of the gears...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{losses are}} of great {{significance}} to the automotive and motorsports industries. Many of these losses are incurred during power transmission through the gearbox. There has been considerable research in this area, however, generally gear losses are not calculated at part load condition, nor are so called dry sump systems considered outside of motor racing. The method developed by Anderson & Loewenthal which considers efficiency over part-load conditions is used here to calculate <b>geartrain</b> losses with varying speed, load and temperature conditions in a spur gear type gearbox for motorsport application. Both oil bath (wet sump) and oil jet (dry sump) systems of lubrications are considered. The Changenet method {{is used to calculate}} the churning losses in the typical oil bath lubrication system. Seventeen different mineral and synthetic oils were evaluated. At 75 kW engine output, 1200 W were lost in the dry sump gearbox whereas 1320 W were lost in the wet-sump gearbox – in 1 st gear at 9000 rpm engine speed. The oils studied showed a spread of total drive efficiency of 97. 8 to 99 % in the most extreme temperature case. Observation of how efficiency and film thickness relate to operating temperatures it is clear that tight temperature control is critical to obtain the potential benefits available from oil optimisation. The dry sump gearbox is predicted to be more efficient only above 5000 rpm engine speed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a framework to automate {{the process of}} designing Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) powertrain architectures. An algorithm was developed to assemble and compare all possible configurations of powertrain components. Combinatorics was used to discover all possible combinations of: an internal combustion engine, high-torque low-speed electric motor, low-torque high-speed electric motor, planetary gearset, and five-speed discrete gearbox. The Graph Theoretic Method was used to generate the powertrain models. The powertrain models were comprised of steady-state equations in symbolic form. An optimal control strategy is required to fairly compare the different topologies because a powertrain control strategy is dependant on the configuration. Dynamic Programming {{was used to determine}} the control law that minimizes the energy consumption for a given drivecycle. Evaluating every possible topology would take an extremely long time, so topologies were evaluated using a multi-stage screening process. The first stage examined the structure of the powertrain and used heuristics to eliminate infeasible topologies; 512 topologies were feasible. The second stage eliminated topologies that could not meet basic driving performance; 193 topologies were feasible. Basic driving performance was tested using a section of the US 06 drivecycle. The sizes of three components were optimized to ensure the topology is feasible independent {{of the size of the}} components. The third stage eliminated topologies which could not achieve driving performance design goals; 159 could achieve the performance requirements, but only 119 were reasonably fuel efficient. The driving performance goals were implemented with a drivecycle based on the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) goals. The sizes for five components were optimized at this stage. The 20 most fuel efficient powertrains were selected for further evaluation. Additionally, 4 common powertrains were evaluated for reference. The size of the components were optimized for a combination of the PNGV drivecycle and the HWFET drivecycle. The most fuel efficient topology was found to be a Powersplit hybrid which has a discrete gearbox between the final drive and the powersplit device. The electric motor, planetary carrier gear, and gearbox were connected in parallel. It was found that Parallel-like, Powersplit-like, and Complex-like topologies were were the most efficient powertrain configurations. Powertrains containing two gearboxes were more efficient because the <b>geartrain</b> models ignored mechanical inefficiencies...|$|E
40|$|With {{a variety}} of hybrid {{vehicles}} available in the passenger car market, electric technologies and components of that scale are becoming readily available. Commercial vehicle segments have lagged behind passenger car markets, leaving opportunities for component and system development. Escalating fuel prices impact all markets and provide motivation for OEMs, suppliers, customers, and end-users to seek new techniques and technologies to deliver reduced fuel consumption. The research presented here specifically targets the medium-duty (MD), Class 4 - 7, truck market with technologies aimed at reducing fuel consumption. These technologies could facilitate not only idle, but also parasitic load reductions. The development efforts here build upon {{the success of the}} More Electric Truck (MET) demonstration program at Caterpillar Inc. Employing {{a variety of}} electric accessories, the MET demonstrated the improvement seen with such technologies on a Class 8 truck. The Truck Essential Power Systems Efficiency Improvements for Medium-Duty Trucks (TEPS) team scaled the concepts and successes of MET to a MD chassis. The team designed an integrated starter/generator (ISG) package and energy storage system (ESS), explored ways to replace belt and gear-driven accessory systems, and developed supervisory control algorithms to direct the usage of the generated electricity and system behavior on the vehicle. All of these systems needed to fit within the footprint of a MD vehicle and be compatible with the existing conventional systems to the largest extent possible. The overall goal of this effort was to demonstrate a reduction in fuel consumption across the drive cycle, including during idle periods, through truck electrification. Furthermore, the team sought to evaluate the benefits of charging the energy storage system during vehicle braking. The vehicle features an array of electric accessories facilitating on-demand, variable actuation. Removal of these accessories from the belt or <b>geartrain</b> of the engine yields efficiency improvements for the engine while freeing those accessories to perform at their individual peak efficiencies to meet instantaneous demand. The net result is a systems approach to fuel usage optimization. Unique control algorithms were specifically developed to capitalize on the flexibility afforded by the TEPS architecture. Moreover, the TEPS truck technology mixture exhibits a means to supplant current accessory power sources such as on-board or trailer-mounted gasoline-powered generators or air compressors. Such functionality further enhances the value of the electric systems beyond the fuel savings alone. To demonstrate the fuel economy improvement wrought via the TEPS components, vehicle fuel economy testing was performed on the nearly stock (baseline) truck and the TEPS truck. Table 1 illustrates the fuel economy gains produced by the TEPS truck electrification. While the fuel economy results shown in Table 1 do reflect specific test conditions, they show that electrification of accessory hardware can yield significant fuel savings. In this case, the savings equated to a 15 percent reduction in fuel consumption during controlled on-road testing. Truck electrification allows engine shutdown during idle conditions as well as independent on-demand actuation of accessory systems. In some cases, independent actuation may even include lack of operation, a feature not always present in mechanically driven components. This combination of attributes allows significant improvements in system efficiency and the fuel economy improvements demonstrated by the TEPS team...|$|E
