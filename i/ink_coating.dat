50|$|Photocatalyst {{activity}} indicator inks (Paii's) are {{a recent}} {{advance in the}} visual demonstration of photocatalysis and {{the assessment of the}} activity of photocatalyst materials. They are an inexpensive, easy to use and provide a very quick route to demonstrating the presence of a photocatalytic film, even under low levels of UV light. Unlike the photo-oxidative bleaching of methylene blue, they use the underlying semiconductor photocatalyst film to photoreduce the dye (Dox in figure 2), in the <b>ink</b> <b>coating,</b> to another (usually colourless) form, (Dred in figure 2) whilst simultaneously oxidising an easily oxidised organic species, a sacrificial electron donor (SED), such as glycerol, which is also present in the ink. Figure 2 illustrates the basic principles of operation of a Paii when applied to a product that has a thin photocatalyst film coating.|$|E
5000|$|To make {{a relief}} print, the printer {{began with a}} wood block, {{engraved}} {{the image on the}} block by carving out areas that were not to be printed (or inked). A wood block was carved for each primary colours, with the coloured <b>ink</b> <b>coating</b> the areas left in relief. Gascoigne explains that the process required a [...] "master craftsman sit with an original painting {{in front of him and}} work out which areas of the image should be printed in which of the available colours to achieve the desired effect." [...] The printer engraved the image to the finer end grain of the woodblock. For more complicated work the carver worked on the end grain of the wood, and with the use of fine hatchings to the wood that were inked separately achieved the look of blended colours. For the children's book market, which had lower profit margins, the printer would use fewer ink colours, which could be optimised by mixing colours such as blue and yellow to create green.|$|E

30|$|In planar-type solar cells, in {{contrast}} to sensitized ones, charge carrier transport depends on the carrier mobility and diffusion length within the Sb 2 S 3 layer, which are strongly correlated with the morphology, grain size, and crystallinity of the layer. Hence, most research on planar-type solar cells {{has been focused on}} improving the Sb 2 S 3 thin film quality to achieve a large grain size and a high crystallinity by using various deposition techniques. For example, conventional chemical bath deposition (CBD) [16], thermal evaporation (TE) [17], rapid thermal evaporation (RTE) [18, 19], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [20], and nanoparticle <b>ink</b> <b>coating</b> [21] have been applied to fabricate Sb 2 S 3 thin films. Recently, Wang et al. reported a fast chemical approach (FCA) {{that can be used to}} generate very large grain sizes via a one-step spin-coating process and subsequent annealing process using a butyldithiocarbamic acid (BDCA)-based metal-organic precursor solution [22]. Many types of metal oxides or hydroxides can be dissolved in BDCA, which is relatively nontoxic, inexpensive, and thermally degradable, and can be easily synthesized via the reaction of 1 -butylamine (CH 3 (CH 2) 3 NH 2) and carbon disulfide (CS 2) [23].|$|E

In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the catalyst ink, without the metal catalysts, coated membrane (MEA), with the 16 cm 2 active area, were produced. For the proton exchange membrane Nafion- 117 membrane was used. An experimental design (Small Central Composite Design) was done in order to investigate the optimum preparation conditions (such as temperature, pressure and holding time in the hot press) for MEA of PEM electrolyzer. The responses were water vapor permeability and the surface resistance of the catalyst <b>ink</b> <b>coating.</b> The optimum conditions that gave maximum permeability and lowest surface resistance were found at 135 °C of the hot press temperature, 5000 pound of pressure and 3 minute of holding time.

30|$|Drop (Figure  4 (a)), cast (Figure  4 (b)), {{and spray}} (Figure  4 (c)) {{approaches}} have proven, thus far, the fabrication method of choice by many. This is likely {{a direct consequence of}} their low cost and straightforward processing {{rather than any}} direct functional enhancements the fabrication techniques allow for. Drop, cast and spray techniques all require CNT inks. In each case, respectively, these are deposited either by direct dropping of the <b>ink,</b> spin <b>coating</b> or casting of the <b>ink,</b> or spray <b>coating</b> of the <b>ink</b> using a pressurised carrier gas. All these approaches initially require wet processing of the as-grown CNTs and it is this which, commonly to all, limits their usefulness and the consequent performance of the resulting X-ray source. The required high power sonication and vacuum unstable surfactants needed to form the stabilised, homogenous inks results in compromised temporal stability, deleterious hysteresis, and generally degraded emission.|$|R
50|$|Rubber stamping, {{also called}} stamping, is a craft {{in which some}} type of ink made of dye or pigment is applied to an image or pattern that has been , molded, laser {{engraved}} or vulcanized, onto a sheet of rubber. The rubber is often mounted onto a more stable object such as a wood, brick or an acrylic block. Increasingly the vulcanized rubber image with an adhesive foam backing {{is attached to a}} cling vinyl sheet which allows it to be used with an acrylic handle for support. These cling rubber stamps can be stored in a smaller amount of space and typically cost less than the wood mounted versions. They can also be positioned with a greater amount of accuracy due to the stamper's ability to see through the handle being used. Temporary stamps with simple designs can be carved from a potato.The <b>ink</b> <b>coated</b> rubber stamp is pressed onto any type of medium such that the colored image is transferred to the medium. The medium is generally some type of fabric or paper. Other media used are wood, metal, glass, plastic, rock. High volume batik uses liquid wax instead of ink on a metal stamp.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Physics and Astronomy, Washington State UniversityThe photomechanical {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} involving any mechanical property change of a material induced by light exposure. Photomechanical devices {{can be built}} with superior performance over traditional devices and offer versatile control tactics. Previous experiments show that disperse red 1 azobenzene (DR 1) doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) optical fiber has a fast photomechanical response upon asymmetrical 633 nm laser irradiation originating in photoisomerization of the dopants between the cis and trans forms, which causes an elongation of the polymer fiber. In this work, laser light of 355 nm wavelength is used to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} trans to cis photoisomerization process, which should result in length contraction of the DR 1 doped PMMA polymer fiber. A three-point-contact optically-actuated beam controlling tilt mount is made and used as the measurement apparatus to study this process. The photomechanical fiber is observed to elongate upon UV irradiation. Numerical simulations, which take into account the coupled effect between the laser-induced temperature increase and population density change of the dye molecules, show that contraction of the fiber due to direct trans-cis photoisomerization is overwhelmed by elongation due to the photo-thermally-stimulated cis-trans isomerization under high intensity. An <b>ink</b> <b>coated</b> entrance face of the fiber is placed in the measurement tilt mount and is found to exhibit contraction in the fast process under low intensity without sacrificing the good signal to noise ratio enjoyed in the high intensity case.

5000|$|Dot gain {{is caused}} by ink {{spreading}} around halftone dots. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more <b>ink</b> than <b>coated</b> ones, and thus can show more gain. As printing pressure can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called [...] "rimming". Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the fountain solution (in the case of offset printing).

40|$|An {{intelligent}} ink, previously {{shown to}} be capable of rapidly assessing photocatalytic activity, was simply applied via a felt-pen onto a commercially available piece of Activ self-cleaning glass. The ink, comprising of redox dye resazurin and the sacrificial electron donor glycerol within an aqueous hydroxy ethyl cellulose (HEC) polymer media, was photocatalytically degraded in a two-step process. The key initial stage was the photo-reductive conversion of resazurin to resorufin, whereby a colour change from blue to pink occurred. The latter stage was the subsequent photo-reduction of the resorufin, where a slower change from pink to colourless was seen. Red and green components of red-green-blue colour extracted from flat-bed scanner digital images of resazurin <b>ink</b> <b>coated</b> photocatalytic films at intervals during the photocatalysis reaction were inversely proportional to the changes seen via UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and indicative of reaction kinetics. A 3 x 3 grid of intelligent ink was drawn onto a piece of Activ and a glass blank. The photocatalysis reaction was monitored solely by flat-bed digital scanning. Red-green-blue values of respective positions on the grid were extracted using a custom-built program entitled RGB Extractor. The program was capable of extracting a number of 5 x 5 pixel averages of red-green-blue components simultaneously. Allocation of merely three coordinates allowed for the automatic generation of a grid, with scroll-bars controlling the number of positions to be extracted on the grid formed. No significant change in red and green components for any position on the glass blank was observed; however, the Activ film displayed a homogenous photo-reduction of the dye, reaching maxima in red and minima in green components in 23 +/- 3 and 14 +/- 2 min, respectively. A compositionally graded N-doped titania film synthesised in house via a combinatorial APCVD reaction was also photocatalytically tested by this method where 247 positions on a 13 x 19 grid were simultaneously analysed.
