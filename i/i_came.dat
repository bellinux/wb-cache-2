5|$|Mark came up {{with the}} music first, then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up with the words and we fitted it all {{together}} into a melody. That's the way I normally make songs– I write everything in the studio– and it obviously means that producers are very important to me. It's a complete joint effort.|$|E
5|$|When Mary <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the throne, she had Bucer and Fagius tried posthumously for heresy {{as part of}} {{her efforts}} to restore Catholicism in England. Their caskets were disinterred and their remains burned, along with copies of their books. On 22 July 1560, Elizabeth I {{formally}} rehabilitated both reformers. A brass plaque on the floor of Great St Mary's marks the original location of Bucer's grave.|$|E
5000|$|Changing Woman and [...] and {{the younger}} twin, , who was also known as , Child of the Water, now heard {{a voice from the}} east {{chanting}} in reply: With the Slayer of Monsters <b>I</b> <b>come.</b> From the house of the dark stone blades <b>I</b> <b>come.</b> From where the dark stone knives hang <b>I</b> <b>come.</b> Giver of the sacred hoops <b>I</b> <b>come.</b> <b>I</b> <b>come,</b> <b>I</b> <b>come!</b> The dreaded one.Changing Woman said, [...] "It is the voice of your father.

5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So <b>I</b> <b>came</b> into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E

5|$|Long ago, King Childeric <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty {{to go along with}} it. Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors. The enlisted {{men of the}} High Seas Fleet, aware that Germany had lost the war, {{had no interest in}} dying {{for the sake of the}} Navy's honor. When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper had no choice but to disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to an end.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{followed}} a similar format: Dr. Cave's tenancy {{was cut short}} in 1551, when King Edward VI granted the abbey to William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, brother of the former Queen Catherine Parr. Much of the abbey stone was then {{used to create a}} new mansion on the site, for the Marquess. The Marquess only held the abbey for two years: after supporting Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, in 1553, on the accession of Bloody Mary, he was arrested and his lands were confiscated. Mary granted the abbey and mansion to her catholic supporter Edward Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings of Loughborough, however he too fell from favour when Mary's sister Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the throne.|$|E

5|$|On 5 April 1899, {{the ship}} {{participated in the}} {{celebrations}} commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Eckernförde during the First Schleswig War. In May, the I and II Divisions, along with the Reserve Division from the Baltic, went on a major cruise into the Atlantic. On the voyage out, the I Division stopped in Dover and the II Division went into Falmouth to restock their coal supplies. The I Division then joined the II Division at Falmouth on 8 May, and the two units then departed for the Bay of Biscay, arriving at Lisbon on 12 May. There, they met the British Channel Fleet of eight battleships and four armored cruisers. The Portuguese king, Carlos <b>I</b> <b>came</b> aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm to inspect the German flagship. The German fleet then departed for Germany, stopping again in Dover on 24 May. There, they participated in the naval review celebrating Queen Victoria's 80th birthday. The fleet returned to Kiel on 31 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} French troops helped stiffen {{resistance}} to the English, who abandoned Haddington in September 1549 and, {{after the fall of}} Protector Somerset in England, withdrew from Scotland completely. From 1554, Marie of Guise formally took over the regency, maintaining a difficult position, partly by giving limited toleration to Protestant dissent and attempting to diffuse resentment over the continued presence of French troops. When the Protestant Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the throne of England in 1558, the English party and the Protestants found their positions aligned and asked for English military support to expel the French. The arrival of English troops, and particularly the English fleet, in 1560, led to the besieging of the French forces in Leith, which fell in July. By this point Mary of Guise had died and French and English troops both withdrew under the Treaty of Edinburgh, leaving the young queen in France, but pro-English and Protestant parties in the ascendant.|$|E

25|$|In December 2013 in a blog {{article for}} The Spectator website {{published}} shortly after Nelson Mandela died, Rod Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: But for Christ's sake BBC, {{give it a}} bloody break for five minutes, will you?

That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm. He also wrote:Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to the conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill. I think <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E
