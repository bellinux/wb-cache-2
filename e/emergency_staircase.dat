50|$|The shaft is a {{concrete}} structure about 315 m high {{from the ground}} floor. Six elevators in three different sides of the shaft are used to transfer the visitors {{to the head of}} the tower at the speed of 7 m/s, besides an <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase</b> at the fourth side.|$|E
50|$|The {{backside}} {{of the building}} (containing the <b>emergency</b> <b>staircases)</b> and Cambie Street was filmed during the street scenes of The Neverending Story. It {{can be seen from}} Water Street.|$|R
50|$|At the base, the {{building}} stands on columns which {{act as an}} entrance for a vast post-modern hall. They are two stories high and separate {{the street from the}} nine-meter (30 ft) high lobby. Because the elevators and <b>emergency</b> <b>staircases</b> are located to the rear of {{the building}}, this area appears hollow.|$|R
50|$|The story {{height of}} the {{standard}} floors is 4.2 m, with a floor area of 1,900 square meters. The highrise is founded on a 3400 m² reinforced concrete slab that is 4.0 m thick. In plan view, the tower consists of two large, rounded squares which are arranged with a longitudinal offset of several meters. In the resulting niches on each side, two elongated rounded rectangles are located, housing the lifts and <b>emergency</b> <b>staircases.</b> The theme of the rounded corners is repeated throughout the building, for example in the windows and pillars, and information signs on the inside.|$|R

The group is the project of guitarist Jojo Hiroshige (JOJO広重), its one constant member, who is head and owner of the Osaka-based Alchemy Records. Other regulars include Jojo's wife Junko and Toshiji Mikawa (also of Incapacitants).|$|E
50|$|A special {{attraction}} is the flying saucer-shaped structure housing a restaurant, which since 2005 {{has been called}} UFO (previously, Bystrica), on the bridge's 84.6 m pylon. The restaurant is reached using an elevator located in the east pillar, and offers a good view over Bratislava. The west pillar houses an <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase</b> with 430 stairs. Nový Most has four lanes for motor traffic on the upper level and lanes for bicycles and pedestrians on the lower level.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{building}} {{was said to have}} played a part in the high death toll. The two internal staircases were designed for use in case of lift failures and not as fire exits, and filled with smoke during the fire, acting as chimneys. The building had no external <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase.</b> The walls between the hotel rooms were not sufficiently fire resistant, hastening the spread of the blaze. The tower lacked many other safety features, including battery-operated exit lights.|$|E

[...] He took a day job as a custodian at the World Trade Center. The article {{goes on to say}} that Rodriguez's show business aspirations fell by the wayside when his responsibilities for cleaning the office of Governor Mario Cuomo at the WTC expanded to include organizing Governor Cuomo's press conferences, and that after Cuomo left office in 1994, Rodriguez was reassigned to cleaning the windowless <b>emergency</b> <b>staircases</b> of the North Tower, where he remained until September 11, 2001.|$|R
50|$|The QEH {{auditorium}} is {{a separate}} building from the foyer. The auditorium building is aligned with the rear of its stage parallel to Waterloo Bridge and the seating area cantilevered out towards the foyer, supported by a massive column containing the <b>emergency</b> escape <b>staircases</b> at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{a rise in}} {{the local}} {{population}} due to new residential developments, particularly on Ellesmere Street, the stop's <b>emergency</b> exit <b>staircase</b> to the street was converted into a full passenger entrance/exit, which opened on 3 September 2005. There are plans to relocate the entrance as part of the [...] "Cornbrook Hub" [...] redevelopment.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 15 December 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&BR, now the Piccadilly line). When opened, the {{platforms}} were accessed {{in the standard}} manner by four lifts and an <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase</b> connecting to parallel passageways and bridges to midway along the platforms. The original station building designed by Leslie Green was located on Brompton Road a short distance west of its junction with Knightsbridge and Sloane Street. A rear entrance was located on Basil Street.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} 142 ft tall, giving a drop {{distance}} {{for the lead}} shot from the crucible room of 120 ft. The crucible room has a diameter of 24 ft and originally housed a gas fired cast iron cauldron, for melting the lead ingots. A lift provided access to the crucible room for both personnel and ingots, along with an <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase.</b> The lead shot fell into a tank of cooling water {{at the foot of}} the tower, and were transferred by a conveyor belt to hoppers in the roof of the processing building.|$|E

5|$|Tunnelling {{began in}} September 1903. Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four lifts and an <b>emergency</b> spiral <b>staircase</b> in a separate shaft.|$|R
5000|$|It has 15 lifts (elevators) {{high speed}} {{moving at a}} speed of 6.2 meters per second, in {{addition}} to pressurized <b>emergency</b> 2 <b>staircases,</b> automatic handler units of air conditioning, mechanical, electrical and telecommunications on each floor. Each plant floor has an average area of 1,750 to 1.825 meters square, free of columns with a height of each floor of 4.12 m. The total area of the building is 61,000 m² of space rooms.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, the {{original}} lifts between {{the second and}} third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new <b>emergency</b> <b>staircases</b> were installed, replacing {{the original}} spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant. The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system. A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.|$|R
50|$|Doreen Tower is a {{building}} complex centered in Gulshan Thana of Dhaka. The 25-story building trade tower is topped-out with {{a height of}} 92 m, and {{will be one of}} the tallest buildings in Bangladesh. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), the public authority responsible for overseeing urban development in Dhaka, approved the building plans in January 1998. Their approval came despite the fact that the building is twice the height allowed for the area, does not have the required setback, provides less than a third of the required parking, and lacks mandatory fire safety measures, including a fire-protected <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase,</b> fire fighting lift, and shelter space.|$|E
50|$|Since 1995, the {{building}} has again been the site of university-level instruction, {{in the form of}} the Escuela Universitaria. This required a comprehensive restoration. On the one hand, {{the building}} was renovated to resemble as closely as possible its historical appearance; on the other hand, electricity, sanitary facilities, and climatization were brought up to modern standards. The wooden portions of the building, especially the elaborate ceilings, were painstakingly restored, as was the tilework on the towers. One new <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase</b> was added at the corner of the courtyard opposite the historic staircase; an emergency exit was added at the back. An elevator was also added, adjacent to the new staircase.|$|E
5000|$|The lift is {{supported}} by electric traction motor, using a VVVF regulated-mechanism, supported by a robust metal frame. The concrete lift includes a communication system between ticketbooth and machine rooms, in addition to vertical chamber, constructed of reinforced concrete, semi-open with four emergency accesses (in addition to the principal accesses). It includes a copper roof with a [...] "sandwiched" [...] crawler panel and lacquered polyurethane, allowing light through translucent, honeycombed polycarbonate sheet, that faces the bank. The <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase</b> consist of a structure with guardrails in carbon steel, steel plate steps and a lower security door in steel tube, similar to the ladder structure.|$|E
500|$|Beacon Hill Station was {{designed}} by architectural firm Otak and built by {{a joint venture between}} engineering firms Hatch Mott MacDonald and Jacobs Engineering Group. The station building houses entrances to four high-speed elevators that travel [...] to platform level in 20 seconds. Beacon Hill's [...] split island platform is located between the two Beacon Hill Tunnel tubes, with a small cross-tunnel passageway between the two sections of the platform. It serves Central Link's two tracks; the northbound tracks serves trains to University of Washington station, while the southbound tracks serves trains to Angle Lake station. As with all Link stations, electronic information signs above the platform offer real-time information about train arrivals and service alerts, in addition to announcements over an intercom. Beacon Hill's bus stops are located south of the station building on Beacon Avenue, with the northbound stop located adjacent to the station and the southbound stop accessible via a signaled crosswalk. The station does not include public parking, but is within walking distance of several private parking lots that require payment. ORCA card vending machines are located outside the station building, along with bicycle lockers and a bicycle cage with space for 48 bicycles. <b>Emergency</b> <b>staircases</b> and the ventilation shaft are capped by the east headhouse, located behind the station building and plaza on South Lander Street.|$|R
500|$|The {{tunneling}} {{resulted in}} [...] of earthwork, {{most of which}} {{was used for the}} expansion of the Port of Drammen. It was transported away from the tunnel with up to 12 truckloads per hour. The first breakthrough took place on 5 June 2008. On 19 October 2008, there was a ground failure at a storage area of earthwork. This caused a land slip which pressed up earthwork nearby at Gjønnes Station on the Kolsås Line of the Oslo Metro; a [...] long section of one platform and track was pressed up , resulting in the other track lying on its side. Because of changes to European Union regulations after planning of the project, three extra <b>emergency</b> <b>staircases</b> had to be installed in late 2009. The final breakthrough in the tunnel occurred on 26 July 2009. The tunneling took place under the groundwater level. To avoid similar problems which occurred during the construction of the Romerike Tunnel, where massive leaks took a year to fix, several test bores were made in the area to measure the groundwater level. Any indications of a change would immediately be automatically communicated to the on-site geologists, who would be able to act accordingly. The system also automatically pumped water into the affected areas to compensate for any leaks until they could be fixed.|$|R

5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an <b>emergency</b> spiral <b>staircase</b> in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|R
50|$|Designed by {{architect}} Leslie Green {{the station}} was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway. Located at the junction of Heath Street and Hampstead High Street, the name Heath Street was proposed for the station before opening: indeed, the original tiled station signs on the platform walls still read Heath Street. Hampstead is on a steep hill and the station platforms are the deepest on the London Underground network, at 58.5 m below ground level. It has the deepest lift shaft on the Underground at 55 m which houses high-speed lifts. They were previously Otis lifts, but were modernised by Wadsworth lifts, & again in 2014 by small generic lift installer Accord. There is also a spiral <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase</b> of over 320 steps.|$|E

50|$|At 127 m, the Glasgow Tower is {{currently}} the tallest tower in Scotland, and since late 2015 following the demolition of both the Red Road Flats and the Bluevale and Whitevale Towers the structure is now the tallest in all of Glasgow. It holds a Guinness World Record for being the tallest tower {{in the world in}} which the whole structure is capable of rotating 360 degrees. The whole structure rests upon a 65 cm thrust bearing, and is connected to its foundations by two concentric rings and shock absorbers. The thrust bearing itself rests in a 15 m caisson. This is to allow the building to rotate under computer control to face into the wind. The tower has two lifts each with a 12-person capacity, but for reasons of comfort, this is normally limited to 6 guests plus a single member of staff. There is also an <b>emergency</b> <b>staircase,</b> comprising 523 stairs from the Cabin level to the Podium.|$|E
50|$|Covent Garden {{station is}} one of the few {{stations}} in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs and often becomes congested because of the Covent Garden area's popularity with tourists. To control congestion on Saturday afternoons, when the surrounding shopping areas are at their busiest, the station was previously exit-only to avoid the risk of dangerous overcrowding of the platforms, but following replacement of the lifts, this restriction was lifted. There are four lifts that give access to street level, although a final flight of stairs from the lifts to the platforms means that the station is wheelchair-inaccessible. Alternatively, there is an <b>emergency</b> spiral <b>staircase</b> of 193 steps (the equivalent to a 15-storey building).|$|R
