This result moderates the risk of tacit collusion when competitors can <b>freely</b> <b>negotiate</b> their access charges. We also analyze the case of a merger between the two networks and give conditions under which the merger can be welfare improving. ...|$|R

Under ECL laws, collecting societies negotiate ECL agreements on behalf of their members, as well as non-members because ECL laws allow collecting societies to enter into ECL agreements on behalf of all rights owners of the category of rightsholder the collecting society represents. Once the collecting society and the user, such as a TV broadcaster, have negotiated an ECL agreement, it comes into force and covers only the types of copyrighted works for uses specified in the ECL licence.|$|R

The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws. Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped {{that they would be}} upheld under the precedent of Muller v.

From a normative perspective, Williamson argues that this partition is efficient {{with respect to the}} economizing logic of individuals. However, we show that, actually, the American law of labour relationships is based on legal pluralism and that the model of private ordering, which has been less and less used since the 1980 s, has strong limitations. In this context, the analysis of the public ordering/private ordering framework that Williamson proposes is of little interest...|$|R
40|$|The gas dual-pricing {{system in}} Russia {{has been a}} highly {{contentious}} issue {{in the context of}} the ongoing negotiations on the accession of Russia to the WTO.

In the view of the European Union and other WTO Members such a policy is not permitted under WTO disciplines, while Russia persists in viewing the existing dual-pricing system as WTO consistent. The article pursues a legal assessment of the issue, demonstrating that although the Russian gas pricing system can be considered a subsidy, this subsidy is non-actionable under the WTO rules. This means that Russia has merit in its attempt to keep the gas pricing system in place after it accedes to the WTO. ...|$|R
