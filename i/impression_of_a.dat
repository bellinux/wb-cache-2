5|$|Because {{the south}} {{transept}} {{is similar in}} dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15thcentury Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are {{the work of the}} restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.|$|E
5|$|Four main {{proposals}} were suggested {{for the new}} fixed link. One involved a four-lane subsea tunnel, one involved building a second, two-lane bridge immediately adjacent to the current one, which would give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single bridge, another involved a new four-lane bridge slightly to the south, and the last involved a new bridge considerably further to the south, which would connect to County Road 557.|$|E

5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. The color is used for emotional impact; black and white (toned amber) represents the world of the white man; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
5|$|The final {{versions}} of the sonatas convey the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828. The sonatas were labeled Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of}} the last folio of the third sonata the date September 26. As compared to the sketches, the final versions are written much more neatly and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|E
5|$|The missile silo {{used for}} the episode's climactic scene was {{incomplete}} when the scene was filmed, as the crew {{did not have enough}} time or money left to complete the set. The crew built the incomplete silo on a sound stage around a completed spacecraft prop, and were able to digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors to give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally, with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine to give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fast winter's journey {{by means of the}} troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.|$|E
5|$|This new {{constructional}} technique allowed Gaudí {{to achieve}} his greatest architectural goal; to perfect and go beyond Gothic style. The hyperboloid vaults have their centre where Gothic vaults had their keystone, and the hyperboloid allows for a hole in this space to let natural light in. In the intersection between vaults, where Gothic vaults have ribs, the hyperboloid allows for holes as well, which Gaudí employed to give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> starry sky.|$|E
5|$|Umar, {{apparently}} {{wanting to}} defeat the Byzantines first, employed the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided {{that they had no}} choice but to attack. The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> continuous stream of reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They {{are made up of}} dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|Bowie studied art, {{music and}} design, {{including}} layout and typesetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, {{introduced him to}} modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother {{to give him a}} Grafton saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician. Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil, which gave a false <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> change in the iris' colour. Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally {{carved out of the}} original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its carved wooden fittings of many different periods.|$|E

5|$|In August {{the brigade}} formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the brigade took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which {{were part of a}} larger {{deception}} force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor. They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west. The regiment was heavily involved in the deception, carrying out offensive patrolling, constructing dummy camps, and moving back and forwards behind the lines to give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much larger force than was actually present.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua's Masonic ties as Master of Lodge Le Progres de L'Oceanie {{would give}} him a global brotherhood in his travels. He and his chosen companions boarded the {{steamship}} City of Sydney at 6:30a.m., January 20, bound for San Francisco. As the King made his way onto the ship, many in the crowd at the dock reached out to touch him. Major George W. Macfarlane, his aide-de-camp, would accompany them as far as California. The King traveled as Aliʻi Kalākaua and as Prince Kalākaua, rather than in his capacity as head of state. The intent was to give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> personal vacation, thereby avoiding the large costly retinue required for official business. The Royal Hawaiian Band, the Hawaiian army, and a large contingent of well-wishers bid them farewell as the City of Sydney sailed out.|$|E
5|$|The bull {{appears to}} have had a sacred role in a number of Celtic cults. The animal was viewed {{positively}} by the Celts as an image of fertility and abundance; one tribe, the Taurini, even adopted the bull's name. It is unknown how it came to be associated with bodies of water {{in the form of the}} water bull, but historian and symbologist Charles Milton Smith has suggested that such mythological creatures might originate with the water spouts that can form over the surface of Scottish lochs, which can give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> living form as they move across the water.|$|E

5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E
5|$|The next {{months were}} spent {{training}} and refitting, until August when the brigade formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward {{to form the}} left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the regiment took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which {{were part of a}} larger deception force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor.

5|$|The opening scene, set at {{the closing}} {{ceremony}} of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC. Elland Road {{was used for the}} speech elements of the prince stammering his way through his first public address, and Odsal Stadium was selected because of the resemblance of its curved ends to Wembley Stadium in 1925. The crew had access to the stadium only at 10pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed to give the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects.|$|E
