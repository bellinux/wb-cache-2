50|$|The {{initiative}} {{to build a}} church in Skotfoss was taken by Gustav Fangel Smidt, who managed the nearby Skotfoss Bruk paper mill. At the time, the townspeople of Skotfoss and Dalsbygda had to travel many miles west {{along the banks of}} Norsjø to Melum Church in order to attend mass. The founders of Union Co. (later the Norske Skog Union), who owned Skotfoss Bruk, agreed to donate 1,000 kroner each towards the construction of the new church, and the remaining 38,000 of the 42,000 kroner cost was split between wholesaler Thor Eger and Rittmester Heftye. The church's site, located on Sandåsen near the entrance to Løveid Canal, was donated by {{the board of directors of}} the Norsjø-Skien Canal.

50|$|The North British belatedly {{set about}} {{improving}} and expanding Waverley station. This {{was not easy}} because of the constrained location in a high amenity area, and hostility to railway encroachment was at a high level. Nonetheless, on 5 July 1891 the North British obtained Parliamentary powers to quadruple the line from Corstorphine (that is, Saughton Junction) {{in the west to}} Waverley, and from Waverley to Abbeyhill in the east. This involved duplicating the three tunnel sections. In addition Waverley station itself was much expanded, and when the work was completed in 1900 it covered 23 acres and had nineteen platforms. North Bridge was reconstructed and incorporated into the station structure; one-third of the cost was borne by the North British Railway, and the whole scheme at Waverley cost £1.5 million. The station was architecturally magnificent, although the baroque stone and <b>joinery</b> <b>work</b> in the booking hall was somewhat oppressive, and the pedestrian access from the street was still narrow and bleak.|$|E

5000|$|In 1914, {{the bank}} {{embarked}} on a substantial reconstruction of the building {{to the design of}} FH Faircloth. The Maryborough Chronicle (16 May 1914) reported that the original building would [...] "form the base or skeleton of improvements and alterations that will completely transform the appearance of the old structure ..." [...] A later article (15 June 1915) described the work as [...] "dismantling and re-erection". The reconstructed building occupied the same area as the previous building and the upper level window openings were located in the same positions.The Chronicle described the completed building as follows:"The main building has a frontage of 33 feet (10 m) to the main street, with a depth of 60 feet (9 m) to Richmond Street, all of the work being done in cement on concrete foundations. The bricks used for the street frontages are of a reddish colour with white [...] "tuck" [...] points, while the sand-stone coloured entablature, mouldings and embellishments form a fine set off to the effective looking Corinthian columns set on solid pedestals and extending to the full height of the two storeys, the extremities of the columns themselves being surmounted with beautiful entablatures and enriched cornice, further relieved with medallions and mouldings. Artistic effect is given in a lesser order in the Ionic style introduced on the line of the first floor, with small cornice and entablature butting into Corinthian columns and supported by Ionic columns and pilasters. The main entrance is attractively treated with Ionic columns and arched pediments whilst the windows on the first floor are also nicely relieved in fine architectural work. To save space the main entrance doors slide into recesses in the brick. Considerable artistic attention has been given to the general furnishing of the inside of the building, the walls being all finished in King's cement with appropriate colourings and the ceilings of stamped steel with very effective designs. The large banking chamber just inside the main entrance door facing Kent Street, has a length of 42 feet (12.8 m), and a width of 27 feet (8 m). The floor is tile covered, picked out in fine designs, whilst a beautiful semi-circular counter and partitions have been installed, the <b>joinery</b> <b>work</b> having been done by Messrs. James Fairlie and Sons. The effect in the room is enhanced by the antique copper gas pendants fitted up by plumbing sub-contractor, Mr W Wells. On the right hand side of the main door, connected with the banking chamber, is the manager's office, with a door leading therefrom to the chief office further back. Behind the banking chamber are the strong room and stationary room, with a passage leading to the clerks' entrance. On the Bungalow (south eastern) side is the entrance hall and a stairway leading to the upper storey. From the entrance hall access is gained to a large dining hall. The rest of the residential portion of the building is nicely furnished and well laid out with fine balconies on the eastern side and {{at the back of the}} premises." [...] The main contractor was NC Steffensen who had tendered to complete the work at a cost of £2997. The bank moved into the new premises on 14 June 1915.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{thick layer}} of {{carbonised}} seeds was encountered in an 11 th century a. d. room situated in the seigneurial part of the village of La Gravette. This paper presents the first results of charcoal and seed analyses which give information on the food products stored in the granary and on their arrangement there. Triticum aestivum/durum/turgidum {{was by far the}} most important stored crop, while Avena sp., then Hordeum vulgare, Secale cereale, Triticum monococcum and Vitis vinifera were secondary. Weeds were poorly represented. Charcoals were dominated by deciduous Quercus sp., and 11 additional wood taxa were recorded, including especially Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus sp., Rosaceae, Corylus avellana, Acer campestre and Ulmus sp. According to the charcoal distribution, Quercus and Fagus were probably building materials while most of other taxa would have been used for basketry, wattling or <b>joinery</b> <b>work.</b> In {{the western part of the}} granary, naked wheat was stored in bulk. In the eastern part, various crops (at least naked wheat, barley, rye, oat and grape) were stored in small amounts, most of which were probably separated by light wooden structures. The cereal crops had largely been processed and cleaned. The stored products probably represent taxes paid to the lord who owned the granary...|$|E
40|$|The town of Hildesheim in the German {{state of}} Lower Saxony is {{generally}} accepted {{to have been}} home to a uniquely recognizable and contradictory assembly of early-sixteenth-century sculpture executed in a highly distinctive carving style {{that appears to have}} emerged suddenly in the region today defined as southern Lower Saxony, and vanished as imperceptibly forty years later. Its surviving examples range from exceptional to mediocre, and are found scattered across the breadth of Northern Germany, with some also in notable collections abroad. A small number of these sculptures have traditionally been associated with the locally documented master Hinrick Stavoer. Based upon a signature on a retable located in the town of Enger in Westfalia, Stavoer’s oeuvre has been judged by scholarship to represent competent <b>joinery</b> <b>work</b> with little artistic flair or merit. Consequently, Stavoer was excluded from the reconstructions of a more meritorious sculpture production, and relocated to the neighbouring town of Brunswick. The more sophisticated works from Hildesheim were divided amongst several autonomous workshops, each presided over by an anonymous master who all orientated their own outputs on the dominant artistic personality of the day, the equally anonymous Master of St. Benedict. The result is a production that is characterized by its remarkable homogeneity and interchangeability. The almost complete absence of secure provenance, coupled with a connoisseurship typified by prevailing contemporary autocratic traditions of scholarship, have created a de-contextualized and de-constructed art history that has neglected to consider the much greater number of less sophisticated but historically equally significant works. Taking the historic attributions to Hinrick Stavoer and the known primary evidence relating to him as its departure point, this thesis revisits the existing precepts of Hildesheim sculpture. It successfully challenges its long-held assumptions, and presents a new basis for our understanding of early-sixteenth-century sculpture from southern Lower Saxony...|$|E

The Whiteinch Railway joined the Stobcross line near Crow Road; the junction was named Whiteinch Junction and the line opened on 29 October 1874.

At a large number of its own power stations, situated on Svartälven and its tributaries, the company produced electrical energy which was widely distributed to its own works and outside customers. The company also grew timber on a large scale, and an extensive private railway system runs right through the company's forests which cover several hundred thousand acres in Hällefors and surrounding municipalities.

40|$|Pronounced {{increase}} in construction activities in Tanzania has a corresponding utilization of wood products. This {{adds to the}} already aggravated situation by wood harvest for fuel; manufacturing and forest clearance for agricultural purposes. In most cases exploitation of wood is done to fulfil the immediate social and economic gains while paying minimum attention to the extended environmental ramifications. Among other aspects, the industry is characterized by use of wood harvested from sensitive environments like mangrove forests, for temporary structures such as scaffolds and formworks. On the other hand, high quality timber is used for relatively undeserving <b>joinery</b> <b>works.</b> Worse still, when the temporary structures are demolished the wood end up in cooking stoves as fuel while they could be reused or recycled for construction purposes.
