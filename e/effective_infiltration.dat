30|$|Seropan is a {{perennial}} river with an all-season discharge of Q ≥  0.5  m 3 /s despite the extended dry season without <b>effective</b> rainwater <b>infiltration.</b> The base flow in Seropan in February 2012 {{is characterized by}} an EC of 506  µS/cm which is about equal to the EC during dry season (data not shown). Because EC in karst systems is mainly controlled by the calcium-carbonate equilibrium (Fournier et al. 2007; Perrin et al. 2007), the constant and about 20 times higher EC compared to precipitation (20 – 30  µS/cm) indicates that base flow is continuously recharged by a water mass with sufficient long residence time in the limestone that allows equilibration with calcite (Hess and White 1988). This assumption {{is supported by a}} SICc of around 0 in Seropan River water during dry season 2009 and the weak rainy season in 2010 (Table  1). This storage component is characterized by a slow and diffusive matrix flow and recharged itself through diffusive surface water infiltration via epikarst or the vadose zone. Recharge to Seropan River from this storage component dominates during low water periods and is responsible for the year-round water flow also during dry season. Similar conditions of karst aquifers in low water periods were described for the Sierra de las Nieves aquifer in southern Spain by Baena et al. (2009).|$|R

This parameter usually varies with respect to lithology {{and the extent of}} precipitation in the investigated area. The average <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration,</b> expressed in millimeters/year, was directly computed by dividing the volume of water discharged on average from a hydrogeological basin by the extent of its recharge area. This method does not directly depend on the extent of precipitation, and therefore it is not biased by uncertainty in that value. <b>Effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> was assessed for 15 hydrogeological units and ranges from 200 mm/year to 475 mm/year.

The closing of the groundwater budget equation and the estimate of the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> are supported by the data of groundwater drainage from tunnels bored for the High Speed railway connection between Florence and Bologna. The comparison between the surface hydrological regime of springs and creeks, the discharge monitoring of the tunnel and the effects on the environmental flows of the forced drainage, has put in evidence either a higher than expected value of the coefficient of <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration,</b> considered as the ratio between <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> in the watershed and effective rainfall, or {{the importance of the}} interflow in the determination of the runoff coming out from the watershed.

In the paper a methodology to estimate the dynamic resource from the analysis of the recession curve of creeks and springs and to derive the environmental flow of a creek, both with the availability of few discharge data, is presented.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the active recharge of karst aquifers is an important tool to estimate the groundwater resource availability in these complex hydrogeological systems, characterized by spatial and temporal variability of many hydrogeological factors, involved in groundwater flow. As a matter of fact, the rate of recharge is a key aspect for sustainable exploitation and management of these groundwater resources, as they represent {{one of the most}} important fresh-water supplies for human life and economic activities. This paper presents the results of the inverse hydrogeological water budget method application in the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring, Central Italy, to evaluate the average annual groundwater recharge (i. e. the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration),</b> supported by an open source GIS. This carbonate aquifer is {{one of the most important}} of Central Italy and Pertuso Spring is the main outlet of this karst system with an average rate of about 1. 7 m 3 /s. The study area lies in the Upper Valley of the Aniene River, in the south-east part of Latium Region, and is spread for about 50 km 2. Calculation of the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> was based on mean annual rainfall data, collected over 20 years (1992 - 2012), evapotranspiration and on hydrogeological settings of outcropping rocks, used for setting up potential infiltration coefficients. The inverse hydrogeological water balance has been applied to the study area, discretized in grid cells (EFQ), 6. 25 Ha each one. The results of the inverse hydrogeological water balance method applied to the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring show an annual recharge of about 45 Mm 3 /year. The <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> map shows that the highest values are related to the presence of karstified Cretaceous limestone, mainly outcropping in the north-east part of the basin. On the contrary, lower values of <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> are generally due to the lower permeability, which characterizes the rest of the area (Triassic crystal dolomites, pudding stones and conglomerates). Results show that the annual active recharge of this karst aquifer (45 Mm 3 /year) is greater than the depletion volume of water coming from Pertuso Spring (25 Mm 3 /year).

40|$|Abstract: During {{the spring}} thaw in eastern Siberia, melt water {{sometimes}} causes avalanches and spring floods in mountain taiga permafrost regions. Thus, {{it is important}} to understand the spring runoffgeneration in the region. We analyzed data for the Mogot experimental watershed, which is located in this region and was the site of intensive observations by the State Hydrological Institute for 10 years from 1976 to 1985. The spring runoff ratio was smaller than the annual ratio, and the variation in the spring runoff ratio was larger than that in the annual ratio. This demonstrated that spring runoff is generated by a different mechanism. The variation in the spring runoff ratio depended on the maximum snow water equivalent and fall soil moisture. Furthermore, the <b>effective</b> parameters determining <b>infiltration</b> into frozen soil were soil temperature and the duration of the thaw. To evaluate snow ablation, sublimation is also important. The estimated sublimation from snowcover was significant and amounted to nearly 11. 6 mmlmonth in April...|$|R

30|$|To date, many {{authors have}} studied the {{characteristics}} of root channels or macropores. Although natural soil pore structures may seem irregular, if examined in detail, {{it is clear that}} their structures develop in an orderly manner. In macro-porous soils, the solute infiltration region drastically changes when the water content and boundary conditions for infiltration change (Mori et al. [1999 a], [1999 b], [2001]). For example, when a soil column was saturated (suction[*]=[*] 0 kPa) water was preferentially introduced into macropores (Mori et al. [1999 a]). Additionally, when the infiltration velocity was maintained at 1 / 10 of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the matric potential at the matrix was maintained at − 3 kPa, (empty) macropore bypass flow disappeared and solutes were distributed throughout the whole soil body (Mori and Higashi [2009]). Therefore, artificial macropores were created to facilitate <b>effective</b> vertical <b>infiltration.</b> However, empty artificial macropores were found to clog easily, which prevents infiltration from continuing for prolonged periods (Mori and Hirai [2014]). Subsequently, thin section observations showed that natural macropore walls were coated with clay, organic matter, and natural polymers (Mori et al. [1999 b]) and that since empty artificial macropores do not have these coatings, they are easily prone to clogging and collapse. Such bio-clogging was avoided when artificial macropores were filled with fibrous material, and solutes were successfully transported into the soil profile over prolonged periods (Mori and Hirai [2014]). More specifically, the fiber-filled macropore structure permitted vertical infiltration, while the micropore or matrix facilitated solute distribution into the soil body, thereby achieving effective bioremediation (Mori and Hirai [2014]).|$|R

However, most models used to compute karst hydrosystem recharge rely on simplistic formulations of evapotranspiration (ET) that do not account for vegetation functioning.

These landslides, mostly classifiable as earthflows, generally exhibit continuous slow movements, with temporary increases of velocity controlled both by groundwater and rainfall regime. Although {{the relationship between}} precipitation, groundwater flow and displacement rate is evident, its quantitative description remains problematic. We use piezometric and slope movement continuous monitoring to investigate the groundwater flow system {{in the vicinity of}} the contact between clay shales and overlying more permeable units, where the village of Lizzano in Belvedere is located. Our aim is to describe the groundwater flow and its relation to slope deformation in order to simulate the effect of possible drainage measures both on piezometric levels and expected displacement rates. Timing and magnitude of piezometric responses at different depths are related to observed deformations and used to calibrate a transient 3 D groundwater flow model. Groundwater modeling validates the conceptual hydrogeological scheme and allows simulation of the impact of surface and deep drainages on piezometric levels. Results indicate that horizontal drains are more <b>effective</b> than <b>infiltration</b> reduction measures, both in terms of drawdown and time effectiveness of action.

The {{success or failure}} of GIS-based IEOF simulation and visualization resides initially with the georeference system used. Cartographers have long complained about the poor quality of the output from GIS, which today is generally due not to limitations of the GIS itself but instead to a lack of understanding of cartographic principles among hydrologists and environmentalists. Implementation of soft geo-objects representing flow elements such as streams, mudflows, and runoff provides better dynamic visualization in terms of velocity and direction. Inclusion of volumetric overland flow would help in determining the volume of runoff that hits the flood-plain areas, estimating channel flow capacity, and routing and diversions to reduce effects from flooding. With rapid urbanization, industrialization, and climate change, historical runoff and infiltration rates would provide an improper guide for future enhanced visualization of the current 2 D land use surface. This study aims to visualize the influence of georeferencing on IEOF simulation when represented by volumetric soft geo-objects within a 3 D environment, which is driven by the physically based Green-Ampt method. Visualization is analyzed by focusing on infiltration and overland flow processes using the conformal-based Malaysian Rectified Skew Orthomorphic (MRSO) and the equidistant-based Cassini-Soldner projection. Appropriate usage of a georeferencing system to visualize 3 D dynamic IEOF simulation may see high demand from civil engineers, environmentalists, town planners, geologists, and meteorologists as a basis for producing scientific results in flood management control, sustainability for long-term development purposes, stream restoration, rehabilitation, and hydrologic impact assessment...|$|R

Hybrid photovoltaic (h-PV) devices composed of metal oxide-organic pairings are currently limited by ineffective charge transfer between the materials and by poor transport of free charge out of the active layer. Control of interfacial properties, and the structure and morphology of each component is key to device optimisation. In this thesis, ZnO nanorods are paired with the photoactive polymer, poly 3 -hexlythiophene (P 3 HT) with two areas studied: i) nanorod alignment to aid polymer infiltration, and ii) elucidating optimum polymer processing conditions to prepare efficient devices. Aligned nanorods are synthesised from ZnO coated substrates by a hydrothermal method.

The site is located in the Province of Vicenza and formerly was a chrome-plating plant. The subsoil consists predominantly of gravelly deposits with a thickness of at least one hundred meters. An unconfined aquifer is present with water table at about 23 m depth bgl. During the seven years of monitoring (2008 - 2014), the fluctuation of groundwater level was more than 6 m; hydraulic conductivity is about 1. 0 E- 03 m/s and groundwater seepage velocity about 12 m/day. At the area of the source of contamination, the unsaturated soil is contaminated by hexavalent chromium throughout the thickness: concentrations range from 200 to 500 mg/kg. At the bottom of zone of groundwater level fluctuation, the hexavalent chromium concentration decreases to below the detection limit.

40|$|Although {{individuals}} {{spend the}} majority of their time indoors, most epidemiological studies estimate personal air pollution exposures based on outdoor levels. This almost certainly results in exposure misclassification as pollutant infiltration varies between homes. However, it is often not possible to collect detailed measures of infiltration for individual homes in large-scale epidemiological studies and thus there is currently a need to develop models {{that can be used to}} predict these values. To address this need, we examined infiltration of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and identified determinants of infiltration for 46 residential homes in Toronto, Canada. Infiltration was estimated using the indoor/outdoor sulphur ratio and information on hypothesized predictors of infiltration were collected using questionnaires and publicly available databases. Multiple linear regression was used to develop the models. Mean infiltration was 0. 52 ± 0. 21 with no significant difference across heating and non-heating seasons. Predictors of infiltration were air exchange, presence of central air conditioning, and forced air heating. These variables accounted for 38 % of the variability in infiltration. Without air exchange, the model accounted for 26 % of the variability. <b>Effective</b> modelling of <b>infiltration</b> in individual homes remains difficult, although key variables such as use of central air conditioning show potential as an easily attainable indicator of infiltration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{kinetics}} of {{infiltration of}} 60 Sn 40 Pb- 10 Ag molten solid lubricants into the TiC-Fe-Cr-W-Mo-V ordered porous sintering body were studied and the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> model {{which was used}} to analysis the kinetics of infiltration was established. The infiltration process was simulated by finite element method. The result showed that the main influence factors on the infiltration quality were the pressure,the temperature and the time. The high temperature self-lubrication composite material is widely used in many fields (Aerospace aviation metallurgy),for it has low of the friction, good of the wear resistance,and high of the bearing capacity. Many scholars have research on the method to manufacture the self-lubrication composite. The self-lubrication composite are generally prepared by high temperature sintering...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} intrinsic vulnerability assessment of the aquifer in the Rižana spring chatcment by the method SINTACS. It is parametric method that takes into consideration seven parameters (depth to ground water, <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> action, unsaturatedzone attenuation capacity, soil/overburden attenuation capacity, hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer, hydraulic conductivity range of aquifer, hydrologic role of the topographic slope). Parameters are presented in grid information layers that wereelaborated {{on the basis of}} interpretation and GIS processing of geological, hydrogeological,speleological, topographical, meteorological and pedological data. According to the parametersimportance for vulnerability assessment, a multiplier (importance weight) was assigned to each parameter. Final map of vulnerability is a result of overlaying (summing) of weighted information layers (parameters) and shows the catchment area of the Rižanaspring subdivided into six vulnerability classes...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to find out}} correlation between released groundwater volume and groundwater level and salinity degradation {{as well as to}} find <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> holes formation for groundwater augmentation. It belongs to field experimental research. This study concludes some concerns, they are: (1) Groundwater condition in farm land of coastal area in Takalar Regency has undergone salinization and groundwater salinity escalation in every groundwater release is very high. Groundwater release volume is directly proportional to groundwater salinity escalation with relatively high rate on its escalation gradient; (2) Total degradation of groundwater level in coastal farm land ranges from 14 to 15 cm, and it is relatively low compared to total occurred degradation of groundwater level in observed inner land in early year (ranging from 100 to 150 cm); (3) Number of infiltration hole significantly affects escalation volume of augmentation and groundwater salinity rate degradation...|$|E
40|$|Alkaline {{phosphatase}} (AP) is a phosphate transferase {{present in}} bacteria and eukaryotes. In previous studies, {{we have shown}} that AP is able to dephosphorylate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at physiological pH levels. Because LPS is the causative agent of gram-negative sepsis, we hypothesize that AP might {{be used as a}} medication during early stages of LPS-induced septic shock. We have demonstrated protective effects of AP when this enzyme was administered simultaneously with LPS. However, a major question of anti-LPS therapies is whether they are also <b>effective</b> after systemic <b>infiltration</b> of whole bacteria and if they also act in later stages of the disease. To test this, we explored the protective effects of AP from human placenta (pIAP) in a bacterial challenge model in Balb/c mice. AP was intravenously administered 20 min after a bacterial intraperitoneal inoculation of 2 to 5 x 10 (7) CFU of Escherichia coli suspended in a 100 -muL volume of saline. It was shown that AP attenuated the systemic host response upon E. coli. Body temperature was normalized as compared with untreated septic mice. Also, serum nitric oxide levels 24 h after the injection of bacteria were reduced almost to control levels in mice that received AP. Moreover, survival after 24 h was significantly higher in the AP-treated group compared with the nontreated control group...|$|R
40|$|To {{maximize}} the irrigation efficiency {{and to protect}} groundwater from agrochemical pollution, two variables must be known with good accuracy: <b>effective</b> evapotranspiration and <b>infiltration,</b> especially in lowland areas were the run-off is minimal. Three different experimental plots cultivated with maize were equipped with tensiometers and soil moisture probes to monitor every day the water movement in the unsaturated zone. Other relevant parameters of the various soil layers, as hydraulic conductivity and water retention curve, were obtained in laboratory experiments, while boundary conditions, as precipitations, temperature and root growth, were obtained on site. Inverse modeling was performed using HYDRUS- 1 D to assess the degree of uncertainty on model parameters. Results showed a good model fit of water content and head pressure at various depths, in each site, using Penman-Monteith formula for daily potential evapotranspiration calculation, but poor fit applying the Hargreves and Turk formulas. Best performance of model fit was observed for S-shaped equation employed to simulate the root water-uptake reduction with respect to Feddes equation. The soil parameters uncertainty was limited and remained within analytical errors, thus a robust estimation of cumulative infiltration and evapotranspiration has been derived. This study points out that evapotranspiration {{is the most important}} variable in defining groundwater recharge for maize crops in lowlands.

40|$|A key {{prerequisite}} for <b>effective</b> GIS based <b>Infiltration</b> Excess Overland Flow (IEOF) simulation and visualization is good knowledge of GIS core concept and prediction of soil infiltration rates due to impervious area coverage. The {{success or failure}} for a GIS based IEOF simulation and visualization resides initially with the georeference system used. Implementation of soft geo-objects representing flow elements such as streams, mudflows and runoff provides better dynamic visualization in terms of velocity and direction. Inclusion of volume would offer substantial effort towards determining volume of stormwater runoff hits the flood-plain areas, estimating channel flow capacity, routing and diversions to reduce flood disasters realistically. However, cartographers have long complained about the poor quality of the output from GIS, which generally today is not due to limitation of the GIS itself, but to {{lack of understanding of}} cartographic principles among hydrologists and environmentalists. With rapid growth of urbanization, industrialization and climate change, previous historical runoff and infiltration rate would provide improper guide for the future enhanced visualization of the current 2 D land use surface to improve future hydrologic impact assessment. This study aims to visualize the influence of georeferencing towards IEOF simulation represented by volumetric soft geo-objects dynamically within 3 D environment driven by physically based Green-Ampt method. Visualization is analyzed by focusing on infiltration and overland flow process using conformal Malaysian Rectified Skew Orthomorphic (MRSO) and equidistance Cassini-Soldner projections. Appropriate usage of georeferencing system to visualize 3 D dynamic IEOF simulation may obtain high demands from civil engineers, environmentalists, town planners, geologists and meteorologists as base for producing scientific results of flood management control, sustainability for long-term development purposes, stream restoration,rehabilitation and hydrologic impact assessment...|$|R
