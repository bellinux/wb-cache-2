25|$|Peacock {{bass are}} {{important}} food fish and also considered game fish. This {{has resulted in}} their accidental (escapees from fish farms) or <b>deliberate</b> (<b>release</b> by fishers) introduction to regions outside their native range, both elsewhere in South America, and in warm parts of North America and Asia. Where introduced, they may become invasive and damage the ecosystem because of their highly predatory behavior, feeding extensively on smaller native fish.|$|E
25|$|Until European colonisation, the numbat {{was found}} across {{most of the}} area from the New South Wales and Victorian borders west to the Indian Ocean, and {{as far north as}} the {{southwest}} corner of the Northern Territory. It was at home {{in a wide range of}} woodland and semiarid habitats. The <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> of the European red fox in the 19th century, however, wiped out the entire numbat population in Victoria, NSW, South Australia and the Northern Territory, and almost all numbats in Western Australia, as well. By the late 1970s, the population was well under 1,000 individuals, concentrated in two small areas not far from Perth, Dryandra, and Perup.|$|E

5000|$|Scottish Natural Heritage have re-introduced the European beaver to {{the wild}} in Scotland using Norwegian stock. The species {{was found in the}} Highlands until the 15th century, and {{although}} the then Scottish Government initially rejected the idea, a trial commenced in May 2009 in Knapdale. In Tayside, <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> or escapes have led to up to 250 animals colonising the area. The Scottish Government is monitoring the situation and expected to make an announcement about the species' future in 2016. [...] By means of escapes or <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases,</b> wild boar (Sus scrofa) have been re-introduced to several places in Scotland including a wide area of Lochaber and West Inverness-shire. Various other schemes are under consideration. For example, the owner of the Alladale estate north of Inverness has expressed a desire to reintroduce wolves as part of a wilderness reserve, {{the first of its kind}} in Britain.|$|R
50|$|Hoplias malabaricus {{are popular}} in the {{aquarium}} trade but are prohibited from being kept in California as a potentially invasive species. H. malabaricus was formerly established in Hillsborough County, Florida from either <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> or fish farm escapes. Since January 1977 no specimens have been collected or reported; presumably the species was extirpated as result of extremely cold temperatures during that month.|$|R
50|$|In Thailand, this fish, {{known locally}} as pla khu dam (ปลาคู้ดำ), was {{introduced}} from Hong Kong and Singapore as part of fish-farming projects, but has adapted to local conditions and thrives in the wild in some areas.

2500|$|In the Netherlands, a large herd (ca. 3000 animals {{counted in}} late 2012) {{lives in the}} Oostvaarders Plassen, a nature reserve. Ireland has its own unique subspecies. In the UK, {{indigenous}} populations occur in Scotland, the Lake District, and the South West of England (principally on Exmoor). Not {{all of these are}} of entirely pure bloodlines, as some of these populations have been supplemented with <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> of deer from parks, such as Warnham or Woburn Abbey, in an attempt to increase antler sizes and body weights. The University of Edinburgh [...] found that, in Scotland, there has been extensive hybridisation with the closely related sika deer. Several other populations have originated either with [...] "carted" [...] deer kept for stag hunts being left {{out at the end of}} the hunt, escapes from deer farms, or <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases.</b> Carted deer were kept by stag hunts with no wild red deer in the locality and were normally recaptured after the hunt and used again; although the hunts are called [...] "stag hunts", the Norwich Staghounds only hunted hinds (female red deer), and in 1950, at least eight hinds (some of which may have been pregnant) were known to be at large near Kimberley and West Harling; they formed the basis of a new population based in Thetford Forest in Norfolk. Further substantial red deer herds originated from escapes or <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> in the New Forest, the Peak District, Suffolk, Lancashire, Brecon Beacons, and North Yorkshire, as well as many other smaller populations scattered throughout England and Wales, and they are all generally increasing in numbers and range. A census of deer populations in 2007 and again in 2011 coordinated by the British Deer Society records the red deer as having continued to expand their range in England and Wales since 2000, with expansion most notable in the Midlands and East Anglia.|$|R
50|$|Red-crested pochards build nests by the lakeside among {{vegetation}} and lay 8-12 pale green eggs. The birds' {{status in the}} British Isles is much confused {{because there have been}} many escapes and <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> over the years, as well as natural visitors from the continent. However, it is most likely that they are escapees that are now breeding wild and have built up a successful feral population. They are most numerous around areas of England including Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of the current population of Chinese water deer in Britain derives from escapees, with the remainder being descended {{from a number of}} <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases.</b> Most of these animals still reside close to Woburn Abbey. It appears that the deer’s strong preference for a particular habitat - tall reed and grass areas in rich alluvial deltas - has restricted its potential to colonize further afield. The main area of distribution is from Woburn, east into Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and North Essex, and south towards Whipsnade. There have been small colonies reported in other areas.|$|R

50|$|After two years' {{detailed}} analysis of national records the global eradication of smallpox was certified by an international commission of smallpox clinicians and medical scientists on 9 December 1979, and endorsed by the General Assembly of the World Health Organization on 8 May 1980. However, there is an ongoing controversy regarding the continued storage of the smallpox virus by labs in the US and Russia, as any accidental or <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> could create a new epidemic for persons born after or in the late 1980s due to the cessation of vaccinations against the smallpox virus.|$|E
40|$|Growing {{demands for}} marine fish {{products}} {{is leading to}} increased pressure on already depleted wild populations and a rise in aquaculture production. Consequently, more captive-bred fish are released into the wild through accidental escape or <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases.</b> The increased mixing of captive-bred and wild fish may affect the ecological and/or genetic integrity of wild fish populations. Unambiguous identification tools for captive-bred fish will be highly valuable to manage risks (fisheries management) and tracing of escapees and seafood products (wildlife forensics). Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from captive-bred and wild populations of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. and sole Solea solea L., we explored the efficiency of population and parentage assignment techniques for the identification and tracing of captive-bred fish. Simulated and empirical data were used to correct for stochastic genetic effects. Overall, parentage assignment performed well when a large effective population size characterized the broodstock and escapees originated from early generations of captive breeding. Consequently, parentage assignments are particularly useful from a fisheries management perspective to monitor the effects of <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> of captive-bred fish on wild populations. Population assignment {{proved to be more}} efficient after several generations of captive breeding, which makes it a useful method in forensic applications for well-established aquaculture species. We suggest the implementation of a case-by-case strategy when choosing the best method. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Irish goat breed from Ireland is {{used for}} the {{production}} of meat and milk. Although this breed is not native to Ireland, domesticated goats have long been kept for milk, meat, and skin. In many parts of the region, feral populations have become established as a result of escapes or <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases</b> from captivity. Populations have persisted in remote and rugged areas to which the animal is ideally adapted. These goats are nimble-footed on crags and precipitous cliffs. They have a range of colours, but the coat is usually a mixture of grey, black, and brown. Both sexes have horns, larger in the male than in the female.|$|R
30|$|With either {{accidental}} or <b>deliberate</b> <b>releases,</b> it {{is critical}} to not only provide a reliable indication of the presence of hazardous particles within the atmosphere (release detection) but to also indicate where the event originated (release localization). Understanding the source’s point in time and space can guide emergency responders and enable fast corrective actions to be more precisely targeted. In the case of a CBRN attack, for example, antidotal medications which are potentially already in short supply can be administered only to people who were exposed and in danger of succumbing to attack related illness or injury. Similarly, {{in the case of an}} accidental release, source localization can guide forensics and enable the prevention of future releases.|$|R
5000|$|Species {{reintroduction}} is the <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> of {{a species}} into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism survives. The goal of species reintroduction {{is to establish a}} healthy, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing population. A species that needs reintroduction is usually one whose existence has become threatened or endangered in the wild. However, reintroduction {{of a species}} can also be for pest control. For example, wolves being reintroduced to a wild area because of an overpopulation of elk or deer. Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term [...] "reestablishment".|$|E
50|$|According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bioterrorism is the <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> of viruses, bacteria, toxins {{or other}} harmful agents to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants.

Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Terrorists tend to use biological agents because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread {{from person to person}} and some, like anthrax, cannot.|$|E
5000|$|Cuban {{tree frogs}} are {{commonly}} {{available in the}} pet trade within the United States. [...] They are inexpensive, and when cared for properly, tend to live five to 10 years. They feed readily on commercially available crickets, but while in captivity, they may turn to cannibalism. [...] Their toxic mucus can burn the eyes and trigger an allergic (or asthmatic) reaction; as a result, this species is not an ideal pet species, especially for children. The Cuban tree frog's colonization of Oahu {{is believed to be}} a result of accidental or <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> of pets. Therefore, the species is now banned from sale in Hawaii. Conviction of importation of a Cuban tree frog carries a maximum fine of $25,000 and a year in jail.|$|E

50|$|As {{the social}} protest {{of these early}} years waned, gekiga shifted in meaning towards {{socially}} conscious, mature drama and towards the avant-garde. Examples include Koike and Kojima's Lone Wolf and Cub and Akira, an apocalyptic tale of motorcycle gangs, street war, and inexplicable transformations {{of the children of}} a future Tokyo. Another example is Osamu Tezuka's 1976 manga MW, a bitter story of the aftermath of the storage and possibly <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> of poison gas by U.S. armed forces based in Okinawa years after World War II. Gekiga and the social consciousness it embodies remain alive in modern-day manga.

5000|$|... "Stalking" [...] {{is defined}} as to pursue or {{approach}} stealthily which is often necessary when approaching wild deer, or the high seat overseeing {{the area where the}} deer are likely to be passing. Scottish deer stalking is often done under the guidance of a stalker or a , a resident expert. Deer stalking is not the only form of control, or culling, for the six wild species of deer at large in the UK. The six species are Red Deer, Roe Deer, Fallow Deer, Sika Deer, Muntjac and Chinese Water Deer and there have never been more deer at large or more widely distributed in the UK than there are now. The first two species are indigenous although new populations have appeared after deliberate releases and escapes from parks or farms. A result of this is that both Red Deer and Roe Deer are now present in several parts of Wales, a country from which both had been absent as wild animals for several centuries. Fallow Deer have been at large {{in many parts of the}} UK for at least 1,000 years, added to by more recent escapes, but the other three species have solely originated from ornamental collections and deer farms, principally from Woburn Abbey, escaping through damaged fences or sometimes by <b>deliberate</b> <b>release.</b> A number of deer escaped in southern England following damage to fences by the hurricane of 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Bioterrorism is the <b>deliberate</b> <b>release</b> of viruses, bacteria, {{or other}} germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants.

Biological agents in the hands of terrorists pose serious threats to states’ security because they can be easily spread through the air, through water, and through food. [...] Biological agents can also be difficult to detect and often do not cause illness for several hours to several days. [...] A prominent example of a bioterrorist attack on the United States is the September 2001 anthrax attacks. On September 18, 2001, several letters containing anthrax were sent to media outlets and the U.S. Congressional offices of Senator Thomas Daschle and Senator Patrick Leahy. Five Americans died from anthrax inhalation as a result of contact with the contaminated mail. While the 2001 anthrax attacks were relatively small-scale, the United States government has taken several steps since to 2001 to pass legislation and initiatives aimed at better protecting the United States against biological attacks, improving the United States’ public health system, and improving the United States ability to respond to biological attacks.|$|E
