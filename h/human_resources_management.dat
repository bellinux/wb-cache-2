Under a programme introduced in late 1978 they would return for six-week call-up periods after their national service was over. The overall quality of these national servicemen was initially subjacent when compared to the more experienced regular soldiers, but over time they were able to reach the same high standard. Hence, the RLI actively encouraged conscripts to enlist as regulars (with some success); especially those with leadership or <b>human</b> <b>resources</b> <b>management</b> potential who had completed tertiary education, or had started a course of advanced study and intended to finish it after completing their service.|$|E
