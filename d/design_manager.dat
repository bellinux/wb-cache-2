Its {{goal is to}} create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic {{design management}} and the implementation of design on the operational level. It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical <b>design</b> <b>manager,</b> design director, design & innovation manager, brand <b>design</b> <b>manager,</b> new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Sustainability in the {{construction}} industry is gaining increased attention which consequently shifted the modus operandi towards improving knowledge and practice. Amongst the key stakeholders involved in the delivery of sustainable buildings are <b>design</b> <b>managers,</b> who have a vital role in terms of managing and coordinating the design process and communicating design information. During this highly complex and iterative process, <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> also undertake tasks and activities which are related to sustainability and its assessment. This study investigated the impact of sustainability assessment on the design managers’ roles and responsibilities. The research specifically focused on ICT as an ‘enabler’ within the sustainability assessment process that aids <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> in achieving a better environment while carrying out their roles and responsibilities. Without an explicit understanding about how ICT can be effectively used within the sustainability assessment process, its impact will remain limited for <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> who are one of the key players in the strive for a sustainable design process. A twofold research methodology was adopted within this project to achieve the primary and secondary research objectives, this included: an extensive literature review on the building design process, design management role and sustainability assessment; and, fieldwork, which consisted of questionnaires and series of interviews with <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> working for contractors in the industry. The research concluded that there are several barriers to the effective management of sustainability assessment by <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> caused by two major factors: the late involvement in the projects and the lack of a structured approach for the sustainability management. The study concluded that in order for ICT to become an effective ‘enabler’ in the assessment process, barriers to effective management of sustainability assessment must be removed first...|$|R

5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of good design management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals.

5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture.

40|$|The role {{of visual}} {{communication}} design {{continues to increase}} in importance around the world. In Bahrain, organisations are increasingly considering visual communication design {{as a means of}} accomplishing organisational goals. The research aims to understand the process by which <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> in organisations in Bahrain manage and evaluate visual communication designs to gain strategic advantage. Even though the management of visual communication design has not yet been recognised as a separate category of design management in Bahrain, its processes and approaches may differ from other management applications. This research opens with a contextual overview of the visual communication design management field, before presenting an understanding of how visual communication design can be utilised as an innovative approach to the strategic structuring organisational thinking. Methods have been developed for investigating how Bahraini client <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> manage visual communication design projects. Observational studies and interviews with client <b>design</b> <b>managers</b> and creative directors have been conducted to obtain an understanding of the visual communication design process, together with evaluation procedures in the Bahraini context.

500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design management function has a large influence on what the <b>design</b> <b>manager</b> does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a [...] "secondary" [...] organisational process, design management is seen as [...] "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the <b>design</b> <b>manager</b> as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R, and communication.

500|$|The project's {{exterior}} <b>design</b> <b>manager</b> was Lee Moran, {{a former}} Ford Australia designer. He {{was chosen by}} Toyota Styling Australia chief Paul Berninger in 2005. One of Moran's focuses was {{to reduce the size}} of the grille and add emphasis to the front bumper line below it. This was done so the car had more of a Formula One oriented look. In the Toyota wind tunnel in Japan, the vehicle's drag coefficient was confirmed at 0.30, meaning that the car would operate better aerodynamically than its non-TRD variants. The TRD also features bold exterior additions that differentiate it with the standard Aurion range, such as exhaust pipes integrated into the bumper, tinted taillight lenses, and a unique bodykit.
