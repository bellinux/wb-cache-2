5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward far enough to permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not far enough to permit live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E
5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute <b>Extraction</b> <b>System</b> (LAPES), in which palletized supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E
25|$|Dual-phase {{extraction}} utilizes a soil vapor <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> {{that produces}} a high vacuum resulting in the extraction of both contaminated vapors {{as well as a}} limited amount of contaminated groundwater. This method is somewhat inefficient due to large amount of energy required by pulling water by vacuum compared to pushing water with a submersible pump.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{high vacuum}} systems like liquid ring pumps, rotary {{positive}} blowers, and rotary vane blowers are utilized for the <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Extraction</b> <b>systems</b> must {{be capable of}} handling water (multi-phase extraction) during the extraction process.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} part of 1965 about one dozen {{personnel}} of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, a drogue parachute would be released, pulling palletized cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the runway. At full strength the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, high velocity or low-velocity drop techniques.|$|E

The 3300 hectare {{property}} is used primarily for gravel runway training, radar tracking, and aerial cargo drop exercises such as LAPES.

25|$|After being sorted, {{washed and}} chopped up, they proceed into large steel vats for preservation/precooking {{and also to}} destroy any {{bacteria}} that could be harmful {{for the rest of}} the processing period as well as for the consumer after production. The juice will be extracted out by a juice <b>extraction</b> <b>system.</b> The outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the juice in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E
40|$|Background: Bio-molecular event {{extraction}} from {{literature is}} recognized as an important task of bio text mining and, as such, many relevant systems have been developed and made available during the last decade. While such systems provide useful services individually, {{there is a need}} for a meta-service to enable comparison and ensemble of such services, offering optimal solutions for various purposes. Results: We have integrated nine event <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> in the U-Compare framework, making them intercompatible and interoperable with other U-Compare components. The U-Compare event meta-service provides various meta-level features for comparison and ensemble of multiple event <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> Experimental results show that the performance improvements achieved by the ensemble are significant. Conclusions: While individual event <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> themselves provide useful features for bio text mining, the U-Compare meta-service is expected to improve the accessibility to the individual systems, and to enable metalevel uses over multiple event <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> such as comparison and ensemble. © 2011 Kano et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

40|$|Text {{documents}} often embed {{data that}} is structured in nature. By processing a text database with information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems,</b> we can define {{a variety of}} structured “relations,” over which we can then issue SQL queries. Processing SQL queries in this text-based scenario presents multiple challenges. One key challenge is efficiency: information extraction is a time-consuming process, so query processing strategies should pick efficient <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> whenever possible, and also minimize the number of documents that they process. Another key challenge is result quality: <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> might output erroneous information or miss information that they should capture; also, efficiencyrelated query processing decisions (e. g., to avoid processing large numbers of useless documents) may compromise result completeness. To address these challenges, we characterize SQL query processing strategies {{in terms of their}} efficiency and result quality, and discuss the (user-specific) tradeoff between these two properties. ...|$|R
25|$|Selective ActiNide EXtraction. As {{part of the}} {{management}} of minor actinides it has been proposed that the lanthanides and trivalent minor actinides should {{be removed from the}} PUREX raffinate by a process such as DIAMEX or TRUEX. In order to allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel, the lanthanides must be removed. The lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron driven nuclear reaction. To date the <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> for the SANEX process has not been defined, but currently several different research groups are working towards a process. For instance the French CEA is working on a bis-triazinyl pyridine (BTP) based process.|$|E
25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> site. These tasks included a borehole inspection {{to determine how much}} of the shaft needed casing to prevent rockfalls from jamming the escape capsule. Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the winching rig required assembly. Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|E
25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E

500|$|In 1887, the British Army {{was searching}} for a {{revolver}} to replace the largely unsatisfactory [...]476 Enfield Mk I & Mk II Revolvers, the Enfield having only replaced the solid frame Adams [...]450 revolver which was a late 1860s conversion of the cap and ball Beaumont–Adams revolver in 1880.
