25|$|In this route, {{hydrazine}} {{is produced}} in several steps from ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and a ketone such as acetone or methylethyl ketone. The ketone and ammonia first condense to give the imine, which is oxidised by hydrogen peroxide to the oxaziridine, a three-membered ring containing carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Next, the oxaziridine gives the <b>hydrazone</b> by treatment with ammonia, which process creates the nitrogen-nitrogen single bond. This <b>hydrazone</b> condenses with one more equivalent of ketone; the resulting azine is hydrolyzed to give hydrazine and regenerate the ketone. Unlike the Olin Raschig Process, this approach does not produce a salt as a by-product.|$|E

Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) can also add to the carbonyl group. After the elimination of water, this will result in an oxime. An ammonia derivative of the form H2NNR2 such as hydrazine (H2NNH2) or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a <b>hydrazone,</b> which are usually orange crystalline solids.

25|$|A Shapiro {{reaction}} of the vinyllithium compound derived from <b>hydrazone</b> 4.1 with aldehyde 4.2 makes the first connection that will become the B ring.

Epoxidation with vanadyl(acetylacetate) converted alkene 4.3 to epoxide 4.4, which, upon reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, gave diol 4.5. This diol was then protected as carbonate ester 4.6. The carbonate group also served to create rigidity in the ring structure for the imminent pinacol coupling reaction. The two silyl ether groups were removed, and diol 4.7 was then oxidized to give dialdehyde 4.8 using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of tetrapropylammonium perruthenate.
