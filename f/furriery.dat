25|$|Horses were {{central to}} Cuman culture {{and way of}} life, and their main {{activity}} was animal husbandry. The knight, Robert de Clari, described the Cumans as nomadic warriors who raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. They moved north with their herds in summer and returned south in winter. Some of the Cumans led a semi-settled life and took part in trading and farming, as well as blacksmithing, <b>furriery,</b> shoe making, saddle making, bow making, and clothes making. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. They attached feeding sacks to the bridles of their horses, allowing them to cover great distances. They could go on campaign with little baggage and carry everything they needed. They wore sheepskin and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They prayed to the first animal they saw in the morning. Like the Bulgars, the Cumans were known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when {{they ran out of}} water far from an available source. Their traditional diet consisted of soup with millet and meat and included beer, curdled mare's milk, kumis, and bread (though bread could be rare depending on location).|$|E

50|$|By 1932 Gaba {{had moved}} to New York, where he {{designed}} a lifelike mannequin known as Cynthia that was created for Saks Fifth Avenue. Cynthia was a 100-pound model who had realistic imperfections like freckles, pigeon toes, and even different sized feet. Gaba posed with Cynthia around New York City for a Life Magazine shoot that humorously demonstrates how lifelike the mannequins had become. Cartier and Tiffany sent her jewelry, Lilly Daché designed hats for her, and couturiers sent her their latest fashions, <b>furrieries</b> sent minks. Soon {{a whole host of}} ‘Gaba Girls’ followed.|$|R
50|$|Cynthia herself {{soon became}} dazzlingly famous. Cartier and Tiffany sent her jewelry, Lilly Daché {{designed}} hats for her, and couturiers sent her their latest fashions, <b>furrieries</b> sent minks.

She was given a credit card from Saks Fifth Avenue, and had a box seat subscription to the Metropolitan Opera House. She had her own newspaper column, and a successful radio show.

50|$|Although {{the economy}} of the commune is {{prevalent}} agricultural, the secondary and tertiary economic sectors have also developed recently. The commune is known as an important fructiferous basin of the region. Due to the small industry represented by handicraft, Hălmagiu has become an important centre of <b>furriery</b> and producing of wooden tools. The main exploitable resources are andesite, complex iron ore and banded clay.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the London College of Fashion are in three early London trade schools for women: the Shoreditch Technical Institute Girls School, founded in 1906; the Barrett Street Trade School, founded in 1915; and the Clapham Trade School, founded in 1927. All were {{set up by the}} {{technical}} education board of the London County Council to train skilled labour for trades including dressmaking, millinery, embroidery, women's tailoring and hairdressing; to these, <b>furriery</b> and men's tailoring were later added. Graduates of the schools found work either in the garment factories of the East End, or in the skilled dressmaking and fashion shops of the West End of London.|$|E

40|$|In Sieradz, a city {{of medium}} size, we know the {{statutes}} of six fraternities in the years 1547 – 1593 (collective, drapers, tailors, merchants, linen-drapers and brewers). Statutes of four corporations craft mention of the circumstances, in which women took over temporary management of craft workshops. Women in Sieradz performed typical occupations: trade practices, crafts (spinning, shoemaking, tailoring, drapery, <b>furriery,</b> coppersmithing, baking, pottery, brewing), the services (washing, keeping food {{in the homes of}} the nobility living in the city and wealthier craftsmen). Few were engaged in usury. They allocated money on home furnishings, charity, worthy burial. Their economic condition was undoubtedly worse than townswomen of Krakow, Poznan, Wroclaw, Warsaw and Lviv.

40|$|In XV and XVI centuries, Szadek, {{like many}} other Polish towns, was {{undergoing}} a period of intensive growth and prosperity. Many craftsmen, also from abroad, came and settled in Szadek in XV century. The town became an important wool cloth manufacturing centre on the economic map of Poland, surpassed only by Brzeziny in the Sieradz and Łęczyca district {{and a few other}} towns. The growth of wool cloth manufacturing spurred the development of other crafts, such as brewing, tailoring, shoemaking, <b>furriery,</b> carpentry and flour-milling, and trade. The economic position of Szadek was reflected in its administrative, judicial, cultural, political and social functions. In XV-XVI centuries the town was as important as such major urban centres of that time as Sieradz or Wieluń. The beginning of XVII century was a period of Szadek’s degradation and decline of its cloth production, which had two main causes. The first one was a series of misfortunes that afflicted this town in turbulent XVII century: fires, epidemics and passages of troops connected with wars. The second reason was the structure of wool manufacturing in Szadek, oriented to meeting local demand and mass production of cheap, inferior kind of coarse cloth, mainly bought by peasants. Impoverished rural population in XVII century bought less and less woollen cloth made in towns. Decreased demand was also caused by development of cloth manufacture in rural areas of southern and eastern Greater Poland. The shrinking demand on internal market for cloth manufactured in Szadek led to the decline of this town’s two-centuries long period of prosperity...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{consider}} wealth as {{a historical}} category, which had been filled {{in the course of}} society development, creation of new machinery and technologies, increasing complexity of economic relations. The article describes a system of wealth elements of ancient Rus, including natural resources, produced goods, human, social, and institutional capital, knowledge and technology, as well their features, forms of realization and protection. The art of metallurgy, weapon business, shipbuilding, spinning, weaving, <b>furriery,</b> tanning and pottery of Ancient Rus testify to the high level of human capital and technology development. The authors made a conclusion on the importance of social capital, without which monetary wealth did not matter. Wealth in Ancient Rus served as a means of social communication. Wealth in old Russian society had a specific social function, which consisted in increasing individual status by passing personal objects to other members of community. When considering the wealth as a comparative category, the authors conclude that in old Russian society high social prestige of wealth was combined with the duality of ethical evaluation: wealth itself was not condemned, but poverty was given priority over wealth. The authors analyzed the political institutions: veche (council), obshchina (community), druzhina (institution of princely power), verv (commune); economic institutions: pomestyevotchina (estate), dan (tribute), polyudye (collection of tribute), desyatina (tithe), rabstvo (slavery) etc.; and legal institutions of Ancient Rus, first of all, Russkaya Pravda (Russian Truth). It is revealed that in Russkaya Pravda one can find the basics of the property law and liability law, as well as some information on capital protection...|$|E

The conference was held in the city of Kyzyl on July 24 - 27, 2016. It was co-organized by Khoomei International Research Center (Kyzyl, Republic of Tuva), Tuvan State University and the Center for the Development of Traditional Tuvan Culture and Crafts (Republic of Tuva). Among the conference {{participants}} were scholars from the USA, Austria, Republic of Tuva (Russia) and expert craftsmen from Tuva and the regions of the Altai. Discussions at the conference sessions touched such issues as the historical and cultural heritage of the peoples of the Sayans and the Altai and its role in contemporary life; continuity in cultural development; Tuvan traditional beliefs; revival of spiritual culture; the triad in shamanic spirituality; Tuvan applied arts, etc. Applied arts preserve specific features of the ethnic world view common for a number of peoples of the Sayan-Altai uplands. Conference participants highly appreciated the work of the leading master stonecutters, makers of ethnic costume, tools and expert practitioners of other traditional arts. Also discussed were the problems of artistic and professional growth, contemporary uses of applied arts, and the importance of studying applied arts as a reflection of ethnic culture.
