5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create <b>galls,</b> almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the <b>galls</b> are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause <b>galls</b> in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody <b>galls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many thrips form <b>galls</b> {{on plants}} when feeding or laying their eggs. Some of the gall-forming Phlaeothripidae, such as genera Kladothrips and Oncothrips, form eusocial groups similar to ant colonies, with {{reproductive}} queens and nonreproductive soldier castes.|$|E

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their <b>galls,</b> the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the <b>galls</b> containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the <b>galls</b> at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different <b>galls</b> about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E

5|$|Outside Australia it {{has become}} naturalised in South Africa, Tanzania, Italy, Portugal, Sardinia, India, Indonesia and New Zealand. It is present in California as a garden escapee, but is not {{considered}} to be naturalised there. In South Africa, where it had been introduced between 1858 and 1865 for dune stabilization and tannin production, it had spread along waterways into forest, mountain and lowland fynbos, and borderline areas between fynbos and karoo. The gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster signiventris has been introduced in South Africa for biological control and has reduced the capacity of trees to reproduce throughout their range. The eggs are laid by adult wasps into buds of flower heads in the summer, before hatching in May and June when the larvae induce the formation of the grape-like <b>galls</b> and prevent flower development. The <b>galls</b> can be so heavy that branches break under their weight. In addition, the introduction in 2001 of the acacia seed weevil Melanterius compactus has also proved effective.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some of {{patients}} with an intact <b>gall</b> bladder develop acute cholecystitis or have <b>gall</b> bladder stone formation after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy may affect <b>gall</b> bladder motility. AIMS: To prospectively evaluate longterm effect of endoscopic sphincterotomy on <b>gall</b> bladder motility. PATIENTS: Thirty two patients with an intact <b>gall</b> bladder (15 with and 17 without <b>gall</b> bladder stones) who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for choledocholithiasis. METHODS: <b>Gall</b> bladder function was examined before and at from seven days to five years after sphincterotomy. <b>Gall</b> bladder volume, at fasting and after caerulein administration, was determined by ultrasonography. RESULTS: After endoscopic sphincterotomy, the enlarged orifice remained patent during a five year follow up period. One patient with <b>gall</b> bladder stones subsequently developed acute cholecystitis, the remaining being asymptomatic. In the patients before sphincterotomy, particularly in those with <b>gall</b> bladder stones, the <b>gall</b> bladder showed larger fasting volume and lower caerulein stimulated maximum contraction than normal controls. Throughout five years after sphincterotomy, fasting volume of the <b>gall</b> bladder decreased and its maximum contraction increased, regardless of <b>gall</b> bladder stones; {{significantly different from the}} values before sphincterotomy (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic sphincterotomy decreases fasting volume of the <b>gall</b> bladder and increases its contraction ability for a long period. These changes may rather decrease the risk of future acute cholecystitis or <b>gall</b> stone formation...|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} {{diseases}} that {{can reduce the}} yield and market value of carrots. The most devastating carrot disease is Alternaria leaf blight, which {{has been known to}} eradicate entire crops. A bacterial leaf blight caused by Xanthomonas campestris can also be destructive in warm, humid areas. Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne species) can cause stubby or forked roots, or <b>galls.</b> Cavity spot, caused by the oomycetes Pythium violae and Pythium sulcatum, results in irregularly shaped, depressed lesions on the taproots.|$|E
5|$|Archaeamphora longicervia H. Q. Li was {{described}} as an herbaceous, Sarraceniaceae-like pitcher plant from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Here, a re-investigation of A. longicervia specimens from the Yixian Formation provides new insights into its identity and the morphology of pitcher plants claimed by Li. We demonstrate that putative pitchers of Archaeamphora are insect-induced leaf <b>galls</b> that consist of three components: (1) an innermost larval chamber; (2) an intermediate zone of nutritive tissue; and (3) an outermost wall of sclerenchyma. Archaeamphora is not a carnivorous, Sarraceniaceae-like angiosperm, but represents insect-galled leaves of the previously reported gymnosperm Liaoningocladus boii G. Sun et al. from the Yixian Formation.|$|E

5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy <b>galls</b> are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|Many wasp {{species are}} parasitoids; the females deposit eggs on or {{in a host}} {{arthropod}} on which the larvae then feed. Some larvae start off as parasitoids, but convert at a later stage to consuming the plant tissues that their host is feeding on. In other species, the eggs are laid directly into plant tissues and form <b>galls,</b> which protect the developing larvae from predators but not necessarily from other parasitic wasps. In some species, the larvae are predatory themselves; the wasp eggs are deposited in clusters of eggs laid by other insects, and these are then consumed by the developing wasp larvae.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are {{believed}} to have descended from a fungus-feeding ancestor during the Mesozoic, and many groups still feed upon and inadvertently redistribute fungal spores. These live among leaf litter or on dead wood and are important members of the ecosystem, their diet often being supplemented with pollen. Other species are primitively eusocial and form plant <b>galls</b> and still others are predatory on mites and other thrips. Two species of Aulacothrips, A. tenuis and A. levinotus, {{have been found to be}} ectoparasites on aetalionid and membracid plant-hoppers in Brazil.|$|E
40|$|Epithelial {{dysplasia}} of <b>gall</b> bladder is {{an important}} precancerous lesion of <b>gall</b> bladder carcinogenesis.

5|$|The diet of the yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{varied and}} available {{from a range}} of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat. Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks (Allocasuarina and Casuarina, including A.torulosa and A.verticillata), but also Eucalyptus (including E.maculata flowers and E.nitida seeds), Acacia (including gum exudate and <b>galls),</b> Banksia (including the green seed pods and seeds of B.serrata, B.integrifolia, and B.marginata), and Hakea species (including H.gibbosa, H.rugosa, H.nodosa, H.sericea, H.cycloptera, and H.dactyloides). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced Pinus radiata and to other introduced trees, including Cupressus torulosa, Betula pendula and the buds of elm Ulmus species. In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), alongside native species.|$|E
5|$|The fruits are small, {{round and}} yellow, and can ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit {{is in the form of}} a syconium, an {{inverted}} inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. F.rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species Pleistodontes imperialis, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce <b>galls</b> while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), F.rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.|$|E
