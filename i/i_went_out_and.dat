500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see?

500|$|Cy Grant, a Guyanese actor {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Lieutenant Green (Colonel White's assistant and Cloudbase's main computer operator and public announcer), had been known to the Andersons for singing topical calypsos on the current affairs programme Tonight. His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?' He said, 'Okay, send him out.' So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> auditioned and got the job." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Proffitt, the Appalachian {{musician}} whose {{version of}} [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] the Trio rearranged, watched their {{performance of his}} song on a television show and wrote in reaction, [...] "They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with 'This time tomorrow, reckon where I’ll be/If it hadn't a' been for Grayson/I'd a been in Tennessee.' I began to feel sorty sick. Like I’d lost a loved one. Tears came to my eyes. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> bawled on the ridge." [...] Proffitt had learned the song from {{his father and his}} grandmother, who had known Tom Dula and Laura Foster, the killer and the victim in the actual 1866 murder related in the song. Both Proffitt and fellow North Carolina musician Doc Watson sang the older version of the tune, which had [...] "a lively mocking tempo... that retained some of the ghastliness and moral squalor of an actual murder," [...] according to folk historian Robert Cantwell, who also notes that the Kingston Trio's version of the song left out several verses from the traditional lyric. The slower, harmonized Trio version of the Dooley song and other traditional numbers struck Proffitt as a betrayal of [...] "the strange mysterious workings which has made Tom Dooly [...] live..." [...] As recently as 2006, folk traditionalist and influential banjo master Billy Faier remarked: [...] "I hear and see very little respect for the folk genre" [...] in their music and described the Trio's repertoire as [...] "a mishmash of twisted arrangements that not only obscure the true beauty of the folk songs from which they derive, but give them a meaning they never had." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E

2500|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{the band}} chose {{to stay away from}} the {{political}} realm. However, in 2004, upon learning that George W.

Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets.

Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit.

[...] "I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: [...] "I saw Sparks play on American Banstand in 1975. My sister and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, [...] "why I love the Sparks".

2500|$|Volney Mathison (chiropractor, radio engineer, psychologist, and hypnotist) {{built an}} EDA meter {{based on a}} Wheatstone bridge, a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that {{projected}} {{an image of the}} needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an electropsychometer or E-meter, and it {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Mathison Electropsychometer". In Mathison's words, the E-meter [...] "has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts". Mathison recorded in his book, Electropsychometry, that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:p.64In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it’s a current floating inside another current [...]. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, [...] [...] After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ( [...] , [...] ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.|$|E
