Ovopel containing GnRHa and dopamine antagonist (DA) in doses 0. 5 + 2 mg×kg- 1, 3. Dagin containing GnRHa and DA in doses 5 + 20 mg×kg- 1. Single groups of <b>stripped</b> <b>eggs</b> (n = 17 to 19 pcs) were placed into separated ponds. The avarage temperature of flowing water was 20. 9 +- 0. 9 °C. The highest ratio of <b>stripped</b> <b>eggs</b> to broodstock was observed following injection of Dagin (89. 5 %) and by Ovopel (82. 4 %). The highest mortality of <b>stripped</b> <b>eggs</b> to broodstock was observed by using CPE (76. 5 %). The highest values of gonadosomatic index (pGSi) propagated <b>stripped</b> <b>eggs</b> were observed in groups injected by Dagin (18. 4 +- 5. 2 %) and Ovopel (17. 6 +- 5. 9 %), the lowest values were observed by using CPE (16. 3 +- 6. 5 %). The relative labour fertility of <b>stripped</b> <b>eggs</b> was very stable (Ovopel 117000 +- 39000 pcs×pcs- 1, Dagin 116000 +- 32000 pcs×pcs- 1, CPE 115000 +- 45000 pcs×pcs- 1). The highest average wet weight of one egg was 1. 42 mg (CPE) and 1. 59 mg (Dagin), only this variation was statically provable (= 0. 05). The period of latence from the second hormonally injection to the {{artificial propagation}} (after ovulation) was 15. 5 +- 1. 2 h (resp. 324 +- 25 h°) with Ovopel, with CPE 16. 4 +- 1. 0 h (so 341 +- 22 h°) and with Dagin 16. 5 +- 0. 4 h (so 345 +- 7. 6 h°).

40|$|Progestin hormones stimulate sperm {{motility}} in teleosts but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Preliminary {{results suggest that}} progestin upregulation of {{sperm motility}} in southern flounder and several other marine species is mediated through a sperm membrane progestin receptor with the characteristics of membrane progestin receptor alpha (mPRα, also known as Paqr 7 b). The hypothesis that mPRα has {{an important role in}} progestin regulation of southern flounder sperm motility and fertility was tested in the present study. The specific mPRα agonist, 10 -ethenyl- 19 -norprogesterone (Org OD 02 - 0, 100 nM), mimicked the stimulatory actions of the endogenous progestin, 17, 20 β, 21 -trihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (20 β-S, 100 nM) on flounder sperm motility. The concentration of the mPRα protein on sperm plasma membranes was positively correlated to sperm motility as well as the responsiveness of sperm to progestin stimulation. Acute in vitro progestin treatment of sperm with high mPRα protein levels increased both sperm motility and fertilization success in <b>strip</b> <b>spawning</b> experiments. However, in vitro progestin treatments were ineffective on sperm with low receptor abundance. A single injection of the superactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (LHRHa, 100 μg/kg) increased sperm motility and fertilization success in <b>strip</b> <b>spawning</b> experiments 72 h post-injection which was accompanied by an increase in mPRα protein concentrations on sperm plasma membranes. These results provide clear evidence that southern flounder sperm hypermotility is mediated through mPRα. Stimulatory G proteins, but not inhibitory G proteins, were identified in flounder sperm plasma membrane fractions. The finding that treatment of flounder sperm plasma membrane fractions with either 20 β-S or Org OD 02 - 0 increases cAMP levels suggests progestins stimulate flounder sperm motility by activating an mPRα/stimulatory G protein/membrane adenylyl cyclase pathway. A similar mechanism has been identified in Atlantic croaker, suggesting that the signaling pathway mediated by mPRα in sperm is highly conserved in advanced teleosts. Collectively, our results indicate that progestin-stimulation of flounder sperm hypermotility and fertility is dependent on a sufficient concentration of mPRα which can be upregulated by in vivo LHRHa treatments. These findings potentially have practical applications for enhancing the fertility of male flounder broodstock...|$|R

Females were induced immediately after capture (wild group, n =  17) or held captive for the entire maturation period prior to induction (captive group, n =  7). Candidate predictors of egg quality measured on the female parent {{at the time of}} induction or on the spawn at ovulation were evaluated using correlation and multiple regression analysis. The fertilization rate, the hatching rate, and the duration of survival of unfed larvae post hatch were weakly correlated to each other (- 0. 23  < r < − 0. 08), revealing occurrence of distinct and independent components of egg quality. Spawns from captive females were characterized by a longer latency interval between hormonal induction and ovulation, lower fecundity, and lower hatching rates, as compared to those from wild females. Among the wild brood fish, a positive correlation was observed between the age of the female and the hatching rate. The best model optimized during stepwise multiple regression analysis of hatching rate data only explained 34 % of the variance for this trait and no model could be optimized for the prediction of fertilization rate or the duration of survival post hatch.

[...] The third was Flash Gordon Strange Adventures Magazine, which saw a single issue, dated December 1936; it was copyrighted by both Hersey and King Features, the syndicate that owned the copyright to Flash Gordon. [...] Dan Dunn and Tailspin Tommy produced one more issue each before Hersey closed down the venture. [...] It is not known why only one issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine appeared; poor sales figures from the other magazines may have been responsible, or Hersey may simply {{have run out of}} money, or possibly King Features, the owner of the copyright to Flash Gordon, only granted rights to Hersey for one issue, and withdrew from the venture after the first issue appeared. [...] Sf historian Everett Bleiler notes that Hersey did not mention the venture in his autobiographical Pulpwood Editor, published a year later, and adds that [...] "given Hersey's usual attempts to glorify himself and to gild his failures, this silence suggests a fiasco larger than usual".|$|R

Nine	matured	female	and	 9 	male	fishes	weighing	from	 1. 46 	to 2. 80 kg	were	randomly	selected	for	three	different	doses	of	hormonal	injection. Both	male	and	female	fishes	from	all	the three replicate groups (3 {{females and}} 3 males per replicate) were administered a single dose of 0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6 mL of ovaprim/kg body	weight	(BW),	 respectively. After	 12 	h	of	post-injection,	 the	females	were	stripped	individually	into	dry and pre weighed plastic containers {{to record the}} <b>stripped</b> <b>egg</b> weight per female. The breeding performance was assessed on the	basis	of	total	<b>egg</b>	mass	and	<b>stripping</b>	response. To	assess	the	egg	quality	of	hormone	induced	fishes,	 the	fertilization rate and hatching rates were examined among the three doses administered. Complete ovulation was observed in all the three doses	of	hormonal	injection. The	results	indicated	that	the	total	weight	of	<b>stripped</b>	<b>eggs</b>	were	significantly	highest	(P < 0. 05) 	 at	the	individuals	received	 0. 4 	mL	ovaprim/kg	BW	compared	to	those	injected	with	other	higher	doses. Highest fertilization (97. 88 %) 	 and	hatching	(93. 66 %) 	 were	also	recorded	 in	 the	 individuals	received	 0. 4 	mL	ovaprim/kg	BW. However,	 breeding	performance	and	egg	quality	were	not	statistically	significant	among	the	three	hormone	doses	tested in this study. Hence, it was evidenced that ovaprim, the synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone with a dopamin...|$|R
40|$|Effects of post-ovulatory and post-stripping {{retention}} {{time and temperature}} on egg viability rates were studied in kutum (Rutilus frisii kutum). Eggs were retained inside (in vivo storage) or outside the ovarian cavity with ovarian fluid (in vitro storage) at various temperatures. Two experiments were performed: 1) Partial volumes of <b>eggs</b> were <b>stripped</b> and fertilized at 24 - hour intervals for 96 hours post-ovulation (HPO) (at 11 °C) and at 12 -hour intervals for 72 HPO (at 14 °C), and 2) stored eggs were fertilized after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-stripping (HPS) at temperatures of 4, 10, 12, and 26 °C. In the first experiment, the highest eyeing and hatching rates (76...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of Venerupis decussata relies on wild seed collection, {{which has been}} recently compromised due to recruitment failure and severe mortalities. To address this issue and provide an alternative source of seed, artificial spawning and larval rearing programs were developed. However, hatchery-based seed production {{is a relatively new}} industry and it is still underdeveloped. A major hurdle in the European clam seed production is the control of spawning and reproduction, which is further hindered by the impossibility of obtaining fertile gametes by gonadal "stripping", as meiosis re-initiation is constrained to a maturation process along the genital ducts. In the present study, oocytes were collected from 15 females and microarray analyses was performed to investigate gene expression profiles characterizing released and stripped ovarian oocytes. A total of 198 differentially expressed transcripts between <b>stripped</b> and <b>spawned</b> oocytes were detected. Functional analysis carried out on these transcripts highlighted the importance of a few biological processes, which are most probably implicated in the control of oocyte competence. Significant differences were observed for transcripts encoding proteins involved in meiosis progression (e. g. dual specificity phosphatase CDC 25), WNT signalling (e. g. frizzled class receptor 8, wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 4), steroid synthesis (e. g. progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 3, cytochrome P 450 -C 17), mRNA processing (e. g. zinc finger protein XlCOF 28), calcium regulation (e. g. regucalcin, calmodulin) and ceramide metabolism (ceramidase B, sphingomyelinase). This study provides new information on transcriptional profiles putatively associated with ovarian egg infertility, and suggests potential mechanisms regulating early oocyte development in clams. Genes which were differentially expressed between <b>stripped</b> and <b>spawned</b> oocytes might have a pivotal role during maturation process in the gonadal duct and could be interesting targets for further functional studies aiming to make ovarian oocytes fertilizable.
