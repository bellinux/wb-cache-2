50|$|The early larval instars of some aposematic, day-flying looper moths are {{specific}} to cycads, and genus Encephalartos {{is one of their}} food plants. They include the leopard magpie (most <b>Encephalartos</b> <b>spp.,</b> other cycads, etc.), Millar's tiger (cultivated E. villosus), dimorphic tiger (cycads under forest canopy), spotted tigerlet (E. villosus), inflamed tigerlet (E. villosus), Staude's tigerlet (E. ngoyanus, cultivated E. villosus and Stangeria) and pallid grey (E. natalensis).|$|E
40|$|Encephalartos hildebrandtii is a palm-like plant which {{belongs to}} the family Cycadaceae. The plant bears large pineapple-like cones. When the cones mature they fall off and expose the seeds. The seed {{consists}} of a hard nut-like kernel covered by a thick flesh-red layer. The stems and {{the seeds of the}} plants provide a source of edible starch. The starch prepared from this plant is used as an emergency starch supply for families during famine or wherever {{there is a shortage of}} food. This paper records the development of tumours in rats fed flour prepared from the starchy kernel of Encephalartos hildebrandtii. The flour prepared from the starchy kernel of <b>Encephalartos</b> <b>spp.</b> is used by man in East Africa after several stages of preparation to remove the toxic factors (Mugera and Nderito, 1967). The starchy kernel and its flour before it is detoxicated with water is very poisonous to man and livestock (Mugera and Nderito, 1967). MATERIALS AND METHODS Batches of nuts of Encephalartos hildebrandtii were bought at various times from the coast province of Kenya and transported to the Veterinary Faculty a...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStudies of the {{pollination}} {{ecology of}} the South African cycad, Encephalartos friderici-guilielmi Lehm, were carried out to determine {{the role played by}} insects and to identify the key pollinators. Surveys of insects on the male and female cones at the time of pollination indicated that three beetle species were present in sufficient numbers during pollination to be potential pollinators, i. e. an undescribed Erotylidae sp. (Cucujoidea), Metacucujus encephalarti (Cucujoidea), and Porthetes hispidus (Curculionidae). Pollen laden specimens of all three species were found on female cones with mean pollen loads ranging between 391 and 1019 pollen grains per beetle. In behavioural experiments, individuals of P. hispidus and M. encephalarti deposited fluorescent dye on the micropyles of receptive ovules. Enclosure of pollen laden specimens of P. hispidus, M. encephalarti, or Erotylidae sp. nov. on female cones resulted in seed set that was statistically similar to open controls and significantly higher than insect exclusion treatments. These data support the conclusion that E. friderici-guilielmi is insect pollinated and provide further evidence for the role of cucujoid (Erotylidae, Boganiidae) and curculionoid (Porthetes) beetles in the pollination of <b>Encephalartos</b> <b>spp...</b>|$|E
