5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown}} that the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the AMPK activator AICAR as compared to somatostatin- 14 on cell viability and GH secretion in human GH-secreting pituitary adenomas in vitro and in rat GH 3 cells. Overnight treatment with AICAR increased phospho-(threonine- 172) AMPK levels (activated AMPK) in cultured human adenomas. As to the effects on cell viability, four adenomas out of 15 <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> AICAR (0. 4 mM) and five adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SS- 14 (100 nM). One adenoma <b>was</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> both somatostatin and AICAR. The effects of cotreatment with SS- 14 and AICAR were investigated in eight adenomas. In two adenomas, the effects of AICAR + SS- 14 did not exceed the effect of AICAR. In two adenomas which <b>were</b> not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> either AICAR or SS- 14, the cotreatment was able to reduce cell viability versus control. Two adenomas <b>were</b> not <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> any treatment. As to the effects on GH secretion, nine adenomas out of 15 <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> AICAR. Twelve adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SS- 14. Eight adenomas <b>were</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> both AICAR and SS- 14. Cotreatment exceeded the effect of single treatments in 4 out of 10 adenomas. In GH 3 cells, AICAR reduced the activity of p 70 S 6 kinase, which {{plays an important role in}} cell growth. SS- 14 did not affect significantly AMPK phosphorylation and p 70 S 6 K activity but it was able to enhance the inhibitory effect of AICAR on phospho-S 6 levels. Moreover, AICAR and SS- 14 reduced ERK phosphorylation with a different time course. The combined treatment reduced phospho-ERK levels at any time point...|$|R
25|$|In {{support of}} Zajonc's claim that affect {{does not need}} {{cognition}} to occur, Zola–Morgan conducted experiments on monkeys with lesions to the amygdala (the brain structure that <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> affective stimuli). In his experiments, Zola–Morgan proved that lesions to the amygdala impair affective functioning, but not cognitive processes. However, lesions in the hippocampus (the brain structure responsible for memory) impair cognitive functions but leave emotional responses fully functional.|$|E
25|$|The District Administration Scheme was {{implemented}} in 1982 {{with the establishment}} of a district board and a district management committee in each of the districts in Hong Kong. The aim of the scheme is to achieve a more effective co-ordination of government activities in the provision of services and facilities at the district level, ensure that the Government <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> district needs and problems and promote public participation in district affairs. From 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999, the former district boards were replaced by provisional district boards. The provisional district boards were in turn replaced on 1 January 2000, with 18 district councils.|$|E

The {{breeding}} season is usually August to January, but <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> mice populations, and some pairs breed {{twice in a}} good season. Both sexes are involved in building the nest, which is a large untidy shallow cup of sticks usually in the foliage {{near the top of}} trees, taking about two weeks to complete the nest-building. The flat nest is built of thin twigs and is around [...] across when newly built, but growing to around [...] across and [...] deep after repeated use. The nest is lined with green leaves and felted fur, though linings of grass and cow dung have also been reported. It is generally located in the canopy of an isolated or exposed tree in open country, elevated [...] or more above the ground. Black-shouldered kites have been known to use old Australian magpie, crow or raven nests.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{mechanism}} is a [...] "Jakobshavn effect", coined by Terry Hughes, {{where a small}} imbalance of forces caused by some perturbation can cause a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, even becoming afloat at the calving front, and <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> tidal changes. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up glacier via longitudinal extension in what R. Thomas calls a backforce reduction.|$|E
2500|$|Attachment in {{children}} is [...] "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Attachment also describes the function of availability, which {{is the degree to}} which the authoritative figure <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> the child's needs and shares communication with them. Childhood attachment can define characteristics that will shape the child's sense of self, their forms of emotion-regulation, and how they carry out relationships with others. Attachment is found in all mammals to some degree, especially nonhuman primates.|$|E

2500|$|Psychopharmacological {{intervention}} in disorders of impulsivity has shown evidence of positive effects; common pharmacological interventions {{include the use}} of stimulant medication, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants. ADHD has a well-established evidence base supporting the use of stimulant medication for the reduction of ADHD symptoms. Pathological gambling has also been studied in drug trials, and there is evidence that gambling <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> SSRIs and other antidepressants. [...] Evidence based pharmacological treatment for trichotillomania is not yet available, with mixed results of studies investigating the use of SSRIs, though Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has shown positive effects. Intermittent Explosive Disorder is most often treated with mood stabilizers, SSRIs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and anti-psychotics (all of which have shown positive effects). There is evidence that some pharmacological interventions are efficacious in treating substance use disorders, though their use can depend on the type substance that is abused. [...] Pharmacological treatments for SUD {{include the use of}} acamprosate, buprenorphine, disulfiram, LAAM, methadone, and naltrexone.|$|E
6000|$|From any {{prolonged}} {{study of}} Browning's poetry we become conscious of certain dominant qualities of style {{that may be}} thought of quite apart from his themes or message. That his style has the defect of its qualities has already been pointed out. Here we may appropriately indicate those qualities as positive elements of his power. His diction, rich alike in the most learned words and the most colloquial, <b>is</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>to</b> all demands. His power of phrasing runs the whole gamut from the most pellucid simplicity to the most triumphant originality. His figures of speech, drawn from all realms, are penetrating in quality, of startling aptness. Equally characteristic is his versification, varying as it does from passages of melodic smoothness and grace to lines as strident, broken, and harsh as the thought they dramatically reflect. In narration, whether in the brilliant rapidity and ease of a short poem like [...] "Hervé Riel" [...] or in the sustained flow of a long story like that of Pompilia, we find unusual skill. In disquisition, in the presentation of complicated and elusive intellectual processes, there is a quite unmatched agility and dexterity. Probably no two forms of poetry contain more of Browning's most noteworthy work than the lyric, especially the reflective love lyric, and that form which is distinctively his own, the dramatic monologue. In his best poems in this last form he has no competitor. It is in the presentation of character {{through the medium of}} dramatic monologue that he most fully reveals the unerring precision of his analysis, his lightning glance into the heart of a mystery, the ease with which he tracks a motive or mood or thought to its last hiding place, and his consequent passion and fire of sympathy or scorn.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the structure of}} demand was performed on household data classified into income groups for urban Indonesia. A demographically augmented Linearized Almost Ideal Demand System was used to estimate the structural parameters of the demand equations. Endogenous switching regression techniques yielded unbiased and consistent demand parameter estimates for the low income group, which had a large number of zeros for some food groups. Standard, seemingly unrelated, equation techniques were used to estimate the demand parameters for the other income groups.
