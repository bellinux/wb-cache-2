A non-dimension relative expression between the load and air lift is obtained by applying some assumptions for the flow, Navier Stokes equations and {{the equation of}} equilibrium. The diameter of the <b>feed</b> <b>hole</b> and the central pocket are computed {{in order to work}} in optimal regime for the case the working lift is 20 µm and the load is 20 kG. The results of the theoretical calculation are match with the experimental results and used to manufacture air-bearing slide carrier at Hanoi University of Technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of cavitation {{is still a}} problem in technical and industrial applications. Especially in automotive internal combustion engines, hydrodynamic journal bearings are used due to their favourable wearing quality and operating characteristics. Cavitation flows inside the bearings reduces the load capacity and leads to a risk of material damages. Therefore {{an understanding of the}} complex flow phenomena inside the bearing is necessary for the design development of hydrodynamic journal bearings. Experimental investigations in the fluid domain of the journal bearing are difficult to realize founded by the small dimensions of the bearing. In the recent years more and more the advantages of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are used to investigate the detail of the cavitation flows. The analysis in the paper is carried out in a two-step approach. At first an experimental investigation of journal bearing including cavitation is selected from the literature. The complex numerical model validated with the experimental measured data. In a second step, typically design parameters, such as a groove and <b>feed</b> <b>hole,</b> which are necessary to distribute the oil supply across the gap were added into the model. The paper reflects on the influence of the used design parameters and the variation of the additional supply flow rate through the <b>feed</b> <b>hole</b> regarding to cavitation effects in the bearing. Detailed pictures of the three-dimensional flow structures and the cavitation regions inside the flow film of the bearing are presented...|$|E
40|$|UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a production-level optical {{polishing}} process {{consisting of}} a moving belt that is pressed into an optical surface by a carrier wheel. The current configuration is comprised of a cylindrical carrier wheel attached to cylindrical roller bearings. As the optics market is moving towards aspheric geometry with smaller radii of curvature, geometric limitations associated with roller bearings requires {{the development of a}} modified approach to the UFF process. This thesis explores the feasibility of incorporating spherical fluid bearing elements in the UFF process as a replacement for roller bearings. Self-acting (or wedge film) and externally pressurized hydrostatic spherical fluid-film bearings were investigated for the UFF process. The self-acting bearing was modeled and analyzed using a previously developed hydrodynamic finite element computer program. The hydrostatic bearing was modeled using an analytical formulation of the Reynolds equation coupled with empirical data to account for entrance flow effects at the <b>feed</b> <b>hole</b> and to account for pressure drops in the bearing fluid supply system. Both bearing configurations predicted adequate fluid film thickness under steady load and speed. Performance tests on the UFF were completed with both bearing configurations under steady load and speed. Ball to cup seizure was observed with the self-acting configuration nearly immediately after initial load and speed application, with seizure presumably due to inadequate squeeze film resistance during the transient startup period. The hydrostatic bearing operated successfully over a wide range of applied loads and speeds employed in the current UFF process with minimal cup and ball wear. The feasibility of the hydrostatic spherical bearing element in the UFF process was subsequently demonstrated through the generation of repeatable and acceptable removal function maps which were then employed in the polishing of a planar optical surface...|$|E

40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} reduces {{maintenance costs}} on industrial machinery by reducing downtime and allowing for need-based maintenance instead of schedule-based maintenance. Currently, condition monitoring {{is not as}} widely applied on reciprocating compressors as compared to rotating compressors. However, research for monitoring various components of reciprocating compressors such as inlet and outlet valves and piston rings is conducted. There is industry interest into expanding this research to the main bearings of the compressor. Previous research on bearings focuses on either rolling element bearings or traditional journal bearings with not much information available on low speed applications of fully floating ring journal bearings as are studied in this work. The following work shows a detailed derivation of the forces acting on the main bearings during normal compressor operation based on kinematic relations and dynamic equivalence. The bearing is simulated using an adaptation of the mobility method for fully floating ring bearings found in previous research. It involves solving two simultaneous mobility calculations along with the ring speed to link the inner to the outer bearing. Experimental data of the crankshaft orbit is collected for comparison to the simulation. Condition monitoring for three different fault types is investigated through seeded fault testing: Varying lubricant viscosity, oil <b>feed</b> <b>hole</b> obstruction, and grooves in the bearing land. Principle component analysis has been shown previously {{to be a successful}} method of feature selection for classification. This is applied to several sensors and the classification results are compared. A single axis position measurement of the crankshaft shows the most promising results compared to a traditional accelerometer on the bearing housing and a novel accelerometer on the crankshaft. The single axis measurement provides a cost efficient alternative method to the two axis orbit measurement typically used for traditional journal bearings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an ElastoHydroDynamic (EHD) bearing calculation. The effect of body forces is shown to be important for highly loaded bearings in reciprocating internal combustion engines. Extension of the program to rotating machinery includes an examination of instability in the shaft bearings of a turbocharger. The development of a parameter to predict cavitation damage in a bearing is promising. Several calculation results using the program are shown. These are engine main bearing and connecting rod big-end bearings and full floating bearings for a turbocharger. The calculations on the big-end bearing if a racing engine show why the designers were having difficulty understanding the correct location for the oil <b>feed</b> <b>hole</b> position. Effects of elastic deformation, thermal deformation and manufacturing/assembly deformation all {{have a significant effect on}} the extent of the oil film. A novel calculation for a cavitation damage parameter is demonstrated successfully for a heavily loaded diesel engine bearing. The importance of body forces on the oil film due to high accelerations on certain bearings is shown to be theoretically important but not yet demonstrated. The program was written with the intention to be incorporated into the sponsoring company’s range of engine design software. A part of that development process included carrying out calculations to demonstrate to customers and present papers at conferences. The results of some of these calculations have been included in this thesis. Results of a study on the effect of crankshaft geometry on racing engine viscous friction losses were reported in a paper presented at the IDETC conference in Long Beach, 2005. This study used the first version of the software which only included Rigid Hydro Dynamics (RHD) at the time but was usable. Results of a study on stability of shaft motion in high speed turbocharger bearings were reported in a paper at the 8 th International Turbocharger conference in London, 2006. At this time the program was still only capable of RHD calculations but could now solve for multiple oil films simultaneously and sweep through the speed range. The studies on the effects of body forces and the development of a cavitation parameter will be presented in papers in the near future...|$|E

40|$|The oil {{feeding of}} a {{squeeze film damper}} through holes can be an {{interesting}} solution to improve the damper's energy dissipation capability since it increases the journal's effective squeezing surface. While groove feeding has been extensively studied, only a few works have addressed the problem of hole fed dampers. The squeeze film damper model {{may be able to}} estimate the pressure at the <b>feed</b> <b>holes</b> as well as the flow into the film. A fundamental issue in the modeling of the <b>hole</b> <b>feed</b> system is the choice of the adequate boundary conditions. Existing published models consider the supply pressure to be constant at a specific section of the hydraulic system. The pressures at the oil injection holes are then obtained via local flow balances taking into account a linear flow resistance across the feed conduits. The model developed in the present work is based on the application of the simplified form of the energy equation commonly used in hydraulics, with approximate pressure drop coefficients. As a boundary condition we impose the power supplied to the pump. The nonlinear hydraulics problem is coupled with the squeeze flow and the Newton–Raphson method is employed to solve the set of nonlinear equations. The influence of the <b>hole</b> <b>feed</b> system on the unbalance response and stability of a Jeffcott rotor is analyzed in regards to the number of <b>feed</b> <b>holes</b> and the power supplied to the pump.

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), {{the major}} target pest of {{transgenic}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, remains susceptible to Bt cotton in China at present.

We examined the behavioural responses of H. armigera to Bt and non-Bt cottons to determine whether behavioural avoidance to Bt cotton may be present. In oviposition choice tests, the number of eggs on non-Bt cotton plants {{was significantly higher than}} on Bt cotton plants. Similarly, in no-choice tests, Bt cotton plants attracted significantly fewer eggs compared with non-Bt cotton plants. H. armigera neonates showed higher dispersal and lower establishment on Bt cotton than on non-Bt cotton.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} sweetpotato {{resistance to}} sweet potato weevils (Cylas spp.) and investigated the phytochemicals that mediated this defence. New Kawogo, LIR 302 and ARA 228 {{were shown to}} be the most resistant based on stem and root damage. Significant differences were observed on the number of faecal droppings, <b>feeding</b> <b>holes</b> and eggs laid on the root in a choice and no-choice bioassays confirming that New Kawogo, LIR 302 and ARA 228 affected development and emergence of adult weevils. Six hydroxycinnamic acid esters, including hexadecylcaffeic, hexadecylcoumaric, octadecylcaffeic, octadecylcoumaric, heptadecylcaffeic and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid esters were identified on the root surface and amounts of these differed significantly between resistant and susceptible varieties. The mean number of C. puncticollis and C. brunneus <b>feeding</b> <b>holes,</b> faecal droppings and egg laid on the root core were significantly different among the root cores treated with synthetic hydroxycinnamic acid esters. The study also showed that there were significant differences in the root volatiles of resistant and susceptible variety both before and after infestation. The larval survival of sweetpotato weevil was significantly affected by hydroxycinnamic acid esters treatment and Bt-toxin applied on the diet. There was also significant differences in percentage sweetpotato weevil root infestation among genotypes of the segregating population. The genotype by environment (GxE) interaction effect was also significant on the sweetpotato weevil damage on the stem portion of the sweetpotato vine indicating that weevil stem damage is dependent on the season. The mean number of sweetpotato weevil <b>feeding</b> <b>holes</b> differed significantly on the root of the genotypes of the segregating population in the feeding and oviposition bioassay. There was significant difference in total hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) esters among the genotypes of the segregating population. The distribution of genotype mean total HCA ester concentration was skewed to the left and only one progeny, NKB 257, had higher total HCA ester concentration than New Kawogo, the resistant mother used in the crossing. A weak but significant correlation between total HCA ester concentration and sweetpotato weevil root damage was observed signifying that resistance to sweetpotato weevils depended on other factors as well. The results are discussed in terms of how they might be incorporated into integrated pest management of sweetpotato weevils...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} rotor {{flexibility and}} shaft speeds, turbomachinery undergoes large dynamic loads and displacements. Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) are {{a type of}} fluid film bearing {{used in rotating machinery}} to attenuate rotor vibration, provide mechanical isolation, and/or to tune the placement of system critical speeds. Industry has a keen interest in designing SFDs that are small, lightweight, and mechanically simple. To achieve this, one must have a full understanding of how various design features affect the SFD forced performance. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis, experimental and theoretical, of a short (L= 25. 4 mm) open ends SFD design incorporating three lubricant <b>feed</b> <b>holes</b> (without a circumferential feed groove). The damper radial clearance (c= 127 ?m), L/D ratio (0. 2), and lubricant (ISO VG 2) have similar dimensions and properties as in actual SFDs for aircraft engine applications. The work presents the identification of experimental force coefficients (K, C, M) from a 2 -DOF system model for circular and elliptical orbit tests over the frequency range ?= 10 - 250 Hz. The whirl amplitudes range from r= 0. 05 c- 0. 6 c, while the static eccentricity ranges from eS= 0 - 0. 5 c. Analysis of the measured film land pressures evidence that the deep end grooves (provisions for installation of end seals) contribute to the generation of dynamic pressures in an almost purely inertial fashion. Film land dynamic pressures show both viscous and inertial effects. Experimental pressure traces show the occurrence of significant air ingestion for orbits with amplitudes r> 0. 4 c, and lubricant vapor cavitation when pressures drop to the lubricant saturation pressure (PSAT~ 0 bar). Identified force coefficients show the damper configuration offers direct damping coefficients that are more sensitive to increases in static eccentricity (eS) than to increases in amplitude of whirl (r). On the other hand, SFD inertia coefficients are more sensitive to increases in the amplitude of whirl than to increases in static eccentricity. For small amplitude motions, the added or virtual mass of the damper is as large as 27 % of the bearing cartridge mass (MBC= 15. 15 kg). The identified force coefficients are shown to be insensitive to the orbit type (circular or elliptical) and the number of open <b>feed</b> <b>holes</b> (3, 2, or 1). Comparisons of damping coefficients between a damper employing a circumferential feed groove 1 and the current damper employing <b>feed</b> <b>holes</b> (no groove), show that both dampers offer similar damping coefficients, irrespective of the orbit amplitude or static eccentricity. On the other hand, the grooved damper shows much larger inertia force coefficients, at least ~ 60 % more. Predictions from a physics based model agree well with the experimental damping coefficients, however for large orbit motion, over predict inertia coefficients due to the model neglecting convective inertia effects. Credence is given to the validity of the linearized force coefficients by comparing the actual dissipated energy to the estimated dissipated energy derived from the identified force coefficients. The percent difference is below 25 % for all test conditions, and in fact is shown to be less than 5 % for certain combinations of orbit amplitude (r), static eccentricity (eS), and whirl frequency (?) ...|$|R
