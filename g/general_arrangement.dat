5|$|Benedictine monasticism, {{present in}} England from the 6th century, was greatly {{extended}} after the Norman Invasion in 1066. There {{were also a}} number of Cistercian abbeys, but these were often in remote areas and not destined to become cathedrals. The Romanesque architecture of Normandy replaced that of Saxon England, the buildings being generally larger and more spacious, the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of monastic buildings following those of the great Abbey of Cluny. The Romanesque style, of which the English form is often known as Norman architecture, developed local characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E

25|$|Freezer {{trawlers}} – The {{majority of}} trawlers operating on high sea waters are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, {{allowing them to}} stay at sea for extended periods of time.

25|$|Clive Palmer first {{announced}} {{the project in}} a press conference on 30 April 2012, following the signature of a memorandum of understanding with state-owned Chinese shipyard CSC Jinling ten days before.

25|$|The {{second example}} {{retained}} the same <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> but differed considerably in constructional detail. The Fabre lattice girders {{were replaced by}} conventional spars, the single interplane struts replaced by more conventional paired struts and the tail surfaces altered to a cruciform arrangement, with the rudder divided into two sections {{above and below the}} stabiliser. The trim of the aircraft could be altered on the ground by adjusting the bracing cables for the tail surfaces.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} chainrings with {{half-step}} {{differences between the}} larger two and multi-range differences between the smaller two, e.g. chainrings 24-42-46 and cogset 12-14-16-18-21-24-28-32-36. This <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> is suitable for touring with most gear changes being made using the rear derailleur and occasional fine tuning using the two large chainrings. The small chainring (granny gear) is a bailout for handling steeper hills, but it requires some anticipation {{in order to use}} it effectively.|$|E
25|$|The Sylvania, {{like her}} sisters, was {{originally}} built with a <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of three cargo holds located both to aft and {{forward of the}} superstructure, the passenger spaces located between them, with tourist class dominating the passenger spaces. Despite {{the dominance of the}} tourist class, her interiors were built to the elegant standards maintained by Cunard on their previous ships. Notable public spaces included a cinema with a balcony and even a soda fountain. The ship was also built with full air-conditioning.|$|E

25|$|The <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the BN-1 {{is similar}} to that of the Comper Swift in {{particular}} G-ABUS, an aircraft that Desmond Norman was associated with along with fellow de Havilland Technical School apprentice, Tony Cole, that they jointly acquired in 1948 and restored to flying condition. In part this was an attempt to restart the club flying scene that had been prevalent in pre-war England. The BN-1 can be seen as the first steps towards making cheap aviation available to all as the BN-2 Islander was later to achieve for developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Most, if not all, of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra {{were known}} of {{in some form}} or other before Kepler. A small stellated dodecahedron appears in a marble tarsia (inlay panel) on the floor of St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, Italy. It dates from the 15th century and is {{sometimes}} attributed to Paolo Uccello. In his Perspectiva corporum regularium (Perspectives of the regular solids), a book of woodcuts published in the 16th century, Wenzel Jamnitzer depicts the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron. It is clear from the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the book that he regarded only the five Platonic solids as regular.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} facilities aboard Titanic {{aimed to}} meet the highest standards of luxury. According to Titanics <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a manor house or an English country house.|$|E

25|$|Tuna {{purse seiners}} are large purse seiners, {{normally}} over 45 metres, {{equipped to handle}} large and heavy purse seines for tuna. They have the same <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned {{at the top of}} the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the power block is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search for tuna schools. On the deck are three drum purse seine winches and a power block, with other specific winches to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{elements of}} the original structure include the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the interior: three naves separated by three ultra-semicircular arches over Corinthian capitals, and the apse formed of a single rectangular chapel. The many geometrical decorative elements are also original and more numerous than those of any other Iberian monument of the period. The interior {{is divided into three}} sections supported by three arcs, supported by cylindrical columns, with polymorphic capitals. A triumphal arch divides the chapel from the main altar, while the roofs are supported by beam timbers. The high altar is decorated in a carved-wooden retable, gilded in gold, with an image of Saint Peter over the altar. The naves {{on either side of the}} main altar are decorated with carved-wooden chapels covered in gold.|$|E
25|$|The fort was {{oriented}} {{in such a}} {{way that}} its main gate, or porta praetoria faced south-south-east, that is away from the limes but towards Nida. The central structure of the fort was a large principia, a central plaza surrounded by housing or offices for the higher officers, which was flanked by a roofed hall for assemblies of the fort's garrison. The praetentura (front part of the fort) contained the praetorium (the fort commander's residence) to the west of the via praetoria, and a large horreum (grain store) to its east. The rest of the fort's interior, today a park-like area of grass and trees, should be visualised as packed with further buildings: stables, magazines, workshops and, of course, the actual troop quarters, subdivided into contubernia. Two such troop barracks have been reconstructed in the southeast part of the fort. For the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> and terminology of Roman fort architecture, see Castra.|$|E

Again, the branch is concerned with all that relates to the education of officers, and to appointments, promotions, leave, retirements, removals, restorations, services, and claims of officers, good service and other pensions, and generally of honours, distinctions, decorations, medals, etc. The establishment and internal economy of the Corps of Royal Marines, and the <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> and regulations of the Coastguard and Reserves, are also within the scope of this branch, with other work relating to the personnel.|$|R
25|$|Almost {{everywhere}} {{the rates}} from the shipping points used exclusively, or almost exclusively, by the Standard are relatively {{lower than the}} rates from the shipping points of its competitors. Rates have been made low to let the Standard into markets, or they have been made high to keep its competitors out of markets. Trifling differences in distances are made an excuse for large differences in rates favorable to the Standard Oil Co., while large differences in distances are ignored where they are against the Standard. Sometimes connecting roads prorate on oil—that is, make through rates which are lower than the combination of local rates; sometimes they refuse to prorate; but in either case the result of their policy is to favor the Standard Oil Co. Different methods are used in different places and under different conditions, but {{the net result is}} that from Maine to California the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of open rates on petroleum oil is such as to give the Standard an unreasonable advantage over its competitors.|$|E

The ship was named after the Battle of Serenity Valley, where then-Sergeant Malcolm Reynolds and then-Corporal Zoe Alleyne were among the few survivors on the losing side. It is revealed in [...] "Bushwhacked" [...] that the Battle of Serenity Valley is widely considered to have sealed the fate of the Independents.|$|E
500|$|Alongside BAe (which at {{the time}} was not part of Airbus) were MBB, Fokker-VFW and Aérospatiale. The design within the JET study that was carried forward was the JET2 (163 passengers), which then became the Airbus S.A1/2/3 series (Single Aisle), before {{settling}} on the A320 name for its launch in 1984. Previously, Hawker Siddeley had produced a design called the HS.134 [...] "Airbus" [...] in 1965, an evolution of the HS.121 (formerly DH.121) Trident, which shared much of the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the later JET3 study design.
