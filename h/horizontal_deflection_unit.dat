The key to this experience is visible laser light in red, green and blue, projected on screen with the aid of <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>units.</b> In this paper, a primarily <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> system in the form of a rotating polygonal scanner is decribed. The design of this scanner assembly combines a double sherical air bearing with integreated polygonal mirror for deflection and a high torque inside drive for quickly reaching high rotation.

40|$|At the Fermilab A 0 photoinjector facility, bunch-length {{measurements}} of the laser micropulse and the e-beam micropulse {{have been done in}} the past with a fast single-sweep module of the Hamamatsu C 5680 streak camera with an intrinsic shot-to-shot trigger jitter of 10 - 20 ps. We have upgraded the camera system with the synchroscan module tuned to 81. 25 MHz to provide synchronous summing capability with less than 1. 5 ps FWHM trigger jitter and a phase-locked delay box to provide phase stability of ~ 1 ps over 10 s of minutes. These steps allowed us to measure both the UV laser pulse train at 263 nm and the e-beam via optical transition radiation (OTR). Due to the low electron beam energies and OTR signals, we typically summed over 50 micropulses with 0. 25 - 1 nC per micropulse. The phase-locked delay box allowed us to assess chromatic temporal effects and instigated another upgrade to an all-mirror input optics barrel. In addition, we added a slow sweep <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> plug-in <b>unit</b> to provide dual-sweep capability for the streak camera. We report on a series of measurements made during the commissioning of these upgrades including bunch-length and phase effects using the emittance exchange beamline and simultaneous imaging of a UV drive laser component, OTR, and the 800 nm diagnostics laser.

Laboratory tests for controlled low strength materials with bottom ash and recycled in-situ soil have been carried out. The optimum mixing ratios were 25 %– 45 % of in-situ soil, 30 % of bottom ash, 10 %– 20 % of fly ash, 0 %– 3 % of crumb rubber, 3 % of cement, and 22 % of water. Each mixture satisfied the standard specifications: a minimum 20 cm of flowability and 127 kPa of unconfined compressive strength. The average secant modulus (E 50) was (0. 07 – 0. 08) qu. The ranges of the internal friction angle and cohesion for mixtures were 36. 5 °– 46. 6 ° and 49. 1 – 180 kPa, respectively. The pH of all of the mixtures was over 12, which is strongly alkaline.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{observed}} during earthquakes that the soft-storey failure of an upper floor of a building results in large impact load acting on structural members of the lower storeys. It may further lead to progressive collapse of the whole structure substantially intensifying human losses and material damages. The aim {{of this paper is}} to show the results of a numerical analysis focused on the behaviour of multi-storey steel frame building that suffers from a soft-storey failure under ground motion excitation. A numerical model of the structure was created in FEM computer software and was exposed to an impact that would have been generated after a soft-storey failure due to falling of the upper floors. During the analysis, the whole structure was exposed to ground motion excitation and different moments have been chosen for the impact so as to estimate the most critical moment for the structure. The results of the study show that not only the value of the impact force is crucial but also the moment when the impact occurs. This is due to the fact that <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> of the supporting members (steel columns) varies during the time of the excitation. It {{has been observed}} that the most critical moment for the building for being subjected to a vertical impact is when the <b>horizontal</b> <b>deflection</b> is close to its peak...|$|R
