5000|$|The term's meaning {{has split}} {{depending}} on political persuasion. For many conservatives, the term {{has become part}} of a political theory that the USA is developing an increasingly large 'moocher' class who depend on government benefits paid for by taxes from richer or harder-working citizens, pay no taxes themselves and vote themselves higher benefits paid for from the taxes of others. This has led prominent conservative politicians such as Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann to propose that poorer citizens should have their taxes increased to make them more aware of the problems of excessive taxation and so-called big government. 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney commented that [...] "There are 47 {{percent of the people who}} will vote liberal no matter what...believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That's an entitlement. The government should give it to them. And they will vote <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>president</b> no matter what...47% of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect...I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." [...] Perry, announcing his presidential campaign, commented [...] "Spreading the wealth punishes success...we’re dismayed at the injustice that nearly half of all Americans don’t even pay any income tax." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It's {{just about}} how I don't {{like to talk}} about {{politics}}. I mean there's politics in everything, and it's not necessarily governmental politics. There's who's going to sleep with whom to get ahead, who's going to do this to get that. ... I see it in the church, everyday life, government. That's what I'm talking about, not about the stupid crap that's going on with guys in suits and their views and their lobbies and their this and their that. Korn has never been a real political band. I'm political to a point where it affects human life, from global warming to abortion issues to my gun rights, stuff like that. Those are the kind of politics that I care about. The other BS with taxes or who's going to be ahead elections, I don't really care. Obviously even going out and voting doesn't really count, it's all based down to these Electoral College votes. What the hell can I do? It's a shame. I just wait <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>president</b> {{to get out of the}} office, and hopefully we can find someone that can do a better job. But what do we really know? Maybe he is doing the right thing, you don't know. We are all so clouded with what goes on. You understand if we didn't have oil, the United States of America would cease to exist and we'd all die? If you really think about it, oil is what keeps us all going, gets us our medicine, gets us our food, gets us every single thing." [...] - Jonathan Davis ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout 2013, McCain decried Republican isolationist - or {{at least}} non-interventionist - drift, {{exemplified}} by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin Amash were [...] "wacko birds" [...] and by his April 2013 remark that [...] "there are times these days when I feel that I {{have more in common}} on foreign policy with President Obama than I do with some in my own party." [...] In May 2013, McCain made an unannounced trip to Syria in the midst of Syrian civil war, crossing the border near Kilis in Turkey. McCain, a vocal proponent of U.S. military intervention in the conflict {{on the side of the}} anti-government forces, met with General Salim Idris of the Free Syrian Army and others. He called for arming them with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no-fly zone over the country. Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese Shiite pilgrims the year before, McCain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other. [...] Following the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack, McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and complained that the action the Obama administration was contemplating might just be a [...] "pinprick". In early September 2013, after meeting with Obama at the White House, he indicated support for Obama's request to Congress that it authorize a military response, saying [...] "If the Congress were to reject a resolution like this, after the president of the United States has already committed to action, the consequences would be catastrophic, in that the credibility of this country with friends and adversaries alike would be shredded. And there would be not only implications <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>president,</b> but for future presidencies as well." [...] and in September 2013 indicated support for Obama's request to Congress that it authorize a military response. He then cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of authorizing a military response.|$|E

25|$|As the {{industry}} structure was deeply fractionalised, the consensus was that consolidation was necessary. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> purpose, <b>President</b> Boris Yeltsin created the VPK-MAPO (Military Industrial Complex – Moscow Aircraft Production Association), which included some key {{companies such as}} Mikoyan.

50|$|The Bellamy salute, {{adopted in}} 1892 to {{accompany}} the American Pledge of Allegiance, bore a resemblance to the Nazi Salute. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, <b>President</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem in the United States, instead of the Bellamy salute. This was done when Congress officially adopted the Flag Code on 22 June 1942.|$|R
40|$|Like old generals, American {{lawyers and}} judges {{have spent the last}} quarter-century {{fighting}} the last big war. The war, of course, was Vietnam and its constitutional counterpart was Watergate. The enemy was the Imperial President, Bad King Richard; and victory came when Nixon unconditionally surrendered after his smashing defeat in the Tapes Case. The King was dead! Long live [...] , the Court. But the Tapes Case opinion reflected a troubling imperialism of its own-judicial imperialism-and featured remarkably sloppy reasoning. The Justices reached the right result but for the wrong reasons. Ever since, Americans have refracted everything through the twisted prism of this great case, and so the law of the Presidency today is badly distorted. There may still be time to set the law straight-doubtless too late <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>President,</b> but perhaps in time for the next. The first step is to see where the law of the Presidency began to go wrong-in the landmark Tapes Case...|$|E

50|$|The Whiskey Ring {{was seen}} by many as a sign of {{corruption}} under the Republican governments that took power across the nation following the American Civil War. General Orville E.

Grant, although not directly involved in the ring, came to be seen as emblematic of Republican corruption, and later scandals involving his Secretary of War William W. Belknap only confirmed that perception. The Whiskey Ring scandal, along with other alleged abuses of power by the Republican party, contributed to national weariness of Reconstruction, which ended Grant's presidency with the Compromise of 1877.|$|R
