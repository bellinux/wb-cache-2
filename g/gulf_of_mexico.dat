5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> A low pressure area in the northwest <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E

5|$|A trough {{extended}} from the northern <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August. The trough remained nearly stationary, spawning Tropical Storm Bertha in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> and a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} South Carolina. The weak low pressure area off South Carolina drifted southward, with its associated deep convection increasing in organization on August 4. By 1800UTC on August 5, the system had acquired sufficient organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Three, while located about 175miles (280km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June, a mid-level {{center of}} {{circulation}} formed {{in association with}} a quasi-stationary cold front that stretched across northern Florida and the extreme northeast <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> On June20, a weak and disorganized {{area of low pressure}} developed in conjunction with the front and it passed by Tampa Bay, Florida the following day. Upon moving into the eastern <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> there was little convection on observed on satellite imagery, although a distinguishable wind-shift was noted by an offshore buoy. However, by June23, the presence of deep convection atop a circulation had become well-defined enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify the disturbance as a tropical depression, while centered 330mi (535km) southwest of Cape Coral, Florida. Moving generally west to west-northwestward across the central <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the National Hurricane Center sent a reconnaissance plane into the tropical depression at 1500UTC on June24, at which time winds of 60mph (95km/h) were found. About three hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie.|$|E

5|$|The {{system that}} would become Hurricane Alicia {{originated}} from {{the western end of}} a frontal trough that stretched from New England to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> Satellite pictures showed a meso-scale low pressure area that had moved off the Alabama and Mississippi coasts near the trough and was possibly the precursor system to Alicia.
