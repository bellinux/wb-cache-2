40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} {{currently}} the commonest pelvic malignancy affecting American women, most of whom share the same pathophysiologic basis, that is, unopposed estrogenic stimulation. The initial result of hyperestrogenism {{is the development of}} endometrial hyperplasia, which is reversible in most cases by appropriate hormonal therapy. Persistent stimulation eventually leads to atypical hyperplasia with nuclear atypia and invasive carcinoma. Because there is no cost-effective screening method for the detection of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, it is essential to survey the high-risk population with appropriate diagnostic techniques. After diagnosis, therapy should be individualized based on pathologic findings (cell type and histologic grade) and extent of disease (International Federation of <b>Gynaecologists</b> <b>and</b> <b>Obstetricians</b> stage, depth of myometrial invasion, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node status). Recent studies suggest that sex hormone receptors and nuclear DNA ploidy patterns provide useful prognostic information independent of histologic grade...|$|R

40|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} the most common gynaecological {{malignancy}} and its incidence is increasing. In 1998, international federation of <b>gynaecologists</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetricians</b> (FIGO) required a change from clinical to surgical staging in endometrial cancer, introducing pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy.

There is agreement about the prognostic value of lymphadenectomy, but its extent, therapeutic value, and benefits in terms of survival are still matter of debate, especially in early stages. Accurate preoperative risk stratification can guide to the appropriate type of surgery by selecting patients who benefit of lymphadenectomy. However, available preoperative and intraoperative investigations are not highly accurate methods to detect lymph nodes and a complete surgical staging remains the most precise method to evaluate extrauterine spread of the disease. Laparotomy has always been considered the standard approach for endometrial cancer surgical staging.

40|$|Background: The {{implementation}} of maternal health guidelines remains unsatisfactory, even for simple, well established interventions. In settings where most births occur in health facilities, {{as is the}} case in Kerala, India, preventing maternal mortality is linked to quality of care improvements. Context: Evidence-informed quality standards (QS), including quality statements and measurable structure and process indicators, are one innovative way of tackling the guideline implementation gap. Having adopted a zero tolerance policy to maternal deaths, the Government of Kerala worked in partnership with the Kerala Federation of <b>Obstetricians</b> & <b>Gynaecologists</b> (KFOG) <b>and</b> NICE International to select the clinical topic, develop and initiate {{implementation of}} the first clinical QS for reducing maternal mortality in the state. Description of practice: The NICE QS development framework was adapted to the Kerala context, with local ownership being a key principle. Locally generated evidence identified post-partum haemorrhage as the leading cause of maternal death, and as the key priority for the QS. A multidisciplinary group (including policy-makers, <b>gynaecologists</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetricians,</b> nurses <b>and</b> administrators) was established. Multi-stakeholder workshops convened by the group ensured that the statements, derived from global and local guidelines, and their corresponding indicators were relevant and acceptable to clinicians and policy-makers in Kerala. Furthermore, it helped identify practical methods for implementing the standards and monitoring outcomes. Lessons learned: An independent evaluation of the project highlighted the equal importance of a strong evidence-base and an inclusive development process. There is no one-size-fits-all process for QS development; a principle-based approach might be a better guide for countries to adapt global evidence to their local context...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} physiotherapeutic {{treatment}} of urinary stress incontinence in England. DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING [...] All 192 English district health authorities. SUBJECTS [...] One physiotherapist from each district who was {{primarily concerned with}} urinary incontinence. A consensus view was requested. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Responses to questionnaire and analysis of a visual analogue scale to indicate effectiveness. RESULTS [...] There was a 98 % response rate. Treatment was often by senior physiotherapists (108 senior I grade or above) who, in 117 districts, claimed {{to have made a}} specialty of treating the condition. <b>Gynaecologists</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetricians</b> were far more likely to refer patients than any other agency (147 respondents said that they were the commonest source of referral). One hundred and fifty four respondents stated that physiotherapy was usually used as the first line of treatment. Pelvic floor exercises and interferential treatment were most commonly used (by 178 and 144 respondents respectively) and thought to be the most effective, especially in combination, though various techniques were used in applying them. Positive motivation (108), recent onset of symptoms (55), and youth (40) were viewed optimistically, and obesity (60), previous surgery (59), prolapse (42), and a chronic cough (36) were considered to be bad prognostic features. The number of patients treated varied greatly (range 10 - 360) between districts and was poorly correlated with catchment size (correlation coefficient 0. 3). CONCLUSIONS [...] As physiotherapists are treating considerable numbers of patients with stress incontinence research is urgently needed to produce efficacy data to enable rationalisation of resources to cater for the whole population...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess {{level of}} {{contamination}} of neckwear worn by <b>gynaecologists</b> <b>and</b> <b>obstetricians</b> during routine working week. DESIGN [...] Multicentre randomised double blind crossover trial. Participants wore the same conventional ties for three days in one week and bow ties {{for the same period}} in second week. SETTING [...] Two teaching and three district general hospitals in the midlands, Wales, and north England. SUBJECTS [...] 15 registrars and senior registrars. INTERVENTIONS [...] A swab soaked in sterile saline was taken from specific area on ties at end of first and third working days and sent in transport medium for culture on chocolatised blood and MacConkey agar for 48 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Level of bacteriological growth assessed semiquantitatively (0 for no contamination; for heavy contamination) after swabs had been cultured. At end of study the participants completed a questionnaire to assess their attitude toward wearing different types of necktie. RESULTS [...] 12 doctors (80 %) completed the study. Although bow ties were significantly less contaminated at end of first working day (z = - 2. 354, p = 0. 019), this difference was not maintained; {{there was no difference in}} {{level of contamination}} on third day. Level of contamination did not increase between first and third day of wearing the same garment. One of the 10 doctors who returned the questionnaire found the bow tie very uncomfortable. All participants would consider wearing a bow tie if it proved to be less contaminated than a conventional tie. CONCLUSIONS [...] Although a significant difference in contamination was established between conventional and bow ties on first day of study, this difference was not confirmed on third day and there is unlikely to be any real association between tie type and bacterial contamination. Because of its negative image and difficulty to tie, the bow tie will probably remain a minority fashion...|$|R
40|$|Treatment with {{aromatase}} inhibitors for {{postmenopausal women}} {{with breast cancer}} {{has been shown to}} reduce or obviate invasive procedures such as hysteroscopy or curettage associated with tamoxifen-induced endometrial abnormalities. The side effect of upfront aromatase inhibitors, diminished estrogen synthesis, is similar to that seen with the natural events of aging. The consequences often include vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) and vaginal dryness and atrophy, which in turn may result in cystitis and vaginitis. Not surprisingly, painful intercourse (dyspareunia) and loss of sexual interest (decreased libido) frequently occur as well. Various interventions, both non-hormonal and hormonal, are currently available to manage these problems. The purpose of the present review is to provide the practitioner with a wide array of management options to assist in treating the sexual consequences of aromatase inhibitors. The suggestions in this review are based on recent literature and on the recommendations set forth both by the North American Menopause Association and in the clinical practice guidelines of the Society of <b>Gynaecologists</b> <b>and</b> <b>Obstetricians</b> of Canada. The complexity of female sexual dysfunction necessitates a biopsychosocial approach to assessment and management alike, with interventions ranging from education and lifestyle changes to sexual counselling, pelvic floor therapies, sexual aids, medications, and dietary supplements—all of which have been reported to have a variable, but often successful, effect on symptom amelioration. Although the use of specific hormone replacement—most commonly local estrogen, and less commonly, systemic estrogen with or without an androgen, progesterone, or the additional of an androgen in an estrogenized woman (or a combination) —may be highly effective, the concern remains that in patients with estrogen-dependent breast cancer, including those receiving anti-estrogenic adjuvant therapies, the use of these hormones may be attended with potential risk. Therefore, non-hormonal alternatives should in all cases be initially tried with the expectation that symptomatic relief can often be achieved...|$|R
