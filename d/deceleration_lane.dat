50|$|Junction 0 (and 8 of the M5) was {{originally}} a free-flowing trumpet-style junction, then {{converted to a}} roundabout with M5 flyover when the M5 was widened in the 1990s. Junction 1, where the M50 meets the A38, is a partial cloverleaf. Junction 2 has full slips roads from the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> into the slip roads save the kinked eastbound exit to local roads. Junction 3 consists of dual-carriageway-style 90° exits due to cost, low traffic volume and the style of road; however {{this has been the}} scene of various accidents.|$|E

50|$|The pit {{straight}} was redesigned: it was widened by 13m (giving {{room for}} a <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane),</b> the small kink removed by straightening the approach, and the Dunlop curve realigned, steepened and eased, moving the Dunlop Bridge. This all {{had the effect of}} shortening the lap by 31 metres. The grandstand was demolished and rebuilt with new spectator terraces beyond a ditch between the track. The postwar pits were also torn down and a new 3-storey complex built giving more space for crews and with hospitality suites above (although there was still no barrier out to the racing line). This limited the number of starters to 52, down from 60.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} year the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) set about making {{extensive}} track improvements and infrastructure changes - the pit straight was redesigned and widened to remove the kink just before start/finish line, and give room for a <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane.</b> The pits complex was pulled down and rebuilt giving more room to the teams, but thereby limiting spaces to only 52 starters rather than the previous 60. The grandstand was demolished and rebuilt with new spectator terraces and a wide ditch {{between them and the}} race-track. Track safety technology and practices evolved slowly until Formula 1 driver Jackie Stewart organized a campaign to advocate for better safety measures 10 years later. Stewart's campaign gained momentum after the deaths of Lorenzo Bandini and Jim Clark.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project aimed at validating the interactive fixed-base driving simulator of the Interuniversity Research Center for Road Safety (CRISS) to enable its use for design of decelerations lanes, in {{function of the}} lane length. The research was developed in two phases. In the first one a field study was carried out on a section of a real highway to study driver’s behavior in deceleration lanes with three different lengths. The second one was a experiment using the driving simulator of CRISS. Forty-two drivers drove in the simulator on three configurations of the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane.</b> Trajectories and speeds in field and in simulator were analyzed. The driver’s behavior in terms of deceleration rate was also analyzed. The analysis revealed that the average trajectory is developed in the same phases in field and in simulation. Taper is also used in a correct way in reality {{as well as in}} the driving simulation. Before arriving at the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane,</b> speeds in virtual reality are higher than those in field measurement. This was probably determined by the fact that no inertial force on the driver is transferred in the driving simulator. The inability of driver to discern roadway scenario long distances ahead may have also contributed. Into the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane,</b> the perception of the scenario is better, and consequently speeds were similar than field data. No relation between the deceleration rates and the lane length were found in reality as well as in driving simulator...|$|E
50|$|This {{also means}} that the Mombach {{interchange}} {{is one of the}} few that lie on a bridge. The bridge was originally designed to accommodate a highway to be built through the interchange, so very short acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes</b> were built there. Several street lights were installed to illuminate the junction, but, for cost reasons, these remain dark today. Also, two traffic control systems at the Mombach interchange have been out of operation since the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The initial MIS was {{primarily}} transit-oriented in scope. The recommendations included light rail, highway improvements, pedestrian/bicycle facility improvements, enhanced Transportation Demand Management (TDM), Intelligent transportation system (ITS) measures. It also recommended safety improvements such as acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes,</b> wider shoulders. The initial MIS {{did not call}} for additional highway lanes. The Federal Highway Administration and CDOT were troubled by this omission, and leaders of all four agencies agreed that the MIS placed {{too much emphasis on}} transit.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, {{construction}} began on a third lane and a 12-foot shoulder lane between the Fairfax Drive entrance ramp (near George Mason Drive in Ballston) to I-66 west and the Sycamore Street ramp, a 1.9 mile distance. The entrance ramp acceleration lane and the exit ramp <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes</b> were lengthened to form a continuous lane between both ramps. The 12-foot shoulder lane can carry emergency vehicles {{and can be used}} in emergency situations. This project was completed in December 2011.|$|R
30|$|At diverge segment, {{the most}} {{significant}} difference from basic and merge segments is that the DR and the vertical variation h {{are related to the}} 1 st component. Higher DR can significantly interrupt mainline traffic since it is necessary to pass through several lanes to move onto the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> for driving vehicles. Furthermore, higher h can make lane-changing maneuvers more difficult.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} safety impact of the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> at the Upstream Zone of at-grade U-turns on 4 -lane divided Thai highways. A substantial speed reduction is required by vehicles for diverging and making U-turn, and the deceleration lanes are provided for this purpose. These lanes are also providing a storage space for the U-turning vehicles to avoid unnecessary blockage of through lanes and reduce the potential of rear-end collisions. The safety at the U-turn is greatly influenced by the proper or improper use of the deceleration lanes. Subject to their length, full or partial speed adjustment can occur within the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> also the road users’ behavior is influenced. To assess the safety impact, the four groups of U-turns with the varying length of deceleration lanes were identified. Owing to limitation of availability and reliability of road crash data in Thailand, widely accepted Traffic Conflict Technique (TCT) was used as an alternative and proactive methodology. The U-turns’ geometric data, traffic conflicts and volume data were recorded in the field at 8 locations, 8 hours per location. Severity Conflict Rate (SCR) was assessed by applying a weighing factor (based on the severity grades according to the Czech TCT) to the observed conflicts related to the conflicting traffic volumes. A comparative higher value of SCR represents a lower level of safety. According to the results, increase in the functional length of the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> yields a lower value of SCR and a higher level of the road safety...|$|E
40|$|Acceleration and {{deceleration}} lanes are {{the critical}} parts which ensure safety maneuver between main lane and ramp. Due to terrain constraints, the left exit or left entry ramp {{used in the}} interchange design doesn’t accord with the right-hand driving habits and drivers’ expectations. To ensure the safety and efficiency of the operation, it’s necessary to study the safety length of the acceleration and deceleration lanes on left-side ramp considering the vehicles’ operating characteristic of merging or diverging. According to the headway distribution of main lane in merging area, the probability model of vehicles in the acceleration lane merged into the main lane was established based on the acceptance gap theory. The length of the acceleration lane can be calculated under the different operating speed and merging probabilities. Based on Secondary reduction theory, the required safety length of <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> driving from the inner lane to the left-side exit ramp was determined to ensure that those diverging vehicles do not affect {{the operation of the}} vehicles on the main lanes. The recommended length of acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> will provide a technical sustain to the safety design of interchange...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of road geometry design is the provision of safe distances to allow motorists to change speed from low or moderate speed flows to high speed flows, and vice versa. Design guidelines for determining acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> lengths were evaluated to understand the basis for these designs from across the world. It was found that many current guidelines are based on data collected over 40 years ago. Vehicle acceleration and deceleration characteristics have changed over this period {{and the majority of}} the Australian vehicle fleet is less than 10 years old. Data was collected from a number of sites in the Newcastle and Central Coast regions of New South Wales using a combination of video and GPS to measure the performance of passenger vehicles and an associated driver characteristic. The GPS recorded real position at regular time intervals which was used to calculate acceleration or deceleration rates of passenger vehicles. The results were used to determine a driver characteristic which indicated how much of the acceleration and deceleration vehicle performance the average driver was willing to use. An acceleration model and a deceleration model were developed based on vehicle dynamics. The models output distance and time required to reach target speeds. The parameters for each model to reproduce the guidelines used in the Austroads Guide to Road Design were derived. Preliminary results indicated that most drivers tend to use all of the acceleration or <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> length currently provided, rather than to utilise the increased vehicle performance available to them. An important feature of the models is that they allow for the use of actual vertical geometry instead of average grades used in former models. ...|$|E
30|$|This study aims at {{identifying}} crash-influencing factors by facility type of Nagoya Urban Expressway, {{considering the}} interaction of geometry, traffic flow, and ambient conditions. Crash rate (CR) model is firstly developed separately at four facility types: basic, merge, and diverge segments and sharp curve. Traffic flows are thereby categorized, {{and based on the}} traffic categories, the significances of factors affecting crashes are analyzed by principal component analysis. The results reveal that, the CR at merge segment is significantly higher than those at basic and diverge segments in uncongested flow, while the value is not significantly different at the three facility types in congested flow. In both un- and congested flows, sharp curve has the worst safety performance in view of its highest CR. Regarding influencing factors, geometric design and traffic flow are most significant in un- and congested flows, respectively. As mainline flow increases, the effect of merging ratio affecting crash is on the rise at basic and merge segments as opposed to the decreasing significance of diverging ratio at diverge segment. Meanwhile, longer acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes</b> are adverse to safety in uncongested flow, while shorter acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes</b> are adverse in congested flow. Due to its special geometric design, crashes at sharp curve are highly associated with the large centrifugal force and heavy restricted visibility.|$|R

40|$|Deceleration lanes are {{designed}} to improve traffic operation, reduce vehicular interferences, improve safety, and provide an effective transition from high-speed lanes to low-speed ramps. Nevertheless, several studies have shown high crash rates on these road geometries. Moreover, there are no guidelines that could provide designers with clear and updated criteria for appropriately designing deceleration lanes, whilst {{taking into account the}} driver’s behavior and the effects of different design variables on driving performance. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the driving performance of drivers exiting from the highway under various geometric deceleration lanes conditions. Specifically, the effects of different deceleration lanes on the speeds, trajectories, and decelerations of diverging drivers were investigated, in order to increase the knowledge of driver behavior whilst approaching a highway exit, during the lane-change maneuver, and along the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane.</b> Thirty one drivers took part in the experiments. Two different tapered deceleration lanes (with a single-lane exit ramp and with two-lane exit ramp, respectively) were implemented using a driving simulator in order to observe how exiting drivers performed, by analysing their speeds, decelerations and trajectories while they were approaching the <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> and were decelerating till the exit ramp. The effects of the number of the exit lanes on the driving performances were then statistically analysed. The main results demonstrated that, for the geometric and operating conditions investigated in this study, a single-lane exit ramp resulted in a poorer performance from the exiting drivers with regard to the operating and safe driving conditions. In fact, it was found that, when a single-lane exit ramp was available, drivers adopted lower exiting speeds and higher decelerations than those using two-lane exit ramp. Therefore, the latter seemed to provide improved performance, by limiting the interferences of the diverging drivers with through traffic, with regard to speed differentials and deceleration maneuvers along the through lanes...|$|E
30|$|From the {{analyses}} above, geometric features are found {{out to be}} the most significant influencing factor in uncongested flow. In this sense, the different CR characteristics by facility type in uncongested flow may be significantly associated with the variation in geometry. Poor design consistency induced by small radius is the potential cause for the highest CR in sharp curve. Ramp traffic can interrupt mainline traffic, and longer acceleration lane may provide longer interruption area. Both features can increase crash risk at merge segment. A lot of diverging traffic may move onto the lane nearest to <b>deceleration</b> <b>lane</b> in advance in the upstream of diverging area, since urban expressway carries a lot of commuters and many drivers are familiar with road structure. Hence, even if DR and LD are found out as significant influencing factors, CR at diverge segment is not significantly higher than that at basic segment.|$|E
50|$|The Parclo A2 and B2 are {{commonly}} used on rural freeways such as Highway 402 and Highway 416, where the ramps can be added without widening the street overpass/underpass to include <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes</b> (normally needed on the A4 in order to safely enter the loop ramps {{that lead to the}} freeway). The Parclo A2 and B2 ramps are also usually longer and allow for higher speeds than their A4 counterparts because of rural land availability. It is possible to upgrade an A2 to an A4 by adding directional ramps, serving arterial-to-freeway traffic that would otherwise be forced to make a left turn to enter the loop ramps.|$|R
40|$|<b>Deceleration</b> <b>lanes</b> are {{important}} because they help drivers transition from high-speed lanes to low-speed ramps. Although {{they are designed to}} allow vehicles to depart the freeway safely and efficiently, many studies report high accident rates on exit ramps with the highest percentage of crashes taking place in <b>deceleration</b> <b>lanes.</b> This paper describes the results of adriving simulator study that focused on driving performance while approaching a divergence area and decelerating during the exiting maneuver. Three different traffic scenarios were simulated to analyze the influence of traffic volume on driving performance. Thirty drivers drove in the simulator in these scenarios while data on their lateral position, speed and deceleration were collected. Our results indicate there are considerable differences between the main assumptions of models generally used to design decelerationlanes and actual driving performance. In particular, diverging drivers begin to decelerate before arriving at the decelerationlane, causing interference with the main flow. Moreover, speeds recorded {{at the end of the}} decelerationlane exceed those for which the ramp's curves are designed; this creates risky driving conditions that could explain the high crash rates found in studies of exit ramps. Finally, statistical analyses demonstrate significant influences of traffic volume on some aspects of exiting drivers’ performance: lower traffic volume results in elevated exiting speed and deceleration, and diverging drivers begin to decelerate earlier along the main lane when traffic volume is low. However, speeds at the end of the decelerationlane and the site of lane changing are not significantly influenced by traffic volume...|$|R
