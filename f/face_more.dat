5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also <b>face</b> <b>more</b> threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also <b>face</b> <b>more</b> stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E
50|$|People {{tended to}} like brand names that were paired with {{attractive}} <b>faces</b> <b>more</b> than those paired with unattractive <b>faces.</b> The <b>more</b> times a brand was paired with an attractive <b>face,</b> the <b>more</b> people liked it.|$|R

30|$|In models vii and viii, we again {{find that}} {{both male and}} female ex-offenders <b>faced</b> <b>more</b> {{difficulties}} in high-skilled occupations than in low-skilled occupations. The influence of the sex of the human resource manager on the difference in positive response probabilities between ex-offenders and non-offenders was statistically significant only among female job applicants. Model viii shows that female ex-offenders <b>faced</b> <b>more</b> difficulties when the human resource manager was a woman.|$|R
5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a <b>face</b> <b>more</b> in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 {{detonation}} of Joe-1 by the Soviet Union prompted {{an all-out}} {{effort by the}} United States, led by Teller, to develop the more powerful hydrogen bomb in response. Henry D. Smyth, Wheeler's department head at Princeton, asked him to join the effort. Most physicists were, like Wheeler, trying to re-establish careers interrupted by the war and were reluctant to <b>face</b> <b>more</b> disruption. Others had moral objections. Those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski, Marshall Rosenbluth, Lothar Nordheim and Charles Critchfield, {{but there was also}} now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory, led by Norris Bradbury. Wheeler agreed to go to Los Alamos after a conversation with Bohr. Two of his graduate students from Princeton, Ken Ford and John Toll, joined him there.|$|E

25|$|Blagojevich {{disagreed}} with many state Democrats while in office, with House and Senate Republican leaders Frank Watson and Tom Cross often refereeing among the Democrats. During 2008, Blagojevich even expressed fear that House Democrats would gain more seats {{and he would}} <b>face</b> <b>more</b> opposition.|$|E
25|$|In various accounts, {{some doctors}} thought the rash resembled {{the pattern of}} fur on a wolf's <b>face.</b> <b>More</b> likely {{is that it is}} derived from the {{similarity}} in distribution to lupus vulgaris or chronic facial tuberculosis where the lesions are ragged and punched out and are said to resemble the bite of a wolf.|$|E

5000|$|The acetabula are wider {{apart in}} females than in males. In males, the {{acetabulum}} <b>faces</b> <b>more</b> laterally, while it <b>faces</b> <b>more</b> anteriorly in females. Consequently, when males walk the leg can move forwards and backwards {{in a single}} plane. In females, the leg must swing forward and inward, from where the pivoting {{head of the femur}} moves the leg back in another plane. This change in the angle of the femoral head gives the female gait its characteristic (i.e. swinging of hips).|$|R

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1934 Lombardi's roommate Jim Lawlor {{introduced}} him to his cousin's relative, Marie Planitz. When Marie announced her ardent desire to marry Lombardi, her status-conscious stockbroker father didn't {{like the idea of}} his daughter marrying the son of an Italian butcher from Brooklyn, a prejudice he would <b>face</b> <b>more</b> than once in his life. Lombardi and Marie wed, nonetheless, on August 31, 1940.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a {{whitewater}} canoeist from Tennessee paddled {{over the}} falls {{in a closed}} deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his <b>face</b> <b>more</b> visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a life vest because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics {{at the base of}} the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found.|$|E
25|$|By then, the {{appearance}} of professional baseball in Venezuela attracted many ball players from the Caribbean and the United States to the country, showing a more integrated sport there {{than it was in}} the United States. This is evidenced in the hiring of stellar pitchers like Ramón Bragaña, Martín Dihigo, Bertrum Hunter, Satchel Paige, Roy Welmaker and the aforementioned Estrada among others, to whom the teenage López had to <b>face</b> <b>more</b> than one once, either as a hitter or pitcher.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1968, Saint Phalle sold Nana {{inflatable}} pool toys, amid {{criticism from}} the art world. She ignored the complaints, focusing on raising money for her future monumental projects. In the coming years, she would <b>face</b> <b>more</b> criticism for over-commercializing and popularizing her artwork, but she raised significant funding that enabled her to finance several ambitious projects on her own. Over the years, she produced clothing, jewelry, perfume, glass or porcelain figures, furniture, and craft items, many with a Nana theme.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{gas mask}} was {{developed}} in 1944 by the US Army Chemical Warfare Service. It was made of plastic and rubber-like material that greatly reduced the weight and bulk, compared to World War I gas masks and fitted the user's <b>face</b> <b>more</b> snugly and comfortably. The main improvement was replacing the separate filter canister connected with a hose by a filter canister screwed {{on the side of}} the gas mask, that could be replaced easily. Also, it had replaceable plastic lenses, much helping vision.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, Cotchin {{spent time}} {{training}} with the Richmond Football Club senior list {{as a member}} of the AIS/AFL Academy. Cotchin later spoke of being taken under the wing of Richmond player, Brett Deledio. At the time Deledio was his favourite AFL player, with a poster of him hanging on Cotchin's bedroom wall in his family home. At the 2007 AFL Under 18 Championships, Cotchin w{{as a member of}} the runner-up Victorian Metro side. Cotchin suffered a broken foot while playing with the Northern Knights in the TAC Cup finals in September 2007, which saw him <b>face</b> <b>more</b> than six weeks away from football.|$|E

25|$|Savage {{enrolled}} at Berklee College of Music and {{graduated with a}} degree in professional music at the age of 27. While reminiscing about her experiences there, she said she was motivated by the drive and passion of the younger students. She also said she needed the school's atmosphere. Savage spoke briefly on the challenges musicians face during their transition from backup to lead, and said that artists <b>face</b> <b>more</b> scrutiny when their performances are mediocre. Her business background has helped her fully understand the scope of the Nigerian music industry. Savage spoke about her business background and said that her level of professionalism does not make her susceptible to deception.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{patterns}} in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also {{higher risk of}} adverse health outcomes. Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities. Blacks and Latinos generally <b>face</b> <b>more</b> pollution than whites and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones. Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the US South and metropolitan areas of the US West. Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants.|$|E
500|$|Brought to {{the brink}} of {{extinction}} by the 1990s due to hunting, it was brought back to international attention by German herpetologist Dr. [...] and his book Reptiles of Central America. [...] Although several zoos and wildlife associations have instituted programs for the iguanas on Utila, the species still finds itself threatened due to overhunting and may <b>face</b> <b>more</b> of a threat in the form of habitat loss. Extreme conservation efforts are in place to try to prevent this species from going extinct.|$|E

40|$|Children {{recognize}} children's <b>faces</b> <b>more</b> accurately than adult faces, {{and adults}} recognize adult <b>faces</b> <b>more</b> accurately than children's faces (e. g., Anastasi & Rhodes, 2005). This is the own-age bias. Research {{has shown that}} this bias is at least partially based on experience since trainee teachers show less of an own-age bias than do other adults (Harrison & Hole, 2009). The present research tested the own-age bias in three groups of children (age 4 – 6, 7 – 9, 10 – 12 years) {{and a group of}} adults in the recognition of three age groups of faces (age 7 – 9, 20 – 22, and 65 – 90 years). Results showed an own-age bias for 7 - to 9 -year-old children and adults. Specifically, children could recognize <b>faces</b> <b>more</b> accurately if they were less than two years different from their own age than if they were more than two years older or younger. These results are discussed in terms of short-term experience with faces creating biases, and this rapidly changes with age...|$|R
