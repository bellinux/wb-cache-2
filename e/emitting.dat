5|$|Americium-243 {{transforms}} by α-emission into 239Np, which converts by β-decay to 239Pu, and the 239Pu changes into 235U by <b>emitting</b> an α-particle.|$|E
5|$|In this process, a {{deuteron}} hitting uranium-238 produces two neutrons and neptunium-238, which spontaneously decays by <b>emitting</b> negative beta particles to form plutonium-238.|$|E

5|$|A {{radio galaxy}} {{is an active}} galaxy that is very {{luminous}} in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is <b>emitting</b> immense plumes or lobes of gas. Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars. Quasars {{are believed to be}} the most consistently luminous objects in the known universe.|$|E
5|$|An {{active galaxy}} is a {{formation}} that emits {{a significant amount}} of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is <b>emitting</b> radiation from in-falling material.|$|E
5|$|I was at {{the command}} post and {{listening}} to the radio communication between the pilots. I realised immediately something serious had happened; I knew they were still in flight and that they were trying to bring Marseille over the lines into our territory and that his aircraft was <b>emitting</b> a lot of smoke.|$|E
5000|$|Observable streams (i.e. streams {{that can}} be observed) {{in the context of}} Reactive Extensions are like event {{emitters}} that <b>emit</b> 3 events: next, error, and complete. An observable <b>emits</b> next events until it either <b>emits</b> an error event or a complete event. However, at that point it will not <b>emit</b> any more events, unless it is subscribed to again.|$|R
5000|$|An {{operator}} that <b>emits</b> inner observables can {{be followed}} by another operator {{that in some way}} combines the items <b>emitted</b> by all the inner observables and <b>emits</b> the item on its outer observable. Examples include: ...|$|R

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), {{uranium-235}} (0.7198–0.7202%), {{and a very}} small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by <b>emitting</b> an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating {{the age of the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by <b>emitting</b> clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|E
5|$|Most gamma-ray <b>emitting</b> {{sources are}} {{actually}} gamma-ray bursts, objects which only produce gamma radiation {{for a few}} milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away. Only 10% of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources. These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Photons are <b>emitted</b> in many natural processes. For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it <b>emits</b> synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear {{transition to a}} lower energy level, photons of various energy will be <b>emitted,</b> ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons can also be <b>emitted</b> when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).|$|R
50|$|Since the {{frequency}} of the <b>emitted</b> radiation depends on both the kinetic energy and on the ionization potential, the different frequencies are <b>emitted</b> at different recombination time (i.e. the <b>emitted</b> pulse is chirped). What is more, for every frequency, there are two corresponding recombination times. We refer to these two trajectories as the short trajectory (which are <b>emitted</b> first), and the long trajectory.|$|R
25|$|Different {{semiconducting}} {{materials are}} used to synthesize quantum dots of different sizes and therefore <b>emit</b> different wavelengths of light. Materials that normally <b>emit</b> light in the visible region are often used and their sizes are fine-tuned so that certain colors are <b>emitted.</b> Typical substances used to synthesize quantum dots are cadmium (Cd) and selenium (Se). For example, when the electrons of two nanometer CdSe quantum dots relax after excitation, blue light is <b>emitted.</b> Similarly, red light is <b>emitted</b> in four nanometer CdSe quantum dots.|$|R
5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining {{whether there is a}} local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or <b>emitting</b> light.|$|E
5|$|South American giant {{cockroaches}} of {{the genus}} Lucihormetica {{were believed to be}} the first known example of defensive mimicry, <b>emitting</b> light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles. However, doubt has been cast on this assertion, and there is no conclusive evidence that the cockroaches are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|The Sm ion is a {{potential}} activator for use in warm-white light <b>emitting</b> diodes. It offers high luminous efficacy due to the narrow emission bands, however, the generally low quantum efficiency and insufficient absorption in the UV-A to blue spectral region hinders commercial application.|$|E
50|$|Many {{sources for}} {{monochromatic}} light can be used. Most lasers <b>emit</b> {{light of a}} very narrow bandwidth, and often provide a suitable light source. A helium-neon laser <b>emits</b> light at 632 nanometers (red), while a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser <b>emits</b> light at 532 nm (green). Various laser diodes and diode-pumped solid-state lasers <b>emit</b> light in red, yellow, green, blue or violet. Dye lasers can be tuned to <b>emit</b> nearly any color. However, lasers also experience a phenomenon called laser speckle, which {{shows up in the}} fringes.|$|R
50|$|Nuclei that {{predominantly}} absorb neutrons {{and then}} <b>emit</b> Beta particle radiation lead to these isotopes, e.g., Th-232 absorbs a neutron and becomes Th-233*, which <b>emits</b> a Beta particle and becomes Pa-233, which <b>emits</b> another Beta particle to become U-233.|$|R
50|$|One {{mechanism}} {{proposes that}} {{the color of}} the <b>emitted</b> light depends on whether the product is in the keto or enol form. The mechanism suggests that red light is <b>emitted</b> from the keto form of oxyluciferin, while green light is <b>emitted</b> from the enol form of oxyluciferin. However, 5,5-dimethyloxyluciferin <b>emits</b> green light even though it is constricted to the keto form because it cannot tautomerize.|$|R
5|$|The {{resulting}} , a white solid, {{is highly}} reactive (by fluorination), easily sublimes (<b>emitting</b> a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas), {{and is the}} most volatile compound of uranium known to exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{screen on}} the Executive was a {{monolithic}} seven-segment gallium arsenide light <b>emitting</b> diode display, bought from a Canadian firm. The small screen reduced the power consumption and material costs, {{but it was}} revised several times in pursuit of lower power consumption, creating issues with the reliability.|$|E
5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This idea is the basis {{for a new generation of}} UV-pumped white light <b>emitting</b> diodes.|$|E
40|$|We found a {{high rate}} (4. 2 %) of {{positive}} results for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) by <b>Emit</b> in 1898 urine samples that were submitted primarily from psychiatric patients for drugs-of-abuse (DOA) testing. Specimens that tested positive for LSD by <b>Emit</b> subsequently tested negative for LSD with two RIAs. Furthermore, LSD was not detected in randomly selected Emit-positive urine samples by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Normal urine samples tested positive for LSD by <b>Emit</b> when they were supplemented with therapeutic medi-cations that were prescribed for patients with positive urine LSD results by <b>Emit.</b> These therapeutic drugs interfered specifically with the <b>Emit</b> assay for LSD, since other <b>Emit</b> DOA tests were not affected by these medications at the tested concentrations...|$|R

5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. Light {{at these}} wavelengths is {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Objects <b>emitting</b> ultraviolet radiation include the Sun, other stars and galaxies.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of work, Fermi's group had {{tentatively}} determined that lighter elements would disperse {{the energy of the}} captured neutron by <b>emitting</b> a proton or alpha particle and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by <b>emitting</b> a gamma ray. This latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton, thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table. When Fermi's team bombarded uranium, they observed this behavior as well, which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of 93. Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim, but after his team observed several unknown half-lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope, he published a paper entitled Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 in June 1934. In it he proposed the name ausonium (atomic symbol Ao) for element 93, after the Greek name Ausonia (Italy).|$|E
5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is <b>emitting</b> an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which {{may be caused by}} a debris disk of dust orbiting at a distance of more than 31 astronomical units from it.|$|E
50|$|Just as {{accelerated}} electric charges <b>emit</b> QED radiation (photons), {{the accelerated}} coloured partons will <b>emit</b> QCD radiation {{in the form}} of gluons.
