5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotide</b> (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by S-adenosylmethionine.|$|E

25|$|FAD plays a {{major role}} as an enzyme {{cofactor}} along with <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotide,</b> another molecule originating from riboflavin. Bacteria, fungi and plants can produce riboflavin, but other eukaryotes, such as humans, have lost the ability to make it. Therefore, humans must obtain riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, from dietary sources. Riboflavin is generally absorbed in the small intestine and then transported to cells via carrier proteins. Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) adds a phosphate group to riboflavin to produce <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotide,</b> and then FAD synthetase attaches an adenine nucleotide; both steps require ATP. Bacteria generally have one bi-functional enzyme, but archaea and eukaryotes usually employ two distinct enzymes. Current research indicates that distinct isoforms exist in the cytosol and mitochondria. It seems that FAD is synthesized in both locations and potentially transported where needed.|$|E

Infrared absorption spectroscopy revealed strong pi-pi stacking interactions between FMN and BNNT sidewalls. Importantly, the fluorescence spectra {{revealed that the}} nanohybrids were highly fluorescent in the visible-light spectral range.

In each case the fluorescence spectral distribution {{is similar to that}} of the bioluminescence but is readily distinguishable from it on the basis of a significantly greater signal strength. The corrected bioluminescence maxima using Beneckea harveyi luciferase are 479 nm (iso-FMNH 2), 490 nm (FMNH 2), and 560 nm (2 -thio-FMNH 2). In an ethanol glass at 77 K, 2 -thioriboflavin is fluorescent (ϕF = 0. 03, λmax = 562 nm). These results are interpreted by a sensitized chemiluminescence mechanism in which the flavins bound to luciferase act as acceptors of excitation energy. For 2 -thio-FMNH 2, this acceptor species appears to be the oxidized 2 -thio-FMN on the basis of the spectral evidence, whereas for the other flavins, some form of reduced species is a more likely candidate...|$|R

25|$|NADH is {{oxidized}} to NAD+, {{by reducing}} <b>Flavin</b> <b>mononucleotide</b> to FMNH2 in one two-electron step. FMNH2 is then oxidized in two one-electron steps, through a semiquinone intermediate. Each electron thus transfers from the FMNH2 to an Fe-S cluster, from the Fe-S cluster to ubiquinone (Q). Transfer {{of the first}} electron results in the free-radical (semiquinone) form of Q, and transfer of the second electron reduces the semiquinone form to the ubiquinol form, QH2. During this process, four protons are translocated from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.|$|E
25|$|All redox {{reactions}} {{take place}} in the hydrophilic domain of complex I. NADH initially binds to complex I, and transfers two electrons to the <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotide</b> (FMN) prosthetic group of the enzyme, creating FMNH2. The electron acceptor – the isoalloxazine ring – of FMN is identical to that of FAD. The electrons are then transferred through the FMN via a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, and finally to coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). This electron flow changes the redox state of the protein, inducing conformational changes of the protein which alters the pK values of ionizable side chain, and causes four hydrogen ions to be pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix. Ubiquinone (CoQ) accepts two electrons to be reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2).|$|E

40|$|The protein (AfpA, for archaeoflavoprotein) encoded by AF 1518 in {{the genome}} of Archaeoglobus fulgidus was {{produced}} in Escherichia coli and characterized. AfpA {{was found to be}} a homodimer with a native molecular mass of 43 kDa and containing two noncovalently bound <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotides</b> (FMNs). The cell extract of A. fulgidus catalyzed the CO-dependent reduction of AfpA that was stimulated by the addition of ferredoxin. Ferredoxin was found to be a direct electron donor to purified AfpA, whereas rubredoxin was unable to substitute. Neither NADH nor NADPH was an electron donor. Ferricyanide, 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol, several quinones, ferric citrate, bovine cytochrome c, and O 2 accepted electrons from reduced AfpA, whereas coenzyme F 420 did not. The rate of cytochrome c reduction was enhanced in the presence of O 2 suggesting that superoxide {{is a product of the}} interaction of reduced AfpA with O 2. Although AF 1518 was previously annotated as encoding a decarboxylase involved in coenzyme A biosynthesis, the results establish that AfpA is an electron carrier protein with ferredoxin as the physiological electron donor. The genomes of several diverse Archaea contained afpA homologs clustered with open reading frames annotated as homologs of genes encoding reductases involved in the oxidative stress response of anaerobes from the domain Bacteria. A potential role for AfpA in coupling electron flow from ferredoxin to the putative reductases is discussed. A search of the databases suggests that AfpA is the prototype of a previously unrecognized flavoprotein family unique to the domain Archaea for which the name archaeoflavoprotein is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) of acetogenic {{bacteria}} catalyzes {{the reduction of}} methylene-THF, which is highly exergonic with NADH as the reductant. Therefore, the enzyme was suggested {{to be involved in}} energy conservation by reducing ferredoxin via electron bifurcation, followed by Na + translocation by the Rnf complex. The enzyme was purified from Acetobacterium woodii and shown to have an unprecedented subunit composition containing the three subunits RnfC 2, MetF, and MetV. The stable complex contained 2 <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotides</b> (FMN), 23. 5 ± 1. 2 Fe and 24. 5 ± 1. 5 S, which fits well to the predicted six [4 Fe 4 S] clusters in MetV and RnfC 2. The enzyme catalyzed NADH:methylviologen and NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity but also methylene-tetrahydrofolate (THF) reduction with NADH as the reductant. The NADH:methylene- THF reductase activity was high (248 U/mg) and not stimulated by ferredoxin. Furthermore, reduction of ferredoxin, alone or in the presence of methylene-THF and NADH, was never observed. MetF or MetVF was not able to catalyze the methylene-THFdependent oxidation of NADH, but MetVF could reduce methylene-THF using methyl viologen as the electron donor. The purified MTHFR complex did not catalyze the reverse reaction, the endergonic oxidation of methyl-THF with NAD + as the acceptor, and this reaction could not be driven by reduced ferredoxin. However, addition of protein fractions made the oxidation of methyl-THF to methylene-THF coupled to NAD + reduction possible. Our data demonstrate that the MTHFR of A. woodii catalyzes methylene-THF reduction according to the following reaction: NADH + methylene-THF→methyl-THF + NAD +. The differences in the subunit compositions of MTHFRs of bacteria are discussed in the light of their different functions...|$|R
25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotide</b> (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E

40|$|The O 2 -tolerant, NAD+-reducing soluble [NiFe] {{hydrogenase}} (SH) from Ralstonia eutropha H 16, HoxHYFUI 2, is {{a complex}} enzyme, harboring multiple redox cofactors: a [NiFe] active site, an electron relay of iron-sulfur clusters, and two noncovalently bound <b>flavin</b> <b>mononucleotides</b> (FMN). The interplay and functional role of these cofactors is so far not understood in detail. In the present study, the isolated HoxHY module was investigated, which represents the smallest active subcomplex of a [NiFe] hydrogenase. Direct electrochemical studies and solution assays showed that the as-isolated HoxHY is initially catalytically inactive, but after reductive activation at low potentials, exhibits both H 2 oxidation and H+ reduction, consistent {{with the role of}} the SH in bidirectional catalysis. The overpotential relative to E(2 H+/H 2) is minimal, facilitating coupling of the closely spaced 2 H+/H 2 and NAD+/NADH half reactions in the SH. Methyl viologen reduction assays revealed that H 2 oxidation by HoxHY is enhanced on addition of excess FMN, in line with results from optical spectroscopy which indicate that FMN is present at substoichiometric levels in as-isolated HoxHY. X-ray absorp-tion spectroscopy suggested one 4 Fe 4 S cluster in addition to the active site in HoxHY. FTIR investigations confirmed that the active site iron atom has a "standard" ligation, i. e., one CO and two cyanide ligands. At least two novel oxidized states were detected by FTIR, both of which could be reductively activated by artificial electron donors, such as dithionite, and by the native electron donor H 2 in the presence of additional FMN. The flavin cofactor also appears to stabilize the active site, providing further evidence for its importance in HoxHY. All reduced states of the [NiFe] site previously identified for standard [NiFe] hydrogenases and for the native SH within living cells were detected in FTIR spectra of HoxHY {{with the exception of the}} intermediate Nia-C species. Electrochemical experiments show that incubation of active HoxHY with O 2 at high potentials causes slow inactivation, but activity is recovered within seconds at potentials below - 170 mV at 30 °C, even in the presence of 2 % O 2. This behavior is consistent with the HoxHY moiety of the SH remaining active in the presence of O 2 at the potential of the NAD+/NADH pool in vivo. © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co. KGaA...|$|R

At pH 7. 5, the optimum pH for stability of NADH-nitrate reductase, this enzyme, and a component enzyme reduced <b>flavin</b> adenine <b>mononucleotide</b> (FMNH 2) -nitrate reductase has a similar stability at both 10 and 25 C. Two other component enzymes—methylviologen-nitrate reductase and NADH-ferricyanide reductase—also have a similar but higher stability. At this pH the Arrhenius plot for decay of NADH-nitrate reductase and methylviologen-nitrate reductase indicates a transition temperature at approximately 30 C above which the energy of activation for denaturation increases.

Urine samples were analysed for indole-catecholamines, their metabolites and oxidative-stress marker, hydroxylpyrolline- 2 -one (HPL). Rating scales were Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Global Assessment of Function scale, Clinical Global Impression score and Social and Occupational Functioning Scale. Analysis used Spearman’s correlates, Receiver Operating Characteristics and structural equation modelling (SEM).

Cbl may ensure controlled high output of nitric oxide (NO) and its safe deployment, because: (1) Cbl is ultimately responsible for the synthesis or availability of the NOS substrates and cofactors heme, arginine, BH 4 <b>flavin</b> adenine dinucleotide/flavin <b>mononucleotide</b> (FAD/FMN) and NADPH, via the far-reaching effects of the two Cbl coenzymes, methionine synthase (MS) and methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCoAM) in, or on, the folate, glutathione, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and urea cycles, oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Deficiency of any of theNOS substrates and cofactors results in ‘uncoupled’ NOS reactions, decreasedNO production and increased or excessive O 2 −, H 2 O 2, ONOO− and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitric oxide species (RNIS) leading to pathology. (2) Cbl is also the overlooked ultimate determinant of positive glutathione status, which favours the formation of more benign NO species, s-nitrosothiols, the predominant form in which NO is safely deployed.
