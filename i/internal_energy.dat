5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion kilowatt hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in nuclear power to reduce imports. Three nuclear power stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first nuclear power plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the first law for closed systems, energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another, changing the <b>internal</b> <b>energies</b> of each.

25|$|The {{first law}} is usually {{formulated}} {{by saying that}} the change in the <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> of a closed thermodynamic system is equal to the difference between the heat supplied to the system and the amount of work done by the system on its surroundings. It {{is important to note that}} <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> is a state of the system (see Thermodynamic state) whereas heat and work modify the state of the system. In other words, a change of <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat and work added or removed from the system as long as those total to the change of <b>internal</b> <b>energy.</b> The manner by which a system achieves its <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> is path independent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> of {{a system}} can be changed by {{transfers}} of matter or heat or by doing work. When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system {{is said to be}} closed. Then the first law of thermodynamics states that the increase in <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> cannot change. The first law of thermodynamics may be regarded as establishing the existence of the <b>internal</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{definition}} {{in terms of}} increments, {{the value of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> of a system is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant of integration, which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels. This non-uniqueness is in keeping with the abstract mathematical nature of the <b>internal</b> <b>energy.</b> The <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} novel {{formulation}} for B-spline snakes {{that can be}} used as a tool for fast and intuitive contour outlining. We start with a theoretical argument in favor of splines in the traditional formulation by showing that the optimal, curvature-constrained snake is a cubic spline, irrespective of the form of the external energy field. Unfortunately, such regularized snakes suffer from slow convergence speed because of a large number of control points, as well as from difficulties in determining the weight factors associated to the <b>internal</b> <b>energies</b> of the curve. We therefore propose an alternative formulation in which the intrinsic scale of the spline model is adjusted a priori; this leads to a reduction of the number of parameters to be optimized and eliminates the need for <b>internal</b> <b>energies</b> (i. e., the regularization term). In other words, we are now controlling the elasticity of the spline implicitly and rather intuitively by varying the spacing between the spline knots. The theory is embedded into a multiresolution formulation demonstrating improved stability in noisy image environments. Validation results are presented, comparing the traditional snake using <b>internal</b> <b>energies</b> and the proposed approach without <b>internal</b> <b>energies,</b> showing the similar performance of the latter. Several biomedical examples of applications are included to illustrate the versatility of the method. I...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two factors}} that can change the {{temperature}} of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> or the conversion between potential and kinetic <b>internal</b> <b>energy.</b> Temperature is the measure of thermal kinetic energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal kinetic energy. The <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> {{is the sum of}} thermal kinetic energy and thermal potential energy. Thus, even if the <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between kinetic and potential energy; this is what happens in a free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands. If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> changes. This is what happens in a Joule–Thomson expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> {{changes in}} an ideal gas may be {{described}} solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its pressure, volume and thermodynamic temperature.|$|E
25|$|Such {{statements}} of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> {{as a function of}} state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> and work done on the system, when that work does not account for the whole of the change of <b>internal</b> <b>energy</b> and the system is not adiabatically isolated.|$|E

Discussion {{of the role of}} A as system variable of the interface phase and an estimate of the ratio of the respective free energies of systems with and without A show that the system variables () V M S U,,, given by Gibbs suffice to describe the volumetric properties of the fluid.
