5|$|The {{most widely}} used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> through the mouth and vocal {{apparatus}} into the trachea. In a nasotracheal procedure, an endotracheal tube <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> through the nose and vocal apparatus into the trachea. Other methods of intubation involve surgery and include the cricothyrotomy (used almost exclusively in emergency circumstances) and the tracheotomy, used primarily in situations where a prolonged need for airway support is anticipated.|$|E
50|$|In 1886, a law <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> penalizing espionage {{activity}} (another would <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> in 1934).|$|R
50|$|The Emergency Powers Act 1939 <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> {{and signed}} {{on the same}} day as the First Amendment. Further Acts <b>were</b> <b>passed</b> {{over the course of the}} Second World War. The Emergency Powers Act 1976 <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> in {{response}} to The Troubles.|$|R

5|$|Article IX {{involves}} {{amendments to}} the New Jersey state constitution. A potential amendment is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly. The amendment is voted upon by both of the houses. If it gathers at least three-fifths of both the Senate and the General Assembly, the amendment is to be submitted to be voted upon {{by the people of}} New Jersey. If a majority votes for the amendment, the amendment <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> on the thirtieth day after the vote.|$|E
5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> {{by a man}} riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, {{it does not seem}} likely that they are a common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|As the {{national}} dish of Cornwall, several oversized {{versions of the}} pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> over the goal posts.|$|E
5000|$|Unauthorised {{information}} cannot <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> by tone {{of voice}} or body language (but can much more easily <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> by external communication).|$|R
50|$|BRNN can {{be trained}} using similar {{algorithms}} compared to RNN, because the two directional neurons {{do not have any}} interactions. However, when back-propagation is applied, additional processes are needed because updating input and output layers cannot be done at once. General procedures for training are as follows: For forward pass, forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed.</b> For backward <b>pass,</b> output neurons <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> first, then forward states and backward states <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> next. After forward and backward <b>passes</b> <b>are</b> done, the weights are updated.|$|R
50|$|Primitive LPC types (int, string, status, float, etc.) <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> by value. Data {{structure}} types (object, array, mapping, class, struct) <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> by reference.|$|R
5|$|Cristina is {{nominated}} for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> over due to her relationship with the Harper-Avery Foundation that co-owns the hospital. Cristina goes to speak {{at a hospital in}} Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by Preston Burke who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job {{as the head of the}} hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{ground and}} {{satellite}} based imagery, radar, and lidar {{can be used}} to detect ash clouds. This information <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> between meteorological agencies, volcanic observatories and airline companies through Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC). There is one VAAC for each of the nine regions of the world. VAACs can issue advisories describing the current and future extent of the ash cloud.|$|E
5|$|It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, {{and no one}} is {{interested}} in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep.|$|E

50|$|An ad hoc Senate {{committee}} heard {{evidence in}} September and October 2010, and a {{vote by the}} full Senate took place on December 8, 2010. Article 1 <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> unanimously, Articles 2 <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> {{by a vote of}} 69-27, Article 3 <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> by a vote of 88-8, and Article 4 <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> by a vote of 90 to 6. A further vote to disqualify the former judge from ever holding office again passed by a vote of 94 to 2.|$|R
50|$|HTML pages may embed {{parameters}} that <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> to the applet. Hence {{the same}} applet may appear differently {{depending on the}} parameters that <b>were</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Membrane cell {{electrolysis}} employs permeable membrane as an ion exchanger. Saturated sodium (or potassium) chloride solution <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> {{through the}} anode compartment, leaving {{at a lower}} concentration. This method also produces very pure sodium (or potassium) hydroxide but has the disadvantage of requiring very pure brine at high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Primitive starfish, such as Astropecten and Luidia, swallow {{their prey}} whole, {{and start to}} digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other {{inedible}} materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other bivalve, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> on to the pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a neuropeptide known as NGFFYamide.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000â€“100,000 A) <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the equipment cost can be high.|$|E
50|$|One last {{continuing}} resolution <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> lasting three days. The full-year omnibus spending bill, {{called the}} Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> in January 2014.|$|R
50|$|Section 40 further {{requires}} that the general appropriations bill must <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> before any special appropriations bill can <b>be</b> <b>passed.</b> Otherwise, no appropriations are valid.|$|R
50|$|The {{first four}} integer {{parameters}} <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> in registers eax, ebx, ecx and edx. Floating point parameters <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> on the floating point stack - registers st0, st1, st2, st3, st4, st5 and st6. Structure parameters <b>are</b> always <b>passed</b> on the stack. Additional parameters <b>are</b> <b>passed</b> on the stack after registers are exhausted. Integer values are returned in eax, pointers in edx and floating point types in st0.|$|R
5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
5|$|The NULL literal is untyped in SQL, {{meaning that}} it is not {{designated}} as an integer, character, or any other specific data type. Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type. For instance, if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS, SQL {{might not be able to}} automatically resolve to the correct function without knowing the data types of all parameters, including those for which Null <b>is</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the olfactory bulb from where information <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> to the olfactory cortex.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, the Ballot Act <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> {{which allowed}} {{voting by secret ballot}} {{as opposed to}} the {{previous}} system of public oral voting. In 1888, a new Elections Act <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> which defined the required qualifications for candidates for the House of Assembly. In 1889, a new Representation Act <b>was</b> <b>passed</b> which redefined the boundaries of electoral districts.|$|R

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E
5|$|A new Commissioner's Trophy {{is created}} each year, {{much like the}} Lombardi Trophy and the O'Brien Trophy. In contrast, hockey's Stanley Cup <b>is</b> <b>passed</b> from {{champion}} to champion. Before 1997, the trophy was presented in the winners locker room. Since then the presentation occurs on the field if the champion clinches the title in their home stadium. Since its inception, the only year that the Commissioner's Trophy has not been awarded was 1994, when the players' strike ended the season on August 11, resulting in the cancellation of the entire post-season. The New York Yankees have won the most Commissioner's Trophies, winning seven World Series since 1967. The St. Louis Cardinals have won four trophies, a National League record.|$|E
5|$|After Homer sees how devastated Apu {{was about}} being deported, he changes {{his mind about}} the {{immigration}} proposition and vows {{that he and his}} family will help Apu. Lisa discovers that Apu will not have to leave if he can pass a United States citizenship test. Homer agrees to be Apu's tutor to help prepare for the exam. After Lisa intervenes, Apu goes to take the test; he passes and becomes a citizen of the United States. At a congratulatory party, Homer tells his guests how terrible it would be if immigrants were deported, explaining they make the United States thrive. He inspires them to vote no on Proposition 24, but it still passes, with 95% of voters voting yes. After the ballot <b>is</b> <b>passed,</b> the only person deported is Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E
