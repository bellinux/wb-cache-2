25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the 7-8th century CE, Japan used {{commodity}} money for its exchanges. It generally consisted of material that was compact, <b>easily</b> transportable <b>and</b> had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple barter, in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, <b>easily</b> portable <b>and</b> storable, <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> combined <b>and</b> divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of commodity money in Japan were arrowheads, rice grains and gold powder.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} his gubernatorial term, Isaac Shelby {{retired from}} public life but he was called back into {{politics}} by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected <b>easily,</b> <b>and</b> at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, Shelby and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw Indian tribe. Isaac Shelby died, at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July 18, 1826.|$|E

5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site <b>easily</b> <b>and</b> cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant <b>easily,</b> <b>and</b> can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried <b>easily</b> <b>and</b> eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as a binder {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes <b>easily,</b> <b>and</b> this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E

The Filipino film historian and director Nick Deocampo noted that productions made with nitrate film– such as Terang Boelan– burned <b>easily</b> <b>and</b> were thus easily lost, but suggested that {{copies of the}} film may have survived until the 1970s.

5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore <b>easily</b> <b>and</b> are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
