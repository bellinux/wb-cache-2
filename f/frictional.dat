5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion. The <b>frictional</b> force {{is directly related}} to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of <b>frictional</b> forces: static friction and kinetic friction.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone {{may be viewed}} as a heat engine that converts input heat energy from the surface into mechanical energy {{that can be used to}} do mechanical work against surface friction. At equilibrium, the rate of net energy production in the system must equal the rate of energy loss due to <b>frictional</b> dissipation at the surface, i.e.|$|E
5|$|Local {{trauma is}} also {{associated}} with aphthous stomatitis, and {{it is known that}} trauma can decrease the mucosal barrier. Trauma could occur during injections of local anesthetic in the mouth, or otherwise during dental treatments, <b>frictional</b> trauma from a sharp surface in the mouth such as broken tooth, or from tooth brushing.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. <b>Frictional</b> gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates <b>frictional</b> force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the <b>frictional</b> force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes <b>frictional</b> heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and <b>frictional</b> forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as the rotation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Pushing {{against an}} object that rests on a <b>frictional</b> surface {{can result in a}} {{situation}} where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay {{independently}} discovered {{what they believed}} were two kinds of <b>frictional</b> electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined. American scientist Ebenezer Kinnersley later also independently reached the same conclusion. A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but a single electrical fluid showing an excess (+) or deficit (-). He gave them the modern charge nomenclature {{of positive and negative}} respectively. Franklin thought of the charge carrier as being positive, but he did not correctly identify which situation was a surplus of the charge carrier, and which situation was a deficit.|$|E
5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by <b>frictional</b> {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{would allow}} him to retain the 11th Guards and {{suggested}} that Colonel-General N. E. Chibisov, an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan, however, commented that he had had a <b>frictional</b> relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated Lieutenant-General K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coordinate harmoniously due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan's suggestion and promoted him to the rank Army General. He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the 11th Guards, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: 11th Guards, 39th, 43rd and the 4th Shock.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from <b>frictional</b> effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
25|$|In real oscillators, friction, or damping, {{slows the}} motion of the system. Due to <b>frictional</b> force, the {{velocity}} decreases in proportion to the acting <b>frictional</b> force. While simple harmonic motion oscillates with only the restoring force acting on the system, damped harmonic motion experiences friction. In many vibrating systems the <b>frictional</b> force Ff can be modeled as being proportional to the velocity v of the object: , where c is called the viscous damping coefficient.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{adhesion}} {{refers to}} the grip wheels of a train have on the rails, see <b>Frictional</b> contact mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Entropic force – a {{microscopic}} force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular <b>frictional</b> considerations, and statistical variations.|$|E
25|$|Many bicycle {{lubricants}} and greases contain PTFE and {{are used}} on chains and other moving parts subjected to <b>frictional</b> forces (such as hub bearings).|$|E
25|$|Firstly, {{imagine that}} a sample parcel of air flows 500 meters above the sea surface, so that <b>frictional</b> effects are already negligible.|$|E
25|$|The cyclostrophic schematisation is {{realistic}} when Coriolis and <b>frictional</b> forces are both negligible, {{that is for}} flows having large Rossby number and small Ekman number.|$|E
25|$|<b>Frictional</b> antitriptic flow applies {{near the}} ground, {{while the other}} schematisations apply far enough from the ground not to feel its `braking' effect (free-air flow).|$|E
25|$|The Coulomb {{approximation}} mathematically {{follows from}} the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over {{a small fraction of}} their overall area, that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the <b>frictional</b> force is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area (you can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and <b>frictional</b> force is not exactly linear (and so the <b>frictional</b> force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.|$|E
25|$|Generally road-going {{vehicles}} {{have two}} brake pads per caliper, while {{up to six}} are installed on each racing caliper, with varying <b>frictional</b> properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electrostatic}} generators {{are called}} friction machines {{because of the}} friction in the generation process. A primitive form of <b>frictional</b> machine was invented around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand. It may not actually have been rotated during use and {{was not intended to}} produce electricity (rather cosmic virtues), but inspired many later machines that used rotating globes. Isaac Newton suggested the use of a glass globe instead of a sulphur one. Francis Hauksbee improved the basic design, with his <b>frictional</b> electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere to be rotated rapidly against a woollen cloth.|$|E
25|$|Superlubricity, a {{recently}} discovered effect, {{has been observed}} in graphite: it is the substantial decrease of friction between two sliding objects, approaching zero levels. A very small amount of <b>frictional</b> energy would still be dissipated.|$|E
25|$|Carbon-carbon {{disc brakes}} {{are used for}} reduced weight and {{increased}} <b>frictional</b> performance. These provide {{a very high level}} of braking performance and are usually the element which provokes the greatest reaction from drivers new to the formula.|$|E
25|$|It is an {{important}} indicator of activated carbon to maintain its physical integrity and withstand <b>frictional</b> forces imposed by backwashing, etc. There are large differences in the hardness of activated carbons, depending on the raw material and activity levels.|$|E
25|$|The above {{discussion}} {{is based on}} the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and {{does not take into account}} real-world effects like <b>frictional</b> pressure drop in the system, slight thermodynamic irreversibility during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or non-ideal gas behavior, if any.|$|E
25|$|In 1798, Count Rumford (Benjamin Thompson) {{performed}} {{measurements of}} the <b>frictional</b> heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat {{is a form of}} kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Scott O’Hearen took {{a patent}} on the Radial turbine blade system. This {{invention}} utilizes {{a combination of the}} concepts of a smooth runner surface for working fluid <b>frictional</b> contact and that of blades projecting axially from plural transverse runner faces.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that orbital rockets are {{launched}} vertically at first to lift the rocket above the atmosphere (which causes <b>frictional</b> drag), and then slowly pitch over and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to achieve orbit speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the contact surface properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to <b>frictional</b> forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of <b>frictional</b> forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
25|$|Hillslopes are steepened {{past the}} angle of repose for noncohesive materials. This oversteepening is more than could be {{provided}} for by the <b>frictional</b> resistance of the sandy soils. Internal soil cohesion, negative pore pressure ("soil suction"), soil structure, and/or tree root reinforcement {{may be responsible for}} this.|$|E
25|$|His work on fluid {{motion and}} {{viscosity}} {{led to his}} calculating the terminal velocity for a sphere falling in a viscous medium. This became known as Stokes' law. He derived an expression for the <b>frictional</b> force (also called drag force) exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{repeated}} trapping of {{the lining}} {{can cause the}} tissue to become swollen and congested. Ulceration {{is thought to be}} caused by resulting poor blood supply (ischemia), combined with repeated <b>frictional</b> trauma from the prolapsing lining, and exposure to increased pressure are thought to cause ulceration. Trauma from hard stools may also contribute.|$|E
25|$|Bits {{made from}} {{high-carbon}} steel are more durable than low-carbon steel bits {{due to the}} properties conferred by hardening and tempering the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by <b>frictional</b> heating while drilling) they lose their temper, resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits {{can be used on}} wood or metal.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{models of}} {{unemployment}} occurs when wages {{are too high}} for employers {{to be willing to}} hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, <b>frictional</b> unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Solitary rectal ulcer {{syndrome}} (SRUS, solitary rectal ulcer, SRU) {{occurs with}} internal rectal intussusception and {{is part of}} the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions. It describes ulceration of the rectal lining caused by repeated <b>frictional</b> damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception, which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} the applied load is carried by {{pressure}} generated within the fluid due to the <b>frictional</b> viscous resistance to motion of the lubricating fluid between the surfaces. Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of equipment, with only mild wear, and without excessive stresses or seizures at bearings. When lubrication breaks down, metal or other components can rub destructively over each other, causing heat and possibly damage or failure.|$|E
