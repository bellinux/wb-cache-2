40|$|The {{process of}} {{assembling}} particles into organized functional structures {{is influenced by}} the rheological properties of the matrix fluid in which the assembly takes place. Therefore, tuning these properties represents a viable and as yet unexplored approach for controlling particle assembly. In this Letter, we examine the effect of the matrix <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stress on the directed assembly of polarizable particles into linear chains under a uniform external magnetic field. Using particle-level simulations with a simple yield stress model, we find that chain growth follows the same trajectory as in Newtonian matrix fluids up to a critical time that depends on the balance between the yield stress and the strength of magnetic interactions between particles; subsequently, the system undergoes structural arrest. Appropriate dimensionless groups for characterizing the arresting behavior are determined and relationships between these groups and the resulting structural properties are presented. Since field-induced structures can be indefinitely stabilized by the matrix <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stress and “frozen” into place as desired, this approach may facilitate the assembly of more complex and sophisticated structures.

40|$|Horizontal pipe flow of coarse {{particle}} slurries with carrier fluids which exhibited yield stresses were examined. Experimental measurements {{were made to}} investigate the effect the <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stresses had on the transport of the {{coarse particle}}s (1. 7 mm and 4. 4 mm) in a 52 mm diameter pipeloop. These results were used to evaluate two numerical models intended to describe these flows. Experimental tests used clay suspensions which were found to follow the Bingham fluid model. The suspensions had large yield stresses (3 to 25 Pa) which were capable of supporting the particles when the fluid was stationary. These particles were relatively large {{in relation to the}} pipe size. Slurry flows were mostly laminar but turbulent flows were also observed. The first numerical model considered the laminar flow of slurries by representing them as continua with a viscosity which varied with position in the pipe. A finite element method was used to predict the velocity distribution in the pipe from a specified pressure gradient and coarse particle concentration profile. This velocity distribution was then used to predict the concentration distribution based on a dispersive mechanism in laminar flow. The second numerical model was also mechanistically based and represented the slurries as two stratified layers with different coarse particle concentrations. This model was used for both laminar and turbulent flow. The effects of the <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stresses on model predictions were considered...|$|E

40|$|Magnetorheological (MR) fluids {{have a lot}} of {{applications}} in the industrial world, but sometimes their properties are not performing enough to meet system requirements. It has been found that in shear mode MR fluids exhibits a pressure dependency called squeeze strengthen effect. Since a lot of MR fluid based devices work in flow mode (i. e. dampers) this paper investigates the behaviour in flow mode under pressure. The system design is articulated in three steps: hydraulic system design, magnetic circuit design and design of experiment. The experimental apparatus is a cylinder in which a translating piston displaces the fluid without the use of standard gear pumps, incompatible with MR fluids. The experimental apparatus measures the MR <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stress as a function of pressure and magnetic field allowing the yield shear stress to be calculated.

Due to the damper’s nonlinear characteristic, its inverse dynamics model is difficult to obtain. In this paper, a simplified approach, namely the Simplified Inverse Dynamics (SID) model, has been developed for both the Bingham plasticity model and the Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. SID models have then been used to calculate the optimal <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stress or input current, in order to realize the desirable control forces obtained from various optimal control algorithms. For each model, a piston velocity feedback (PVF) algorithm and a damper force feedback (DFF) algorithm have been formulated.

Also, different configurations of MR dampers, such as, different dimension, coil resistance, type of MR fluid, have been employed to show the generic nature of SID model. The effectiveness of force tracking using SID model has been demonstrated through a series of numerical simulations. A multi-storey frame structure with MR damper-brace systems, using a large-scale 20 -ton MR damper, has been adopted.

40|$|A "Phase- 1 " {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop experimental data and general analyses needed for the determination of the feasibility of uslng electro-rheological (ER) fluids in hydraulic devices for controlling the motions of aircraft in flight. Such fluids constitute specially-formulated materials which exhibit large changes in their viscosity in response to an intense electrical field, thereby enabling electrical control of mechanical responses. An ER devices laboratory is described and experimental results presented. ER valves designed for basic study of flow control are presented. Three ER fluid specimens were formulated and subjected to a matrix of measurements showing qualities of wide bandwidth (at least 1 kHz), high thermal stability at temperatures up to 125 or 150 degrees C, and moderate shear stress limits (approximately 0. 1 psi). The performances of a single ER valve and a four-arm bridge using multfple valves have been analyzed, showing that a functional and efficient ER bridge is feasible. The results suggest that it is feasible to build an ERcontrolled rust-stage bridge circuit for modulating the flow to a power spool which would, thence, control flow to a flight-control actuator. A parallel-plate design concept for the ER valves to be used in this bridge is described, and a prototype was constructed.

This report describes the design of an ultra-dense phase multi-element injector and feed system for use on PWR gasifiers operating at pressures to 1, 000 psia. For the design of this injector and feed system, the pulverized coal's Bingham <b>fluid</b> <b>yield</b> stress is approximately 11 Pascals (Pa) with a coefficient of rigidity of 10 centipoise (cp). These values are typical of earlier experimental testing conducted with dried pulverized coal below 18 wt% moisture [...] see, e. g., Sprouse and Schuman (1983, 1986). Each individual injector element is designed for a coal flow rate between 3 and 4 tons/hr (0. 76 to 1. 0 kg/sec) at full flow conditions. Hence, a small 400 to 500 tons/day (4. 2 to 5. 25 kg/sec) gasifier will require a 6 -element injector, a 1, 500 tons/day (15. 7 kg/sec) gasifier will require an 18 -element injector and a 3, 000 tons/day (31. 5 kg/sec) gasifier will require a 36 -element injector.
