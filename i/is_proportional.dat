5|$|A better {{approximation}} {{is to take}} ε = L/M, {{the energy}} generation rate per unit mass, as ε <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to TI15, where TI is the core temperature. This is suitable for stars at least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the CNO cycle, and gives the better fit R ∝ M0.78.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to its mass, the mass of an object in {{kilograms}} is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the scale, is equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{relationship}} between them in the standard case is simple. In particular, the Y channel is the same in both, both Cb and U <b>are</b> <b>proportional</b> to (B-Y), and both Cr and V <b>are</b> <b>proportional</b> to (R-Y).|$|R
50|$|For smooth functions, the {{approximation}} errors made at {{each step}} <b>are</b> <b>proportional</b> to the square h2 of the width h of the input intervals.

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, the area {{enclosed}} by the curve shrinks, at the constant rate of 2 units of area {{per unit of}} time, independent of the curve. Therefore, the total time for a curve to shrink to a point <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to its area, regardless of its initial shape.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{distance}} from y to the centre, s is now greater than SQ, so an additional force is required to move the body to q such that sq = SQ. The extra force is represented by yq, and f <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to ry + yq, just as F is to RQ.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy of}} an emitted photon <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to its frequency, so these {{specific}} energy levels appear as distinct bands in the electromagnetic spectrum.

30|$|The strong scaling,defined as the {{performance}} variation for a fixed total FDM domain size, <b>was</b> not <b>proportional</b> {{to the number}} of GPUs, N, but appeared to <b>be</b> <b>proportional</b> to N 2 / 3. This (non-ideal) scalability was the result of long communication and computation times for the ghost points because the number of the ghost points <b>was</b> <b>proportional</b> to the surface area of the subdomain, and the surface area <b>was</b> <b>proportional</b> to N- 2 / 3. Indeed, we measured the time for processing the side points (including ghost points), internal points, and the communications separately and determined that the communication time was the longest (Table 1).|$|R
5|$|The {{reason for}} this is that the {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the mean curvature, as seen in the Young–Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E
5|$|These are of {{particular}} interest {{because they are the}} first black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar-mass black hole and the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies. The mass of these intermediate mass black holes <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
50|$|This fixed {{relationship}} {{is useful for}} measuring radio frequency or microwave (electromagnetic) fields.Since power is the rate of energy transfer, and the squares of E and H <b>are</b> <b>proportional</b> to power, E2 and H2 <b>are</b> <b>proportional</b> to the energy transfer rate and the energy absorption of a given material.|$|R

In each age/weight group {{the weight of the}} turpentine granuloma produced at 48 hr <b>was</b> <b>proportional</b> to log turpentine dose.

5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting in a given deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to {{the square of the}} mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension {{with the same}} driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{the loss}} {{equations}} for non-beneficial/beneficial attributes are derived for linear, quadratic and cubic functions. In case of linear function, the loss {{is assumed to}} <b>be</b> <b>proportional</b> to the deviation of the attribute from the best value of the attribute. Similarly, in quadratic loss function the loss is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>proportional</b> to {{the square of the}} deviation of the attribute from the best value of the attribute. Loss is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>proportional</b> to the cube of the deviations in case of cubic loss functions.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937 King Hubbert {{described}} the key principles for scaling analogue models. He defined {{three types of}} similarity between models and the natural world: geometric, kinematic and dynamic. To be geometrically similar, lengths in the model and natural example must <b>be</b> <b>proportional</b> and angles must be equal. To be kinematically similar, they must be geometrically similar and the time needed for changes to occur must <b>be</b> <b>proportional.</b> Dynamic similarity additionally requires that the various forces acting on {{a point in the}} model <b>are</b> <b>proportional</b> to those at a corresponding point in nature ...|$|R

5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|In Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī's (973–1048) Shadows, {{non-uniform}} {{motion is}} described {{as the result of}} acceleration. Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, a precursor of the concept of momentum. Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion; Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī (c. 1080 – 1164/5) disagreed, arguing that velocity and acceleration are two different things, and that force <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to acceleration, not to velocity.|$|E
5|$|Lithium fluoride, artificially {{grown as}} crystal, {{is clear and}} {{transparent}} and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It {{has one of the}} lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.|$|E

5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the delocalized electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
5|$|Preload {{refers to}} the filling {{pressure}} of the atria {{at the end of}} diastole, when they are at their fullest. A main factor is how long it takes the ventricles to fill—if the ventricles contract faster, then there is less time to fill and the preload will be less. Preload can also be affected by a person's blood volume. The force of each contraction of the heart muscle <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> to the preload, described as the Frank-Starling mechanism. This states that the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of muscle fiber, meaning a ventricle will contract more forcefully, the more it is stretched.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur <b>is</b> <b>proportional</b> {{to the population}} size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
