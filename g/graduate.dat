40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} the average incomes of three groups of Japanese {{university}} graduates: medical, STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics), and non-STEM/M <b>graduates.</b> Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>graduates</b> of STEM/M (STEM and medicine) earn more than non-STEM/M <b>graduates,</b> and have argued that this difference is because STEM <b>graduates</b> create higher additional value than non-STEM/M <b>graduates.</b> However, those studies did not consider variables that should be important determinants of income in the Japanese labor market. Moreover, there are strong doubts about the interpretation that the higher incomes of STEM/M <b>graduates</b> result from the higher additional value STEM <b>graduates</b> create. Drawing on the 2005 Social Stratification and Social Mobility national survey data, this paper examines whether STEM/M <b>graduates</b> earn more than non-STEM/M <b>graduates,</b> after controlling for other important determinants of income. The results from a multiple regression analysis estimating the effect of STEM/M on income shows that STEM/M <b>graduates</b> earn more than non-STEM/M <b>graduates.</b> When separating medical and STEM <b>graduates,</b> however, the estimated effect of a STEM major is not statistically significant and its value is low (1 % higher than non-STEM/M). Moreover, when the sample is divided into men and women, there is a significant gender discrepancy in the effect of a STEM major: male STEM <b>graduates</b> earn more than male non-STEM/M <b>graduates</b> while female STEM <b>graduates</b> earn much less than female non-STEM/M <b>graduates...</b>|$|R
