2500|$|For 1972, the Torino was {{redesigned}} using many characteristics {{carried over}} from the previous generation. The 1972 Torino styling emphasized the [...] "long hood short deck" [...] look and had strong elements of coke bottle styling. [...] The Torino line was also revised to {{be made up of}} basic models called [...] "Torino" [...] and more upscale models called [...] "Gran Torinos." [...] The most radical change was a large eggcrate grille in an oval opening on Gran Torinos.

[...] Gran Torinos had chrome bezels surrounding the headlamps {{on each side of the}} large oval grille. [...] Base Torinos had a full width argent eggcrate grille that surrounded the headlights. Base Torinos also used a unique hood and front bumper differentiating it from the Gran Torino models. The Torino's front fenders were flared around the wheel opening and the rear quarter panel had strong character line extending to the rear bumper. The windshield had a more rakish 60-degree angle, while the A-pillars and roof were thinner. Even with this changes, structural integrity remained the same as 1971 models. The rear featured a full width bumper that incorporated thin rectangular tail lights into each bumper end. [...] All Torinos had [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation as standard equipment resulting in vent windows vanishing from four-door and station wagon models. [...] The Torino incorporated new safety features for 1972, including new flush mount door handles and side <b>door</b> <b>guard</b> rails.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>door</b> <b>guards</b> (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger {{trapping}} devices, or finger guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of finger trapping accidents in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. <b>Door</b> <b>guards</b> protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.|$|R

50|$|This {{retirement}} {{proved to}} be tragically short, as not long after Winslow put some of his toys on display (a suggestion by Superman), the entire museum exhibition is completely wrecked. Sightings report {{this to be the}} work of a man in blue tights flying at great speeds. Thinking he's been played for a fool by Superman, Schott swears to destroy everything Superman cares about to avenge his life's work. Eventually it is revealed that the real culprit was Bizarro, in search for the duplicator ray, but by then it was already too late: Schott had already returned to his Toyman ways, murdered Jack Nimball and a hotel <b>door</b> <b>guard</b> in cold blood, and built a giant robot to terrorize the city. Shortly after his defeat, he regains his sanity and remembers what he has done. He sheds tears of regret as he is escorted to the police car. After that incident Winslow's mental state grew even worse, and while he often made several legitimate attempts to atone for his sins, he would often relapse back into madness.|$|E
30|$|Finally, common {{household}} adaptation measures {{should be}} valued {{according to their}} economic benefits. The reduction of costs depends {{on the type of}} adaptive measure; for example, temporary safety measures, such as <b>door</b> <b>guards,</b> reduce damage costs by 50 % (Thurston et al. 2008). However, in this study, comparable adaptation measures (e.g. protective barriers) were found to be underrepresented in their implementation.|$|R

Options included a 350 4-barrel V8 of [...] and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at [...] Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. Three-speed manual transmission was standard; four-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic were optional.

5000|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies with 1 {{in a wider}} wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was {{adjusted}} to have slightly more positive camber than the right, {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 El Caminos.

50|$|The {{design of}} the Hunter Railcars {{is derived from the}} Transwa Prospector - the major {{difference}} being the driving cars are each single-engined instead of dual-engined, due to the lower top speed requirement for the Hunter line. Reversible seating is covered with durable, vandal proof woollen moquette farbric in 3x2 formation, and have retractable footrests. CCTV is installed. The cars have been fitted with Dellner SP couplers. They are able to absorb the impact of a collision, and the anti-climbers will also reduce the force of impact. They also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, such as the Tangara, the driver's cab is built as a protective cage, made of fibreglass, which stretches {{to the end of the}} <b>guard's</b> <b>door.</b> The stainless steel paneling starts at the <b>guard's</b> <b>door.</b> The <b>guard's</b> <b>door</b> is designed to operate separately from the passenger doors.|$|R
