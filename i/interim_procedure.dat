40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} {{consequences of}} switching {{the design and}} construction of bridge foundations in sand and mixed soil profiles from an <b>interim</b> <b>procedure</b> based on Allowable Stress Design to the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) procedure were examined. Independent data of 451 production steel H-piles driven in sand and 173 production steel H-piles driven in mixed soil profile were {{used to evaluate the}} adequacy of the regionally calibrated LRFD procedure and investigate its economic implications. This study concludes that the regional LRFD procedure will increase the plan pile length by 25 % for sand and 12 % for mixed soil profile as opposed to 86 % and 93 %, respectively, if the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) procedure had been implemented. Despite the additional cost incurred by switching to the regional LRFD procedure, it satisfies the target reliability index of 2. 33 for a redundant pile group and the 1 % probability of failure stipulated in the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. Alternatively, it can be stated that the currently used method has a reliability index of 1. 7 for sand and 2. 00 for mixed soil profile with approximately 30 % and 10 % more probability of failures, respectively.

BackgroundIn HLHS, the pulmonary valve functions as the neo-aortic valve. Neo-aortic valve dysfunction has been observed after arterial switch operation and the Ross procedure. MethodsPatients with HLHS born before January 1995 who had the Fontan operation and had serial echocardiograms were included. Echocardiograms were reviewed preoperatively, after each surgical reconstruction, and at most recent follow-up for neo-aortic root size and severity of neo-aortic regurgitation (AR). Potential risk factors for neo-aortic valve dysfunction were assessed. ResultsFifty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis as an <b>interim</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed in 39 patients (74 %). Median duration of follow-up was 9. 2 (range 5. 1 to 21) years. During follow-up, the neo-aortic root progressively dilated {{out of proportion to}} body size over time, with 52 patients (98 %) having a Z-score > 2 at most recent follow-up. Neo-AR was present in 61 % of patients at most recent follow-up, with progression over time in 26 patients (49 %). However, neo-AR was more than mild in only three patients. Significantly larger neo-aortic root Z-scores were observed in patients with any degree of neo-AR at most recent follow-up. No other anatomic or clinical variables correlated with severity of neo-AR or root dilation. ConclusionsAfter staged reconstruction for HLHS, neo-aortic root dilation and neo-AR progress over time. Early volume unloading does not have a beneficial impact on dilation of the neo-aortic root. These findings raise concerns about neo-aortic valve function into adulthood...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesContinuous flow in Fontan {{circulation}} {{results in}} impairment of pulmonary artery endothelial function, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and, potentially, late failure of Fontan circulation. Bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is the <b>interim</b> <b>procedure</b> in palliation {{of patients with}} single-ventricle physiology, but pulmonary arteriovenous malformations occur in many patients. In a porcine chronic model of cavopulmonary shunt, we studied pulmonary hemodynamics, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation occurrence, and gas exchange capabilities. We hypothesized that residual antegrade pulsatile pulmonary flow may attenuate the deleterious effects of nonpulsatile Fontan-type circulation. MethodsThirty pigs underwent a sham procedure (n =  10, group I), a cavopulmonary shunt with right pulmonary artery ligation (n =  10, group II, nonpulsatile), or a cavopulmonary shunt with proximal right pulmonary artery partial ligation (n =  10, group III, micropulsatile). Three months later, in vivo hemodynamics, blood gas exchange, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation occurrence, and lung histology were assessed. ResultsAt 3 months, group II right lungs demonstrated significantly increased pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and evidence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations compared with groups I and III (all P < . 001). Group III lungs also showed increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance compared with the sham group, but significantly less than group II. Group III right lungs had the best gas exchange performance, with less histologic changes compared with group II. ConclusionsWe developed a viable chronic large animal model of bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. Residual antegrade pulsatile flow {{in the setting of}} a cavopulmonary shunt prevents pulmonary arteriovenous malformation formation and attenuates, but does not suppress, the development of pulmonary hypertension. From a clinical standpoint, these data would support keeping a small amount of antegrade pulsatile flow during creation of a cavopulmonary shunt...|$|E

The aim {{of the study is}} to establish the plasma levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs TnT), precursor of B-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs CRP) and their relation to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients undergoing hemodialysis without signs of acute coronary syndrome or heart failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Were studied 48 patients - 26 men and 22 women. Pre and postdialysis levels of hs cTnT, NT-proBNP and hs CRP were measured at week <b>interim</b> <b>procedure.</b> Patients were divided in two groups according to the presence of echocardiographic evidence of LVH - gr A - 40 patients (with LVH), and gr B - 8 patients (without LVH). RESULTS: In the whole group of patients was found elevated predialysis levels of all three biomarkers with significant increase (p < 0. 05) after dialysis with low-flux dialyzers. Predialysis values of NT-proBNP show moderate positive correlation with hs cTnT (r = 0. 47) and weaker with hs CRP (r = 0. 163). Such dependence is observed in postdialysis values of these biomarkers. There is a strong positive correlation between the pre and postdialysis levels: for hs cTnT (r = 0. 966), for NT-proBNP (r = 0. 918) and for hs CRP (r = 0. 859). It was found {{a significant difference in the}} mean values of hs cTnT in gr. A and gr. B (0. 07 ± 0. 01 versus 0. 03 ± 0. 01 ng /mL, p < 0. 05) and NT-proBNP (15, 605. 8 ± 2, 072. 5 versus 2, 745. 5 ± 533. 55 pg /mL, p < 0. 05).

40|$|The Epsilon-metal ({var_epsilon}-metal) {{phase was}} {{selected}} in FY 2009 {{as a potential}} waste form to for immobilizing the noble metals found in the undissolved solids + aqueous stream, and the soluble Tc from ion-exchange process, each resulting from proposed aqueous reprocessing. {var_epsilon}-metal phase is observed in used nuclear fuel and the natural reactors of Oklobono in Gabon, where the long-term corrosion behavior was demonstrated. This makes {var_epsilon}-metal a very attractive waste form. Last fiscal year, {var_epsilon}-metal was successfully fabricated by combining the five-metals, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd and Re (surrogate for Tc), into pellets followed by consolidation with an arc melter. The arc melter produced fully dense samples with the epsilon structure. However, some chemistry differences were observed in the microstructure that resulted in regions rich in Re and Mo, and others rich in Pd, while Ru and Rh remained fairly constant throughout. This year, thermal stability (air), and corrosion testing of the samples fabricated by arc melting were the main focus for experimental work. Thermal stability was measured with a differential scanning calorimeter - thermogravimetric analyzer, by both ramp heating as well as step heating. There is clear evidence during the ramp heating experiment of an exothermic event + a weight loss peak both beginning at {approx} 700 C. Step heating showed an oxidation event at {approx} 690 C with minimal weight gain that occurs just before the weight loss event at 700 C. The conclusion being that the e-metal begins to oxidize and then become volatile. These findings are useful for considering the effects of voloxidation process. Three different pellets were subjected to electrochemical testing to study the corrosion behavior of the epsilon-metal phase in various conditions, namely acidic, basic, saline, and inert. Test was done according to an <b>interim</b> <b>procedure</b> developed for the alloy metal waste form. First an open circuit potential was measured, followed by linear polarization sweeps. The linear polarization sweep range was the Tafel equation was fit to the linear polarization sweep data to determine the corrosion rate of each pellet in each test solution. The average calculated corrosion rates of the three pellets according to solution conditions were: - 1. 91 x 10 {sup - 4 } mm/yr (0. 001 M NaOH), - 1. 48 x 10 {sup - 3 } mm/yr (0. 01 M NaCl), - 8. 77 x 10 {sup - 4 } mm/yr (0. 001 M H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }), - 2. 09 x 10 {sup - 3 } mm/yr (0. 001 M NaOH + 0. 01 M NaCl), and - 1. 54 x 10 {sup - 3 } mm/yr (0. 001 M H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } + 0. 01 M NaCl). Three single-pass flow through (SPFT) test were conducted at a flow rate of 10 ml/day, at 90 C, and pH of 2. 5, 7. 0, and 9. 0 for up to 322 days. Results of the tests indicate that dissolution rates were 5 x 10 {sup - 4 } g m{sup 2 } d{sup - 1 } at pH 9. 0, 1. 2 x 10 {sup - 4 } g m{sup - 2 } d{sup - 1 } at pH 7. 0, and 2 x 10 {sup - 4 } g m{sup - 2 } d{sup - 1 } at pH 2. 5. The sample used for the pH 7. 0 SPFT test contains extra Re compared to samples used for the other two SPFT test, which came from a single pellet. The corrosion data measured this year indicate that the {var_epsilon}-metal phase is chemically durable. The two chemically different phases, but structurally the same, behave differently during dissolution according to the microstructure changes observed in both the electrochemical and in SPFT test. Characterization of the test specimens after testing suggests that the dissolution is complex and involves oxidative dissolution followed by precipitation of both oxide and metallic phases. These {{data suggest that the}} dissolution in the electrochemical and SPFT tests is different; a process that needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Summary Unlike {{an ideal}} system, the return time to thermal balance (tb) between {{upstream}} and downstream thermistors, {{as measured by the}} (compensation) heat pulse velocity method, effectively depends on the heat input and the water content of the wood at zero and low sap flow. Even when these factors were held constant and ambient temperature was stabilized, a twofold variation in tb at zero flow was observed within and among Greenspan Technology sensors implanted in wooden posts, making it impossible to distinguish zero flow from low sap velocities (< 0. 01 [...] 0. 02 mm s- 1). This limitation has serious consequences because the contribution of low flow rates to water movement is important during both daytime and night-time in tropical understory and overstory trees. Measurements in an artificial flow system showed that this technical limitation is exacerbated by erratic variation in sensor response at both zero and low flow rates. The limited sensitivity of the tested sap flow sensors may be caused by their poor thermal contact with wood. <b>Interim</b> <b>procedures</b> are suggested for estimating minimum detectable sap flow and delimiting the hydroactive zone until the sensitivity and interchangeability of sap flow probes are improved...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the study {{examined}} the effect of industry risk changes on perceived audit risk at the financial statement level and whether these changes depended on individual differences such as experience and tolerance for ambiguity. ^ Forty-eight auditors from two offices of one of the “Big 5 ” CPA firms participated in this study. The ANOVA results supported the effect of industry risk in the assessment of audit risk at the financial statement level. Higher industry risk was associated with higher perceived audit risk. Tolerance for ambiguity was also significant in explaining the changes in the assessment of audit risk. Auditors with a high tolerance for ambiguity perceived lower audit risk than auditors with a low tolerance for ambiguity. Although ANOVA results did not find experience to be significant, a t-test for experience showed it to be marginally significant and inversely related to audit risk. ^ The second part of this study examined whether differences in perceived audit risk at the financial statement level altered the extent, nature or timing of the planned auditing procedures. The results of the MANOVA suggested an overall audit risk effect at the financial statement level. Perceived audit risk was significant in explaining the variation in the number of hours planned for the total cycle and the number of hours p 1 anned for the tests of balances and details. Perceived audit risk was not significant in determining the analytical review procedures planned, but assessed inherent risk at the cycle level was significant. The higher the inherent risk the more analytical procedures were planned. Perceived audit risk was not significant in explaining the timing of the procedures, but individual differences were significant.

40|$|In {{clinical}} trials, {{ethical and}} practical needs {{often lead to}} the use of interim analysis. One approach involves conducting interim analysis as repeated measurements accumulate on subjects. Standard group-sequential methods do not apply due to correlation among observations. Only very limited techniques have been available for continuous data. Five techniques are described and evaluated for the interim analysis of continuous repeated measurements in General Linear Multivariate Models and Growth Curve Models settings: 1) the interim analysis step-down (ISD) <b>procedure,</b> 2) the <b>interim</b> analysis modified step-down (IMSD) procedure, 3) the original modified step-down (OMSD) <b>procedure,</b> 4) the <b>interim</b> analysis Hotelling Lawley trace (IHLT), and 5) the Bonferroni strategy. The lSD, IMSD and Bonferroni strategy allow testing general linear hypotheses with pre-assigned spending probabilities, and without specifying the covariance structure. The ISD and IMSD procedures provide an exact overall type I error rate, while the Bonferroni strategy does not. The OMSD and IHLT procedures also provide an exact overall type I error rate, for a fixed spending pattern. The special demands of interim analysis for continuous repeated measurements led to examining the properties of such <b>interim</b> analysis <b>procedures</b> for an interesting range of conditions. Depending upon the conditions, the result...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of targeted therapies, which benefit only a subgroup of patients treated {{for a given}} type of cancer, has been extremely attractive to many investigators. Adaptive seamless phase II/III designs in oncology clinical trials with interim analyses for subpopulation selection could be used if pre-defined biomarker hypothesis exists. We consider the interim analysis using time-to-event endpoints, e. g., overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), to identify whether the whole population or only the biomarker-positive population should be continued into the subsequent stage, whereas a final decision is based on OS data. In this paper, we propose the interim decision-making strategies in adaptive designs with correlated endpoints, considering post-progression survival (PPS) magnitudes. In our approach, the interim decision is {{made on the basis}} of predictive power, by incorporating information on OS as well as PFS. We consider PFS data only in making interim decision in order to supplement the immature OS data. Simulation studies assuming a targeted therapy show that our <b>interim</b> decision <b>procedure</b> performs well in terms of selecting the proper population, especially under a scenario in which PPS affects the translation of the benefit from PFS to OS.

40|$|Aims For {{ethical and}} {{economic}} reasons, interim analysis of phase III clinical trials is essential. This {{study was conducted}} to compare the efficiency of two <b>interim</b> analysis <b>procedures,</b> which could be used to allow early termination of a clinical trial. Methods We made a post hoc application of two interim analysis methods (Lan & DeMets with O'Brien-Flemming modification, and the triangular test according to Whitehead) by using individual patient data from four published placebo-controlled survival trials. We determined the date the trial would have been stopped had each method been used, and we estimated consequent results in terms of events and patient numbers included in the trial, the duration of the trial, and on treatment effect. Results The triangular test provided the lowest number of events required to reach a conclusion of the trials while providing an accurate estimate of experimental treatment effects. The triangular test thus indicated the smallest number of patients that would have been enrolled, and the shortest trial duration. The difference between the methods was most important with a detrimental effect of experimental treatment: the number of required events was reduced by 75 % and the trial duration was shortened by 48 % with the triangular test compared to the Lan & DeMets method. Conclusions Stopping a trial early must depend on the clinical context. It is most important to stop a placebo-controlled trial as soon as possible when the experimental treatment can be shown deleterious. In such a situation the triangular test is more appropriate than the Lan & DeMets method. When a treatment effect is no different from, or better than, placebo the triangular test is also superior but the importance of premature termination of the trial in such cases has to be balanced against the inevitable reduction of information that the trial can provide...|$|R
