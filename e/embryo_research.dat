25|$|On January 14, 2001 the British {{government}} passed The Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001 {{to amend}} the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 by extending allowable reasons for <b>embryo</b> <b>research</b> to permit research around stem cells and cell nuclear replacement, thus allowing therapeutic cloning. However, on November 15, 2001, a pro-life group won a High Court legal challenge, which struck down the regulation and effectively left all forms of cloning unregulated in the UK. Their hope was that Parliament would fill this gap by passing prohibitive legislation. Parliament was quick to pass the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 which explicitly prohibited reproductive cloning. The remaining gap with regard to therapeutic cloning was closed when the appeals courts reversed the previous decision of the High Court.|$|E

40|$|Legislation {{influences}} {{the availability of}} <b>embryos</b> for <b>research.</b> The law in Switzerland, and in some other European countries, is restrictive concerning medically assisted reproduction and stem cell research.

Swiss law defines all embryos generated during a reproductive cycle and not used for reproduction as surplus embryos. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the surplus embryos generated in Switzerland in 2003. A detailed questionnaire was sent to all registered IVF units in Switzerland (n = 22). 11727 embryos were generated during 2003.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{elements of}} the legal process of consent to the donation of ‘spare’ <b>embryos</b> to <b>research,</b> including stem-cell research, and makes a recommendation intended to {{enhance the quality of}} that process, including on occasion by guarding against the invalidity of such consent. This is important in its own right and also so as to maximise the reproductive treatment options of couples engaged in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment and to avoid possible harms to them. In Part 1, with reference to qualitative data from three UK IVF clinics, we explore the often delicate and contingent nature of what comes to be, for legal purposes, a ‘spare’ embryo. The way in which an embryo becomes ‘spare’, with its implications for the process of consent to donation to research, is not addressed in the relevant reports relating to or codes of practice governing the donation of <b>embryos</b> to <b>research,</b> which assume an unproblematic notion of the ‘spare’ embryo. Significantly, our analysis demonstrates that there is an important and previously unrecognised first stage in the donation of a ‘spare’ <b>embryo</b> to <b>research,</b> namely: consent to an embryo being ‘spare’ and so, at the same time, to its disuse in treatment. This is not explicitly covered by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (HFE) Act 1990, as amended by the HFE Act 2008. Having identified this important initial stage in the process of consent to the donation of a ‘spare’ <b>embryo</b> to <b>research</b> in conclusion to Part 1, in Part 2 we analyse the idea of consent to an embryo's disuse in treatment on the basis that it is ‘spare’ with reference to the legal elements of consent, namely information as to nature and purpose, capacity, and voluntariness. We argue that there are in fact three related consent processes in play, of which the principal one concerns consent to an embryo's disuse in treatment.

40|$|Background: Systematic {{knowledge}} on {{the factors that}} influence the decisions of IVF users regarding <b>embryo</b> donation for <b>research</b> is a core need for patient-centred policies and ethics in clinical practice. However, no systematic review has been provided on the motivations of patients who must decide embryo disposition. This paper fills this gap, presenting a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies, which synthesizes the current body of {{knowledge on}} the factors and reasons associated with IVF patients’ decisions to donate or not to donate <b>embryos</b> for <b>research.</b> Methods: A systematic search of studies indexed in PubMed, ISIWoK and PsycINFO, published before November 2013, was conducted. Only empirical, peer-reviewed, full-length, original studies reporting data on factors and reasons associated with the decision concerning donation or non-donation of <b>embryos</b> for <b>research</b> were included. Eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent researchers and disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer, if required. The main quantitative findings were extracted and synthesized and qualitative data were assessed by thematic content analysis. Results: A total of 39 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. More than half of the studies (n ¼ 21) used a quantitative methodology, and the remaining were qualitative (n ¼ 15) or mixed-methods (n ¼ 3) studies. The studies were derived mainly from European countries (n ¼ 18) and the USA(n ¼ 11). The proportion of IVF users who donated <b>embryos</b> for <b>research</b> varied from 7 % in a study in France to 73 % in a Swiss study. Those who donate <b>embryos</b> for <b>research</b> reported feelings of reciprocity towards science and medicine, positive views of research and high levels of trust in the medical system. They described their decision as better than the destruction of embryos and as an opportunity to help others or to improve health and IVF treatments. The perception of risks, the lack of information concerning research projects and the medical system and the conceptualization of embryos in terms of personhood were the most relevant motives for not donating <b>embryos</b> for <b>research.</b> Results relating to the influence of sociodemographic characteristics and reproductive and gynaecological history were mostly inconclusive. Conclusions: Three iterative and dynamic dimensions of the IVF patients’ decision to donate or not to donate <b>embryos</b> for <b>research</b> emerged from this review: the hierarquization of the possible options regarding embryo disposition, according to the moral, social and instrumental status attributed to embryos; patients’ understanding of expectations and risks of the research on human embryos; and patients’ experiences of information exchange and levels of trust in the medical-scientific institutions.

40|$|To develop {{guidance}} for clinicians {{participating in the}} informed choice process {{with respect to the}} donation of human <b>embryos</b> for <b>research</b> purposes. Recommendations: 1. As indicated in the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Guidelines and the Assisted Human Reproduction Act, specific consent from both the gamete and embryo providers is required before embryos can be used for research purposes. The gamete donors may be different individuals than the embryo providers when donated gametes are used to create embryos. 2. The consent process should inform potential donors of the possible types of (and for final consent, the specific) research project(s) for which the embryos will be used, the risks involved in donating <b>embryos</b> to <b>research,</b> such as not having these embryos available for their reproductive purposes, the fact that the woman/couple will not benefit personally from donating <b>embryos</b> to <b>research,</b> the potential for commercial gain by others, the possibility that they will be contacted in future about the disposition of the embryos, the fact that confidentiality cannot be absolutely guaranteed. 3. Designation of cryopreserved embryos no longer be required for reproductive purposes to be donated to research, donated to another couple, or discarded should be discussed prior to gamete retrieval and made at the time of cryopreservation, with the understanding that in the future, final consent will be requested. The final decision as to the donation of cryopreserved <b>embryos</b> <b>research</b> should not be made until after the woman/ couple decide they no longer require the embryos for their reproductive purposes. The decision to end cryopreservation should be made separately from the decision regarding disposition of the embryos. The woman/couple will have to be re-contacted regarding the final disposition of their embryos. 4. As a result of lack of scientific data regarding the predictability of microscopic characterization of embryos and potential for pregnancy, it is recommended that all women/couples be offered the opportunity to cryopreserve all embryos not transferred during the treatment cycle and be informed that a failure to cryopreserve all embryos may increase the chance of having to undergo an additional in vitro fertilization cycle to achieve reproductive goals. 5. Research participants should be informed that they may withdraw their consent at any time before the embryos are thawed for research purposes, or, in the case of stem cell research, before a stem cell line is created. 6. Potential donors should be informed that their medical care will not be affected by their decision regarding embryo donation...|$|R
