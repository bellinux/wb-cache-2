50|$|Mechanization, the {{movement}} away from glass containers, and {{the movement}} of manufacturing to emerging nations with cheaper labor costs led many unions in the ceramics, glass, and pottery industries to rapidly lose members. The AFL-CIO established a Stone, Glass and Clay Coordinating Committee to coordinate the collective bargaining activities of these shrinking unions and strengthen their activities in this area. The coordinating committee also encouraged union mergers. This latter effort had some success. In 1975, the former Glass Bottle Blowers Association (GBBA) merged with the Window <b>Glass</b> <b>Cutters</b> League.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>cutters</b> are {{manufactured}} with wheels of varying diameters. [...] One {{of the most}} popular has a diameter of 5.5 mm ( [...] in). The ratio between the arc of the wheel and the pressure applied with the tool has an important bearing on the degree of penetration. Average hand pressure with this size wheel often gives good results. For a duller wheel on soft glass a larger wheel (e.g., 6 mm ( [...] in) will require no change in hand pressure. A smaller wheel (3 mm ( [...] in)) is appropriate for cutting patterns and curves since a smaller wheel can follow curved lines without dragging.|$|R

[...] Kulka rejected the architectural universities {{of the day in}} favour of Adolf Loos's 1919 Bauschule.

Cubic spatial architecture would become the basis of the Loos-Kulka professional relationship. Kulka worked intimately with Loos from 1919 until 1932 when the severity of Loos's illness prevented Loos from carrying out his professional activities.|$|R
50|$|The 1861 census {{identified}} that 1,032 residents of Stourbridge {{were involved in}} the glass trade in some way. Of these, 541 were glass workers - an increase from 409 in 1851, believed to be partly caused by the collapse of the glass industry in nearby Dudley in the 1850s. The vast majority of those involved in the glass trade came from Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. 9% came from other parts of England and 0.2% had come from abroad. Of particular note are <b>glass</b> <b>cutters,</b> as 8.1% had come from Ireland, believed to be {{as a result of the}} decline of the Irish glasscutting industry in the first half of the 1800s. The houses inhabited by glassworkers were of a much better quality in comparison to the slums in which the nailmakers of Lye and Wollescote lived. However, only a few glassworkers owned their own houses.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a history of the flint glass makers and their unionAn the period between 1850 and 1880. The thesis {{attempts}} to throw light both on the flint glass makers and on the concept of Labour aristocraoy. Part one is an analysis of the flint glass makers at the point of production. After giving some account of the flint glass industry, the peculiarity of the work situation is examined; the produotion processq hours of workq methods of wage payments and other working conditions. Wage differentials between different groups of glass makers are analysed as a necessary condition for the formation of the Labour aristocracy. In particular, an attempt is made to reconstruct the life time experience of the glass makers. Special attention is paid to the relationship between <b>glass</b> makersp <b>glass</b> <b>cutters</b> and bottle makers. Part two comprises a detailed investigation of the structure and policies of the Flint Glass Makers Friendly Society in which it is argued that although the Society was a "New Model" Union as the Webbs labelled it, it did not always behave in accordance with Webbian notions of "New-Model" activities...|$|R

50|$|J.S. O'Connor American Rich Cut Glassware Factory, {{also known}} as Maple City Glass Company, H.W. Kimble Silk Company, and Arrow Throwing Company, is a {{historic}} glassware factory and silk mill located at Hawley, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. With the waning of the canal and gravity rail operations in the late 19th Century, Hawley developed into a busy manufacturing town. In addition to silk fabric and garments, among the chief products was fine cut glass. The leading cut glass establishment was that of John Sarsfield O’Connor (1831 - 1916) {{at the base of}} the Paupack Falls. The building was built on the site of previous mills of wood frame construction in 1890. The earliest of these dates back to the founding of the hamlet of Paupack Eddy, the forerunner of Hawley, in the closing decade of the 18th Century. It is a three-story, 160 feet long and 44 feet wide, bluestone building in the Federal style, with an addition 40 by 75 feet. J.S. O’Connor Rich Cut Glass has been described as one of the most extensive glass cutting factories in America. O’Connor is recalled as one of the finest <b>glass</b> <b>cutters</b> in the nation.The factory was said to be one of its kind in America, run by water power and lit by electricity generated by its own electrical plant. The firm had a capacity of 250 cutting frames. When the third floor was rebuilt, 50 cutting frames were added.This brought the workforce from 150 to nearly 200, and a new showroom was built. Another reference says that the workforce eventually reached almost 300. In 1902, the cut glass firm relocated from Hawley to Goshen, Orange County, NY. On January 16th of that year, J. S. O’Connor sold his Hawley plant. The addition was built in 1926, when the building was converted to a silk throwing mill. In 1941 Daniel Vacca Sr, purchased the silk mill. Vacca & Sons operated the Arrow Throwing Company at the facility. During World War II, the Vaccas were a major supplier of yarn for emblems and insignias as well as nylon cord for parachutes. Arrow Throwing Company, the last remaining silk mill in Hawley and one of the few throwing mills left in the Northeast, closed its doors in 1987. Soon a lobby was added to the building by new owners in 1988, when converted to an inn, and a restaurant was added years later. It has a shed roof and features pedimented windows and a decorative cornice.|$|R
