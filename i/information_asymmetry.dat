Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E

40|$|The paper investigates small {{business}} lending as an information problem. It models {{the effects of}} <b>information</b> <b>asymmetries</b> within the bank combined with fixed wages. Two kinds of inefficiencies arise in equilibrium: the credit officer either sometimes shirks or he is occasionally fired. In both cases lending falls below the first-best level. The solution, when the bank accepts the <b>information</b> <b>asymmetries,</b> is called the centralized structure. Under decentralized structure the bank employs additional supervisors to mitigate the <b>information</b> <b>asymmetries</b> within its organization. Decentralized banks manage to finance more small firms, but incur higher costs than centralized ones. Small banks are interpreted as a bank with relatively few credit officers, whom can be monitored without <b>information</b> <b>asymmetries.</b> The specification allows for investigating the effects of banking consolidation and technological change on {{small business}} lending.
