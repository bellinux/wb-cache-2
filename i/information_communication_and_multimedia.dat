The dramatic multiplication of computer, <b>information,</b> <b>communication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> technologies has been changing everything from the ways people work, to the ways they communicate with each other and spend their leisure time (Weiss, Nolan and Hunsinger). This technological revolution is often interpreted as the beginning of a knowledge or information society, and therefore ascribes education a central role in every aspect of life. According to Swaminatham (2000), many developing countries remain poor largely because they had let the industrial revolution pass them by. They can ill afford to miss the information technology revolution. This revolution holds an immense challenge to educators as they need to rethink their basic principles, to implement the new technologies in creative and productive ways, and to restructure schooling, examinations and assessment to react constructively an...|$|E
40|$|E-learning is an {{educational}} process utilizing computer, internet, intranet, <b>information,</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> technologies {{in order to}} improve the quality of education and cooperation of the whole educational community and to facilitate access to educational materials, services and information exchange. The objective of e-learning is efficient, fast and easily accessible education. Combined with standard forms of training (distance and full-time studies) e-learning allows one to combine the needs, schedule and opportunities of the student in an optimal way. All this is possible because the educational activities can proceed not only in educational institutions, but also in environments chosen by the student (home, working environment, holidays, traveling etc.) In this way e-learning enables one to save considerable financial expenses. These are attractive reasons for using e-learning and blended learning- not only for individuals but also for corporate training. This proves even more interesting for companies utilizing external training which is not an inexpensive undertaking...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} multiplication of computer, <b>information,</b> <b>communication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> technologies {{has been}} changing {{everything from the}} ways people work, to the ways they {{communicate with each other}} and spend their leisure time. This technological revolution is often interpreted as the beginnings of a knowledge or information society, and therefore ascribes education a central role in every aspect of life. It poses tremendous challenges to educators to rethink their basic tenets, to deploy the new technologies in creative and productive ways, and to restructure schooling to respond constructively and progressively to the technological and social changes currently underway. At the same time, important demographic and socio-political changes are taking place throughout the world. Emigration patterns have created the challenge of providing people from diverse races, classes, and backgrounds with the tools and competencies to enable them to succeed and participate in an ever more complex and changing world. In this chapter, I argue that educators need to cultivate multiple literacies for contemporary technological and multicultural societies, that teachers need to develop new literacies of diverse sorts, including a more fundamental importance for print literacy, to meet the challenge of restructuring education for a hi-tech, multicultural society, and global culture.

40|$|Internet {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} resources for <b>information</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> retrievals. Most <b>multimedia</b> signals today are in digital formats. The digital data can be duplicated and edited with great ease which has led to a need for data integrity and protection of digital data. The security requirements such as integrity or data authentication can be met by implementing security measures using digital watermarking techniques. In this paper a blind speech watermarking algorithm that embeds the watermark signal data in the musical (sequence) host signal by using frequency masking is used. A different logarithmic approach is proposed. In this regard a logarithmic function is first applied to watermark data. Then the transformed signal is embedded to the converted version of host signal which is obtained by applying Fast Fourier transform method. Finally using inverse Fast Fourier Transform and antilogarithmic function watermark signal is retrieved.

Central to our research is the idea of similarity which is a reflexive, symmetric relation over the domain of a data object. By exploiting the similarity relation, we propose a class of efficient data-access policies for real-time data objects. We shall also discuss the design of a distributed real-time data-access interface.

40|$|The {{next-generation}} {{wireless communication}} systems {{are expected to}} support {{a broad range of}} services including <b>communication,</b> <b>information,</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>and</b> entertainment. In order to meet the increasing demand in capacity and achieve multirate services in the 3 G wireless communication systems, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) has emerged as the main candidate under consideration. However, because of its inherent multiple access interference, the performance of CDMA can be severely degraded as the number of subscribers increases. Multiuser detection is a scheme which jointly detect all users' signals and by doing so can offer significant system performance improvement. This paper investigates and analyzes the performance of multiuser successive interference cancellation in a coded wideband DS/CDMA communication system. Specifically, a new multistage interference cancellation method is presented which employs a combined coding, successive interference cancellation and random interleaving. Simulation results will demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the system capacity and performance. © 1999 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In the mid-nineties, {{multimedia}} became {{established as}} an industrial branch {{in the region}} of Munich. Munich holds a leading position among Germany's multimedia regions, referring to the numbers of companies <b>and</b> employees. The <b>multimedia</b> boom in the early 1990 s was triggered by a rapidly increasing demand from enterprises in the Munich region (in the automobile, electronics, publishing, movie and television, banking, insurance and advertising industries) for modern forms of <b>information,</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> training. The <b>multimedia</b> companies find a sufficient supply of qualified labour on Munich's labour market. Moreover a broad range of institutions for education and training and the willingness of many employees to move into the Munich area are additional factors. Multimedia in the Munich region constitutes a fully-fledged production and service cluster. It is based on the availability of varied support services, a specific infrastructural environment, and a creative, innovative milieu. Vertical and horizontal cooperation along the value chain is enabled. Political support on the level of the Bundesland and the region does not primarily aim at promoting multimedia directly but at creating the basic conditions for the entire media economy as well as a specific further qualification of the employees.

40|$|Scotland's rich {{heritage}} {{in the field}} of science and engineering and recent curricular developments led to major investment in education to equip pupils with improved scientific knowledge and skills. However, due to its abstract and conceptual nature, learning science can be challenging. Literature supports the role of multimedia technology in addressing the difficulties associated with science learning. This paper reports on a two-phase investigation that explored the impact of multimedia resources situated in a national e-learning portal to (1) assist generalist and specialist science teachers' teaching practices and (2) stimulate pupils' interest, encourage engagement and improve overall science learning experiences. Our research also investigated how portal resources facilitated and/or acted as barriers for teaching and learning. Findings from our research affirm that multimedia technology has transformed science learning; with these resources accessible through a national portal, radically different learning experiences ensued. These findings raise serious implications for teacher education and professional development in ensuring that teachers acquire sound science content and pedagogical knowledge as well as practical strategies for utilising technology-rich environments, as this is likely to become the norm. Harnessing the fullest potential that <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> technology, <b>multimedia</b> <b>and</b> e-learning portals can offer starts by addressing these challenges...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> {{technology}} <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> {{technology have}} increasingly altered {{the landscape of}} the educational field particularly in higher education. In that, student is becoming the key focus of the educational process, where students’ creativity and interactions are strongly encouraged through IT enabled systems. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading; and course evaluation. The amount of multimedia support facilitated by the e-learning systems has given significant consideration in order to make distance education as effective as classroom education and make the blended leaning experience more effective. While the technology is moving toward a multimedia rich learning management system, its practical deployments is still far away, due to many unsolved technical and pedagogical problems. In this paper we present a framework for implementing a content integrated learning management system with specific focus on multimedia enrichment in learning content. It can be used effectively for teaching courses in medicine as well as to support complementary education for clinicians through channels such as telemedicine which can be integrated as an important component of epidemiology. We discuss two implementation examples: (a) UMELMS implementation in Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, and (b) telemedicine implementation to support international medical collaboration to present our concept of new generation medical education system design...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} research and development effort for Third-generation or 3 G wireless <b>and</b> mobile <b>communication</b> systems. Such systems {{will be able to}} provide end-user with data rates of up to 384 kbps for wide area coverage and up to 2 Mbps for local area coverage. This will also significantly expand the range of options available to users <b>and</b> allow <b>communication,</b> <b>information,</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>and</b> entertainment service to be delivered via wireless terminals. Of the various services, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) has been regarded as {{an important part of the}} third generation systems because of its high frequency utilization and suitability for handling multimedia communication. The performance of Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) will be severely degraded with the number of users increases due to the increase in interference. To improve the system capacity, multi-user detection which cancel the interference generated by other users can be used. Recently a Joint Successive Interference Cancellation with Interleaving (JSICI) scheme [1] has been proposed for multi-user detection. However the complexity of the scheme is very high. In this thesis, we propose a low complexity VLSI architecture which can implement this JSICI scheme for asynchronous frame time transmission efficiently in VLSI. Effective memory architecture, low complexity hardware sharing and low power techniques were proposed. To improve the performance of the asynchronous frame time transmission, a novel delay scheduling mechanism is proposed. Simulation results show that the performance is close to that of the synchronous time frame case...|$|R
40|$|Research {{note of the}} Canada Research Chair on the Socio-organizational Challenges of the Knowledge Economy. Montreal: Télé-université, Université du Québec à Montréal. www. teluq. uqam. ca/chaireecosavoir. Over {{the last}} few decades, many {{countries}} have {{found themselves in a}} context characterized by the spread of the knowledge-based economy (OECD, 1996; Foray and Lundvall, 1995; Soete, 1996; Storper, 1995). The Knowledge Economy implies a farreaching transformation of the labour market, particularly in terms of job mobility and career development (Christensen, 1989). In this context, careers are increasingly fragmented, and people are more mobile in the labour market, with social networks playing an important role in this job mobility as well as in professional development. Although not everyone is concerned by these developments, and there are some resistances to this change in work organization and careers, it is clear that some sectors, particularly the New Economy creative sectors (multimedia, New media such as digital video, tv and the like, ITC), are very much concerned by these developments. This constitutes a considerable challenge for occupational development, since it used to be provided by the firm within internal labour markets and this can no longer be the case when people are more mobile. Now, especially in sectors such as ICT (<b>Information</b> <b>and</b> <b>Communication</b> Technologies) <b>and</b> <b>multimedia,</b> characterized by extreme mobility between firms, but also by a need for permanent professional development, the challenge for firms to capture strategic advantages presents itself in a new perspective. In our view, these new careers, described by some as "nomadic" (Cadin, 1998; Arthur, Claman and De Fillippi, 1995; De Fillippi and Arthur, 1998; Hendry and Jenkins, 1997; Hendry, Arthur and Jones, 1995) and by others as "discontinuous" (Tremblay, 1997), lead us to question our vision of organizations and organization theory. Let us add that in terms of Communications and Strategies, the sector and the questions it poses are surely important, since they call into question the impact of the Communications sector and its developments in <b>multimedia</b> <b>and</b> ICT, as well as management strategies that may be developing in these sectors. Over the last two years, we have conducted research on people who work in the ICT <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> industry. Our paper will dwell on the new types of careers developing in these sectors, highlighting a new form of work organization, which is more informal and rests very much on social networks developed by the workers in these sectors. We will highlight the new type of careers and work organization that is observed and conclude with some questions which need to be addressed {{in the context of the}} development of ICT <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> <b>and</b> particularly as concerns careers and work organization of the future. The new economic sectors characterized by mobility and nomadic behaviour present insights that can be useful in modernizing Work Organization and Career theories, although it may be too soon to draw conclusions as to what this new theoretical vision should be. Clearly, the new vision would need to take into account new forms of learning, new forms of careers offered by firms, aspirations of young workers in these sectors, etc. It also should take into account the specificities of networks of workers in the ICT <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> sectors, as well as the construction of careers of professionals and technicians who are at the core of the competitive advantage of the ICT <b>and</b> <b>multimedia</b> firms...|$|R

40|$|Even if {{it seems}} to be obvious, it has to be {{emphasized}} that there exist a double dimension in the understanding, working and, hence, improvement of u-learning issues: 1) the technological and technical one (<b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>communication</b> devices; <b>multimedia</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> knowledge availability and accessibility [...] .); 2) the social and cultural one (i. e. learning as a ubiquitous activity taking place in a social setting, performed by social actors, [...] . and, this, with the help of, by means of any digital object or resource possessing a relevance for the learner's objectives or aims). In many reports and expertises, u-learning is mainly approached via the technological and technical perspective which has its relevance, especially, with respect to short-term economical and commercial issues. But it is also obvious that the delivery of (very broadly speaking) educational material not only on PC but also on mobile phones, i-pods, iTV, etc. has to satisfy potential user needs, interests or desires or - at least - has to have a such appealing aspect that it is - potentially - able to create a recognizable user need and interest. For this reasons, studies about u-learning have also to take into account social and especially cultural or conceptual (cognitive) questions such as of how to understand and control better on the one hand of what is called in a most broadest sense "learning", or a "learning situation", {{and on the other hand}} of intellectual services and products fitting with such - very broadly speaking - learning situations. In this report we will try to explore this second dimension, the social and cultural one, determining not only our understanding of u-learning but also of possible evolution scenarios of this (new ?) paradigm. Chapter 2 is dedicated to a better understanding of what one can call a learning situation in a very broad sense (and not only in the sense of formal or semi-formal and institutionalised situations). A basic and a more advanced narrative model will be presented for the design of any type of learning situations. Chapter 3 discusses the relationship between digital objects and digital learning resources. A concrete example will be presented. Chapter 4 deals more specifically with the question of (re-) authoring of digital objects in order to promote them as digital learning resources. Chapter 5 presents a technical environment for the (re-) authoring of mainly digital audiovisual objects. Chapter 6, finally, presents a concrete case of (re-) authoring resources for adapting them to an a priori open diversity of learning situations. Même si cela semble aller de soi, il faut souligner qu'il existe une double dimension dans la compréhension de ce qu'on appelle l'u-learning (l'apprentissage ubiquitaire) : 1) la dimension technique et technologique (dispositifs techniques d'accès aux informations et aux connaissances, standards, interopérabilité des ontologies [...] .); 2) la dimension sociale et culturelle (l'apprentissage comme une activité omniprésente se déroulant dans un contexte social, et exercé par tous les acteurs sociaux).
