In order to end the conflict quickly, Phrynon accepted the invitation to duel made by the Mytilenean general Pittacus (one of the Seven Sages of Greece). Phrynon was defeated at the duel, because Pittacus had a <b>hidden</b> <b>net</b> beneath his shield and with it caught and killed him. Pittacus thus won the war for his homeland.

40|$|A fast {{algorithm}} is presented {{for the training}} of multilayer perceptron neural networks, which uses separate error functions for each hidden unit and solves multiple sets of linear equations. The algorithm builds upon two previously described techniques. In each training iteration, output weight optimization (OWO) solves linear equations to optimize output weights, which are those connecting to output layer net functions. The method of hidden weight optimization (HWO) develops desired <b>hidden</b> unit <b>net</b> signals from delta functions. The resulting hidden unit error functions are minimized with respect to hidden weights, which are those feeding into <b>hidden</b> unit <b>net</b> functions. An {{algorithm is}} described for calculating the learning factor for hidden weights.

40|$|Discriminant {{analysis}} is a supervised learning technique {{that can be}} used in order to determine which variables are the best predictors of the classification of objects belonging to a population into predetermined classes. At the same time, discriminant analysis provides a powerful tool that enables researchers to make predictions regarding the classification of new objects into predefined classes. The main goal of discriminant {{analysis is}} to determine which of the N descriptive variables have the most discriminatory power, that is, which of them are the most relevant for the classification of objects into classes. In order to classify objects, we need a mathematical model that provides the rules for optimal allocation. This is the classifier. In this paper we will discuss three of the most important models of classification: the Bayesian criterion, the Mahalanobis criterion and the Fisher criterion. In this paper, we will use discriminant analysis to classify the insurance companies that operated on the Romanian market in 2006.

40|$|The recent {{emerging}} market experiences have posed {{a challenge to}} the conventional wisdom that unsustainable fiscal deficits are the key to understanding financial crises in these countries. The health of the domestic banking system has emerged as the main driving force behind the perverse dynamics of partial reforms. The current paper shares this view and uses a model of contractual inefliciencies in the banking sector to understand the dynamics of these reforms. We find that the threat of a large exchange rate devaluation depends on the stock of international reserves relative to the stock of domestic credit that must be extended by the Central Bank in response to a large capital outflow. Moreover, if a country has a weak banking sector but high <b>net</b> <b>reserve</b> ratios, the capital flow reversal might only increase the vulnerability to a currency crisis without necessarily causing it. The results are in accordance with much of the empiricalliterature on the determinants of financiaI crises in {{emerging market}}s.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{economic}} equilibrium {{analysis of a}} reinsurance market. The continuous-time model contains the principal components of uncertainty; about the time instants at which accidents take place, and about claim sizes given that accidents have occurred. We give sufficient conditions on preferences for a general equilibrium to exist, with a Pareto optimal allocation, and derive the premium functional via a representative agent pricing theory. The marginal utility process of the reinsurance market {{is represented by the}} density process for random measures, which opens up for numerous applications to premium calculations, some of which are presented in the last section. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations of individual dynamic optimization are established for proportional treaties, and the term structure of interest rates is found in this reinsurance syndicate.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{occurrence}} of "financial distress, " a financial condition that is significantly associated with high default risk in publicly traded firms. We posit that a firm’s ability to raise capital, internally or externally, proxied by funds generated from operations, the <b>net</b> <b>reserve</b> of current resources, the remaining capacity to obtain debt financing, and accessibility to equity capital are indicative of {{the likelihood of the}} firm experiencing financial distress. We empirically test this hypothesis and show that a model composed of proxies to capture firms’ ability to raise capital is significantly associated with, and can predict, the onset of financial distress. Furthermore, the predictive ability of this model appears to be incrementally useful, as compared to that of a model containing only controls for size and stress only (Hopwood, McKeown and Mutchler, 1994) and a "naïve " approach of predicting all firms to be either distressed or non-distressed. We interpret these findings to suggest that the ability to obtain capital is a crucial factor for firms seeking to avoid financial distress and the risk of corporate failure. The model we examine, and the proxies it contains, may prove useful to investors seeking to avoid the economic losses associated with the onset of significantly increased default risk...|$|R
