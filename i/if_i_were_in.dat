500|$|The {{limitations}} of devising the album's musical direction {{on a tour}} bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, [...] "I didn't have guitars around {{because it was too}} much hassle... It was another creative limitation... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> my studio, I would have done things the way I normally do them. But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the methods}} that Playford used were {{described}} by economic conservatives as 'socialism', drawing opposition from within his own party, especially in the Legislative Council. It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber—Sir Collier Cudmore—once referred to Playford as a 'Bolshevik'. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader Mick O'Halloran would dine with Playford {{on a weekly basis}} to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that [...] "I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> his shoes." [...] O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner". Playford called Labor [...] "our Opposition", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being [...] "critical without being helpful". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan's prominence in the late 1950s, when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.|$|E

2500|$|A {{stirring}} speech against {{racial discrimination}} {{was given by}} African-American activist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, in which she said [...] "You white women speak here of rights. I speak of wrongs. I, as a colored woman, have had in this country an education which has made me feel as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the situation of Ishmael, my hand against every man, and every man's hand against me." ...|$|E

He announced he would begin two months of daily radiation treatment from mid-July; however, {{in a letter to}} shareholders, Buffett said he felt [...] "great - as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> my normal excellent health - and my energy level is 100 percent". On September 15, 2012, Buffett announced that he had completed the full 44-day radiation treatment cycle, saying [...] "it's a great day for me" [...] and [...] "I am so glad to say that's over".|$|E
2500|$|However, as Powell explained, Tricia's secret did {{not stay}} hidden for long. [...] "It's truly awful. It comes out because Mark is sorting out Frank's life {{insurance}} {{and the insurance}} company wants {{to see all of}} his medical notes. Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left to deal with the hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I know that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> his shoes, I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2002, Pisces V and {{her sister}} vessel Pisces IV {{discovered}} a Japanese midget submarine; sunk on December 7, 1941 by the destroyer [...] in the first American shots fired in World War II, the submarine {{was hit by a}} 4"/50caliber gun shot and depth charged shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor began. The submarine was found in [...] of water about [...] off the mouth of Pearl Harbor. This was the culmination of a 61-year search for the vessel and has been called [...] "the most significant modern marine archeological find ever in the Pacific, second only to the finding of Titanic in the Atlantic". In 2003, Pisces V visited the Japanese midget submarine it had found in Pearl Harbor the year before. The U.S. State Department worked in conjunction with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to determine Japanese wishes regarding the fate of the midget submarine. The submersibles are used by HURL as teaching devices. In 2008, two members of the Tampa Bay Chapter of SCUBAnauts were invited to team with HURL and to visit the historic wreck of the Japanese submarine. One SCUBAnaut said as he stepped on Pisces V that [...] "it looked and felt as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a space shuttle preparing for lift-off".|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{has stated}} that she {{supports}} a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage. This position differed with that of her running mate, John McCain. In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren, Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, [...] "I believe that states have that constitutional right {{to make decisions about}} a variety of issues, {{but when it comes to}} some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, of our culture, I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would be, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a day at sea, with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> his place I should do all that he has done and I should do all that I know he has in mind to do'.|$|E

2500|$|At the November 2010 FOMC meeting, Warsh was {{extremely}} {{skeptical of the}} Fed's plan to generate economic activity and jobs by trying to lower long-term interest rates. Although unemployment was close to 10%, Warsh told his colleagues that he would only vote for QE2 {{out of respect for}} Chairman Bernanke: [...] "If I were in your chair, I would not be leading the Committee in this direction, and frankly, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the chair of most people around this room, I would dissent." [...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I think that would be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of." [...] The Federal Reserve has a legal dual mandate to pursue maximum employment as well as to ensure price stability.|$|E
