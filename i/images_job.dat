H 577 P SHTM 2015 Sunxiii, 286 pages; 30 cmThis study {{investigated}} the general perceptions of hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> among hospitality students in mainland China and developed measurement scales to test the empirical relationships between individual modernity, parental influence, perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> and career intentions. Churchill's (1979) paradigm for developing norms was adopted to facilitate the development of valid scales, and a mixed methodology was designed to achieve the study's objectives. In {{the first part of}} the sequential mixed methods, qualitative data-gathering strategies involving focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were adopted. Content analysis was applied to gain an understanding of how hospitality students perceive hotel <b>job</b> <b>image.</b> The results of the qualitative data analysis provided inputs into the design of the quantitative survey instrument, which was subsequently tested for validity and reliability via two pilot studies involving hospitality students. The first pilot study was conducted to refine the initial items and identify the underlying dimensions. The second was conducted to collect another sample to test the validity and reliability of the purified instruments. After the validity and reliability of the instrument were confirmed, the main survey was conducted. The 736 valid samples obtained were analysed via exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Three dimensions of perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> were generated and validated from the analyses: (1) staff integrity, (2) non-routine job nature and (3) the characteristics and uniqueness of hotel careers. Structural equation modelling was carried out to clarify and test the hypothesised causal relationships among the study’s four constructs, i. e., perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image,</b> individual modernity, parental influence and students' career intentions. The statistical results indicated that the model fit the data, and the results provided evidence to support or reject some of the hypotheses. The direct positive effect of perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> on students' career intentions was found to be significant. Furthermore, perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> was found to completely mediate the relationship between individual modernity and students' career intentions. However, the direct effect of individual modernity on career intentions was not supported. The direct relationship between parental influence and students' career intentions was also insignificant, and the indirect effect proved to be significant. This indicates that perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> mediates the relationship between parental influence and students' career intentions. Finally, hospitality students in mainland China were found to have low intentions to pursue careers in the hotel industry after graduation. The findings of this study make theoretical and empirical contributions to the current body of knowledge. First, this study developed and validated a measurement scale of perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> in mainland China that could serve as a solid foundation for future research. Second, it provided evidence that perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> is a significant predictor of career intentions, offering a new approach to investigating students' career intentions in the hotel industry. Finally, it empirically proved the mediating effect of perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image.</b> Perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> was found to be a complete mediator, which may explain how individual modernity and parental influence affect students' career intentions. In addition to the theoretical contributions, the findings have managerial implications for both hotel-related educational institutes and the hotel industry at large. Given that perceived hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> was found to be an important factor influencing students' career intentions, strategies to improve perceptions of a hotel <b>job</b> <b>image</b> may go a long way in attracting hospitality graduates to choose careers in the hotel industry.

40|$|In {{this article}} I propose a {{semiotic}} investigation of <b>images</b> of <b>jobs.</b> The aim {{is not to}} analyze the social representation of the job, but to explore if there remains a present-day <b>image</b> of the <b>job,</b> and what are its historical and social conditions of existence. The problem is to study the relation between social structure and the <b>image</b> of the <b>job.</b> First, following Foucault’s studies on disciplinary society, the relation between disciplinary society {{and the image of}} labour in the factory will be described. This is followed by an account of the problematic passage from disciplinary society to what Deleuze called a “society of control”. Giving particular consideration to Foucault’s theory of power/knowledge relations and Deleuze’s semiotic reading of this theory,the new social organization of jobs, activities and times will be investigated. Social structure is changing from disciplinary and striated space, such as the space of the factory, to the smooth space of dispersion, like the space of the market. The <b>image</b> of the <b>job</b> changes from the image of the workforce to the image of human capital. Finally, rethinking Foucault’s lectures on biopolitics, the relation between the market and hu- man capital will be analyzed. My hypothesis {{is that it is not}} possible to have an <b>image</b> of the <b>job</b> as human capital in the present: the concept of human capital coincides with the human being and its capability, but there is no longer any specific space for the market, given that the market permeates every space of life...|$|R

Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is extended by including the determinants of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, {{as well as the}} security and privacy variables. Data was collected from 183 healthcare organizations, and was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analysis. The results showed that subjective norm, <b>image,</b> <b>job</b> relevance and output quality have direct and positive relationships with perceived usefulness. Facilitating conditions of the healthcare organizations have positive and direct relationships with the perceived ease of use of RFID. Both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are found to have significant relationships with the healthcare organizations’ intentions to adopt RFID. This research proposed and empirically examined a new technology adoption model that explains RFID adoption decisions in the healthcare industry. The research findings could be used to assist decision makers of healthcare organizations to formulate strategies to improve their RFID system implementation.

Background. The stereotypical public image of nursing {{is a major concern}} to nurses. However, it is relatively unknown how this image affects nurses. A few studies have investigated how nurses&# 039; interpretations of their public image affect their self-image and work behaviour. Methods. A convenience sample of 346 Australian nurses participated in a questionnaire study in 2003. The results were analysed by t-test, polynomial regression and response surface analysis. Six participants from the survey participated in a focus group to provide further interpretation of the findings. Results. Nurses rated their aptitude for leadership more positively than they thought the public viewed them. In contrast, nurses rated their image as being caring less negatively than their perceived public <b>image.</b> <b>Job</b> performance was predicted by self-image relating to leadership aptitude. On the contrary, the relationship between self-image and perception of the public image as being caring predicted job performance. When nurses perceived their public image as caring less positively than their self-image, their job performance tended to improve. As for turnover intention, both self-image and perceived public images of having an aptitude for leadership and being caring were negatively related to intention to quit the job. Conclusion. To enhance nurses&# 039; job performance and reduce their turnover intentions, it is important to improve both the public image and self-image of nurses...|$|R

In today 2 ̆ 7 s globalized world, multinational enterprises need to attract talent not only in the domestic market but also in overseas markets.
