5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are classified as starburst galaxies, one quarter are classified as Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are classified as low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydroxyl</b> megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As <b>hydroxyl</b> emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, <b>hydroxyl</b> masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the <b>hydroxyl</b> luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers. Detection of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of star formation in these objects.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} decade, megamasers were also {{discovered}} for formaldehyde (H2CO) and methine (CH). Galactic formaldehyde masers are relatively rare, and more formaldehyde megamasers are known than are galactic formaldehyde masers. Methine masers, {{on the other}} hand, are quite common in the Milky Way. Both types of megamaser were found in galaxies in which <b>hydroxyl</b> had been detected. Methine is seen in galaxies with <b>hydroxyl</b> absorption, while formaldehyde is found in galaxies with <b>hydroxyl</b> absorption {{as well as those}} with <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser emission.|$|E

40|$|Adsorption of {{boric acid}} trimethyl ester (BATE) on high-surface-area silica {{has been studied}} by FT-IR spectroscopy. It is found that surface <b>hydroxyls</b> {{remaining}} after outgassing at high temperatures act as weak basic sites for BATE adsorption. Coordinate interaction of BATE with isolated <b>hydroxyls</b> dominates the adsorption and induces two splitting B-O vibrational bands at 1375 and 1345 cm(- 1). In addition, {{a small amount of}} BATE reacts with hydrogen-bonded <b>hydroxyls</b> and strained oxygen generated after high-temperature dehydroxylation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
50|$|The Fischer {{projection}} is {{a systematic}} way of drawing the skeletal formula of an acyclic monosaccharide {{so that the}} handedness of each chiral carbon is well specified. Each stereoisomer of a simple open-chain monosaccharide can be identified by the positions (right or left) in the Fischer diagram of the chiral <b>hydroxyls</b> (the <b>hydroxyls</b> attached to the chiral carbons).|$|R
5|$|The {{observed}} {{relationship between}} the luminosity of the <b>hydroxyl</b> line and the far infrared suggests that <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers seemed to present {{a problem with this}} model for compact emission components of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by <b>hydroxyl</b> and lead to a maser photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism. However, a model of maser emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse <b>hydroxyl</b> emission. A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line maser emission, and applies to all <b>hydroxyl</b> masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm this basic picture, but there are still some discrepancies between details of the model and observations of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust opacity for megamaser emission.|$|E
5|$|A few <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers, {{including}} Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The <b>hydroxyl</b> masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic maser emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers.|$|E
5|$|Arp 220 {{hosts the}} first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy, {{and has been}} studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this reason, it is the prototype of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser host galaxies, and is often used {{as a guide for}} interpreting other <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers and their hosts.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} methanol synthesis with model supported copper catalysts, Cu/ZnO and Cu/MgO, using CO/H 2 and CO 2 /H 2 as feedstocks. Under CO/H 2 both catalysts show chemisorbed methoxy as a stable intermediate, the Cu/MgO catalyst also shows <b>hydroxyls</b> on the support. Under CO 2 /H 2 the catalysts behave differently, in that formate is also {{seen on the}} catalyst. For the Cu/ZnO catalyst <b>hydroxyls</b> are present on the metal whereas for the Cu/MgO <b>hydroxyls</b> are found on the support.

30|$|In this work, {{the work}} {{function}} (WF) of graphenes, {{which are used}} as electronic devices, has been designed and evaluated by using the first-principle approach. Different states of graphene were considered, such as surface modification, doping, and defects. Firstly, WF strongly depends on the width of pristine graphene. A bigger width leads to a smaller WF. In addition, the effects of <b>hydroxyls,</b> defects, and positions of <b>hydroxyls</b> and defects are of concern. The WF of the graphene which is modified with <b>hydroxyls</b> is bigger {{than that of the}} pristine graphene. Moreover, the WF value increases with the number of <b>hydroxyls.</b> Positions of the <b>hydroxyls</b> and defects that deviated from the center have limited influence on the WF, whereas the effect of the position in the center is substantial. Lastly, B, N, Al, Si, and P are chosen as the doping elements. The n-type graphene doped with N and P atoms results in a huge decline in the WF, whereas the p-type graphene doped with B and Al atoms causes a great increase in the WF. However, the doping of Al in graphene is difficult, whereas the doping of B and N is easier. These discoveries will provide heavy support for the production of graphene-based devices.|$|R
40|$|Using {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy {{and infrared}} reflection absorption spectroscopy, we studied adsorption of water on a single-layer silicatene grown on Ru(0001). Surface hydroxylation occurs exclusively on defect sites, resulting in isolated silanols (Si–OH). By modifying the defect structure of the overlayer, we have provided a means of tuning spatial distribution of surface <b>hydroxyls</b> to fabricate periodic arrays of silanols on a metal-supported single-layer silicatene. We have visualized the surface <b>hydroxyls</b> directly with atomic resolution to determine their preferential adsorption sites, which involve Si at the junction nodes of three nonequivalent silica polygons. Our results open up the possibility of patterning surface <b>hydroxyls</b> via the engineering of nanometer scale defect sites, which may then serve as potential templates for supported active species on oxide surfaces...|$|R
5|$|The LIRGs that host <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers may be {{distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E
5|$|The first {{detection}} of the Zeeman effect in another galaxy was made through observations of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers. The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line {{due to the}} presence of a magnetic field, {{and the size of the}} splitting is linearly proportional to the line-of-sight magnetic field strength. Zeeman splitting has been detected in five <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers, and the typical strength of a detected field is of order a few milligauss, similar to the field strengths measured in galactic <b>hydroxyl</b> masers.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{were the}} first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies, {{and there are a}} small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities. Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in <b>hydroxyl</b> megamasers are distinct from that of <b>hydroxyl</b> masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of <b>hydroxyl</b> lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in <b>hydroxyl</b> molecules is produced by far infrared radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of <b>hydroxyl</b> megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way.|$|E
40|$|Bridging <b>hydroxyls</b> (Si–OH–Al) in zeolites are catalytically {{active for}} a {{multitude}} of important reactions, including the catalytic cracking of crude oil, oligomerization of olefins, conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons, and the selective catalytic reduction of NO x. The interaction of probe molecules with bridging <b>hydroxyls</b> was studied here on a novel two-dimensional zeolite model system consisting of an aluminosilicate forming a planar sheet of polygonal prisms, supported on a Ru(0001) surface. These bridging <b>hydroxyls</b> are strong Brönsted acid sites and can interact with both weak and strong bases. This interaction is studied here for two weak bases (CO and C 2 H 4) and two strong bases (NH 3 and pyridine), by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, in comparison with density functional theory calculations. Additionally, ethene is the reactant in the simplest case of the olefin oligomerization reaction which is also catalyzed by bridging <b>hydroxyls,</b> making the study of this adsorbed precursor state particularly relevant. It is found that weak bases interact weakly with the proton without breaking the O–H bond, although they do strongly affect the O–H stretching vibration. On the other hand, the strong bases, NH 3 and pyridine, abstract the proton to produce ammonium and pyridinium ions. The comparison with the properties of three-dimensional zeolites shows that this two-dimensional zeolite model system counts with bridging <b>hydroxyls</b> with properties {{similar to those of}} the most catalytically active zeolites, and it provides critical tools to achieve a deeper understanding of structure–reactivity relations in zeolites...|$|R

40|$|The unique {{feature of}} the zeolite {{catalysts}} {{is the presence of}} catalytically active acidic <b>hydroxyls,</b> also known as Brønsted acid sites (BAS), in the zeolite micropores of molecular dimensions. The accessibility and catalytic properties of BAS depend on their local environment, and it is therefore important to know the exact locations of BAS and the number of BAS in these locations. This paper reports a detailed FT-IR investigation into BAS present in the acidic and partially Na-exchanged samples of industrially important mordenite (MOR) zeolite. Our results demonstrate the existence of (at least) six distinct BAS that can be visualized by six single bands in Fourier self-deconvolution traces of the IR spectra. The quantitative estimates for the amounts of these distinct BAS were obtained using the six-band deconvolution method developed in this work. These estimates show that in the purely acidic H-MOR sample about 25 % of BAS are located in eight-membered ring (8 -MR) channels (O 1 -H and O 9 -H <b>hydroxyls),</b> ∼ 13 % of BAS are at the intersections between the side pockets and 12 -MR channels (O 5 -H <b>hydroxyls),</b> and ∼ 62 % of BAS are located in 12 -MR channels (∼ 39 % correspond to O 2 -H and/or O 10 -H <b>hydroxyls</b> and the remaining 23 % to O 3 -H and O 7 -H <b>hydroxyls).</b> These quantitative data demonstrate that the acid sites are distributed quite evenly between oxygen atoms in different crystallographic positions, thus revealing the complexity of the experimental identification of distinct BAS in mordenites and explaining the variety of the earlier suggestions regarding their positions in these zeolites...|$|R

This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the <b>hydroxyl</b> (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary <b>hydroxyl</b> of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
