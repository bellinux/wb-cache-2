However this was rebuffed when Britain and France co-operated to prevent this during the years 1871 – 1878 ending in Britain supporting French influence in Tunisia in exchange for dominion over Cyprus. France still had the issue of Italian influence (related to the huge colony of Tunisian Italians emigrated to Tunisia) and thus decided to find an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pre-emptive strike. Using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into Algeria, France invaded with an army of about 36,000 which quickly advanced to Tunis and forced the Bey to make terms {{in the form of}} the 1881 Treaty of Bardo (Al Qasr as Sa'id), which gave France control of Tunisian governance and making it a de facto French protectorate.|$|E

25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E

Surely the authors do not expect the sort of posturing they engage in to get them a sympathetic hearing in scientific circles -- so what does all this amount to? An <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> all-out culture war, since obviously mainstream science is so corrupt it will not change its evil Darwinian ways unless forced to repent by outsiders?"

500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} {{their debut}} release, the Drill EP, with Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge at Courtyard Studios. Released in May 1992, its chart performance was poor. The band enlisted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, {{who had worked}} with US indie bands Pixies and Dinosaur Jr., to produce their debut album, recorded quickly in an Oxford studio in 1992. With the release of the [...] "Creep" [...] single later that year, Radiohead began to receive attention in the British music press, not all of it favourable; NME described them as [...] "a lily-livered <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rock band", and [...] "Creep" [...] was blacklisted by BBC Radio 1 because it was deemed [...] "too depressing".|$|E
500|$|Malone {{notes that}} when the United States entered World War II in 1942, many of the quality actors became {{involved}} in the war effort and O'Hara struggled to find good co-stars. He points out that she increasingly starred in adventure pictures, which allowed her to develop her acting and keep her profile high in Hollywood. O'Hara had next intended appearing opposite Tyrone Power in , but was hospitalized in early 1942, during which she had her appendix and two ovarian cysts removed at Reno Hospital. Producer Zanuck scoffed at the operation, thinking it was an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> break. He passed it off as [...] "probably a fragment left over from an abortion", which deeply offended her, being a devout Catholic.|$|E
500|$|Venus looks outward at {{the viewer}} of the {{painting}} through her reflected image in the mirror. However, the image is blurred and reveals only a vague reflection of her facial characteristics; the reflected image of the head is much larger {{than it would be}} in reality. The critic Natasha Wallace has speculated that Venus's indistinct face may be the key to the underlying meaning {{of the painting}}, in that [...] "it is not intended as a specific female nude, nor even as a portrayal of Venus, but as an image of self-absorbed beauty." [...] According to Wallace, [...] "There is nothing spiritual about face or picture. The classical setting is an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very material aesthetic sexuality—not sex, as such, but an appreciation of the beauty that accompanies attraction." ...|$|E

500|$|By 2007, Harry and the Potters {{and their}} {{unexpected}} fan based indie music genre of wizard rock have grown {{into an international}} phenomenon. Recently, the band has engaged in charity side-projects and activism within the Harry Potter community. In January 2007, Harry and the Potters created the Wizard Rock EP of the Month Club, a mail order subscription club that released an extended play by a different wizard rock band each month. Reflecting wizard rock's literacy focus, the club raises funds for First Book, a non-profit organization that gives children {{the ability to read}} and own their first new books. In 2007, the Club raised over $13,000 for the organization. They released their first extended play The Enchanted Ceiling in 2007. May 2007 was also the beginning of their large 70-show summer-library tour across the US and Canada called simply [...] "Summer Tour 2007". Like their initial year in 2003, the summer of 2007 would see the release of another Harry Potter book. Harry and the Potters scheduled the mid-point of the tour to arrive back in their home state and celebrate the July 21 midnight release of the seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows at Harvard Yard. The festivities became an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> meet-up of a number of wizard rock bands including The Hungarian Horntails and their nemesis Draco and the Malfoys which all played to a large crowd of Harry Potter fans in the Cambridge, Massachusetts college venue. Harry and the Potters resumed their tour which finally wound-up in late August. In Vancouver on July 7, 2007, hundreds of people crowded outside the Vancouver Public Library to see Harry and the Potters. ABC News reported that the band usually charge $5 to $10 for tickets to their shows, though some performances are free. Harry and the Potters said 600 people turned out for a recent show, July 10, 2007, in Portland, Oregon.|$|E

Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave a 3/5 rating.

As a writer of a linear story, [...] "all they do is to write the script," [...] he said. [...] "In game design, the writer should think about the gameplay and background story first before developing any of the characters. However, the constraints of an interactive medium is no <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> poorly constructed story, the big {{thing is that we}} have a different medium. We have to accept that we have not only huge advantages in the interactive medium but also big constraints. And these constraints often lead to some really shitty stories.

2500|$|The [...] "missing act" [...] {{is located}} in the {{timeline}} between the Café Momus scene and act 3 and describes an open-air party at Musetta's dwelling.

The four Bohemians find in this an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> party and arrange for wine and an orchestra. Musetta gives Mimì a beautiful gown to wear and introduces her to a Viscount. The pair dances a quadrille in the courtyard, which moves Rodolfo to jealousy. This explains his act 3 reference to the [...] "moscardino di Viscontino" [...] (young fop of a Viscount).

2500|$|When {{driving the}} Caparo, Clarkson had stated that limited {{aerodynamic}} downforce is created at slow speeds, {{saying that it}} would be an excellent <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> policeman since [...] " [...] has to take that corner at a thousand mph because if [...] takes it at thirty, [...] crash." [...] The car had low levels of lateral traction while cornering if it was not being driven rapidly. Aerodynamically, this vehicle is designed such that air passing over the body at high speed [...] "pushes" [...] the vehicle against the road (allowing for higher cornering speeds). He criticized the handling characteristics, finding that the vehicle was difficult to control around corners at low speeds, and that on a wet or cold day (these factors negatively affect grip) there were problems even at higher speeds.|$|E

2500|$|Afw ( [...] {{is another}} term for {{forgiveness}} in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, {{and in some}} Islamic theological studies, it is used interchangeably with ghufran. Afw means to pardon, to <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah, forgiveness ('Afw) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. First {{and the most important}} wisdom of forgiveness is that it is merciful when the victim or guardian of the victim accepts money instead of revenge. The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases honor and prestige of the one who forgives. Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness, humiliation or dishonor. Forgiveness is honor, raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and enables a forgiver to enter paradise. The third wisdom of forgiveness is that according to some scholars, such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates (kaffarah) the forgiver from the sins he or she may have committed at other occasions in life. Forgiveness is a form of charity (sadaqat). Forgiveness comes from taqwa (piety), a quality of God-fearing people.|$|E
2500|$|In a post-modern {{thesis on}} the superhero genre Michael Lecker wrote, [...] "In the superhero genre, clothes {{do the talking}} through semiotics, which [...] Barthes {{discusses}} in depth in his work: The 'first, literal message serves as a support for a second meaning, of a generally affective or ideological order' (Roland Barthes). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody." [...] In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, [...] "Cinematic SM is twisted into the non-consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that {{we know it is}} not. Fetishism is used as an <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain – the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalk)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the defense}} and the {{prosecution}} were allowed to submit proposed jury instructions to Judge Hall, which he could choose to either accept or reject. Celia's defense team submitted several instructions to Judge Hall requesting that the jury acquit Celia if they believed {{that she had been}} justifiably resisting sexual assault when she had killed Robert Newsom. In the state of Missouri, at the time of Celia's trial, it was a crime [...] "to take any woman unlawfully against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be defiled," [...] and resistance of such an offense would have been considered a justifiable <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> woman to kill a man. The defense requested that the jury be instructed that the words [...] "any woman" [...] included enslaved women, and that Celia should not be convicted if they believed that she had been attempting to resist rape when she had killed Newsom. Judge Hall did not accept these proposed instructions, and they were not delivered to the jury. The instructions that were actually given to the jury did not address the motive for Celia's crime at all, or allow for an acquittal {{based on the idea that}} she would have been justified in using physical force to resist sexual assault at the hands of her master.|$|E
