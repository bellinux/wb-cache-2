[...] In Europe and the UK, the group's material was licensed to several different record companies, who issued collections of seemingly random tracks, often with attractive packaging and Clapton's or Beck's names and images prominently displayed.

500|$|Users of Steam's {{storefront}} {{can also}} purchase games and other software as gifts {{to be given}} to another Steam user. Prior to May 2017, users could purchase these gifts to be held in their profile's inventory until they opted to gift them. However, this feature enabled a <b>gray</b> <b>market</b> around some games, where a user {{in a country where the}} price of a game was substantially lower than elsewhere could stockpile giftable copies of games to sell to others, particularly in regions with much higher prices. In August 2016, Valve changed its gifting policy to require that games with VAC and Game Ban-enabled games to be gifted immediately to another Steam user, which also served to combat players that worked around VAC and Game Bans, while in May 2017, Valve expanded this policy to all games. The changes also placed limitations on gifts between users of different countries if there is a large difference in pricing for the game between two different regions.|$|E
50|$|Application of this {{provision}} created difficult legal {{issues in the}} context of <b>gray</b> <b>market</b> products. <b>Gray</b> <b>market</b> dealers buy the genuine goods in foreign countries at a significant discount from U.S. prices. They then import these genuine goods into the U.S. and sell them at discount prices, undercutting the authorized U.S. dealers. The <b>gray</b> <b>market</b> exists where the price for goods outside the US is lower than the price inside.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>markets,</b> {{also known}} as {{parallel}} imports, are marketplaces for trading genuine products that are diverted from authorized distribution channels. They have created fierce competition for manufacturers in many industries and each year billions {{of dollars worth of}} products are traded in these markets. Using a game-theoretic model, we analyze the impact of parallel importation on a price-setting manufacturer that serves two markets with uncertain demand. We characterize the optimal joint price and quantity decisions of the manufacturer which determine whether the manufacturer should ignore, block, or allow parallel importation. We also show that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to reduce her price gap while demand uncertainty forces her to lower prices in both markets. Moreover, we observe that parallel importation may force the manufacturer to exit the low-profit market. Through extensive numerical experiments, we explore the impact of market conditions (size and price elasticity) and product characteristics (a fashion item or a commodity) on the manufacturer's reaction to parallel importation. In addition, we provide interesting insights about the value of strategic pricing for coping with <b>gray</b> <b>markets</b> versus the uniform pricing policy that has been adopted by some companies to eliminate <b>gray</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Typically {{the parties}} opposed to <b>gray</b> <b>markets</b> are the {{retailers}} of the {{item in the}} market as it damages its profits and reputation. As a result, they usually pressure the original manufacturer to adjust the official channels of distribution. The state also {{plays an important role}} enforcing penalties in the case of law infringement. However, the zero-day exploit market is atypical and the way it operates is closer to the workings of the black market. Brokers and bounty programs, which could be seen as retailers of zero-days, have no control whatsoever on the original producers of the [...] "bad" [...] as they are independently discovered by different, and often anonymous, actors. It is not in their interest to change the channel of distribution as they can profit from both the white and <b>gray</b> <b>markets,</b> having much less risk in the former.|$|R

50|$|The {{increased}} demand for ammunition not only contributed to inflated prices but also created an opportunity for <b>gray</b> <b>market</b> vendors to arise.

50|$|Because of the {{unavailability}} in America {{of certain}} vehicle models, a <b>gray</b> <b>market</b> {{arose in the}} late 1970s. This provided an alternate, legal method to acquire vehicles only sold overseas. The success of the <b>gray</b> <b>market,</b> however, ate {{into the business of}} Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., which launched a successful congressional lobbying effort to eliminate this alternative for consumers in 1988, despite the lack of any evidence suggesting grey-market vehicles were less safe than those built to comply with U.S. regulations. As a result, it is no longer possible to import foreign vehicles into the United States as a personal import, with few exceptionsâ€”primarily Canadian cars with safety regulations substantially similar to the United States, and vehicles imported temporarily for display or research purposes. In practice the <b>gray</b> <b>market</b> involved a few thousand luxury cars annually, before its virtual elimination in 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Zero-days, on {{the other}} hand, are virtual {{products}} and can be easily sold without intermediaries over the internet as available technologies {{are strong enough to}} provide anonymity at a very low cost. Even if {{there is a need for}} intermediaries, [...] "unwitting data mules" [...] can be used to avoid any evidence of wrongdoing. This is why the black market is so lucrative compared to <b>gray</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Gray</b> <b>markets,</b> which involve transactions with public institutions in charge of national security, usually require the use of third parties to hide the traces of their transactions. The Hacking Team archive, for example, contains alleged contracts with the Ecuadorian National Secretariat of Intelligence where they used two intermediaries: Robotec and Theola. In the same archive, it is said that third-party companies Cicom and Robotec negotiated the contracts on behalf of the FBI and DEA respectively. It is less likely that white markets face the same problem as it is not in their interest to hide the transaction, it is quite the opposite because companies actively promote the use of their new patches.|$|R
