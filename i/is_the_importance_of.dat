5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized {{the level}} of detail {{that has become a}} staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E

25|$|According to {{cognitive}} linguist George Lakoff, liberal philosophy {{is based on}} five basic categories of morality. The first, the promotion of fairness, is generally described as an emphasis on empathy as a desirable trait. With this social contract based on the Golden Rule comes the rationale for many liberal positions. The second category is assistance to those who cannot assist themselves. A nurturing, philanthropic spirit {{is one that is}} considered good in liberal philosophy. This leads to the third category, the desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. The fourth category <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> fulfilling one's life; allowing a person to experience all that they can. The fifth and final category <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> caring for oneself, since only thus can one act to help others.|$|E

25|$|Another {{consideration}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> leadership {{being able}} to communicate with the invasion force. In ancient times, this often meant that a king needed to lead his armies in person to be certain his commands were timely and followed, {{as in the case of}} Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE). At that time, the skills needed to lead troops in battle were as important as the skills needed to run a country during peacetime. When it was necessary for the king to be elsewhere, messengers would relay updates back to the rear, often on horseback or, in cases such as the Battle of Marathon (490 BCE), with swift runners.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{doctrine}} {{laid out}} in 3 John, which is strictly a personal letter, but the overall theme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> hospitality, {{especially when it comes}} to men who were working to spread the gospel. [...] Third John is the shortest book of the Bible by word count, though 2 John has fewer verses. It is the only New Testament book which does not contain the names [...] "Jesus" [...] or [...] "Christ".|$|E
500|$|A 2003 {{interview}} in Newsweek quotes Stephenson's belief that [...] "science fiction... is fiction in which ideas {{play an important}} part." [...] Central to Quicksilver [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the Enlightenment. By placing the reader among a world of ideas that {{change the course of}} science, Stephenson explores the development of the scientific method. One theme Stephenson explores in Quicksilver is the advancement of mathematical sciences which in turn led to important applications: Leibniz's theory of binary mathematics became the foundation upon which to develop computers. [...] As he did in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson highlights the importance of networks and codes, which in Quicksilver [...] occur against a [...] "backdrop of staggering diversity and detail", writes Mark Sanderson in his review of the book for the Daily Telegraph. Also, returning to his cyberpunk roots, Stephenson emphasizes the manner in which information and ideas are dispersed in complex societies. Quicksilver uses the [...] "interactions of philosophy, court intrigue, economics, wars, plagues and natural disasters" [...] of the late 17th and early 18th century to create a historical backdrop. From one perspective, the characters are most useful in their roles as [...] "carriers of information". Although the characters use various techniques to disseminate information, the most prominent is cryptography. Elizabeth Weisse writes in USA Today that the use of cryptography is [...] "Stephenson's literary calling card", as she compares Quicksilver to [...] Cryptonomicon.|$|E

2500|$|Another [...] of {{the story}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> {{situational}} awareness. Christian media consultant Phil Cooke tells the story, conceding that it's fictional, and uses it to demonstrate {{the importance of the}} research he reads, and knowing one's audience in particular. [...] "We're blind unless we know who we're talking to." [...] "hile it is s ship, it's most definitely not his ocean" [...] writes Russ Linden, a columnist at Governing, of the lesson offered.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{language}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> using poetry in conversations. Modifying or rephrasing a classic poem according to the current situation was expected behavior in Heian court life, and often served to communicate thinly veiled allusions. The poems in the Genji are often in the classic Japanese tanka form. Many of the poems were well known to the intended audience, so usually only the first few lines are given and the reader is supposed to complete the thought themselves, much like today we could say [...] "when in Rome..." [...] and leave {{the rest of the}} saying ("...do as the Romans do") unspoken.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to categorise Hume's political affiliations. His writings contain elements that are, in modern terms, both conservative and liberal, although these terms are anachronistic. Thomas Jefferson banned the History from University of Virginia, feeling that it had [...] "spread universal toryism over the land". By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume [...] "a Tory by chance... for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist", a follower of Thomas Hobbes. A major concern of Hume's political philosophy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics: public spirit and regard to the community.|$|E

2500|$|North America: About 50% of {{the global}} {{convertible}} market, mostly from the USA (even if Canada is well represented in the Material sector). This market is more standardised than the others with convertible structures being relatively uniform (e.g. Standard Make-Whole take over features, Contingent Conversion @ 130%). Regarding the trading, the American convertible market is [...] "centralised" [...] around TRACE which helps in terms of price transparency. One other particularity of this market <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the Mandatory Convertibles and Preferred especially for Financials (about 10-20% of the issuances in the US regional benchmarks). Most of the trading operation are based in New-York.|$|E
2500|$|One of Kierkegaard's {{recurrent}} themes <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> subjectivity, {{which has}} to do with the way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, he argues that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Sahgal {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying she felt that Amnesty was risking its reputation by associating with and thereby politically legitimising Begg, because Cageprisoners [...] "actively promotes Islamic Right ideas and individuals". She said the issue was not about Begg's [...] "freedom of opinion, nor about his right to propound his views: he already exercises these rights fully as he should. The issue <b>is</b> ... <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the human rights movement maintaining an objective distance from groups and ideas that are committed to systematic discrimination and fundamentally undermine the universality of human rights." [...] The controversy prompted responses by politicians, the writer Salman Rushdie, and journalist Christopher Hitchens, among others who criticised Amnesty's association with Begg.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{participants}} of the Gaza flotilla, Sinan Albayrak, told the Turkish newspaper Akşam {{in response to}} the Israeli apology, [...] "hat <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the apology? 'We killed nine people and are sorry' – of course it sounds ridiculous. I say this is what the state should have done. If [...] only had prevented this at the start. But we asked for it. We went there ourselves." [...] According to Hürriyet Daily News Semih Idiz, some Turkish citizens are even suggesting that those involved with the Mavi Marmara incident should also bring charges against the Turkish state for playing a prominent role in supporting the Mavi Marmara's mission and for failing to prevent the death of nine Turks on the ship.|$|E
2500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in much of}} Austen's work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> {{environment}} and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality. Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment; Darcy, on the other hand, has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable, {{but he is also}} proud and overbearing. Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society. [...] American novelist Anna Quindlen observed, in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995: ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the traits}} {{particularly}} associated with Hasidism in common understanding {{which are in}} fact widespread, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> joy and happiness at worship and religious life – though the sect undoubtedly stressed this aspect and still possesses a clear populist bent. Another example is the value placed on the simple, ordinary Jew in supposed contradiction with the favouring of elitist scholars beforehand; such ideas are common in ethical works far preceding Hasidism. The movement did for a few decades challenge the rabbinic establishment, which relied on the authority of Torah acumen, but affirmed the centrality of study very soon. Concurrently, the image of its Opponents as dreary intellectuals who lacked spiritual fervour and opposed mysticism is likewise unfounded. Neither did Hasidism, often portrayed as promoting healthy sensuality, unanimously reject the asceticism and self-mortification associated primarily with its rivals. Joseph Dan ascribed all these perceptions to so-called [...] "Neo-Hasidic" [...] writers and thinkers, like Martin Buber. In their attempt to build new models of spirituality for modern Jews, they propagated a romantic, sentimental image of the movement. The [...] "Neo-Hasidic" [...] interpretation influenced even scholarly discourse to a great degree, but had a tenuous connection with reality.|$|E
