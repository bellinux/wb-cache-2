In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
500|$|Two musical {{themes in}} Wicked run {{throughout}} the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works, the first– Elphaba's theme– came from The Survival of St. Joan, {{on which he}} worked as musical director. [...] "I always liked this tune a lot and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> {{figure out what to}} do with it," [...] he remarked in an interview in 2004. The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's brass section, with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, [...] "like a giant shadow terrorizing you". When played by the piano with some electric bass in [...] "As Long As You're Mine", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered bridge, the theme forms the core of the song [...] "No One Mourns the Wicked" [...] and its reprises.|$|E
500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country – I certainly am glad that I came to France, because <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E

A few days later, Peter revealed {{that he was being}} bullied and threatened to change the narrative of this awareness message; [...] "Change the message or just drop it entirely. It has reached a point where my own mental health, my sobriety and the safety of my family are at risk. And this bullying is coming from a place <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> have imagined", he shared before telling that he would remove himself from social media and asking his followers to keep the conversation and break through this stigma.|$|E
2500|$|While at Harrow, Byron became {{close to}} John FitzGibbon, second Earl of Clare, and with George John, fifth Earl De la Warr, and Byron {{retained}} memories of both. Clare {{in particular was}} Byron's favourite, and, after one meeting {{in which they could}} spend only five minutes together, Byron afterwards could [...] "hardly recollect an hour of my existence which could be weighted against them". Byron had other friends at Harrow, including John Wingfield, Edward Noel Long, (grandson of Edward Long) and George, Duke of Dorset, all of who appear in Byron's Childish Recollections. [...] Only Long would continue to Cambridge with Byron. These friendships meant a lot to Byron, and when his friends started dying he claimed that [...] "some curse hangs over me. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> keep alive even a dog that I liked, or that liked me". Not all of Byron's relationships encouraged him to stay at the school. Byron's early loves included Mary Duff and Margaret Parker, his distant cousins, and Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at Harrow. Byron refused to return to Harrow in September 1803 due to his love for Chaworth. In Byron's later memoirs, according to Byron's biographer Fiona MacCarthy, [...] "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings". He returned to Harrow in January 1804. By Easter of that year he had begun to correspond with his half-sister, Augusta. His early letters to her illustrate his earnest desire to establish an affectionate friendship with 'a Friend to whom I can confide.' ...|$|E
