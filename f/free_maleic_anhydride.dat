50|$|Diels-Alder {{reaction}} of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and butadiene and isoprene gives the respective tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides {{which can be}} hydrogenated to the corresponding hexahydrophthalic anhydrides. These species are used a curing agents in epoxy resins. Another market for <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> is lubricating oil additives, which are used in gasoline and diesel engine crankcase oils as dispersants and corrosion inhibitors. Changes in lubricant specifications and more efficient engines have had {{a negative effect on}} the demand for lubricating oil additives, giving flat growth prospects for <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> in this application. A number of smaller applications for <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> The food industry uses <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> in artificial sweeteners and flavour enhancements.

30|$|The vapor-phase {{oxidation}} of benzene {{to produce}} <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> using air as oxidant, {{is one of}} the first successful catalytic oxidations of aromatic hydrocarbons. Commercial production of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> from benzene started around 1933. Currently, the industrial process for benzene to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> autoxidation is only of historical and educational interest [12]. The selective vapor-phase oxidation of n-butane over vanadium phosphorous oxide (VPO) catalysts has been the dominant chemical route to produce <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> since the mid- 1970 s [13].

The result indicated that rHDPE/WFM composites with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> exhibit higher tensile strength and modulus of elasticity than rHDPE/WF composites. rHDPE/WFM with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> composites gave a better interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fiber than rHDPE/WF composites as evidence using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ...|$|R

Fourier Transformed Infra Red spectra confirmed that the grafted product accured by appearance of characteristic band at 1720 cm- 1. The higher concentration of <b>Maleic</b> <b>Anhydride</b> reacted the higher of grafting degree of <b>Maleic</b> <b>Anhydride</b> by means of carbonyl index.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{shift of the}} protons of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> was studied {{as a function of}} structure in aromatic solvents, of solvent composition in mixed solvents, of concentration, and of temperature. The large changes in {{chemical shift}}s which were observed are attributed to stereospecific association of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> with solvent molecules of charge transfer type.

40|$|The {{homopolymerization}} of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> was attempted at 190 degrees C, {{during the}} melt-functionalization of polypropylene, either {{with or without}} organic peroxide using a Brabender plastograph.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of n-butane to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> {{was investigated}} over {{a series of}} model-supported vanadia catalysts where the vanadia phase was present as a two-dimensional metal oxide overlayer on the different oxide supports (TiO 2, ZrO 2, CeO 2, Nb 2 O 5, Al 2 O 3, and SiO 2). No correlation {{was found between the}} properties of the terminal V==O bond and the butane oxidation turnover frequency (TOF) during in situ Raman spectroscopy study. Furthermore, neither the n-butane oxidation TOF nor <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity was related to the extent of reduction of the surface vanadia species. The n-butane oxidation TOF was essentially independent of the surface vanadia coverage, suggesting that the n-butane activation requires only one surface vanadia site. The <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> TOF, however, increased by a factor of 2 – 3 as the surface vanadia coverage was increased to monolayer coverage. The higher <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> TOF at near monolayer coverages suggests that a pair of adjacent vanadia sites may efficiently oxidize n-butane to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride,</b> but other factors may also play a contributing role (increase in surface Brønsted acidity and {{decrease in the number of}} exposed support cation sites). Varying the specific oxide support changed the n-butane oxidation TOF by ca. 50 (Ti>Ce>Zr Nb>Al>Si) as well as the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity. The <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity closely followed the Lewis acid strength of the oxide support cations, Al> Nb> Ti> Si> Zr> Ce. The addition of acidic surface metal oxides (W, Nb, and P) to the surface vanadia layer was found to have a beneficial effect on the n-butane oxidation TOF and the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity. The creation of bridging V–O–P bonds had an especially positive effect on the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> selectivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of benzyltrimethylsilane to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> mediated by TiO 2 photocatalysis was initially investigated. The affect {{of changing the}} catalyst, the radical trap loading and the substitution of the benzyltrimethylsilane molecule was assessed. Cyclisation precursors based on benzyltrimethylsilane were prepared, but were found not to cyclise via TiO 2 photocatalysis. A number of other systems were assessed {{for their ability to}} cyclise under TiO 2 photocatalysis; tertiary amines, aminomethyltrimethylsilanes, phenoxymethyltrimethylsilanes and phenoxyacetic acids. Phenoxymethyltrimethylsilane and phenoxyacetic acid were found to add effectively to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> under TiO 2 photocatalysis conditions, however they were unreactive with regards to cyclisation. EPR spectroscopy has been employed to characterise further the reaction of benzylsilanes with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> under TiO 2 photocatalytic conditions. A number of EPR active species were observed; trapped holes and electrons, which reside within the TiO 2 catalyst. In addition, methyl and benzyl radicals were observed and were found to originate from the oxidation of the benzylsilanes by trapped holes in the TiO 2 catalyst. However, no radical species were observed from the <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride.</b> These observations had the following consequences for the currently proposed reaction mechanism for the {{addition of}} benzyltrimethylsilane with <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> under TiO 2 photocatalysis.  The observation of the benzyl radical definitely proved that the reactive intermediate was indeed the proposed benzyl radical  The absence of any <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> EPR active species cast doubt on the role of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> as an electron trap. Moreover when <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> is removed from the reaction system, interstitial Ti 3 + species is absent from the EPR spectra, indicating that <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> is in fact acting as a hole trap.

In addition, unsaturated polyester had been modified using <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and reinforced with chicken feather fiber. The dielectric properties of the unsaturated polyester reinforced chicken feather fiber have been studied with reference to <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> modification and various fiber loading. The structures of unsaturated polyester and <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> modified unsaturated polyester have been investigated. SEM indicated an improved interfacial bonding between polymer and fiber through <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> modification.

The functionalization mechanism, the nature, the concentration, {{and the location of}} grafted anhydride species onto the polypropylene chain are discussed. The polypropylene functionalization was performed using a pre-heated Brabender Plastograph (190 degrees C, 4 min of mixing time). Several concentrations of <b>maleic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and organic peroxide were used for this study.
