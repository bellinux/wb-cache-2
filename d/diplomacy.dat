5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American <b>diplomacy,</b> {{especially}} military <b>diplomacy,</b> knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon.

A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in <b>diplomacy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and <b>diplomacy.</b> Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while <b>diplomacy</b> lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E

This book {{addresses}} the EU???s {{potential to become}} a more joined-up global actor in its external engagement. It uses a single and innovative analytical framework to examine three clusters of policies: EU internal sectoral and cross-cutting policies with long-standing external engagement, those which have been undergoing considerable change, and originally internal policies whose external dimensions are comparatively more recent. It identifies key explanatory factors {{for the emergence of}} (certain forms of) EU external engagement and identifies patterns of the evolving relations between EU internal and external sectoral policies. As such, the book examines and assesses exciting new empirical and theoretical research avenues into European integration studies and offers insights into {{the extent to which the}} EU may be considered a more joined-up global actor developing sectoral <b>diplomacies...</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine <b>diplomacy</b> soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded <b>diplomacy</b> {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
