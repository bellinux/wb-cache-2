If they act completely in accordance with the instructions, the duty of care is fulfilled even though the house may not be properly constructed. However, if the claimant instructs the builder to construct a poorly designed and unstable building, the builder has a duty to warn the claimant.

The former telegraph and post office buildings were quite dilapidated by this time, and would have required major repairs to make them <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation.</b> As the town had extended in a south west direction, Albion Street was no longer as central, and attention turned to the allotment in Fitzroy Street adjoining the court house and timber lockup, as the site for a new police station.|$|E

When she regains consciousness, the man apologizes and {{explains}} he is a building contractor and is to demolish the building within one hour. In an argument which unintentionally doubles as an allegorical defense for death, he tries to persuade her that his work is both necessary and good, since the building is no longer <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation</b> and demolishing it clears the way for new buildings. He indicates that she has been given due notice, and if she will not leave he will call the police to force her from the premises.

5000|$|Clean up {{processes}} were {{regulated by}} the EPA as of 2007. The Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007 required EPA to develop guidelines for remediation of former methamphetamine labs.

[...] The legislation also required that EPA periodically update the guidelines, as appropriate, to reflect the best available knowledge and research. Making a former meth lab site safer for habitation requires two basic efforts: Gross chemical removal: This is the process in which law enforcement or a Drug Enforcement Administration contractors removes the obvious dangers from the site. Obvious dangers include containers of chemicals, equipment, and apparatus {{that could be used to}} make illegal drugs, drug paraphernalia, and other illegal items. This process does not cleanup or remove chemical spills, stains or residue that could be harmful to inhabitants. A property that has had only a gross chemical removal is not <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation.</b> [...] Clandestine Remediation: The cleaning of interior structures and, if applicable, the surrounding land, surface waters and groundwater by an EPA approved or National Crime Scene Clean Up Association certified company. This is the process of removing the residue and waste from the site after the gross chemical removal is done. A property that has been re-mediated should present minimal to no health risk to occupants.|$|E

5000|$|The chief {{cause of}} Korah's revolt was, {{according}} to the Rabbis, the nomination of Elizaphan, son of Uzziel, as prince over the Kohathites (Num. iii. 30), Korah arguing thus: [...] "Kohath had four sons vi. 18. The two sons of Amram, Kohath's eldest son, took for themselves the kingdom and the priesthood. Now, as I am the son of Kohath's second son, I ought to be made prince over the Kohathites, whereas Moses gave that office to Elizaphan, the son of Kohath's youngest son" [...] (Num. R. xviii. 1; Tan., Ḳoraḥ, 3). Korah plied Moses with the following questions: [...] "Does a ṭallit made entirely of blue wool need fringes?" [...] To Moses' affirmative answer Korah objected: [...] "The blue color of the ṭallit {{does not make it}} ritually correct, yet according to thy statement four blue threads do so" [...] (Num. xv. 38). [...] "Does a house filled with the books of the Law need a mezuzah?" [...] Moses replied that it did; whereupon Korah said: [...] "The presence of the whole Torah, which contains 175 chapters, does not make a house <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>habitation,</b> yet thou sayest that one chapter thereof does so. It is not from God that thou hast received these commandments; thou hast invented them thyself." [...] He then assembled 250 men, chiefs of the Sanhedrin, and, having clad them in ṭallitot of blue wool, but without fringes, prepared for them a banquet. Aaron's sons came for the priestly share, but Korah and his people refused to give the prescribed portions to them, saying that it was not God but Moses who commanded those things. Moses, having been informed of these proceedings, went to the house of Korah to effect a reconciliation, but the latter and his 250 followers rose up against him (Num. R. xviii. 2; Tan. l.c.; comp. Targ. pseudo-Jonathan to Num. xvi. 2).|$|E

50|$|By 1910, the Square’s {{houses were}} semi-abandoned and {{considered}} not properly <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> human <b>habitation,</b> with a recommendation for demolition. In the 1920s, hardship led to many Cleland families leaving for other mining areas or emigrating to America and Canada. In 1930 a police census records {{a population of}} 4,274, made up of 2,240 males and 2,030 females, though this shows a reduction of 552 compared with the census taken in 1928. In 1930 the Wishaw and Coltness Railway was closed to freight between Newmains and Cleland Junction, and to passengers between Morningside and Holytown (Cleland Junction). What is now Cleland Station collapsed, due to a local mine running under it caving in. It required major repairs before re-opening.|$|R

Down in the gorge there was never-failing sweet water, grass all the year round, cool, shady retreats, deer, rabbits, turkeys, fruit, and miles and miles of narrow-twisting, deep canon full of broken rocks and impenetrable thickets. The scream of the panther was heard there, the squall of the wildcat, the cough of the jaguar. Innumerable bees buzzed in the spring blossoms, and, it seemed, {{scattered}} honey to the winds. All day there was continuous song of birds, that of the mocking-bird loud and sweet and mocking above the rest.|$|R
