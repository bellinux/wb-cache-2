500|$|Piliero had {{the concept}} nearly {{finished}} {{by the time}} he met with Spears. Both wanted to explore fun ways for Spears to be inappropriate in the video, who had several ideas, such as a cop frisking her. Having seen Spears on How I Met Your Mother and Saturday Night Live, Piliero felt that none of her videos had really taken advantage of her comedic timing, saying, [...] "She never had a music video where she could show her acting chops and have fun with comedy while being super badass. That was my goal from day one: <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as much fun as possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It just felt like the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

"The {{character}} of Blanche initially {{came from a}} woman I knew in North Carolina who had a look that inspired me to create a heroine in her memory...I knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be representative of who black women are, presently and historically. Both my grandmothers did domestic work..." [...] "A cleansing construction: Blanche White as domestic heroine in Barbara Neely's Blanche on the Lam.".|$|E

5000|$|The writers planned {{from the}} start that Tim Taylor's wife would have a strong voice. Patricia Richardson had {{initially}} been reluctant to accept the role, concerned that Jill would be yet another [...] "perfect" [...] TV sitcom mother such as Clair Huxtable of The Cosby Show. She was reassured after seeing some scripts and talking to the series' producers. Early in the show's run, Richardson said, [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> for this character is for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be imperfect. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make mistakes. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be the wrong one in the relationship. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> blow it with Tim, and be the one who has to be punished. Because that's what life is like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I {{had asked}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be my wife I had promised <b>to</b> be <b>her</b> brother. And so I will, {{if she should}} ever <b>want</b> a brother. <b>I</b> am not going <b>to</b> desert <b>her</b> because she will not do what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do, or be what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be. She understands that. There is to be no quarrel between us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Whedon always {{intended}} for the character to become an icon, claiming [...] "I {{wanted her to be}} a hero that existed in people's minds the way Wonder Woman or Spider-Man does, you know? <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be a doll or an action figure. I wanted Barbie with Kung Fu grip! <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> enter the mass consciousness and the imaginations of growing kids because I think she's a cool character, and that was always the plan. I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon, period." [...] In developing Buffy, Whedon was greatly inspired by Kitty Pryde, a character from the pages of the superhero comic X-Men. He admits, [...] "If there's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don't know what it was... She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it." [...] In a 2009 interview, Whedon revealed he only recently realised how much he saw of himself in Buffy. After years of relating more to Xander, he says, [...] "Buffy was always the person that I was in that story because I'm not in every way." [...] Whedon openly wonders why his identification figure is a woman, but describes it as [...] "a real autobiographical kind of therapy for me" [...] to be writing a strong female character like Buffy.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used to beat me, hit me until I was lying {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|After {{playing a}} piano riff and singing the melody for Jimmy Jam, they {{recorded}} a rough vocal track. Jam stated, [...] "She sang me the melody, {{and then asked}} [...] "well, {{what do you think}} it needs?" [...] I said, Nothing. Go write some lyrics, it's fine," [...] adding, [...] "She had a bunch of different melodies, so we picked the two melodies that worked best." [...] Jam and Lewis chose to forego its production, deciding another producer should execute the song: [...] "We stay away from things we can't do. It's not like, 'We've got to do this, and it's got to be our way.' We're going for the best way." [...] Jam contacted Jellybean Johnson to develop the song with Jackson and help her produce it. Johnson recalled, [...] "She first played the groove for me on piano... I thought it would be cool if I could make Janet sound like a heavy metal queen. I knew the rest of them thought I was out of my mind, but I got a friend to play the guitars. I put toms and cymbals on it. Terry played bass and some sparse keyboards, and it was there." [...] In addition to Johnson, guitarist Dave Barry was asked to contribute after previously providing guitar on [...] "You Can Be Mine" [...] from Jackson's prior album. Barry stated, [...] "I wanted it to be authentic rock and roll. I rocked it out, then Janet and I got together to do the vocals. Janet is a very nice, warm person, and she was receptive to my ideas." [...] Jackson sang the song in an alternate tone, quickly adjusting her vocals in a single take. Johnson described, [...] "One night I told her <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> sound like a rock and roll queen on it–she usually uses one of her other voices [...]. this, you wanted to be funky, but more rocked out. She did it in one or two takes." [...] Jam added, [...] "I tried to get her to sing a couple of the other vocals in her natural [...] with kind of an edge on it; she [...] didn't like the way her voice sounded, but for Black Cat, that was exactly what was needed." ...|$|E

She'll be starved and tortured and humiliated. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> accept the punishment of man as a sacrifice <b>to</b> God. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> accept it joyfully. She has an opportunity which is offered to very few of us. God is very good and very merciful." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it's the worst I can do," [...] Newman {{would say in}} answer to this. [...] "Kindly {{overlook}} the deficiency." [...] He assured her that he, at least, would never scold her; she was perfectly satisfactory. [...] "If you only knew," [...] he said, [...] "how exactly you are what I coveted! And I am beginning to understand why I coveted it; the having it {{makes all the difference}} that I expected. Never was a man so pleased with his good fortune. You have been holding your head for a week past just as <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> my wife to hold hers. You say just the things <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say. You walk about the room just as <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> walk. You have just the taste in dress that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> have. In short, you come up to the mark, and, I can tell you, my mark was high." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mrs. Lambert looked away. [...] "I {{tried to}} reason with her, Anthony. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> 'sit for council,' but she's so crazy to get away she will not do it. She will hardly speak to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So all I {{could do}} was {{to go back to}} the other room, and tell him that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go to sleep, and that he must not call out to her until I told him.|$|E
60|$|She laughed again. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go on talking, {{because her}} laugh was so delightful. But we {{had reached the}} road, {{and she said she}} must go back: there were so many things she had to do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> soften {{and help}} me. She seems to draw and smooth away the evil, {{and to keep}} me from myself. Nothing is so dreary where she is.' ...|$|R
