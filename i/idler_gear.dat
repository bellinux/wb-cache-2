For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not. For longer distances, a roller chain or belt is quieter and creates less friction, although gears are typically stronger, depending and the strength of the roller chain.

Maximum boost was 25psi (170 kPa gauge; or an absolute pressure of 270 kPa or 2.7atm). On the Hornet the Merlin 130 was fitted in the port nacelle: the Merlin 131, fitted in the starboard nacelle, was converted to a [...] "reverse" [...] or left-hand tractor engine using an additional <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> in the reduction gear casing.|$|E
50|$|An <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> is a {{gear wheel}} that is {{inserted}} between {{two or more}} other gear wheels. The purpose of an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> can be two-fold. Firstly, the <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> will change the direction of rotation of the output shaft. Secondly, an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> can assist {{to reduce the size}} of the input/output gears whilst maintaining the spacing of the shafts.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> {{contacts}} directly {{both the}} smaller {{and the larger}} gear, it can {{be removed from the}} calculation, also giving a ratio of 42/13≈3.23. The <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> serves to make both the drive gear and the driven gear rotate in the same direction, but confers no mechanical advantage.|$|E
25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a train of spur gears. Accessories are arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The gears are usually plain spur gears, running in roller bearings. <b>Idler</b> <b>gears</b> are commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. Helical gears are sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However helical gears also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated thrust bearing to support them.|$|R

50|$|The main {{difference}} between the Musketeer line and other similar light aircraft is the Musketeer’s landing gear. While the competitive Cessna 172s use spring-steel main gear, the Piper PA-28 Cherokees use oleos and the Grumman American AA-5s use fiberglass-sprung main gear, the Musketeer family use a trailing <b>idler</b> link <b>gear</b> system with a compressed rubber puck suspension system. This gives the aircraft quite different landing characteristics compared to the competition; light touchdowns are often accompanied by the idler links skipping and producing a less-graceful than anticipated landing. With practice, smooth landings are easy to accomplish.|$|R
5000|$|An {{intermediate}} gear {{which does not}} drive a shaft to perform any work is called an <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b> Sometimes, a single <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may {{be referred to as}} a reverse idler. For instance, the typical automobile manual transmission engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear [...] "A") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear ("B") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear [...] "C" [...] will be spinning the same direction as [...] "A". A typical transmission is designed with [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the opposite direction, which drives the vehicle forward. A reverse <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> setup is actually typically an [...] "A" [...] and a [...] "C" [...] gear, which are not in contact with each other until a [...] "B" [...] gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car forwards when the output is spinning in the opposite direction from the input shaft, when added to the [...] "B" [...] <b>idler</b> <b>gear,</b> it forces the [...] "C" [...] gear to spin {{in the same direction as}} the [...] "A" [...] gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.|$|E
50|$|If {{a simple}} gear train has three gears, {{such that the}} input gear GA meshes with an {{intermediate}} gear GI which in turn meshes with the output gear GB, then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this gear ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the gears GA and GB engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b> The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an <b>idler</b> <b>gear</b> is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} <b>idler</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

40|$|Tests of a 167 Kilowatt (224 Horsepower) {{split torque}} face gearbox were {{performed}} by the Boeing Company in Mesa, Arizona, while working under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) split torque gearbox followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The split torque tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two face <b>gears.</b> Two <b>idler</b> <b>gears</b> were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output face gear to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth root fillets provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper face gear from the lower face gear was measured between the two idlers. The POC split torque tests demonstrated that face gears can be applied effectively in split torque rotorcraft transmissions, yielding good potential for significant weight, cost and reliability improvements over existing equipment using spiral bevel gearing...|$|R

2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two <b>idler</b> <b>gears</b> as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder head retainer castings, which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|R
40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation of a combustion engine is such that it generates a cyclic disturbance of the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox hammering noise. The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact of unloaded <b>gears,</b> such as <b>idler</b> <b>gears</b> of an automotive gearbox. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox rattle noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. Hammering noise For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the hammering noise of a truck timing multistage gear. A large variety of dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour of the two-stage gear train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over a wide range of operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using a coefficient of restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour of idle gears of an automotive gearbox. In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response of idle gears depends on the drag torque applied to the idle gear and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in an actual automotive gearbox and the operation of a specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. A nonlinear model of the dynamic response of idle gears is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient of restitution and a dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between active flanks and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the idle gear. Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict gear rattle for any idle gear, any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|R
