5|$|Despite his successes {{during the}} Druze revolt, the authorities, with whom <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tense relationship, grew wary of his {{strength}} and subsequently arrested him in a nighttime raid. He was sent to Istanbul by sea and from there {{he was sent to}} serve a prison sentence at the Widin fortress on the Danube River. Aqil was apparently loaned some money from the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had accompanied him on the ship ride to Istanbul, and Aqil used those funds to purchase a fake passport. With the passport and a disguise, he and an Albanian inmate named Hasan Agha escaped Widin in 1854 and reached Salonica. From there, Aqil departed to Anatolia and then Aleppo. Aqil resumed his Bedouin lifestyle of raiding and nomadic dwelling.|$|E

25|$|A {{contemporary}} account, however, suggests more mundanely that Peter Niers was {{a master}} of disguise: In a circulated warrant from 1579, based on confessions from his captured underlings, when Niers was thought {{to operate in the}} Schwarzwald area, it is stated that he frequently changed his appearance and costume, sometimes masquerading as a common soldier, at other times as a leper, {{and a number of other}} disguises. The same warrant states, however, that some things stayed constant: <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of money on him, he carried two loaded pistols in his trousers, and a huge two-handed sword.|$|E

25|$|Wardell's {{conversion}} to the Roman Catholic faith {{was the result}} of a period of deep internal reflection. This affiliation to a more high church ritual was manifested in his architectural interests which concentrated on the more Gothic designs of England's medieval architecture. For the remainder of his life he saw architecture as a means of praising God. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> room in his home set aside as a chapel for personal devotion which he visited several times during the course of a day. Dominating this room was an ancient carved wooden French cross that now belongs to the Melbourne Diocesan Historical Commission, who also own several other mementos of his persona devotion. Wardell also wrote, in particular two prayers devoted to the Virgin Mary, who he seems to have regarded as his especial saint. It is known that he frequently prayed for help and guidance when working on plans of church buildings.|$|E
500|$|India {{reacted to}} Kalam's death with {{an outpouring of}} grief; {{numerous}} tributes were paid to the former President across the nation and on social media. The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect. President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and other leaders condoled the former President's demise. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said [...] " [...] death is a great loss to the scientific community. He took India to great heights. He showed the way." [...] Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, said, [...] "our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self reliance in defence technologies. I worked very closely with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly benefited from his advice as president of our country. His life and work {{will be remembered for}} generations to come." [...] ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his former colleague [...] "a great personality and a gentleman", while former chairman G. Madhavan Nair described Kalam as [...] "a global leader" [...] for whom [...] "the downtrodden and poor people were his priority. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> passion to convey what is in his mind to the young generation", adding that his death left a vacuum which none could fill.|$|E
500|$|The band {{initially}} {{intended to}} title the album Metal Up Your Ass with the cover featuring a hand clutching a dagger {{emerging from a}} toilet bowl. However, Zazula convinced them to change this as he thought distributors would not stock it. The final cover featured {{the shadow of a}} hand letting go of a bloodied hammer. Burton was credited with coming up with the name Kill 'Em All—referring to timid record distributors, saying, [...] "Those record company fuckers... kill 'em all!"—as a response to the situation. Ulrich thought Kill 'Em All was a good name, and Zazula agreed. Burton suggested to Gary L. Heard, also responsible for the Metallica photograph on the back cover, to feature a bloodied hammer on the album art. According to Hammett, [...] "Cliff carried a hammer with him everywhere he went. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hammer in his luggage, and he would take it out occasionally and start destroying things." [...] Even though the original title was unused, the band did later release a [...] "Metal Up Your Ass" [...] T-shirt with the proposed artwork. A live bootleg recording of a 1982 performance at the Old Waldorf, titled Metal Up Your Ass (Live), featured the original cover artwork. Original pressings of the album came with an inner sleeve that included pictures and lyrics as well as a silver label on the vinyl. Subsequent pressings had a blank white sleeve and standard album label. The 1988 reissue re-introduced the lyrics and photos. The original release can be distinguished by the words [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] {{at the top of the}} back cover. This was dropped from the reissue. The phrase [...] "Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang" [...] was dedicated to San Francisco fan Ray Burch, known for his headbanging at the band's early shows.|$|E

A perfectionist, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong opinion about things and was even loyal to his principles more than any thing else in the football world. As an outspoken and critical visionary, he strongly criticized the Netherlands' style of play at the 2010 World Cup. [...] "Who am I supporting? I am Dutch but I support the football that Spain is playing. Spain's style is the style of Barcelona... Spain, a replica of Barça, is the best publicity for football," [...] Cruyff wrote in his weekly column for the Barcelona-based newspaper El Periodico, prior to the final match.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 Haskins and Alida {{moved to}} the Southern Highlands in Australia and built the third house-studio of their partnership.

Del Bosque added, [...] "I was very happy with Macca. He was a caballero, a gentleman, a stupendous guy; <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> smile, he never complained, he was great, a leader. He related to everyone very well; he united people.

In 1961, at 80 years old, Albert Caquot resigned from all the presidencies which he had always assured voluntarily. Warm-hearted, attentive and available, he loved to withdraw within his family.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Iron Tail {{is often}} mistaken by historians for Chief Iron Hail (“Dewey Beard”), being Lakota contemporaries with similar {{sounding}} names. [...] Most biographies incorrectly report that Chief Iron Tail {{fought in the}} Battle of the Little Bighorn and that his family was killed in 1890 at Wounded Knee, when in truth it was Chief Iron Hail who suffered the loss. [...] Major Israel McCreight reported: [...] "Iron Tail was not a war chief and no remarkable record as a fighter. [...] He was not a medicine man or conjuror, but a wise counselor and diplomat, always dignified, quiet and never given to boasting. He seldom made a speech and cared nothing for gaudy regalia, {{very much like the}} famed War Chief Crazy Horse. In this respect <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> smile and was fond of children, horses and friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suede was {{recorded}} at Master Rock Studios in Kilburn, north west London and cost £105,000 to make. In the studio, the producer Ed Buller's method of working {{was that he}} would form a close relationship with the band member whom he thought to be most important for the sound and creative input. In Suede's case it was guitarist Bernard Butler, which did not go down well with Anderson. Buller would be the band's closest musical collaborator for the years ahead. Anderson liked Buller as a person and for his enthusiasm for Suede. He endorsed his production on the first single [...] "The Drowners"; however, he had different views on [...] "Metal Mickey", feeling that Buller took the [...] "metal brutality" [...] out of the song. Instead of the song ending abruptly after the chorus, which the band demonstrated when performing live, Buller suggested an extended fade-out, which incorporated a key change. Anderson also had an issue with the song [...] "Moving", saying [...] "It never sounds as good on that album as it did live. There's hardly anything of the energy, it's over-produced, it's all a bit FX, it's a bit grim." [...] Butler would eventually clash with Buller for similar reasons during the recording of the next album, which was an event Anderson could perceive early on. [...] "I think as Bernard got more technically aware, because <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fine ear, he very soon saw flaws in what Ed was doing.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
