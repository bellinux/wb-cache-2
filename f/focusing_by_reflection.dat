This configuration is of interest in that it produces very high quality images of surfaces and defects. An impulse response method is used with {{the surface of the}} mirror approximated to a fine grid of point scatterers to give an overall reflected response. The predictions of this model have been compared with those measured experimentally in air using an optics-grade parabolic mirror, at frequencies of up to 1 MHz.

40|$|In 1948 Kirkpatrick and Baez {{showed that}} two crossed mirrors in a tandem {{configuration}} with concave surfaces can <b>focus</b> hard x-rays <b>by</b> <b>reflection.</b> Right afterwards in 1949 Kirkpatrick showed theoretically that x-rays {{can also be}} <b>focused</b> <b>by</b> refraction, when they are transmitted through a similar system, i. e. in conditions, when the reflectivity at the concave interface is negligible. He performed an experiment, in which he refracted an x-ray beam at grazing incidence at such a curved interface in one direction. Consequently {{this was the first}} reported practical use of a refractive x-ray lens. The experiment was forgotten. Here we compare more systematically the focusing in such devise with the expectations. We propose the use in a flat field spectrometer, which could provide better spectral resolution for fluorescence analysis than the commonly used Si drift diodes, however, on the expense of a rather low efficiency. The application of the system may thus be limited to the spectral characterisation of x-ray sources...|$|R

40|$|The {{reflection}} of internal gravity waves at sloping boundaries leads to focusing or defo- cusing. In closed domains, focusing dominates and projects the wave energy onto ’wave attractors’. Previous theoretical and experimental work on 2 D steady state wave attrac- tors {{has demonstrated that}} geometric <b>focusing</b> <b>by</b> wave <b>reflection</b> can be balanced either by viscous dissipation at high wave numbers (Hazewinkel et al., 2008), or by nonlinear wave-wave interactions (Scolan et al., 2013). The present study considers a weakly nonlinear 3 D internal wave beam under steady state conditions in a semi-infinite domain between two vertical walls. We analyze {{the effect of the}} Stokes boundary layers at these two vertical side walls on the interior velocity field. With a perturbation approach, we find that the two lateral Stokes boundary layers generate a fully three-dimensional interior velocity field component, proportional to ν 1 / 2, with ν the dynamical viscosity. This velocity field dampens the wave beam at high wave numbers, thereby providing a new mechanism to establish an energetic balance for steady state wave attractors. The analytical results agree well with the 3 D numerical wave attractor simulation by Brouzet et al. (2016) ...|$|R

Coxeter groups {{arise in}} a wide variety of areas, so every {{mathematician}} should know some basic facts about them, including their connection to “Dynkin diagrams. ” Proofs about these “groups generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> ” mainly use group theory, geometry, and combinatorics.
