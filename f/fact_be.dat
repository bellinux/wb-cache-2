5|$|The team, which {{represented}} Michigan Basketball for the ninety-sixth {{season in the}} Big Ten Conference, is {{sometimes referred to as}} Team 96 or Squad 96. Although this team represented Michigan for the ninety-sixth consecutive year, there was controversy as to whether the team should in <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> marketed as Team 96 because the 1908–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team was not properly accounted for among the prior teams.

40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{natural language}} system requires a large knowledge base.

Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in <b>fact,</b> <b>be</b> canonical.|$|E

5|$|As {{the time}} went past 90 minutes, {{an injury to}} Kevin Richardson held up play. TV cameras showed Liverpool midfielder Steve McMahon telling his team-mates there was one minute remaining. The injury itself meant there would, in <b>fact,</b> <b>be</b> two minutes and 39 seconds of injury time played. Liverpool adopted time-wasting tactics, {{including}} an unnecessary backpass from McMahon to Grobbelaar. In the second minute of injury time, Arsenal launched their final attack. A Barnes run was intercepted by Richardson, and he passed the ball back to his goalkeeper John Lukic. Lukic bowled the ball out to Dixon, his long ball to Alan Smith was flicked on, finding Michael Thomas charging through the midfield. Thomas evaded a challenge by Nicol and raced into the penalty area, slipping the ball past the advancing Grobbelaar to score Arsenal's second.|$|E

40|$|Facts {{exist in}} {{a wide array of}} {{varieties}} and they raise a lot of philosophical questions. The relationship between law and <b>fact</b> can <b>be</b> investigated in different perspectives. A statement of <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> any statement in which an event is described as occurred in the domain of the real world. Statements concerning <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> a matter of choice and construction, but above all they can be proven to be true or false. The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> not meaningful in itself, but only when it is bound up with a set of concepts, epistemological assumptions, linguistic conventions, shared values, general rules of experience, that gives it meaning. We deal with semantic, categorical, social or institutional constructions. Legal reasoning concerns both facts and norms. Their meaning is the result of their entering into a reciprocal correspondence. Reconstruction of facts and interpretation of law cannot be separated. In judicial contexts <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> the point of reference of a procedural machinery concerning evidence. Such <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> selected, determined and verified according to their relevancy in the case. A statement describing a <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> true when and insofar as it has been confirmed by the evidence presented to the court...|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by Sam Newton that Ecgric may in <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> identical to Eni's son Æthelric, whose descendants became kings of East Anglia. Æthelric's son Ealdwulf ruled from about 664 to 713. After Ecgric's death, three other sons of Eni ruled in succession before Ealdwulf, an indication that Raedwald's line was extinct. Æthelric's marriage to Hereswith suggests that {{it was expected that}} he would rule East Anglia and he may have been promoted by Edwin before 632. Æthelric was apparently dead by 647, at which time Anna was already ruling and Hereswith had gone to Gaul to lead a religious life. It has therefore been argued that Æthelric and Ecgric were in fact the same person, a suggestion that is disputed by the historian Barbara Yorke, who notes that the two names are too distinct to be compatible.|$|E
5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in <b>fact,</b> <b>be</b> an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans under the bed where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
5|$|After Poehler {{agreed to}} play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. The idea was partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in <b>fact,</b> <b>be</b> a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with The Office, the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{against the}} strong theory {{and for the}} weak theory, Searle insists, [...] "it could not be the case, as some have maintained, that all <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> {{institutional}} social <b>facts,</b> that there <b>are</b> no brute <b>facts,</b> because the structure of institutional facts reveals that they are logically dependent on brute facts. To suppose that all <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> institutional social would produce an infinite regress or circularity {{in the account of}} institutional facts. In order that some <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> institutional, there must <b>be</b> other <b>facts</b> that <b>are</b> brute physical, biological, natural. This is the consequence of the logical structure of institutional facts.".|$|R

5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and that are on average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who described and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and an immigrant to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites may in <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> close to or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their relationships are disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|On September 2009, Glickenhaus {{announced}} {{his intention to}} race {{a new version of}} the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours Nürburgring. The car, called the P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races. The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours Nürburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a cycle occurs in which {{volcanic}} activity at the summit is dominant for several hundred years, after which activity shifts to the rift zones for several more centuries, {{and then back to}} the summit again. Two cycles have been clearly identified, each lasting 1,500–2,000years. This cyclical behavior is unique to Mauna Loa among the Hawaiian volcanoes. Between about 7,000 and 6,000years ago Mauna Loa was largely inactive. The cause of this cessation in activity is not known, and no known similar hiatus has been found at other Hawaiian volcanoes except for those currently in the post-shield stage. Between 11,000 and 8,000years ago, activity was more intense than it is today. However, Mauna Loa's overall rate of growth has probably begun to slow over the last 100,000years, and the volcano may in <b>fact</b> <b>be</b> nearing the end of its tholeiitic basalt shield-building phase.|$|E
50|$|Mental facts {{include such}} things as perceptions, feelings, and judgments. Mental <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> {{ultimately}} caused by physical facts, in that mental facts depend on physical and biological functions which are required for consciousness.

40|$|What is {{the ontological}} status of facts? Are facts {{linguistic}} or extra-linguistic entities? If <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> extra-linguistic entities, are they mind-independent or relative to languages, theories or conceptual schemes? Based on a minimal definition of facts, the author argues that what are specified by true statements are not identical to true propositions expressed, so <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> not linguistic entities. Furthermore, what are specified by true statements {{are not to}} which a true statement corresponds, so <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> not mind-independent, either as concrete entities in the universe or as abstract entities {{in the world as}} it is. Last, the author presents an internal factual realist answer: although <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> neither in the world as it is, nor in a language, <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> real and exist in a world under consideration. A fact, as a non-linguistic correlate of a true statement of a language, exists in a world specified by the language...|$|R
