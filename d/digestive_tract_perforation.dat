30|$|Although {{surgical}} management {{requires a}} multidisciplinary assessment, several factors {{need to be}} taken into account. (1) First, inadequately treated typhlitis carries a high risk of death [112]. (2) In the more severe patients with typhlitis, lack of surgical management was found to be a significant adverse prognostic factor [113]. (3) Data obtained in non-cancer patients with thrombocytopenia suggest that even high-risk hemorrhage surgical intervention such as splenectomy carries a low risk of morbidity or mortality [114]. Taken together, these data suggest that neutropenia or thrombocytopenia per se should not lead to delayed surgical intervention in critically ill neutropenic patients suspected of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>perforation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Disk battery ingestions {{can lead}} to serious {{complications}} including airway or <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>perforation,</b> blood vessel erosions, mediastinitis, and stricture formation. Case presentation We report a 20 -month-old Caucasian child who developed eosinophilic enterocolitis and subsequent protein-losing enteropathy from manganese that leaked from a lithium disk battery. The disk battery was impacted in her esophagus for 10 days resulting in battery corrosion. We postulate that this patient's symptoms were due to a manganese leak from the 'retained' disk battery; this resulted in an allergic response in her gut and protein-losing enteropathy. Her symptoms improved gradually over the next 2 weeks with conservative management. Conclusion This is the first case report to highlight the potential complication of allergic enterocolitis and protein-losing enteropathy secondary to ingested manganese. Clinicians should be vigilant about this rare complication in managing patients with disk battery ingestions. </p...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{report the}} case of a 41 -year-old woman with a colonic {{perforation}} due to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) catheter. Left-sided colonic perforation was diagnosed by abdominal computed tomography 28 years after shunt placement, following acute meningitis caused by Escherichia coli. The proximal end of the VPS was exteriorized and it was decided to remove the distal end by colonoscopy. After pulling out the catheter with a polypectomy snare, it broke at the site where it was entering the colon, leaving a small perforation in the colonic wall which was closed with 2 endoclips. The endoluminal fragment of the catheter, being 20 cm in length, was removed through the rectum. The patient is asymptomatic at the 12 -month follow-up.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{perforation}} of the stomach by a fish bone. A 63 -years-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe abdominal pain. On physical examination, tenderness and rebound tenderness were noted in the upper abdomen. Abdominal X-ray showed free air, and abdominal CT showed a 3. 0 cm linear foreign body. The problem was diagnosed preoperatively as perforation of the stomach due to a fish bone and the patient underwent emergency surgery. We found a fish bone penetrating {{the wall of the}} stomach. The fish bone was removed, and the perforation was directly sutured. Perforation of the digestive tract, especially the stomach, by ingested fish bones is relatively rare.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the safety of}} endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after Billroth-Ⅱ gastrectomy. MethodsA total of 43 patients who were admitted to our hospital and underwent Billroth-Ⅱ gastrectomy from June 2012 to June 2015 were enrolled and underwent ERCP. ResultsOf all 43 patients undergoing ERCP, 39 (90. 7 %) received successful intubation, 2 (4. 7 %) received failed intubation, and 2 (4  7 %) experienced the complication of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>perforation.</b> Among the 39 patients who underwent ERCP, 31 (79. 5 %) were diagnosed with common bile duct stones (3 underwent sphincterotomy and 28 underwent endoscopic papillary balloon dilation to remove stones), 6 (15. 4 %) were diagnosed with benign stenosis {{at the end of}} bile duct (4 underwent papillary balloon dilation alone and 2 underwent biliary plastic stent implantation), and 1 patient each (2. 6 %) was diagnosed with ampullary tumor and hepatic portal metastasis of gastric cancer and received implantation of metal and plastic stents, respectively.

40|$|Background and Methods. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to find out}} whether translocation of bacteria to the abdominal cavity and endotoxemia in rats with sterile peritonitis could be prevented by selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Sterile peritonitis was caused by the intraperitoneal injection of either 100, 150, 200, or 300 mg of zymosan suspended in paraffin. Results: The frequency of infection of the abdominal cavity depended on the dose of zymosan given, ranging from 20 % in rats receiving 100 mg to 89 % in rats receiving 300 mg of zymosan. In rats not receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> (the control group), Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in all rats, and Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the abdominal cavity in ten of 19 rats. In rats receiving antibioties for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in none of the 14 rats, and likewise, Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from the abdominal cavity in none of the 14 rats (p <. 005). Moreover, in rats receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> endotoxin levels in feces and plasma were significantly lower, as compared with rats not receiving antibiotics for selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Conclusion: Selective decontamination of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> prevents translocation of Gram-negative bacilli to the abdominal cavity, and endotoxemia and mortality in rats with sterile peritonitis...|$|R

40|$|What {{is known}} and {{objective}} Endoscopic submucosal dissection of early colorectal neoplasms (ESD-ECN) {{is known to}} be an operation with risk of contamination, possibly requiring pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of post-operative infection. However, an evaluation of the need for pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis for ESD-ECN has yet to be reported. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis is associated with a reduced incidence of post-operative infection following ESD-ECN. Methods The present retrospective case-controlled study utilized a database built from the medical records of 14 university hospitals throughout Japan. Patients who were admitted and discharged from the hospital from April 2012 to October 2013 and who had undergone ESD-ECN were included in the study. Patients who had been undergone any other operation during their course of hospitalization, and patients who were prescribed antimicrobial agents for reasons other than post-operative infection or for prophylaxis were excluded. Characteristics of the study population, pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis and antimicrobial therapy for post-operative infection were investigated. In addition, we compared the characteristics of patients with post-operative infection (PI) and those with no post-operative infection (NPI). Univariate analyses were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results and discussion We obtained the records of 522 patients who had undergone ESD-ECN from the database. After application of exclusion criteria, 421 patients were enrolled. The post-operative infection rate was 1 · 2 %. Peritonitis was found most to be the most common post-operative infection (44 %). Pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis was used for 314 patients (75 %), with a median duration of 3 · 0 (range 1 - 11) days. Cefotiam was most frequently prescribed for pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis (56 %). Antimicrobial therapies were started 1 - 10 days after ESD-ECN for a duration of 1 - 14 days. Pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis was not associated with post-operative infection rate, with an OR (95 % CI) of 0 · 73 (0 · 08 - 6 · 61). However, <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>perforation</b> was shown to be associated with post-operative infection and had an OR (95 % CI) of 17 · 1 (1 · 66 - 176 · 45). What is new and conclusion Post-operative infection is an exceedingly rare event following ESD-ECN. Pre-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis had no significant effect on post-operative infection following ESD-ECN and thus may be unnecessary. Instead, prevention of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>perforation</b> may be more critical for the decrease in post-operative infections. Univariate analyses of PI vs. NPI...|$|E
30|$|Even {{when the}} surgery {{indication}} is clear, the optimal timing of surgery is debated. For symptomatic septic neutropenic patients, neutropenia recovery represents a high-risk {{period in which}} the clinical status is likely to worsen [64]. Waiting for neutropenia resolution remains debated because this approach might expose patients to a septic degradation toward septic shock. Interestingly, Badgwell recently suggested to delay surgery until neutropenia recovery, although he demonstrated in the same publication that surgery was independently associated with a good outcome, regardless of the duration of neutropenia, which appears as a conflicting message [11]. An expert panel from the French Intensive Care Society stated that neutropenia and thrombocytopenia should not modify the timing of surgery in patients with suspicion of <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> <b>perforation</b> [16], without any robust publication to rely on. Recent data demonstrated that preoperative septic shock and renal replacement therapy were independently associated with an increased mortality in hematology patients who underwent surgery for an acute abdominal complication [54]. We showed that surgery during the neutropenic period did not modify the prognosis, suggesting that surgery should probably not be delayed. It {{is important to note that}} some patients included in the meta-analysis underwent surgery lately at the stage of septic shock and multi-organ failures. Despite these severe situations, abdominal surgery was not associated with an increased mortality, suggesting that the prognostic impact of surgical management may be underestimated. We could not analyze early versus delayed surgical procedures. The influence of an early surgical strategy on outcome deserves to be evaluated, as we know that an early management is associated with a better prognosis [65, 66].|$|E

The symbiotic A. veronii bv. sobria strain proliferated well and persisted for at least 7 days inside the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> In contrast, the proliferation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited inside the animal compared to growth in the in vitro control, indicating that the ingested blood was modified within the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> However, both strains were able to persist in the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> for at least 7 days. For an Escherichia coli strain, the viable counts decreased approximately 1, 000 -fold within 42 h. The decrease of viable E. coli could be prevented by interfering with the activation of the membrane-attack complex of the complement system that is present in blood. This suggests that the membrane-attack complex remained active inside H. medicinalis and prevented the proliferation of sensitive bacteria.

Selective oropharyngeal decontamination only aims to eradicate respiratory tract colonization. In a recent study, selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination were associated with lower day- 28 mortality, when compared to standard care. Furthermore, selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination {{was associated with a}} lower incidence of intensive care unit-acquired bacteremia caused by gram-negative bacteria. We quantified the role of intestinal tract carriage with gram-negative bacteria and intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia. DESIGN: Data from a cluster-randomized and a single-center observational study. SETTING: Intensive care unit in The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Patients with intensive care unit stay of > 48 hrs that received selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination (n = 2, 667), selective oropharyngeal decontamination (n = 2, 166) or standard care (n = 1, 945). INTERVENTIONS: Selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination or selective oropharyngeal decontamination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Incidence densities (episodes/ 1000 days) of intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia were 4. 5, 3. 0, and 1. 4 during standard care, selective oropharyngeal decontamination, and selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination, respectively, and the daily risk for developing intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteria bacteremia increased until days 36, 33, and 31 for selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination, standard care, and selective oropharyngeal decontamination and was always lowest during selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination. Rectal colonization with gram-negative bacteria was present in 26 % and 71 % of patient days during selective <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination, respectively (p <. 01). Irrespective of interventions, incidence densities of intensive care unit-acquired gram-negative bacteremia was 4. 5 during patient days with both intestinal and respiratory tract gram-negative bacteria carriage. These incidence densities reduced with 33 % (to 3. 1) during days with intestinal gram-negative bacteria carriage only and with another 45 % (to 1. 0) during days without gram-negative bacteria carriage at both sites.
