40|$|Objectives: To measure {{preferences}} {{and willingness to}} pay (WTP) for a novel anaesthetic (<b>dental</b> <b>gel)</b> versus existing anaesthetic options for periodontal maintenance visits. Design: The study was conducted by developing and administering a survey, composed of a modified decision aid and a WTP instrument. The decision aid provided clinical information in layman's terms. Patients stated their anaesthetic preference; WTP elicited the hypothetical amount of money a subject would pay to have <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> available for maintenance cleaning, should they require anaesthetic. Patients: Periodontal recall patients (n = 97; `recall') and participants {{from the general population}} (n = 196; `general') from southwestern Ontario, Canada. Results: The overwhelming majority of participants chose <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> over injectable local anaesthetic or no anaesthetic as their first anaesthetic preference (general: 81. 0 %; recall: 82. 5 %). The median WTP for <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> was 20. 00 Canadian dollars ($Can) per visit for the general population and $Can 10. 00 for the recall population (1999 values). The majority of participants were willing to pay an insurance premium for <b>dental</b> <b>gel,</b> even if they did not personally prefer <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> (general: 72. 4 %; recall: 73. 2 %). The median monthly premium to have <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> available for any plan beneficiary requiring scaling and root planing (SRP) during maintenance was $Can 2. 00 per month for both groups. Conclusions: In this population, an alternative to traditional injectable local anaesthetic (i. e. <b>dental</b> <b>gel)</b> was overwhelmingly preferred by both general population participants and recall patients for maintenance cleaning procedures. Most participants were willing to pay to have <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> available, either for themselves or for others.

40|$|A highly selective, {{rapid and}} direct amperometric method, {{based on the}} {{formation}} of a complex between tin(II) and 8 -hydroxyquinoline (oxine), has been developed for the determination of trace levels of tin(II) using flow injection analysis. Tin(II) electro-oxidation was catalyzed by oxine; its oxidation peak occurred at + 0. 05 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a glassy carbon electrode in 0. 1 mol 1 (- 1) acetate buffer (pH 6). A linear relationship was obtained between the peak current and the tin(II) concentration in the range 0. 25 - 20 mumol 1 (- 1). The detection limit was 0. 1 mumol 1 (- 1) and the relative standard deviation calculated by the injection of a 10 mumol 1 (- 1) tin(II) solution was 5 % (n = 20). Optimization of several experimental parameters has been carried out and the influence of numerous cations and possible interfering molecules encountered in radiopharmaceuticals and in <b>dental</b> <b>gels</b> has been investigated.

40|$|For the {{effective}} treatment of periodontitis, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (HCl) medicated <b>dental</b> <b>gels</b> are prepared with different hydrophilic polymers (MC, HPMC, HPC, and HEC) in different concentrations of propylene glycol. The formulations {{are subjected to}} various physicochemical studies like pH, spreadability, extrudability, viscosity, drug content, in vitro drug release, and rheological and stability studies. During the rheological studies plots of shear rate versus viscosity showed that all the gels were non-Newtonian and exhibited pseudoplastic behavior. in vitro drug release {{studies were carried out}} in the diffusion cell using a pH 7. 2 phosphate buffer as a receptor medium. Formulations exhibited an extended release of the drug for over a period of 6 hours and the release depended on the type of polymer and concentrations of propylene glycol used. Stability studies showed no significant variations (P > 0. 05) in pH, spreadability, viscosity, extrudability, and drug content. An in vitro release study concluded that hydrocolloid based ciprofloxacin hydrochloride medicated <b>dental</b> <b>gels</b> appear to be probably extend the release of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride. Optimal formulations were selected for in vivo or clinical studies. The clinical evaluation of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride gels was carried out to determine the efficacy in the treatment of periodontitis. Six groups, each containing five patients, were used in the study. All the patients were evaluated for plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP). In all these studies, two groups were treated with formulations alone and another two groups were treated with formulations along with scaling and root planning. One group was treated with scaling and root planning only, whereas, the last group was treated as control (No treatment). All the groups showed a similar baseline PI. However, the PI values decreased remarkably in the groups treated with formulation along with scaling and root planning when compared to the other groups. Similarly, the results of GI, BOP, and PD also showed a significant reduction (P < 0. 05) in the groups treated with formulation along with scaling and root planning compared to other groups.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical effects of a <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> containing barberry extracts (from Berberis vulgaris) on gingivitis and microbial plaque control. A double blind clinical trial study was conducted in a dormitory on 45 boys aged 11 - 12 years having the same socioeconomic conditions. These students were divided into 3 groups; the first group (25 students) using barberry gel, and the second group (10 students) using placebo gel without active ingredient. To compare the activity of our gel with an active antiplaque, a third group of 10 students using Colgate® antiplaque toothpaste was also considered. At the beginning all subjects were examined for plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI). These tests were re-evaluated after 21 days of using the above mentioned dentifrices. The results showed that barberry gel has reduced the PI for about 56 %. This reduction was 18. 5 % for placebo and 44 % for Colgate ® antiplaque groups. Considering means of PI (ΔPI) and GI (ΔGI) of different groups, there was significant difference between barberry and placebo gel’s groups and between placebo and Colgate ® groups, but the difference between barberry and Colgate ® groups was not significant. This study indicates that the barberry <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> effectively controls microbial plaque and gingivitis in the school aged children; therefore, the use of barberry <b>dental</b> <b>gel</b> is strongly recommended...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} single-blind, randomized, parallel-designed {{clinical}} trial (RCT) was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of three sustained-release biodegradable polymers delivered into periodontal pockets following initial periodontal therapy. Methods: Forty-seven patients (28 females and 19 males) {{with a mean age}} of 51 years (range 29 - 71) underwent a periodontal examination at baseline (i. e. Week 0) and after 18 weeks. This included the assessment of the Plaque Index (PlI), Bleeding on Probing (BOP), Pocket Probing Depths (PPD) and Probing Attachment Levels (PAL) at six sites per tooth. Two to 4 months prior to baseline, all subjects had received initial periodontal therapy including motivation, instruction in oral hygiene practices and full-mouth scaling and root planing. At the treatment appointment (i. e. Week 2), the patients were randomly assigned to receive either Atridox™, Elyzol® <b>Dental</b> <b>Gel</b> or PerioChip® at all residual periodontal pockets with a probing depth ≥ 5 mm and concomitant BOP. In accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, Elyzol® <b>Dental</b> <b>Gel</b> was applied for a second time 7 days later. In addition to the clinical evaluation, subgingival microbiological samples were collected prior to treatment (i. e. Week 2) and at Weeks 4 and 18. Analysis of variance/covariance was used to evaluate changes from baseline to Week 18 for the clinical parameters. Results: Between the baseline and 18 -week examinations, subjects treated with Atridox showed a significantly greater gain in mean PAL of 0. 33 mm ± 0. 09 (SD) than subjects treated with Elyzol® <b>Dental</b> <b>Gel</b> [0. 03 mm ± 0. 09 (SD) ] (p = 0. 03). However, the gain in PAL of 0. 16 mm ± 0. 10 (SD) found after PerioChip® application did not differ significantly from that obtained following the application of Atridox™ (p = 0. 27). Of the sites treated with Atridox™, 42 % gained ≥ 1 mm PAL and 9 % ≥ 2 mm PAL as opposed to the sites treated with Elyzol® <b>Dental</b> <b>Gel,</b> in which 34 % gained ≥ 1 mm PAL and 8 % gained ≥ 2 mm PAL. Of the sites treated with PerioChip®, 36 % gained ≥ 1 mm and 6 % gained ≥ 2 mm PAL following a completed initial periodontal therapy. Conclusions: The application of the three biodegradable sustained release devices tested following initial periodontal therapy resulted in a statistically significant gain in mean PAL for Atridox™ and a significant reduction in PPD for all three devices during the study period. Furthermore, when sites treated with Atridox™ were compared with sites treated with Elyzol®, a significant difference in mean PAL gain (0. 3 mm) was observed. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2002. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} the acute and subacute toxicity the gel containing 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract. The toxicity of the gel studied at the intragastric route of administration, due to the scope of drug – dentistry. Materials and methods. The object of the research was gel containing 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract. Studies of acute toxicity gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract was performed on white inbred laboratory mice of both sexes, weighing 19 – 21 gram. Animals received gel single intragastric at maximum tolerated this route of administration dose – 2. 0 g/kg [6]. The experiment used by 5 mice of both sexes. The criteria of judgment about the toxicity was the clinical picture of intoxication, animal survival, dynamics of body weight of mice (raw data, 3, 7, 14 days). Observation of animals were carried out within two weeks. Subacute toxicity studied on white inbred laboratory rats of both sexes, weighing 220 – 250 g. Animals were divided into 3 groups, each experimental group were 5 male and 5 female rats. Total experiment used 30 rats. Rats was injected gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract once a day for 14 days at doses of 0. 2 g/kg and 1. 0 g/kg (1 / 10 and 1 / 2 of the maximum dose in acute experiment). Control animals were injected comparison drug Kamistad–H gel at a dose of 1. 0 g/kg. Evaluation of the toxic effects of investigational gel and reference medicine on the body of the experimental animals were carried out on the following parameters: clinical observations, the survival of animals, food and water consumption, the dynamics of body weight, hematological and biochemical parameters of blood. Clinical observations of the animals was performed daily during the experiment, registering changes in their general condition, behavior, food and water consumption. Clinical and biochemical parameters studied using a reagent kit of "Felicity Diagnostics" (Ukraine) and conventional methods. Body weight of animals recorded in dynamics. The animals were weighed before the experiment, then 7 and 14 days. Results and discussion. Results of the study parameters acute toxicity gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract showed that intragastric administration to mice at a dose of 2. 0 g/kg caused no clinical symptoms of intoxication. Animals calmly reacted to the introduction of the sample gel, their general condition and behavior remained unchanged. Animal deaths and abnormalities in their general condition and behavior during the observation period were noted. Impact analysis of the sample of gel on the dynamics of body mass animal experiments showed that a single injection of a gel to mice at a dose of 2. 0 g/kg did not significantly affect the dynamics of body weight. In experiments on rats were studied subacute toxicity gel with carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract. The results of 14 days intragastric introduction gel and reference drug studies at subacute toxicity showed that daily administration of no effect on the general condition, appearance (state of the skin and mucous membranes) and the behavior of rats. Consumption of food and water in animal experimental and control groups had no differences from each other. During the experiment animal deaths were not reported. Data characterizing the dynamics of increase in body weight of rats showed that the animals of experimental groups and the control group {{by the end of the}} experiment had equivalent, statistically significant weight gain compared with the output data: males – p ≤ 0. 0001 females – from p ≤ 0. 0001 to p ≤ 0. 0004. During the experiment, the animals of all experimental groups were observed physiological fluctuations that characterize the pattern of peripheral blood. Results of biochemical studies showed that overall the tested parameters: the concentration of total protein, albumin, thymol test, the activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, the concentration of glucose and cholesterol in the blood serum of rats of all experimental groups answered normal values. There have been fluctuations in biochemical parameters in animals of all experimental groups compared with baseline data did not go beyond the physiological norm. Conclusions. 1. Study of acute toxicity after a single intragastric administration to mice gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract have shown that gel does not cause death of animals; no toxic effects on the general state, behavior, food consumption and water weight animals; does not affect the absolute and relative weight of internal organs; does not cause visible changes of internal organs. 2. According to the standard classification gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract refers to practically non-toxic substances. 3. Subacute toxicity study results showed that the gel with 0. 5 % carbon dioxide Humulus lupulus extract with 14 daily intragastric administration to rats at doses of 0. 5 g/kg and 1. 0 g/kg, does not cause death of animals; has no toxic effects on the general state, behavior and dynamics of body weight of the experimental animals; no negative impact on the performance of blood of animals; does not change the biochemical parameters characterizing the functional state of the liver of animals. 4.

40|$|Saccharin, a {{synthetic}} sweetener constituent of several pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations, is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively {{in the presence}} of interferences like active ingredients and excipients. A derivative ultraviolet spectrophotometric method employing the second and the fourth orders was used. The calibration data obtained were satisfactory, with a relative precision range of 0. 53 %- 0. 72 %, and linearity between 0. 9998 - 0. 9999. The recovery test results for the toothgel sample ranged between 97. 80 % and 104. 95 % in the second order of derivative and between 98. 04 % and 101. 32 % in the fourth derivative, respectively, using zero-peak (ZP) and peak-peak (PP) methods. The suspension sample showed values between 97. 35 % and 104. 72 % in the second derivative and between 95. 94 % to 104. 41 % in the fourth derivative, respectively, employing the zero-peak (ZP) and peak-peak (PP) methods. The proposed method showed precision, accuracy and simplicity.

40|$|Although {{dental health}} has {{improved}} {{during the last}} 40 - 50 years, approximal caries still constitutes a problem in many age groups. It is important that fluoride (F) toothpaste is used when brushing the teeth. In some subjects, {{there may be a}} need for supplementary F products, especially in the caries-prone approximal area. Aim: The aims of this thesis were: i) to study the F release of F-containing approximal oral hygiene aids both in vitro and in vivo, ii) to evaluate different methods for the administration of F in vivo, iii) to study the effect of the frequent use of F-containing toothpicks and floss on demineralised enamel and dentine in situ and iv) to evaluate recommendations and the use of oral hygiene products for approximal cleaning in a Swedish adult population. Material and methods and Results: The F release of 26 brands of toothpicks and floss was followed for 24 hrs in vitro. A large variation in the release between these products was found; in general, toothpicks resulted in larger amounts of F compared with floss. The release in vivo was studied using single and multiple fluoridated toothpicks and dental floss, as well as in combination with toothbrushing or a mouthrinse with 0. 2 % NaF. Moreover, the administration of F by an interdental brush dipped in 0. 2 % NaF gel (here called the “Inter <b>Dental</b> Brush <b>Gel</b> Method”) was evaluated. Approximal saliva was collected, using paper points, before and up to 60 min after treatment. Both toothpicks and floss resulted in enhanced F concentrations in vivo. An interdental brush dipped in 0. 2 % NaF gel and a mouthrinse with 0. 2 % NaF resulted in the same F concentration as after using multiple toothpicks. All combinations of toothpicks and dental floss with F rinsing resulted in higher concentrations than after only toothbrushing or in combination with brushing. The most optimal order was to use toothpicks and dental floss after toothbrushing and before rinsing. Fifteen adults with full dentures, in which demineralised enamel and dentine specimens had been mounted, were included in an in situ experimental caries model. Toothpicks or floss, impregnated with NaF and amine fluoride (AmF), were used regularly for four weeks. All the products inhibited continuous demineralisation - dental floss somewhat more than toothpicks. A reduction in plaque micro-organisms was also found. Recommendations made by dental staff in relation to approximal cleaning aids were evaluated by a questionnaire sent to 500 dentists, 500 dental hygienists and 1000 patients in Sweden. The ability to remove approximal plaque was also evaluated in 60 regular users of approximal aids. Recommendations by dental staff are mostly given to children and adolescents in order to prevent dental caries and to older individuals to prevent gingivitis and periodontal disease. Approximal plaque appears to be more easily removed by regular users of interdental brushes compared with the use of toothpicks and dental floss. Conclusions: The use of fluoridated interproximal aids appears to be important in order to reduce approximal caries. An interdental brush dipped in a NaF gel is an interesting method for increasing approximal F concentration...|$|R
