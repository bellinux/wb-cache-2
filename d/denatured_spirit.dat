50|$|In {{addition}} to the firearms industry, the tobacco industry is also subject to paying special (occupational) taxes, and are therefore SOTs. Specifically, manufacturers of tobacco products, manufacturers of cigarette papers and tubes, and tobacco export warehouse proprietors are subject to tax. Before 1 July 2008, segments of the alcohol trade (producers and marketers of alcohol beverages, manufacturers of non-beverage products, users of tax-free alcohol, and users and dealers of specially <b>denatured</b> <b>spirits)</b> were also subject to special (occupational) taxes. These taxes were repealed in Public Law 109-59.|$|R
50|$|Denatured alcohol, {{also called}} {{methylated}} <b>spirits</b> or <b>denatured</b> rectified <b>spirit,</b> is ethanol that has additives {{to make it}} poisonous, bad tasting, foul smelling or nauseating, to discourage recreational consumption. In some cases it is also dyed. Pyridine, methanol, or both {{can be added to}} make denatured alcohol poisonous, and denatonium can be added to make it bitter.|$|R
5000|$|Rectified spirit, {{also known}} as neutral spirits, {{rectified}} alcohol, or ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin is highly concentrated ethanol which has been purified by means of repeated distillation, {{a process that is}} called rectification. In some countries (e.g. India), denatured alcohol or <b>denatured</b> rectified <b>spirit</b> may commonly be available as [...] "rectified spirit", but this is poisonous and ingestion can be fatal.|$|R
50|$|The Act further bans the use or {{possession}} of <b>denatured</b> <b>spirit</b> or any material, utensil, implement or apparatus whatsoever used for manufacture of liquor. Publishing or display of advertisements of liquor {{or any other}} preparation fit for use as liquor in the newspapers and periodicals is also banned.|$|E
50|$|Rarely, {{blindness}} {{is caused}} by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with ethanol for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in methylated <b>spirits,</b> <b>denatured</b> ethyl alcohol, to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption. Methylated spirits are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages.|$|R
5000|$|Graetz then {{designed}} a pressure lamp, working with vaporized paraffin. To start this process, the lamp was preheated with methylated <b>spirit</b> (<b>denatured</b> alcohol), in later models with an integrated blow torch called [...] "Rapidstarter" [...] {{running from the}} paraffin tank directly. In a closed tank, paraffin was pressurised with a hand pump. The heat produced by the mantle was then used to vaporize the paraffin, which is mixed with air and blown in to mantle to burn.Around the year 1916, the lantern and its name started to travel around the world. The name Petromax derives from “Petroleum” and “Max Graetz”.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical {{removal of}} overpaint include {{physical}} techniques {{to remove the}} coating from the surface. On a glazed surface a sharp needle or scalpel can be used. If mechanical removal is not possible without damaging the surface then solvents can be used instead. The archetype solvents typically used are water, white spirit, industrial methylated <b>spirits</b> (<b>denatured</b> alcohol), acetone, and Dichloromethane which is usually found {{in the form of}} a commercial paint stripper. The appropriate solvent works by being applied to the ceramic surface by a cotton wool swab and is rolled on the surface rather than being wiped. Wiping the solvent on the surface will push the paint into the surface rather than lift it off.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A 85 mm Chance Brothers Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation which {{produced}} the light for the Sumburgh Head lighthouse until 1976. The lamp (made in approx. 1914) burned vaporized kerosene (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a <b>denatured</b> alcohol (methylated <b>spirit)</b> burner to light. When lit {{some of the}} vaporised fuel was diverted to a Bunsen burner to keep the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so. This in turn pressurized the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The [...] "white sock" [...] is in fact an unburnt mantle on which the vapor burned.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for fungal attack is {{incomplete}} drying of specimens, caused either during the specimen preparation process or afterwards, or in collections that become wet later through flood, other water damage or improper storage conditions, especially in the tropics. Properly dried plant specimens will not suffer from fungal attack if stored in the correct conditions. During the drying process specimens are particularly at risk if they dry slowly. This happens through poor drying conditions or specimens being wet before being pressed or having water-retaining or succulent parts. Specimens with sugary exudations or large quantities of nectar are also particularly attractive to fungi and need special care during drying {{to ensure that they}} dry fast enough to prevent mold growth. If fungal growth occurs on specimens, it can be brushed with 95% ethanol or methylated <b>spirits</b> (<b>denatured</b> alcohol). However, this may alter the specimen for chemical and other investigative research and only kills the fungus present on the specimen, not preventing further problems of fungal growth.|$|R
