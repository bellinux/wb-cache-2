50|$|RFIQin, also {{referred}} to as RFIQ, is a patented automatic cooking device that consists of three different sized pans, a portable <b>induction</b> <b>heater,</b> and recipe cards, which is designed by Vita Craft Corporation, but is currently only sold in Japan through Vita Craft Japan. Electronics are embedded in the cookware, which monitor the food and send wireless signals to adjust the temperature of the <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> accordingly; this prevents the loss of nutrients and saves thermal energy because the food is not overheated. Specialized recipe cards send a wireless signal to the RFIQin system when a recipe card is waved under the handle of the pan, which begins the cooking process; each recipe card can incorporate 23 separate recipe steps. The recipe cards have cooking steps to follow that are indicated by a beeping sound from the <b>induction</b> <b>heater.</b> The system can cook almost all types of food, including cakes and fried foods.|$|E

50|$|Induction {{shrink fitting}} {{refers to the}} use of <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> {{technology}} to pre-heat metal components between 150 C and 300 C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component. Typically the lower temperature range is used on metals such as aluminium and higher temperatures are used on metals such as low/medium carbon steels. The process avoids the changing of mechanical properties whilst allowing components to be worked. Metals typically expand in response to heating and contract on cooling; this dimensional response to temperature change is expressed as a coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|Induction heating is {{the process}} of heating an {{electrically}} conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents. An <b>induction</b> <b>heater</b> consists of an electromagnet, and an electronic oscillator that passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials like iron, heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses. The frequency of current used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.|$|E
