40|$|Cloud computing, in {{particular}} its <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Services</b> model, allows system administrators to obtain resources to deploy their applications {{and to pay}} just for the resources that are consumed. Therefore, local data centers are replaced by remote infrastructures. As a consequence, the specific hardware expertise required from system administrators is reduced. However, cloud computing requires new skills. Estimating resources that the applications require {{to run in the}} cloud is a complex task due to system administrators frequently do not know the low-level technical details of what they really need. Furthermore, the estimations can vary depending on the cloud provider characteristics. Selecting the more adequate provider for a particular application is also a laborious task because there are a huge number of <b>services</b> offered by <b>a</b> considerable number of providers that are not directly comparable. In order to assist system administrators in this hard labour, we propose an architecture that supports the process of deploying applications in cloud providers, using high level information based on non-functional requirements.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, cloud {{applications}} are developed in Platforms <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Service</b> and <b>Infrastructures</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Service.</b> Before {{the advent of}} Cloud computing, software engineering knew several approaches and methodologies for application development like: agiles methods and service oriented approaches. With cloud computing and the convergence toward ”Everything <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Service”, application development methods are moving to a new paradigm which abstracts the underlying architecture and infrastructure. We ﬁnd in the literature, some work describing frameworks and architectures for cloud software development, {{but there is a}} lack of a methodology which covers the whole application development lifecycle. Furthermore, these work are mainly dedicated to developers. Our work ﬁts into the perspective of deﬁning a methodology for automatic cloud-based services- oriented business application development. The methodology we propose is designed for non-IT professional users. It avoids the huge technical background needed for cloud application development by automating the process of development; avoids PaaS dependency and advocates the implicit collaboration by reusing and composing <b>services.</b> We deﬁne <b>a</b> ”requirements vocabulary”, which is based on linked USDL principles and aims to describe the application requirements in a high level of abstraction of the development details...|$|R

40|$|Today {{the main}} limit to Cloud {{adoption}} {{is related to}} the perception of a security loss the users have. Indeed, the existing solutions to provide security are mainly focused on Cloud Provider prospective in order to securely integrate frameworks and <b>Infrastructures</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Services</b> (IaaS) in <b>a</b> Cloud datacenter. There is no way to monitor and evaluate the provided security. In fact, Service Level Agreements mainly focus on performance related terms and no guarantees are given for security mechanisms. Users are interested in tools to verify and monitor the implemented security requirements. On the other side, developers need tools to deploy Cloud application offering measurable security grants to end users. In this paper we will propose an approach to implement security mechanisms as components in the application design process. We modeled security interactions according to the specific threat, the specific security requirements and user/application capabilities trying to improve security and enable <b>a</b> <b>Service</b> Provider to offer security guarantees to customers.

30|$|Researchers have {{analyzed}} {{the performance of}} BDA from various viewpoints. For example, Alexandru [5] analyzes the performance of Cloud Computing Services for Many-Task Computing (MTC) system. According to Alexandru, scientific workloads often require High-Performance Computing capabilities, in which scientific computing community has started to focus on MTC, this means high performance execution of loosely coupled applications comprising many tasks. By means of this approach {{it is possible to}} demand systems to operate at high utilizations, like to current production grids. Alexandru analyzes the performance based on the premise if current clouds can execute MTC-based scientific workload with similar performance and at lower cost that the current scientific processing systems. For this, the author focuses on <b>Infrastructures</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Service</b> (IaaS), this means providers on public clouds that are not restricted within an enterprise. In this research, Alexandru selected four public clouds providers; Amazon EC 2, GoGrid, ElasticHosts and Mosso in which it is performed a traditional system benchmarking in order to provide a first order estimate of the system performance. Alexandru mainly uses metrics related to disk, memory, network and cpu to determine the performance through the analysis of MTC workloads which comprise tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tasks. The main finding in this research is that the compute performance of the tested clouds is low compared to traditional systems of high performance computing. In addition, Alexandru found that while current cloud computing services are insufficient for scientific computing at large, they are a good solution for scientists who need resources instantly and temporarily.|$|R
