40|$|Growth {{evolution}} and biomass yield of fiber sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] variety FS- 5 were studied {{under field conditions}} in central Greece in the years 2001 and 2002, using a completely randomized block design with three treatments in four replicates. (including control) The project comprised two irrigation methods: conventional drip irrigation and modern subsurface drip irrigation. Both treatments received at regular intervals the same irrigation amount for matching half of the evapotranspiration needs (supplemental irrigation) {{in the first year}} (2001), and the total evapotranspiration needs (full irrigation) in the second year (2002). <b>Irrigation</b> in both <b>systems</b> was applied in laterals placed 1. 6 m apart with a distance of 0. 6 m between the self-regulated emitters, recharging 3. 75 m 3 h- 1. The <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> subsurface <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> was placed at a depth of 0. 45 cm from the soil surface. The growth (plant height, leaf area index) and biomass productivity of the crop was measured in periodical samplings throughout the growing period in both years. The results demonstrated a great superiority of the subsurface drip method on growth and total biomass production apparently due to the minimal evaporation losses and the better water distribution in the rooting zone occurring under subsurface irrigation. The crop irrigated with this system reached yields of 38. 6 and 18 t ha- 1, under full (in 2002) and supplemental (in 2001) irrigation, respectively. The respective yields under surface drip irrigation were significantly lower, i. e. 33. 3 t ha– 1 (in 2002) and 12 t ha– 1 (in 2001). Moreover, the obtained results demonstrated the great potentiality of fiber sorghum as alternative commodity for biomass production in Greece, according to the focus of the sustainable, alternative agriculture under both high and low irrigation inputs.

40|$|Background: Water {{management}} {{has become the}} most indispensable factor for augmenting the crop productivity especially on soybean because of their high susceptibility to both water stress and water logging at various growth stages. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the possible effect by <b>automatic</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> based on soil moisture on soybean growth. Methods: The study had three different irrigation methods as sprinkle irrigation (SI), surface drip irrigation (SOl) and fountain irrigation (FI). Sl was laid down in 7 x 7 m interval as square for per irrigation plot, SOl a lateral pipe was laid down to 1. 2 m row spacing with 2. 3 L h- 1 discharge rate, the distance between laterals is 20 cm spacing between drippers and Fl was laid down in 3 m interval as square for per irrigation plot. Soybean (Daewon) cultivar was sown in the June 20 th 2016, planted in 2 rows of apart in 1. 2 m wide rows and distance between hills was 20 cm. Results: This <b>automatic</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> uses valves to turn irrigation easily automated by using controller, solenoids and moisture sensor in adjusting available soil moisture levels 30 % at 10 cm depth. Irrigation application efficiency is obtained by dividing the total water stored in the effective root zone on the applied irrigation water.

Discussions: The most significant advantage of SOl system was that water is supplied near the root zone of the plants drip by drip due to which a large quantity of water was saved 27. 5 % and 95. 6 % compared to Sl, Fl system.

40|$|The {{fate and}} {{transport}} of three herbicides {{commonly used in}} rice production in Japan were compared using two water management practices. The herbicides were simetryn, thiobencarb and mefenacet. The first management practice was an intermittent irrigation scheme using an <b>automatic</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> (AI) with a high drainage gate and the second one was a continuous irrigation and overflow drainage scheme (CI) in experimental paddy fields. Dissipation of the herbicides appeared to follow first order kinetics with the half-lives (DT 50) of 1. 6 - 3. 4 days and the DT 90 (90 % dissipation) of 7. 4 - 9. 8 days. The AI scheme had little drainage even during large rainfall events thus resulting in losses of less than 4 % of each applied herbicide through runoff. Meanwhile the CI scheme resulted in losses of about 37 %, 12 % and 35 % of the applied masses of simetryn, thiobencarb and mefenacet, respectively. The intermittent irrigation scheme using an <b>automatic</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> with a high drainage gate saved irrigation water and prevented herbicide runoff whereas the continuous irrigation and overflow scheme resulted in significant losses of water {{as well as the}} herbicides. Maintaining the excess water storage is important for preventing paddy water runoff during significant rainfall events. The organic carbon partition coefficient K oc seems to be a strong indicator of the aquatic fate of the herbicide as compared to the water solubility (S W). However, further investigations are required to understand the relation between K oc and the agricultural practices upon the pesticide fate and transport. An extension of the water holding period up to 10 days after herbicide application based on the DT 90 from the currently specified period of 3 - 4 days in Japan is recommended to be a good agricultural practice for controlling the herbicide runoff from paddy fields. Also, the best water management practice, which can be recommended for use during the water holding period, is the intermittent irrigation scheme using an <b>automatic</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> with a high drainage gate.

A common practice is to combine wind and pv solar energy is called hybrid renewal source. In our project, we generating power from different renewal source of energy and implemented it in the field of agriculture and as well as to decoration purpose by the means irrigation and fountain pumps. Irrigation pumps used in the agriculture sector account for about 25 % of electricity consumption in India. Our propose <b>irrigation</b> technology is <b>automatic</b> water-saving <b>irrigation</b> technology powered by renewable sources of energy. As the cost of modern <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> is in hike so we also suggest for renewable energy based <b>automatic</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> using new pipelining system. The generated solar power from sun rays, hydro and a new proposed design of wind turbine modules is being used with maximum efficiency. Hydro energy has been taken from daily used waste water and rain water which moves the turbine to generate power after being filtered by membrane type filtration. Along with this, a new proposed wind turbine models is implement for which output comes very efficiently comparable to traditional wind turbine. Also along with all this a new pipe-line system with decreasing crossection area provides best distribution of water in large scale agricultu...|$|R
