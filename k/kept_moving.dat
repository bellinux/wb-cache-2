5|$|The Four Kings {{were very}} popular in Cuba, and the Japanese media were proud of the {{reputation}} they were bringing to judo and Japan. Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan. There was some resistance to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling. In 1913, Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose; in response, they <b>kept</b> <b>moving</b> south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14, 1914.|$|E

I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E

25|$|Constant cavalry {{and naval}} skirmishing {{had been going}} on since March 21. On April 2, Brigadier General Albert Lindley Lee's {{division}} of Union cavalry collided with 1,500 arriving Confederate Texas cavalrymen. These Confederates would continue to resist any Union advance. Union intelligence, meanwhile, had determined that there were additional forces besides Taylor and the cavalry up the road from them. All of the senior Union officers expressed doubts that there would be any serious Confederate opposition, except for the naval flotilla. Banks' army followed Taylor and the cavalry into a dense pine forest area away from the river, probably to keep them in their front. Approaching Pleasant Hill, the Union army was excessively strung out due both to the existence of only a few camping areas with water and the lack of monitoring of the position of the rear elements. Taylor <b>kept</b> <b>moving</b> back toward Shreveport.|$|E

25|$|The narrow, fast-flowing rivers were {{strewn with}} sandbars and shallowly covered rocks. Each year these could change {{position}} dramatically {{during the spring}} thaw when the river was high with meltwater; throughout {{the remainder of the}} season they <b>kept</b> <b>moving,</b> albeit more slowly. These conditions meant that even for a vessel specifically designed for the Yukon navigation was still beset by hazards, and the SS Keno did not escape mishap. On 8 June 1927 she hit a submerged rock on the Yukon River's Big Bend, south of Whitehorse, and sank. She was raised, repaired and re-entered service. In 1933, while working on the Thirtymile River stretch of the Yukon River, the Keno was severely damaged when the barge she was pushing partially ran aground on a bend. The barge dug in, and caused the Keno to swing in the river which brought her stern in contact with the far bank. The consequent impact smashed the Keno paddlewheel and broke off her rudders. Again she was repaired and re-entered service.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{intended}} for {{service in the}} Middle East, Carey and 135 Squadron were diverted to Burma in December. Most of the squadron boarded transport ships on 6 December {{the day before the}} Empire of Japan attack on Pearl Harbor, which started the Pacific War and brought the United States into the conflict. At Free Town, Sierra Leone, Carey boarded a Douglas DC-2 and flew to Takoradi in Ghana with the senior staff, leaving the rest of the squadron to sail on. From there, they flew in a Douglas DC-3 to Khartoum. On the way across Carey flew the aircraft but became the butt of a practical joke when the men <b>kept</b> <b>moving</b> up and down the aircraft to upset its centre of gravity which forced an irritated Carey to keep trimming the elevators. From there a flight in a Short Empire to Cairo was taken in order to report to Air Force Headquarters. Staging through Dubai and Calcutta Carey reached Burma. On 19 December the squadron reached Durban, South Africa and on 24 December set sail for Bombay, India arriving on 6 January 1942. The squadron finally reached Rangoon, Burma on 19 January 1942 {{in the middle of an}} air raid.|$|E
25|$|Following {{even more}} {{training}} in northeastern Dijon, on August 24, the 90th Infantry Division entered a {{sector of the}} front {{on the eastern side}} of the St. Mihiel salient. At the time Pershing, now a full general and Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the AEF on the Western Front, was getting ready for his first major offensive–closing off the salient. Allen's unit was to form the right pivot in the offensive. It started early on September 12 when the offensive began. After a rolling barrage, the division <b>kept</b> <b>moving</b> ahead. Over the next nine hours, Allen's men captured their objectives and by September 16, the Americans had reduced the salient. After the salient was eliminated, Pershing planned for the American forces to attack west at Meuse-Argonne. In the beginning, Allen's unit stayed close to St. Mihiel, covered sectors already left vacate by the troops who went west, and grouped together their positions. Once the battle had become more intense, Allen and his men entered the lines close to Bantheville. The 90th advanced slowly and Allen relieved officers who he found to be incompetent or weak. The division was able to get through the Meuse River near Stenay only several days before the signing of the Armistice of November 11, 1918.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, {{was sent}} to Singapore for jungle {{training}} {{in response to the}} threat of invasion from Indonesian President Sukarno. By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia-Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plamam Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He <b>kept</b> <b>moving</b> around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams' machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a fighting patrol to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base.|$|E

Several other songs were also cut, and Sondheim noted that there were [...] "many changes, additions and deletions..... if you just go along with it, I think you'll have a spectacular time." [...] To create a larger, more cinematic feel, the score was re-orchestrated by the stage musical's original orchestrator, Jonathan Tunick, who increased the orchestra from 27 musicians to 78.|$|E

500|$|Standing [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} , Perry was small {{for a typical}} fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, but rather he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, {{and he had a}} knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. [...] "If you saw a hole, you take it," [...] Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. [...] "If you didn't, you <b>kept</b> <b>moving</b> until you did. You run with instinct." [...] Perry was known for his speed, which earned him the nickname [...] "The Jet". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds.|$|E

[...] Musician and author Peter Lavezzoli described the Byrds in 2007 as [...] "one of the few bands to exert a decisive influence on the Beatles", while also noting that they helped to persuade Bob Dylan to begin recording with electric instrumentation.
