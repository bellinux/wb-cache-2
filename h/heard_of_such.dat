5|$|Spirits {{were high}} during the unit's brief {{training}} period {{as the men}} enjoyed playing sports, observing the country scenery and experiencing the night-life of the nearby capital. They were not adequately trained, receiving only a basic medical examination, a few days' fitness training and a cursory explanation of proper conduct in the bush. They expressed surprise when instructed to paint stripes of camouflage green on their weapons and combat boots in the Rhodesian fashion, having never before <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a practice.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, 16 August {{after an}} {{inflammatory}} sermon, a demonstration {{organized by the}} Supreme Muslim Council marched to the Wall. The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed {{him that he had}} never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a demonstration being held at the Wailing Wall, {{and that it would be}} a terrible shock to the Jews who regarded the Wall as a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E
25|$|In paper 5, {{candidates}} {{were required to}} listen to a recording and do various tasks, but both the recording and the data file were criticised. A Halloween advertisement was included in the recording, and some candidates afterward said that they felt uneasy or thought the radio channel was switched. In the data file, Chinese slang terms were discussed in an extract from a newspaper article and in a poster promoting reading. Some teachers and students criticised the materials for promoting slang terms, some students said that they had not <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> terms and others said that the HKEAA had misconceptions about the use of the slang terms. The Authority responded that, as is the norm, some of the materials provided were deliberately false or worthless to promote critical thinking and choice-taking by students.|$|E

500|$|According to Elisabeth Dhanens, {{the shape}} and rounded top of the {{original}} frame is reminiscent of those found on the top register of panels of the Ghent altarpiece, which are accepted as designed by Jan's brother Hubert. [...] She believes the current frame is too narrow and small, and contains [...] "clumsy marbling". From a detailed 1851 inventory, we know {{the text of the}} hymn inscribed on original frame. The text is written in a poetic form and begun on the lower border and then extended upwards on the vertical borders, ending on the top border. The lower border of the frame read FLOS FLORIOLORUM APPELLARIS; the sides and top MATER HEC EST FILIA PATER EST NATUS QUIS AUDIVIT TALIA DEUS HOMO NATUS ETCET ("The mother is the daughter. This father is born. Who has <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a thing? God born a man"). The fifth stanza of the hymn (not included in van Eyck's transcription) reads, [...] "As the sunbeam through the glass. Passeth but not staineth. Thus, the Virgin, as she was. Virgin still remaineth." [...] The lettering on the hem of her robe echoes the inscription on the frame, words similar to those found on Mary's dress in van Eyck's 1436 Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele, a passage from the Book of Wisdom (7:29) reading EST ENIM HAEC SPECIOSIOR SOLE ET SUPER OMNEM STELLARUM DISPOSITIONEM. LUCI CONPARATA INVENITUR PRIOR ("For she is more beautiful than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she is found to be superior").|$|E

2500|$|A {{portion of}} the highway near {{downtown}} Kansas City, Missouri was closed on May 20, 1997, in order to film the music video for the U2 song [...] "Last Night on Earth". The band reimbursed the Kansas City Police Department for all traffic control and security costs. A permit issued by the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (the predecessor to MoDOT) stated the closure [...] "will enhance and promote the notoriety of...Kansas City's skyline." [...] Mike Right, vice-president of public affairs for the American Automobile Association Auto Club of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star [...] "I can't believe the stupidity of it. They're going to close down an interstate highway that serves downtown Kansas City for a...music video? I've never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three centuries later, the English scholar Edward Jenks {{suggested}} that a chart {{said to have been}} created in 1542 and later held by the British Museum may have been Le Testu's source for Jave la Grande. Le Testu's Cosmographie Universelle (1555) and world atlas (1556) are both in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. [...] The map, said Jenks, was said to have been “the property of a man named Rotz, a French sailor who passed some part of his life in England”. [...] Jenks commented: “this fact gives some colour to the claim put forward by the French, that their countryman, Guillaume le Testu, was [...] the true discoverer of Australia. The claim is based mainly upon the fact that Testu’s name appears on a map dated 1555, on which a southern continent, styled Jave la Grande (“Great Java”), is outlined. But this fact, of course, merely proves that Testu had <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> a country..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conservative geologists in Britain welcomed Cuvier's {{theory to}} replace Werner's Neptunism, and the Church of England clergyman William Buckland became the {{foremost}} proponent of Flood geology as {{he sought to}} get the new science of geology accepted on the curriculum of the University of Oxford. In 1818 he was visited by Cuvier, and in his inaugural speech in 1819 as the first professor of geology at the university he defended the subject against allegations that it undermined religion. His speech, published as Vindiciae Geologicae; or, The Connexion of Geology with Religion Explained, equated {{the last of a}} long series of catastrophes with the Genesis Flood, and said that [...] "the grand fact of an universal deluge at no very remote period is proved on grounds so decisive and incontrovertible, that, had we never <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> an event from Scripture, or any other, authority, Geology of itself must have called in the assistance of some such catastrophe, to explain the phenomena of diluvian action which are universally presented to us, and which are unintelligible without recourse to a deluge exerting its ravages at a period not more ancient than that announced in the Book of Genesis." [...] The evidence he proposed included erratic boulders, extensive areas of gravel, and landforms which appeared to have been scoured by water.|$|E
