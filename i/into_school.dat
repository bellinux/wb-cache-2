In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back <b>into</b> <b>school</b> hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A {{literature}} review was undertaken to determine (a) what {{is currently being}} done to bring out-of-school children <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> and retain them there; (b) what has succeeded in bringing out-of-school children <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> and retaining them;and (c) {{what is being done}} to bring out-of-school children with disabilities <b>into</b> <b>schools?</b> Methods: Various databases were searched to identify relevant articles for the review. Only articles published after the year 2000 were included in the analysis. Results: A total of 23 articles were reviewed. The review identified economical, socio-cultural and school-related variables that contribute to children being excluded from schooling. Various strategies that have worked to bring out-of-school children <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> include alternative education, rebates and incentives, and community awareness programmes. Conclusions and Implications: The review found that there is insufficient research on out-of-school children with disabilities. However, research on the population of children without disabilities has implications that can be relevant to children with disabilities. Key words: children with disability, educatio...|$|R

25|$|In the US, trampolining {{was quickly}} {{introduced}} <b>into</b> <b>school</b> {{physical education programs}} and was also used in private entertainment centers. However, following a number of injuries and lawsuits caused by insufficient supervision and inadequate training, trampolining is now mostly conducted in specialist gyms with certified trainers. This has caused a large {{reduction in the number}} of competitive athletes in the United States and a consequent decline from the earlier American prominence in the sport. Elsewhere in the world the sport was most strongly adopted in Europe and the former Soviet Union. Since trampolining became an Olympic sport in 2000, many more countries have started developing programs and China's program developed World Champion athletes in less than a decade.|$|E

25|$|One {{major source}} of {{controversy}} {{in the realm of}} sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated <b>into</b> <b>school</b> curricula. LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to homosexuality. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that {{they were more likely to}} hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.|$|E
