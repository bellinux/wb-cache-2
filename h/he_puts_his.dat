Underwater the curved mask windows make the diver's vision effectively more hyperopic, or less myopic, and the diver must wear special contact lenses to compensate (unless his eyes are myopic to the right amount to compensate exactly for the refraction at the curved mask windows). The diver's vision will become myopic when <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> head out of water with the contact lenses in.|$|E

500|$|During the season, Geelong coach Chris Scott praised Selwood as [...] "probably {{the toughest}} player I've ever seen...he gets {{hit in the}} head a lot...he just sees the ball and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> head down and he goes as hard as anyone {{possibly}} could". Despite Selwood's individual efforts, the Cats finished with a 15-7 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} season to finish sixth on the ladder. This represented the first time in Selwood's career that the club had not qualified with a double chance for the finals series, setting them up for an Elimination Final match against Fremantle. Despite Selwood's contribution of a game-high 28 disposals and team-high six inside-50s, the Cats were defeated by 16points and exited the finals series—the first time that the club had failed to progress beyond the first week since Selwood had begun his career.|$|E

Later, Finn is also reinstated as quarterback, but it occurs because his replacement Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is injured during a game, dislocating his shoulder. Finn feels responsible and confesses his guilt to Emma, who tells him it is unlikely God is communicating specifically with him through a grilled cheese sandwich.

500|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{wrote that}} the album [...] "feels more like a band record than {{anything}} [...] done in decades". He praises Clarke's choice in bandmates, calling them [...] "prodigies in their own right" [...] but does not praise the whole album. He called [...] "Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu's Report" [...] a [...] "clumsy, failed attempt at summing up the music's history to date" [...] and that [...] "Bass Folk Song No. 6" [...] does not [...] "work [...] well" [...] {{as some of the}} other tracks but [...] "these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording". Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there [...] "are no radical departures" [...] on this album and it sounds as if Clarke is [...] "taking a victory lap here, revisiting past triumphs" [...] but that he [...] "still pull sounds out of his assortment of electric, acoustic and Alembic basses like nobody else, and [...] still slapping, plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary, fusion jazz, rock, funk and whatever else <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> mind to".|$|E

500|$|Writing for Popular Culture in Counseling, Psychotherapy, and Play-Based Interventions, Lawrence Rubin {{states that}} while Naruto has an optimistic and hyperactive personality, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox (Kurama) within his body symbolizes his {{negative}} emotions. He comments that Naruto has a [...] attitude {{when dealing with}} intense conflicts and emotions. He also states that Naruto would use Kurama's chakra for battles he can not handle with his own chakra. Rubin further notes that the more Naruto uses Kurama's chakra, the more <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> comrades and himself in danger. Rubin feels the reason Naruto is a troublemaker is because some villagers avoid him and others mistreat him. He states that children {{growing up in the}} real world who have development issues can relate to his character. Rubin states that the search for acceptance, and being acknowledged by his peers is what motivates Naruto to keep going until he reaches his life's goal, becoming the Hokage. Rubin feels that Naruto's fights with enemies who try to bring harm to the Leaf Village further motivate him to become a powerful shinobi, and a [...] "complete and mature person". Rubin concludes that Naruto's character development {{is similar to that of}} a modern American hero, the type who accidentally becomes better during a series and is able to build or restore peace.|$|E
