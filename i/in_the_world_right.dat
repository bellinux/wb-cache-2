I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things going on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around.

[...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park.

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States, California Chrome was turned out for a month at Taylor Made Farm, then resumed {{training}} with Sherman. On July 23, the horse was entered in the San Diego Handicap where he faced Dortmund, who had finished third in the 2015 Kentucky Derby to American Pharoah. California Chrome tracked behind Dortmund until the far turn, then moved to the front. Dortmund fought back and the two dueled down the stretch, with California Chrome prevailing by half a length while carrying five pounds more than Dortmund. [...] A month later, California Chrome challenged an all-star field in the Pacific Classic, which included a rematch with Dortmund as well as long-time rival Hoppertunity. [...] Most notably, Chrome met the champion mare Beholder for the first time. Beholder, third favorite on the morning line, had won the previous year in her debut against male horses, the only female horse to have ever won that race. California Chrome got the number one post position in the nine-horse field, viewed as an unfavorable draw because, other than his prep race win at Meydan Racecourse, he previously did poorly on the rail. [...] The post position {{turned out not to be}} a problem, as the horse broke cleanly and quickly went to the lead, led throughout the entire race, and only Beholder kept close to him until the mile pole, at which point he pulled ahead of the field and won by five lengths. [...] Espinoza kept a relatively firm hold on the horse throughout the race, and Beholder's rider, Gary Stevens, commented, [...] "Victor was playing with us. I don't think he really let him run. That's scary to think about." [...] In similar form, he again was challenged by Dortmund in the Awesome Again Stakes on October 1. [...] The two horses at one point outdistanced the rest of the field by 12 lengths, but California Chrome led throughout and won by [...] lengths. [...] Art Sherman commented, [...] "You're looking at maybe the best horse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's going on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> now". Likewise, {{he notes that the}} album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so {{this is one of the}} main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's going on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E

Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>right</b> now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because {{you feel like a}} veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models.
