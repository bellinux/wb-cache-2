2500|$|A {{significant}} part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>leadership</b> model, which is also covered in The Life-Giving Church. Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in [...] "cumbersome systems" [...] in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its [...] "brightest and best future leaders". Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even {{to the point of}} disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard's book, Primary Purpose, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This [...] "Philippians 2 Attitude" [...] comes from the scripture that states, [...] "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others." [...] "I took a free-market approach to that and just wanted to empower people to minister whatever was in their hearts." [...] Some of the best-known results of this model are the Mill, the Desperation Band and Desperation interns, the Furnace and World Prayer Center, 24/7 leadership training and New Life Groups, a unique brand of free-market small groups as well as many others. As an example of his coaching of young leaders, John Bolin, in the book Confident Parents, Exceptional Teens that he co-wrote with Haggard, says [...] " [...] talked about communicating with people by improving my posture, poise, and delivery. He painstakingly coached me to stand up tall, to speak with confidence, to look people in the eye, and to articulate with concise clarity... he knew I wouldn't be effective... unless I understood the principle of communication and connection by presenting myself well".|$|E

The first part focus on the main aspects of the changes that have affected the Brazilian productive structure, especially the volume of transactions that changed the relative weight of foreign investments compared to the domestic capital. Another structural aspect is enhanced in the second part, which is the reconfiguration of the structure of representation of interests, which started to operate predominantly in a way of voluntary enrolment and the operation of selective incentives. Finally, the third part concentrates on proposals about the so-called alternative ways of development by the <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>leaderships</b> and the formation of possible coalitions able of sustaining different strategies...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and performance, this paper conducted a major review of published work on the entrepreneurial process with a focus on small businesses. Following the review, it became evident that even though the extant literature indicated that both entrepreneurial orientation and transformational leadership influenced firm performance, there was limited literature examining how these two important organisational variables related to each other, and how they interacted to influence firm performance within the context of small businesses. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the extant literature on <b>entrepreneurial</b> orientation, transformational <b>leadership</b> and firm performance and then build a logical framework depicting the interrelationships between transformational <b>leadership,</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> orientation and organisational effectiveness within the context of small businesses. Specifically, we advance a conceptual research framework, which explicates some pathways through which leader behaviours influence the firm entrepreneurial orientation and overall firm effectiveness.
