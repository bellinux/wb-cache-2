5|$|Al-Maʿarri is {{controversial}} even today {{as he was}} sceptical of Islam, the dominant religion of the Arab World. In 2013, almost a thousand years after his death, the al-Nusra Front, a branch of al-Qaeda, beheaded a statue of Al-Maʿarri {{during the civil war}} in Syria. The statue had been crafted by the sculptor Fathi Muhammad. The motive behind the beheading is disputed; theories range from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a heretic to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is believed by some {{to be related to the}} Assad family.|$|E
5|$|As 2015 began, Ruf {{once again}} {{had to fight}} for playing time; there was no clear opening {{for him on the}} Phillies' roster, {{notwithstanding}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was one of the few}} players on the roster with the ability to hit for power.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{had decided}} to speak to Woodward despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{declined}} Woodward's requests for his previous book State of Denial. The New Republic has also stated that General David H. Petraeus provided off the record information for the writing.|$|E

5|$|Despite his aristocratic birth, Ramarayaningar {{was known}} for his egalitarian views. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{regarded}} as a communalist and anti-Brahmin, he nominated a Brahmin, T. Sadasiva Iyer as the Commissioner of the Hindu Religious Endowment Board.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Rodriguez's firing, Michigan {{also saw the}} departure of QB Tate Forcier. Forcier cited the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt no longer wanted {{as a reason for}} his departure from the school.|$|E
5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not wanted on stage.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps he's wise. Still, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> {{putting up}} a big new orchard-house has some significance. I {{understand}} from Stephen <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been speculating largely in rubber shares. It's a risky game." ...|$|R

5|$|Pericles {{marked a}} whole era and {{inspired}} conflicting judgments about his significant decisions. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was at the}} same time a vigorous statesman, general and orator makes more complex the objective assessment of his actions.|$|E
5|$|Scott Michael Campbell as Billy Budget: WBN page boy who {{is used by}} Roger to {{communicate}} with Penny and send scripts, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is trying {{to hide from the}} police.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet was {{familiar}} with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, Lafayette was an {{exponent}} of {{the ideals}} of the Age of Enlightenment, especially on human rights and civic nationalism. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> spent most of his political career in opposition, his views were taken very seriously by intellectuals and others {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was able to}} recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, {{as well as the}} remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men. American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was a friend}} of King Philip IV of France and of King Charles II of Naples, but these are inferences, not documented <b>facts.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> owed his promotion to these monarchs is likewise unattested.|$|R
50|$|In October 2009, Stockholm District Court {{ordered that}} Svartholm {{be banned from}} {{operating}} the Pirate Bay, despite the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was no longer living in Sweden, and the Pirate Bay was no longer located there.|$|R

5|$|Bruce was {{dismissed}} as manager on 30 November 2011, with Sunderland in 16th position following a poor run of form which culminated with a 2–1 home defeat to bottom club Wigan four days earlier. He later linked his dismissal from the managerial post with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is a fan}} of Newcastle United, Sunderland's bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|Donal {{meanwhile}} {{turns to}} alcohol, devastated at the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has brought about}} a god who, according to Donal's religion, should not even exist. However, Reed's analysis leads him {{to believe that the}} final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to turn into the Viking god once more.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{announced that it was}} his farewell international tour, the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were broken. The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, and stands to this day.|$|E
50|$|Consciousness of the source: During {{the process}} of revelation, the Prophet has a clear {{consciousness}} of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> being enlightened by an external transcendent source, just as a schoolchild is aware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is being taught by a human teacher.|$|R
5000|$|His parents searched vainly for him {{in field}} {{hospitals}} and interviewed comrades to try to identify what had happened. A notice was published in The Times on 7 October 1915 confirming the known <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "wounded and missing".|$|R
6000|$|... "Writers and orators {{have lied}} so long about 'the idyllic' in farm life, and said {{so much about}} the 'independent American farmer,' <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself has {{remained}} blind to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> one of the hardest-working and poorest-paid men in America. See the houses they live in,--hovels." ...|$|R
5|$|Forster {{earned his}} first {{professional}} contract with Newcastle United, signing for their Academy in 2005. Forster was Newcastle's third choice goalkeeper in the 2007–08 season while Tim Krul was on loan at Falkirk, and played {{regularly in the}} reserves. However, in the six years he was signed to the club, Fraser never made a first-team appearance for Newcastle, mainly due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{spent most of his}} time on loan to other clubs, often lasting entire seasons.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{enjoyed a}} good season in 2000–01 as they {{finished}} third in the league and reached the 2001 Scottish Cup Final, which was lost 3–0 to Celtic. Manager Alex McLeish departed for Rangers in December 2001; team captain Franck Sauzée was appointed as the new manager, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no previous coaching experience. A terrible run of form followed and Sauzée was fired after being in charge for 69 days.|$|E
5|$|His {{appearance}} in the final was remarkable for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the top scorer of the day with five points, despite having suffered an ankle injury in the previous match, and was not expected (or advised) to play. He started the final and was taken off before half time. During the break, and even some way into the second half, he was receiving treatment to his ankle, including pain-killing injections.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about his {{background}} except <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a descendant of the 11th-century general Nyaung-U Hpi. But the <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was married to a}} daughter of King Kyaswa and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became the chief minister show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hailed from a (distant) branch of the royal family. He was born c. 1198/99.|$|R
50|$|Plimpton {{attempts}} {{at first to}} disguise the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a total amateur, but soon Lions players can see the truth for themselves. He is unwelcome to some who resent the intrusion, but a star player, Alex Karras, intervenes on his behalf.|$|R
