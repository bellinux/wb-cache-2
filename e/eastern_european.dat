5|$|The first IMO {{was held}} in Romania in 1959. Since then it has been held every year except in 1980. That year, it was {{cancelled}} due to internal strife in Mongolia. It was initially founded for <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> member countries of the Warsaw Pact, under the Soviet bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well. Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in <b>eastern</b> <b>European</b> countries, and gradually spread to other nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in Romania in 1959. The oldest of the International Science Olympiads, the IMO has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the {{competition}} initially planned to hold in Mongolia was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Because the competition was initially founded for <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> countries participating in the Warsaw Pact, {{under the influence of}} the Eastern Bloc, the earlier IMOs were hosted only in <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> countries, gradually spreading to other nations. Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, the {{collapse}} of the USSR in Eastern Europe gave many new countries the opportunity to compete. Three countriesâ€”Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all of them former Yugoslav republics, won through from a pre-qualifier to compete. After the 1993 event, a relegation system was introduced, allowing even more <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> countries to compete: seven more made their debut in 1994.|$|E

This included 154,000 Poles, around 40,000 Ukrainians and smaller numbers of Russians. These immigrants were searching for better opportunities - a few thousand Belarusians were also among them. Slavs from other regions migrated as well, here mainly South Slavs like Bulgarians and Croats, but also Czechs and Slovaks, with moderate numbers of Slovenes and others. Hungarians and Romanians were among the non-Slavic <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europeans</b> and were the biggest groups after the Poles, Russians and Ukrainians.|$|R

5|$|Because <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, director of the Program of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E

Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E

She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E
