25|$|Most research, such as {{studies done}} by UNICEF, {{suggests}} that boys {{are much more}} likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. In Albania, where <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{where the}} {{kidnapping}} and <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun. Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children whose families believe have been abducted {{for the purpose}} of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.|$|E

25|$|The {{conditions}} in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality. Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside. Furthermore, many of the gangs which run networks of <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts {{in order for them}} to become further reliant on their exploiters.|$|E
25|$|In China, the Ministry of Public Security has {{established}} a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of <b>forced</b> <b>begging,</b> which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are {{those responsible for the}} child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Bank <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> is most {{commonly}} found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent. In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which does little to combat the issue.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{cultural}} factors that support begging. In Europe begging {{is found in}} a number of minority cultures, especially popular within Roma and nomadic communities. In Turkey familial networks of beggars have been documented across three generations, making it deeply ingrained within their survival schemas. It {{is important to note that}} while these may be culturally rooted practices, juvenile begging by way of familial pressure still falls under the realm of <b>forced</b> <b>begging.</b> The transport of children, even one's own, for the purposes of exploitation through begging is a form of trafficking outlined by the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|While {{concrete}} {{figures are}} difficult to determine, the International Labour Organization (ILO) recently reported that {{there are at least}} 600,000 children involved in <b>forced</b> <b>begging.</b> The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging. Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by Human Rights Watch projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging. Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though {{there is no way of}} knowing whether it was through forced means.|$|E
25|$|<b>Forced</b> <b>begging</b> is a {{profitable}} practice in which exploiters {{are motivated by}} economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked {{for the purpose of}} begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.|$|E

He sent word to the waiting Swedish <b>force</b> <b>begging</b> them to retreat upon meeting, but Mardefelt, having been unaware of the treaty, interpreted the plea as a trick of battle.

The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking. The film asserts that most victims of human trafficking are children. Actress Lucy Liu said that people who watch Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America." [...] Lucy Popescu of CineVue criticized the film for focusing on the victims, arguing that the perpetrators of trafficking should have been dealt with more prominently. Not My Life was named Best World Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in September 2012.|$|E
500|$|Not My Life is a {{documentary}} film about human trafficking and contemporary slavery. It addresses {{many forms of}} slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, unfree labor in Ghana, <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, {{and other kinds of}} child abuse. The focus of the film is on trafficking victims, especially women and children, the latter of whom are often betrayed by adults that they trust. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking, including members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Free the Slaves, Girls Educational and Mentoring Services (GEMS), International Justice Mission (IJM), the Somaly Mam Foundation, Terre des hommes, Tostan, UNICEF, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the United States Department of State (US DoS).

2500|$|Forced child begging {{is a type}} of begging {{in which}} boys and girls under the age of {{eighteen}} are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion. Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as [...] "the activity of asking for money as charity on the street". There is evidence to suggest that <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent UNICEF study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of <b>forced</b> <b>begging.</b> The United Nations protocol affirms that [...] "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article." [...] With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member. The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the European Union, the International Labour Organization (ILO), and the United Nations, among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence. [...] The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating [...] "trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent and worrying phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude." [...] This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.|$|E
2500|$|Many NGOs have {{initiated}} movements {{focusing on}} {{informing the public}} {{on the dangers of}} donations.

Their initiatives are focused on educating passersby on the <b>forced</b> <b>begging</b> of trafficked Cambodians within their country to decrease the likelihood of donations.|$|E
