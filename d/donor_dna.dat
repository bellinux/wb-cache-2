5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and recombine <b>donor</b> <b>DNA</b> into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E
25|$|In prokaryotes, natural {{bacterial}} transformation involves {{the transfer of}} DNA from one bacterium to another and integration of the <b>donor</b> <b>DNA</b> into the recipient chromosome by recombination. Natural {{bacterial transformation}} {{is considered to be}} a primitive sexual process and occurs in both bacteria and archaea, although it has been studied mainly in bacteria. Transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation and not an accidental occurrence, because it depends on numerous gene products that specifically interact with each other to enter a state of natural competence to perform this complex process. Transformation is a common mode of DNA transfer among prokaryotes.|$|E
25|$|Scarless Cas9 Assisted Recombineering (no-SCAR) is an editing {{method that}} {{is able to}} {{manipulate}} the Escherichia coli (E. coli) genome. The system relies on recombineering whereby DNA sequences are combined and manipulated through homologous recombination. No-SCAR is able to manipulate the E. coli genome {{without the use of}} the chromosomal markers detailed in previous recombineering methods. Instead, in this method, the λ-Red recombination system facilitates <b>donor</b> <b>DNA</b> integration while Cas9 cleaves double-stranded DNA to counter-select against wild-type cells. Although λ-Red and Cas9 genome editing are widely used technologies, the no-SCAR method is novel in combining the two functions; this technique is able to establish point mutations, gene deletions, and short sequence insertions in several genomic loci with increased efficiency and time sensitivity.|$|E

[...] Homologous recombination requires incoming DNA to be highly similar to the recipient genome, and so horizontal gene transfer is usually limited to similar bacteria. [...] Studies in several species of bacteria have established that there is a log-linear decrease in recombination frequency with increasing difference in sequence between host and recipient DNA.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} nature of {{fluoride}} resistance in Streptococcus mutans, we transformed DNA extracted from fluoride-resistant mutants of S. mutans GS- 5 into fluoride-sensitive cells of the same strain. Transformation with DNA from first-step mutants produced transformants with resistance to either 600 or 1, 000 micrograms of sodium fluoride per ml, {{both of which are}} within the first-step resistance range (400 to 1, 000 micrograms/ml).

However, their actions as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are both beneficial and deleterious. We analyzed the effect of glucocorticoids on the gene expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy <b>donors.</b> <b>DNA</b> microarray analysis combined with quantitative TaqMan PCR and flow cytometry revealed that glucocorticoids induced the expression of chemokine, cytokine, and complement family members as well as of newly discovered innate immune-related genes, including scavenger and Toll-like receptors.

Simultaneous inhibitory and stimulatory effects of glucocorticoids were found on inflammatory T helper subsets and apoptosis-related gene clusters. In cells activated by T cell receptor cross-linking, glucocorticoids down-regulated the expression of specific genes that were previously up-regulated in resting cells, suggesting a potential new mechanism by which they exert positive and negative effects.
