50|$|Physical vapor {{deposition}} {{takes place}} in a vacuum and produces a thin film of solar cells by depositing thin layers of metals onto a backing structure. <b>Electron-beam</b> <b>evaporation</b> uses thermionics emission to create a stream of electrons that are accelerated by a high-voltage cathode and anode arrangement. Electrostatic and magnetic fields focus and direct the electrons to strike a target. The kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy at or near the surface of the material. The resulting heating causes the material to melt and then evaporate. Temperatures in excess of 3500 degrees Celsius can be reached. The vapor from the source condenses onto a substrate, creating a thin film of high-purity material. Film thicknesses from a single atomic layer to many micrometers can be achieved. This technique is used in microelectronics, optics, and material research, and to produce solar cells and many other products.|$|E

Poly-Si films formed have micrometer-order-long grains stretched along a lateral crystallization direction, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron diffraction pattern measurements reveal that grains in poly-Si films tend to have a particular orientation.

40|$|AbstractPolycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films {{have the}} {{potential}} to overcome the limits of today's silicon thin-film solar cell technology because of the chance to grow high-quality material by low-cost deposition techniques. As poly-Si thin-film fabrication is independent of rather slow and costly PECVD processes, it is possible to switch to physical high-rate deposition methods such as <b>electron-beam</b> (e-beam) <b>evaporation</b> exhibiting a strong cost-saving potential. In this contribution, the challenges and opportunities of two different poly-Si solar cell preparation techniques using e-beam evaporated silicon are investigated: Thermal solid phase crystallization (SPC) of initially amorphous silicon layers, and direct growth of poly-Si films at elevated temperatures > 500 °C. For both approaches, attention is given to the interplay between substrate texture, structure of the grown silicon and the final solar cell performance. Poly-Si thin film solar cells with 7. 8 % conversion efficiency were prepared on a smooth substrate in cooperation with CSG solar, demonstrating the equality of e-beam evaporation as deposition technique compared to PECVD. However since e-beam evaporation leads to a non-conformal deposition of rough surfaces, the implementation of a textured substrate for light trapping is highly desired but still challenging. A different behavior is observed for poly-Si thin films directly grown at higher temperatures. For the best photovoltaic performance, a certain substrate microstructure is even necessary and can be optimized by the use of glass coated by differently textured ZnO films as substrate...|$|R
40|$|For ambient {{radio-frequency}} (RF) energy harvesting, {{the available}} power levels are quite low, {{and it is}} highly desirable that the rectifying diodes do not consume any power at all. Contrary to semiconducting diodes, a tunnelling diode – {{also known as a}} metal-insulator-metal (MIM) diode – can provide zero-bias rectification, provided the two metals have different work functions. This could result in a complete passive rectenna system. Despite great potential, MIM diodes have not been investigated much in the GHz-frequency regime due to challenging nano-fabrication requirements. In this work, we investigate zero-bias MIM diodes for RF energy-harvesting applications. We studied the surface roughness issue for the bottom metal of the MIM diode for various deposition techniques such as sputtering, atomic layer deposition (ALD) and <b>electron-beam</b> (e-beam) <b>evaporation</b> for crystalline metals as well as for an amorphous alloy, namely ZrCuAlNi. A surface roughness of sub- 1 nm has been achieved for both the crystalline metals as well as the amorphous alloy, which is vital for the reliable operation of the MIM diode. An MIM diode comprising of a Ti-ZnO-Pt combination yields a zero-bias responsivity of 0. 25 V− 1 and a dynamic resistance of 1200 Ω. Complete RF characterisation has been performed by integrating the MIM diode with a coplanar waveguide transmission line. The input impedance varies from 100 Ω to 50 Ω in the frequency range of between 2 GHz and 10 GHz, which can be easily matched to typical antenna impedances in this frequency range. Finally, a rectified DC voltage of 4. 7 mV is obtained for an incoming RF power of 0. 4 W at zero bias.
