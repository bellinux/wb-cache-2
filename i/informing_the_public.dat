5|$|The {{process of}} issuing a {{convective}} watch {{begins with a}} conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. If after collaboration a watch is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue a watch approximation product which {{is followed by the}} local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> of the meaning behind the watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E

25|$|The {{new style}} of sermons {{and the way}} people practiced their faith breathed new life into {{religion}} in America. People became passionately and emotionally involved in their religion, rather than passively listening to intellectual discourse in a detached manner. People began to study the Bible at home, which effectively decentralized the means of <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> on religious matters and was akin to the individualistic trends present in Europe during the Protestant Reformation.|$|E

25|$|United States Senator Peter Fitzgerald {{chose not}} to run for reelection in 2004, leaving Patrick Fitzgerald without a congressional patron. In the summer of 2005, there were rumors {{that he would not}} be reappointed to a second {{four-year}} term in retaliation for his investigations into corruption in Illinois and Chicago government, as well as for his investigation of the Plame scandal. On May 23, 2012, Fitzgerald held a press conference <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that he was stepping down from his position and retiring as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois Federal Court effective June 30, 2012.

25|$|In the 1972 federal {{election}} campaign, the NDP finally made a breakthrough, winning 31 {{seats in the}} House of Commons, including one for John Harney, and holding the balance of power. However, within two years, the party faced a setback when it won only 16 seats in the 1974 {{federal election}}. Lewis, Howard, and Harney lost their seats and ended their federal careers as active politicians. Lewis resigned, finally <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{that he had been}} fighting cancer for the past two years. Broadbent, became the leader in the House of Commons until a new leader was elected. In the end, the real winner of 1971 convention was Ed Broadbent. Although he was unsuccessful for his run at the leadership in 1971, it was a prelude to his winning the leadership at the next convention, and without the internecine divisiveness that the Waffle introduced at this convention.|$|E

By 1982 they had a budget of $1 million and millions of volunteers. Around the same time, gay men were being stricken with AIDS, desperate for money for research and services. Spokesmen for the Moral Majority connected it to God's will, asserting the general public needed protection from [...] "the gay plague", and warned, [...] "If homosexuals are not stopped they will infect the entire nation and America will be destroyed." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1950, the Atomic Energy Commission asked Scientific American not {{to publish}} an article by Hans Bethe that it claimed {{revealed}} classified information about the hydrogen bomb. Scientific American reluctantly agreed to stop the presses and make changes in the article, and to recall and burn the 3,000 copies {{that had already been}} printed. The 1951 arrest of Klaus Fuchs, Harry Gold, David Greenglass, Morton Sobell and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who, according to Hoover, [...] "stole the basic secrets of nuclear fission", caused great concern. President Dwight D. Eisenhower denied the Rosenbergs clemency on the grounds that their actions [...] "could well result in the deaths of many, many thousands of innocent citizens", and they were executed. After the Soviet Union detonated Joe 4 in August 1953, newspapers proclaimed that the Soviets had tested a hydrogen bomb. In fact it was only a boosted fission device, but the veil of secrecy covering the thermonuclear program prevented scientists from <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{changes at}} the Norris Geyser Basin {{resulted}} in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin. New fumaroles were observed, and several geysers showed enhanced activity and increasing water temperatures. Several geysers became so hot that they were transformed into purely steaming features; the water had become superheated and {{they could no longer}} erupt normally. This coincided with the release of reports of a multiple year United States Geological Survey research project which mapped the bottom of Yellowstone Lake and identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in the past. Research indicated that these uplifts posed no immediate threat of a volcanic eruption, since they may have developed long ago, and there had been no temperature increase found near the uplifts. On March 10, 2004, a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion. This was closely followed by an upsurge of earthquake activity in April 2004. In 2006, it was reported that the Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome— areas that have long been known to show significant changes in their ground movement— had risen at a rate of [...] per year from mid–2004 through 2006. As of late 2007, the uplift has continued at a reduced rate. These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region. Experts responded to the conjecture by <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> that there was no increased risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future. However, these changes demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Yellowstone hydrothermal system.|$|E
500|$|On February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel {{his first}} {{interview}} on Scientology on the ABC News program Nightline. The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar {{appeared on the}} program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's [...] "ulterior motive" [...] is really {{to get people to}} take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the Time magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in USA Today. Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the Time article, {{and the rest of the}} twelve-week campaign was dedicated to <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the Time article, and Miscavige called Behar [...] "a hater". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the Time piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to [...] "kidnap Scientologists out". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was [...] "missing the issue", and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.|$|E
