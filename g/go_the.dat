5|$|The {{game was}} played on 18 November on an icy pitch (straw had not been spread over the pitch the night before), which nearly caused the game to be cancelled. The All Blacks kicked off, and had {{the best of the}} first ten minutes. Scotland {{eventually}} got a scrum near the All Blacks goal-line, and after winning the scrum, passed to Ernest Simson, who dropped a goal to put Scotland ahead 4–0. It {{was the first time the}} All Blacks had been behind on tour. The All Blacks replied with a try under the posts, which was unconverted. A second try was then scored, by Smith; again it went unconverted. Scotland then scored an unconverted try, to lead at half time 7–6. With less than ten minutes to <b>go</b> <b>the</b> score remained 7–6 and it looked like the All Blacks might lose their first match on tour. However, with four minutes to <b>go</b> <b>the</b> All Blacks had a scrum on halfway; the resulting movement finished with George Smith crossing for a try. Bill Cunningham then scored a try with seconds remaining, and the All Blacks were victorious 12–7.|$|E

5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara Croft Go, {{a successor}} to Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It was released on 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara Croft around a level composed of nodes and lines. While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman <b>Go,</b> <b>the</b> developers did not want Lara Croft Go {{to feel like a}} re-skin, so an emphasis has been placed on the puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E

5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can <b>go</b> <b>the</b> entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E
5|$|By July Dyer {{was back}} in Britain and was fit enough to {{re-enter}} the ring, stopping Nicol Brady via technical knockout in a contest in Wallsend. He followed this with a points decision over Jack Zimmer and then won through Will Brooks' disqualification in a contest held in Cardiff. In November 1920 Dyer was invited to the National Sporting Club in London to face 'Bermondsey' Billy Wells. During the bout the referee twice instructed both men to make a proper contest of the fight. The referee let the match <b>go</b> <b>the</b> full fifteen rounds and then, instead of declaring a winner, he called the fight a 'no contest', with the fighters' purse being given to charity. After the National Sporting Club debacle, Dyer turned {{more and more to}} his singing and very few fights are recorded after 1920. A fight against Jim Slater in January 1922 is believed to be his last bout.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the winning run in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not <b>go</b> <b>the</b> distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E

5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him <b>go.</b> <b>The</b> support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E

5|$|In December 1872, Colonel George Crook used Apache scouts {{to find a}} cave in Salt River Canyon {{that was}} being used by Guwevkabaya to mount attacks on White settlers. On December 28, {{accompanied}} by 100 Pima scouts, Captain William Brown led 120 of Crook's men to a siege of the cave. 110 Kwevkepaya were trapped in the cave, when Brown ordered the soldiers to fire at {{the roof of the}} cave, causing rock fragments and lead shrapnel to rain down on the Guwevkabaya. Having nowhere else to <b>go,</b> <b>the</b> besieged gathered around the mouth of the cave, where soldiers (accompanied by Crook) pushed boulders onto them from above, killing 76 of the group. The survivors were taken to Camp Grant as prisoners. The Yavapai were so demoralized by this and other actions by Crook that they surrendered at Camp Verde (renamed Fort McDowell), on April 6, 1873. In 1925, a group of Yavapai from the Fort McDowell Reservation, along with a Maricopa County Sheriff, collected the bones from the cave, and interred them at the Fort McDowell cemetery.|$|E
