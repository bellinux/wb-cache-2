40|$|The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> {{is a kind}} {{of paper}} in order that its holder shall entitle the debtor named in the {{document}} to pay a certain amount <b>of</b> payments. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> represents a means of payment and an instrument of providing the payment. It is an unconditional order given by the drawer to the drawee to pay a certain amount to the payee listed on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange.</b> The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is generally a paper on the orders but it can be issued as value paper to a name. It is such promissory notes where the issuer becomes a clause not by order. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> though it appears as a means of payment and an instrument for securing the payment it also appears as a means of international payment, because the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> can become a modern instrument of crediting and payment.

Four cases <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> utilization were examined, that finally lead to judicial recovery <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> amount.

The results were subsequently processed in the form of descriptions of the individual cases and the individual cases were evaluated. The thesis also includes examples <b>of</b> the specific <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchanges</b> discussed in the individual cases. The research has shown, among other things, that a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> can be a very effective tool to secure receivables, however it can be also very treacherous. The law <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is not a simple one.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} dissertation is to chart and analyze the flow of payments and credits to and from Gothenburg for the period 1790 − 1820, with {{a special interest in}} the transactions involving The Merchant House Ekman & Co. Both <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions within Ekman & Co and protested <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> for other firms are studied. Markus A. Denzel’s model of Cashless Payment is an instrument to study how <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> were used to ease payments and credit relations in the European Early Modern Credit market between 1790 and 1820. European trade possibilities for the period 1790 − 1820 are discussed in chapter III. The period under scrutiny was rather dramatic with economic and political changes. In Great Britain there was the industrial revolution and France experienced the great political revolution, followed by the Napoleonic wars. Chapter IV explores the credit- and <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> markets. Since protested <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and different ways to deal with the problems that occur are important, this dissertation examines protested <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> for two periods 1798 − 1800 and 1811 − 1812. The reasons for protesting <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> are either lack of acceptance or lack of payment, both of which are common in this analysis. As a consequence there were no more endorsement possibilities. Chapter V describes the business of The Merchant House Ekman for the period 1790 − 1800, with special interest in the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions. Peter III Ekman started his business ca 1760. He realized the importance of European contacts and from early on he traded with Merchants in Amsterdam, Hamburg, Greifswald, Wolgast and Stralsund. During the period 1790 − 1800 {{he was one of the}} most important producers of salted herring in Gothenburg. As a return good he imported grain from Merchant houses in the Baltic Sea. He imported the important salt by using his own ships. Ekman’s credit transactions in the form <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> contracts are <b>of</b> central importance, but the difficulty with the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions is that there are no obvious connections with the commodity transactions. Because of endorsement, it is impossible to tell exactly what <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> belonged to a certain amount of traded commodity. Chapter VI examines the Ekman & Co shift from mostly trading in herring and iron to concentrate on colonial trade at the time of war. Concerning credit relations, a database has been created for <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> dating from 1810, which is then used to analyze the credit relations that Ekman & Co had with other firms in the European market. The dissertation shows the benefits of discounting and how the endorsements were used, as well as the fact that the Cashless Payments system with the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions worked. When the system failed there was an effective law that solved the problem. All of this is further evidence that Gothenburg was an integrated part of the European financial system...|$|R
