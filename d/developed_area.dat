5|$|Bristol's {{boundaries}} are defined in several ways, {{depending on whether}} they {{are those of the}} city, the <b>developed</b> <b>area,</b> or Greater Bristol. The narrowest definition of the city is the city council boundary, which includes a large section of the western Severn Estuary up to (but not including) the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} broader definition {{used by the}} Office for National Statistics (ONS) includes developed areas adjoining Bristol {{but outside}} the city-council boundary, such as Whitchurch village, Filton, Patchway and Bradley Stoke, but excludes undeveloped areas within that boundary. The ONS has defined a Bristol Urban Area, which includes Kingswood, Mangotsfield, Stoke Gifford, Winterbourne, Frampton Cotterell, Almondsbury and Easton in Gordano. The North Fringe of Bristol, a <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> in South Gloucestershire between the Bristol city boundary and the M4 and M5 motorways, was so named {{as part of a}} 1987 plan prepared by the Northavon District Council.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this portion}} of NY441 is {{surrounded}} by woodlands, it is actually located in a largely <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> of Penfield known locally as Panorama. The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the densely populated hamlet of Penfield.|$|E

5|$|Miri Port Authority (MPA) was {{established}} on 1 February 1981 and commenced operation on 1 March 1983. It is {{located near the}} mouth of Baram River. The port is able to take in ships measuring up to 1,500 GRT (Gross Register Tonnage), with general cargo area of 50,895 m2 and total <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> of 34 hectares (0.34km2). It is mainly used in handling petroleum, timber products, coal, and building materials. A total of 23.94 million metric tonnes of goods was handled by MPA from 2011 to 2013, which earned a total revenue of RM 48.58 million in port dues.|$|E
5|$|The campus can {{be roughly}} divided in two by the Jaime Garces B. Avenue that runs in an east-west direction. The {{northern}} part, {{which is also}} the largest, is mostly undeveloped. The <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> is enclosed by the Tulio Ramirez Avenue, and it is composed of more than 30 buildings, including the main administration building, the faculties of Science and of Engineering, part of the faculty of Integrated Arts, and the Mario Carvajal Library, which is the main library of the university.|$|E
5|$|Greek Revival residences {{were first}} built in Troy along Second Street {{in the late}} 1820s. In 1839, six local {{businessmen}} bought a parcel of land between Second and Third {{at the south end}} of what was then the <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> of the city and created Washington Park. Modeled on contemporary British residential squares such as those found in London's Bloomsbury neighborhoods, its first phase, on Washington Place, featured rows of townhouses with a unified facade fronting on a park reserved exclusively for residents, whose deeds require a monthly maintenance fee. It retains its integrity despite some later alterations and damage, and is one of only two privately owned urban parks in New York.|$|E

5|$|Past Duck Pond, {{the route}} {{turned to the}} southeast, passing {{by a series of}} small ponds and {{crossing}} under an old railroad grade as it ran along the base of a series of peaks known as the Loon Lake Mountains. NY99 continued to follow the range to the northwestern edge of Loon Lake, where it veered to the northeast and ran along the northern and eastern shores of the lake to the hamlet of Loon Lake at its southeastern tip. NY99 passed generally northwest–southeast through the small lakeside community before reentering another sparsely <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> of the town of Franklin. The highway progressed southeastward, crossing over the northern branch of the Saranac River and passing through the largely undeveloped community of Merrillsville before ending at an intersection with NY3.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{owns and}} manages 60 buildings, {{both on and}} off campus. The buildings at McMaster vary in age, with Hamilton Hall opening in 1926, to the university's new L. R. Wilson Hall, which opened in September 2016. McMaster main campus is divided into three main areas: the Core Campus, North Campus and West Campus. The Core Campus is where the majority of the university's academic, research and residential buildings are located while the North Campus is made up of the university's athletic precinct and a small number of surface parking. The West Campus is the least <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> of the main campus, containing only a few buildings, surface parking, and undeveloped land.|$|E

A half-mile north of that exit, northbound traffic can also exit, and southbound traffic enter, at Pines Bridge Road.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} legal hurdle to {{the various}} {{construction}} plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings.

25|$|It {{was during}} his {{university}} years that Ursu began keeping a diary, {{in which he}} expressed strong criticism of the Communist regime. When Ursu stopped writing, the manuscript comprised 61 notebooks, covering a period of 40 years. From 1950 to 1985 {{he worked at the}} Bucharest-based Institute for the Study and Design of Communal Households. He personally designed a large number of lodgings (according to his own estimate, by 1977, 30,000 to 40,000 people were housed in buildings he had planned).

25|$|NY151 {{begins as}} a city-maintained highway at a {{junction}} with US9 and US20 in Rensselaer, near the Hudson River. Known as 3rd Avenue, the two-lane route heads towards the southeast in a largely <b>developed</b> <b>area.</b> Upon assuming an eastward route, the highway crosses over a series of Amtrak tracks, passing south of the AlbanyRensselaer rail station and entering a more residential area. NY151 turns slightly towards the northeast as it leaves the city of Rensselaer and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as it passes into the town of East Greenbush.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} vary in age. The oldest is Graduate House, {{originally a}} farmhouse {{dating back to}} the 19th century. The oldest building which was erected for the university is the Douglas Wright Engineering Building, which was erected in 1958. A large majority of the university's buildings, and its ring road, were constructed during the 1960s. The university's main campus is divided into three major areas: South Campus, North Campus and Northwest Campus. South Campus is the academic core of the university, while North Campus holds the Research and Technology Park. Northwest Campus is the least <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> of the main campus, made up primarily of farm fields and an environmental reserve, which divides it from North Campus.|$|E

The route remains in Greenport for only , passing residential and industrial neighborhoods {{on the fringe}} of the city as it intersects the north end of County Route29 (Spook Rock Road). Just east of the junction, NY23B traverses Claverack Creek and crosses into the town of Claverack, where the route initially serves a sparsely <b>developed</b> <b>area</b> between the town line and the hamlet of Claverack. The open fields are gradually replaced by homes as the highway enters Claverack, where NY23B meets NY9H and NY23 at a junction {{in the center of the}} community.

The two are promoted together, but with two very different atmospheres. Ixtapa is promoted as a world class luxury resort and Zihuatanejo is promoted as a more “typical” Mexican experience.
