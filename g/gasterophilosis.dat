40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on excretory/secretory antigens of second instar Gasterophilus for the diagnosis of <b>gasterophilosis</b> in grazing horses. Between January 2007 and January 2009, two experiments were carried out on free-ranging horses in northwest Spain. During the first year, monthly blood samples were collected from a herd of 25 horses. In the second year, a monthly serological survey was conducted {{for a total of}} 398 different horses. All the sera were analyzed by ELISA using excretory/secretory antigens from Gasterophilus intestinalis (GphiL 2 ES) and Gasterophilus nasalis second-stage larvae (GphnL 2 ES). Climatic data were collected between January 2007 and January 2009 from local meteorological automated stations to establish the weather pattern in the study area. Observations of Gasterophilus eggs on the horses’ hair and third instars passed in the faeces were also done. The kinetics of IgG response decreased against GphiL 2 ES from January to July, increased slowly from August and rose up to January. After a slight decrease in January, the absorbances against GphnL 2 ES reduced from April to August, when the lowest values were observed. The IgG values rose {{until the end of the}} study in January. Third instars were observed in the faeces in March to May, and Gasterophilus eggs were seen on the horses’ hair from June to September. The highest IgG seroprevalences were achieved in winter (January–February; 100 %) against both antigens. The lowest percentages of seropositivity were observed in June (3 %) to the GphiL 2 ES, and in July (9 %) to the GphnL 2 ES. The use of antigens from G. intestinalis second-stage larvae was shown to be suitable for diagnosing infestation by G. intestinalis or G. nasalis. We concluded that under oceanic climate conditions, the egg-laying period occurs from late spring, and eggs and first instars are found in the mouth in early summer. During summer the second instars move into the stomach and intestine, where the third-stage larvae remain until the end of winter, when pupation takes place. The adult horse bot fly emerges in the spring. Two treatments for the control of <b>gasterophilosis</b> are suggested: a curative in the summer to eliminate the first instars and a preventive in the autumn to suppress the second instars...|$|E
40|$|Gasterophilus larvae {{are common}} obligate parasites of the {{digestive}} tract of the equids. Horses become infected with this parasite by ingesting the larvae hatched from eggs laid by the female flies. In this study carried out monthly, we (i) counted the Gasterophilus eggs deposited by female flies on the coat of 30 grazing horses, (ii) counted and identified the Gasterophilus larvae retrieved from {{the digestive tract}} of 128 slaughtered horses, and (iii) compared these results to meteorological data. Eggs were deposited on all monitored horses, and were present from October to January and from May to September, whereas they were absent from February to April. The number of laid eggs was significantly different between the months, body regions, genders, and age classes (p [*] &# 60;[*] 0. 05). Larvae were recovered in 112 (87. 5 %) horses, and 6 species of Gasterophilus were identified. The prevailing species were Gasterophilus intestinalis (recovered in 110 horses; 85. 9 %) and Gasterophilus nasalis (69 horses; 53. 9 %), recovered in all months. Gasterophilus inermis (5 horses; 3. 9 %), Gasterophilus pecorum (3 horses; 2. 3 %), Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis (3 horses; 2. 3 %) ¸ and Gasterophilus meridionalis (2 horses; 1. 6 %) larvae were also found. Significant differences were found among monthly larval burdens for both Gasterophilus spp. and G. intestinalis (p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05), but not for G. nasalis (p &# 60;[*] 0. 05). Larval burdens and prevalences did not differed significantly between both genders and age classes (p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05). Monthly eggs and larvae trends were not significantly correlated (p &# 62;[*] 0. 05). With regard to the meteorological variables, minimum air temperature was significantly correlated with the eggs trend (rho[*]=[*] 1. 000; p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001) and maximum air temperature with the Gasterophilus spp. (rho[*]=[*] 0. 972; p [*]&# 60;[*][*] 0. 001) and G. intestinalis (rho[*]=[*] 0. 972; p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 001) larvae trends. In addition, {{the number of hours}} with a temperature below + 10 &# 176;C was significantly correlated with G. intestinalis larvae trend (rho[*]=[*] 0. 602; p [*]&# 60;[*] 0. 05). Our findings confirmed that in Sardinia, <b>Gasterophilosis</b> is an important parasitosis in the horses, and it needs more attention and extensive and/or correct treatment to reduce its prevalence...|$|E
