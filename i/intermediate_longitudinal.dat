40|$|The {{properties}} of a frustrated quantum antiferromagnet are interesting topics in condensed matter theory. Among the quantum antiferromagnets, Cs₂CuCl₄ gains attention {{as one of}} the candidates for materials with ground state spin liquid phase. The recent experimental results show that there exist several ground state phases in the presence of magnetic field which cannot be explained with classical Hamiltonian. In the thesis, I numerically studied the ground state of Cs₂CuCl₄ using a modified classical Hamiltonian, and I compared the result with previous experiments and classical analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Clinical {{examination}} of {{the region of the}} eye mainly affected in patients with intermediate uveitis is difficult and often hampered by media opacities. In that perspective ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) promises to be a valuable additional diagnostic tool.  METHODS—UBM was performed at a sound frequency of 50  MHz on 26  eyes of 13  patients with intermediate uveitis in order to determine configuration of pars plana, peripheral retina, and vitreous. Findings of ophthalmoscopy with scleral indentation and UBM were compared.  RESULTS—In 18  of 26  eyes pathological structures such as membraneous or fluffy vitreous condensations were identified by UBM. Among these UBM revealed pathological findings which were not visible on funduscopy in nine eyes. Most importantly, vitreoretinal adhesions with traction on the retina were imaged in four eyes. However, in three eyes vitreous opacities being visible on funduscopy were not identified by UBM.  CONCLUSION—UBM seems to be a valuable diagnostic technique for the evaluation of patients with <b>intermediate</b> uveitis. <b>Longitudinal</b> studies will have to determine the relevance of UBM findings for the individual clinical course and their influence on therapeutic decisions.    Keywords: intermediate uveitis; ultrasound biomicroscopy; vitreous opacitie...|$|R
40|$|The most {{striking}} feature of quark distribution functions transformed to the longitudinal distance representation is the recognizable separation {{of small and}} large longitudinal distances. While the former {{are responsible for the}} average properties of parton distributions, the latter can be shown to determine specifically their small-x behavior. In this paper we demonstrate how the distribution at <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> distances can be approximated by taking into account constraints which follow from the general properties of parton densities, such as their support and behavior at x → 1. We show that the combined description of small, intermediate, and large longitudinal distances allows a good approximation of both shape and magnitude of parton distribution functions. As an application we have calculated low-virtuality C even and odd (valence) u and d quark parton densities of the nucleon and the C-even transversity distribution h 1 (x), combining recent QCD sum rules and lattice QCD results with phenomenological information about their small-x behavior...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{response}} of low energy, semi-rigid rockfall barriers. The study {{is based on}} a FE model that reproduces the geometry, components and connections of the existing systems that were previously tested at The University of Newcastle. The mechanical behaviour of the relevant barrier components was calibrated from simple mechanical tests and the response of the assembled system, i. e. 2 m high, 15 m long rockfall barrier, was validated against of full-scale tests results. Following a satisfactory validation of the model, further dynamic non-linear analyses were conducted to investigate the dependence of the full system performance to the size of impacting blocks. Interestingly, the total failure energy was found to evolve non-monotonically with block size because of dynamic effects that seem to prevail for impact speeds in the range of 15 - 20 m/s. The study also highlights the complex effects of adding <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> cables to the system. An improvement of the barrier performance is observed for the large blocks but the bullet effect is exacerbated for small blocks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new shear strength model for reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column joints subjected to cyclic lateral loading. In the proposed model, the reinforced concrete {{in the joint}} panel is idealized as a homogenous material in a plane stress state. The contribution of the joint shear reinforcement (including both the transverse steel reinforcement and the <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> steel reinforcement of the column) is taken into account through the nominal tensile strength of the idealized material. The effect of tensile straining in the transverse direction on the compressive strength of the idealized material is accounted for using the Kupfer-Gerstle biaxial tension-compression failure envelope. Comparisons {{with the results of}} 106 existing tests of both exterior and interior beam-column joints, with and without transverse steel reinforcement, demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model. These comparisons also illustrate the superior accuracy of the proposed model over existing models. A subsequent trend analysis using the test database confirms that all key parameters influencing the shear strength of beam-column joints have been appropriately considered in the proposed model. The proposed model is believed to be suitable for design use due to its simple form, wide applicability and accuracy. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Serum IgA {{antibodies}} to Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface antigens were estimated by ELISA. Titres {{in patients with}} and without cystic fibrosis and with no pseudomonal infection were low (less than 105 to less than 261). Titres in patients with cystic fibrosis who were chronically infected with P aeruginosa were very high (1200 - 163, 000), and patients who grew the organism intermittently had <b>intermediate</b> titres. <b>Longitudinal</b> studies suggested increasing tissue invasion or involvement of the lower respiratory tract, or both, with increasing time of infection and identified patients with a good prognosis after the onset of pseudomonal infection. Detection of an increased serum IgA titre can give an earlier indication than measurement of the serum IgG titre {{of the presence of}} P aeruginosa in the respiratory tract in a proportion of patients. IgA measurement seems to be better than IgG measurement at predicting the reappearance of P aeruginosa after apparent eradication of early infection. These results suggest that this assay may be a valuable additional indicator of the presence of P aeruginosa at the beginning of infection, and of the reappearance of the organism after treatment {{in the early stages of}} infection...|$|R

40|$|We {{exploit the}} renormalization-group {{approach}} {{to establish the}} exact infrared behavior of an interacting Bose system at zero temperature. The local-gauge symmetry in the broken-symmetry phase is implemented through the associated Ward identities, which {{reduce the number of}} independent running couplings to a single one. For this coupling the e expansion can be controlled to all orders in e (532 d). For spatial dimensions 1,d< 3 the Bogoliubov fixed point is unstable towards a different fixed point characterized by the divergence of the longitudinal correlation function. The Bogoliubov linear spectrum, however, is found to be independent of the critical behavior of this correlation function, being exactly constrained by Ward identities. The new fixed point properly gives a finite value of the coupling among transverse fluctuations, but due to virtual <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> fluctuations, the effective coupling affecting the transverse correlation function flows to zero. As a result, no transverse anomalous dimension is present. This treatment allows us to recover known results for the quantum Bose gas {{in the context of a}} unifying framework and also to reveal the nontrivial skeleton structure of its perturbation theory...|$|E
40|$|Full-scale {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) exterior beam-column joints, which are fabricated to simulate those in as-built RC frame buildings designed to BS 81 10, are tested under reversed cyclic loading. The seismic behaviour of these non-seismically designed joints is investigated. Particular emphasis {{is given to}} the effects of the beam-column depth ratio, column longitudinal reinforcement and stirrups in joints on the seismic performance and shear strength of the joints. It is shown that beam-column depth ratio has a significant effect on the shear strength and ductility of beam-column joints, while <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> reinforcement may be used to enhance the shear capacity and improve the hysteretic behaviour of beam-column joints, and links placed in beam-column joint cores can effectively improve the seismic behaviour and enhance the joint shear strength. Test results are compared with those predicted by three seismic design codes (ACI- 318, NZS 3101 and Eurocode 8) and two non-seismic design codes (BS 8110 and Eurocode 2). It has been shown that member sizing and reinforcement detailing have significant effects on the shear capacity and seismic behaviour of exterior beam-column joints. In general, present seismic and non-seismic design codes do not accurately predict the shear strength of the non-seismically detailed joints, while BS 8110 may provide relatively better predictions than others in these particular cases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{decision}} of whether {{and where to}} cross the midline, an evolutionarily conserved line of bilateral symmetry in the central nervous system, is the first task for many newly extending axons. We show that Wnt 5, {{a member of the}} conserved Wnt secreted glycoprotein family, is required for the formation of the anterior of the two midline-crossing commissures present in each Drosophila hemisegment. Initial path finding of pioneering neurons across the midline in both commissures is normal in wnt 5 mutant embryos; however, the subsequent separation of the early midline-crossing axons into two distinct commissures does not occur. The majority of the follower axons that normally cross the midline in the anterior commissure fail to do so, remaining tightly associated near their cell bodies, or projecting inappropriately across the midline in between the commissures. The lateral and <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> pathways also fail to form correctly, similarly reflecting earlier failures in pathway defasciculation. Panneural expression of Wnt 5 in a wnt 5 mutant background rescues both the commissural and longitudinal defects. We show that the Wnt 5 protein is predominantly present on posterior commissural axons and at a low level on the anterior commissure and longitudinal projections. Finally, we demonstrate that transcriptional repression of wnt 5 in AC neurons by the recently described Wnt 5 receptor, Derailed, contributes to this largely posterior commissural localization of Wnt 5 protein...|$|E

Transmission and scanning electron microscopic studies of these salt-resistant cytoskeletal residues indicated: (a) small bundles of short transverse filaments connect adjacent myofibrils by forming Z to Z and M to M bridges; (b) parallel, continuous longitudinal filaments connect the peripheries of successive Z-disks and ensheath the sarcomere. These transverse and longitudinal filaments have the characteristic morphology of intermediate filaments; (c) two rings of tightly interwoven and tangled filaments, connected laterally by short filaments, encircle each Z disk.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{information}} relating to the ontogeny, development and the vasculature of eudicotyledonous leaves. However there is less information available concerning the vascular anatomy of monocotyledonous leaves. This is surprising, given that there are two uniquely different phloem systems present in large groups such as grasses and sedges. Monocotyledonous leaves contain marginal, large, <b>intermediate</b> and small <b>longitudinal</b> veins that are interconnected by numerous transverse veins. The longitudinal veins contain two metaphloem sieve tube types, which, based upon their ontogeny and position within the phloem, are termed early (thin-walled) and late (thick-walled) sieve tubes. Early metaphloem comprises sieve tubes, companion cells and vascular parenchyma cells, whilst the late metaphloem, contains thick-walled sieve tubes that lack companion cells. Thick-walled sieve tubes are generally adjacent to, or no more than one cell removed from the metaxylem. Unlike thin-walled sieve tube-companion cell complexes, thick-walled sieve tubes are connected to parenchyma by pore-plasmodesma units and are generally symplasmically isolated from the thin walled sieve tubes. This paper addresses key structural and functional differences between thin- and thick-walled sieve tubes and explores the unique advantages of alternate transport strategies that this 5 to 7 million year old dual system may offer.

40|$|The near wake {{generated}} by a triangular cylinder and a screen, respectively, has been investigated {{with a view to}} provide information on the effect of initial conditions on turbulence structures of various scales based on the wavelet multi-resolution analysis. The velocity data were simultaneously obtained at x/h (x is the streamwise distance downstream of the wake generator and h is the height of the wake generator) = 20 using a rake of eight X-wires aligned in the plane of mean shear. A vector wavelet multi-resolution technique was applied to decompose the velocity data into a number of wavelet components based on the central frequencies. The instantaneous sectional streamlines and vorticity field were used to reveal the turbulent structures at each wavelet component/central frequency. It was found that the behavior of large- and intermediate-scale structures depend on the initial conditions and the small-scale structures are independent of the initial conditions.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the central projections of leg proprioceptors important in resistance reflexes {{and in the}} control of leg movement in the stick insect. The following proprioceptors were studied: the femoral chordotonal organ and the campaniform sensilla on the proximal femur, the hair plate, the hair field and three groups of campaniform sensilla on the trochanter, and the two hair plates and four hair rows on the coxa. For comparison, single tactile hairs on the sternum, coxa, trochanter, and femur were also investigated. Afferent fibers were backfilled with cobalt and the central projections were studied in wholemounts and in sections. Results are compared with those from other insects and arthropods. Results for all three thoracic ganglia are similar. Projections of all the proprioceptors are confined to the ipsilateral half of the segmental ganglion. They all terminate in four common target areas - two each in the lateral and in the intermediate part of the hemiganglion. The two lateral areas lie rostrally and caudally in dorsal neuropile occupied by motoneuron processes. The two intermediate areas lie rostrally and caudally in midventral neuropile lateral to the ventral intermediate tract (VIT). These intermediate areas include part of the ventral coarse-grained neuropile (vcN). Target areas of different proprioceptors overlap considerably, but the intermediate projections of the campaniform sensilla lie slightly closer together {{than those of the}} other organs. In addition to these four areas, the afferent fibers of the femoral chordotonal organ (fCO) project to two medial target areas extending into neuropile medial to the VIT. Afferent fibers from the various sense organs reach these common target areas using different pathways, but these pathways share some common elements. Afferent fibers from one organ can follow several alternative pathways to the common target areas. The intermediate areas are reached by projections which form a rostral and a caudal prong extending medially in midventral neuropile. Fibers enter these rostral and caudal prongs either along the lateral margin of the ganglion (a path referred to as a lateral longitudinal bundle) or by crossing {{from one to the other}} through coarse-grained neuropile occupying the central core of each hemiganglion (a path referred to as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> bundle). Collaterals entering the dorsolateral target areas rise either directly along the margin of the neuropile or from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> bundle. The medial target areas of the fCO projections are reached by a third branch which proceeds from the margin of the ganglion medioventrally between the anterior and posterior prongs and then bifurcates. Fibers from different organs follow different routes to reach common target areas. In addition, fibers from the same organ vary in their distribution among alternative pathways. Projections from tactile hairs on the sternum, coxa, trochanter, and femur are quite different from those of the proprioceptive hairs. They proceed medially along the ventral margin of the ganglion to terminate in a loose plexus within medial parts of the ventral association center. ...|$|E

The cytoskeletons of {{mammalian}} striated {{and smooth}} muscles contain {{a pair of}} high molecular weight (HMW) polypeptides of 220, 000 and 200, 000 mol wt, each with isoelectric points of about 5 (Price, M.

The HMW polypeptides of mammalian muscle have been named "skelemins," {{because they are in}} the insoluble cytoskeletons of striated muscle and are at the M-discs. I have used two-dimensional peptide mapping to show that the two skelemin polypeptides are closely related to each another. Polyclonal antibodies directed against skelemins were used to demonstrate that they are immunologically distinct from talin, fodrin, myosin heavy chain, synemin, microtubule-associated proteins, and numerous other proteins of similar molecular weight, and are not oligomers of other muscle proteins. Skelemins appear not to be proteolytic products of larger proteins, as shown by immunoautoradiography on 3 % polyacrylamide gels.

40|$|Background and objective: Haplotypes in the {{promoter}} {{region of}} the prostanoid DP receptor (PTGDR) gene {{have been shown to}} functionally influence gene transcription and to be associated with asthma in two previous case–control studies in Caucasians. This study tested the association of PTGDR haplotypes with asthma phenotypes in two large Caucasian-Australian populations. These results were incorporated in a meta-analysis with previously published data to determine the overall role for these haplotypes in the risk of asthma. Methods: Three PTGDR promoter-region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were genotyped in 368 individuals from the Western Australian Twin Child Health study and 2988 individuals from the Busselton Health Study. Logistic regression and transition disequilibrium tests were used to assess whether SNP genotypes and three SNP haplotypes were associated with doctor-diagnosed asthma or <b>intermediate</b> quantitative traits. <b>Longitudinal</b> data from the Busselton Health Study were used to examine whether PTGDR influences changes in lung function over time. Meta-analysis incorporated {{the findings of this study}} with those of two previous studies in Caucasian populations. Results: Cross-sectional associations between PTGDR haplotypes and asthma phenotypes were non-significant (P > 0. 05) in both populations. Longitudinal analyses of PTGDR and lung function were also non-significant. Meta-analysis, however, suggested that haplotype TCT was significantly associated with decreased risk of asthma (OR = 0. 76; P = 0. 02) while haplotype CCC was not significantly associated with asthma (OR = 1. 30; P = 0. 07).

The experimental investigation used two orthogonal arrays of sixteen X-wires, eight in the (x, y) -plane, and eight in the (x, z) -plane. Measurements were made at x/h (x is the streamwise distance downstream of the cylinder and h is {{the height of the}} wake generator) = 20. The wavelet multi-resolution technique was applied to decomposing the velocity data, obtained in the wakes generated by the two generators, into a number of wavelet components based on the central frequencies. The instantaneous sectional streamlines and vorticity field were thus 'visualized' for each wavelet component or central frequency. It was found that the behavior of large- and intermediate-scale structures depend on the initial conditions and the small-scale structures are independent of the initial conditions.

40|$|High-field {{asymmetric}} waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) separates ions at {{atmospheric pressure}} {{based on the}} difference in the mobility of an ion in a strong electric field and in a weak electric field. This field-dependent mobility of an ion is reflected in the compensation voltage (CV) at which the ion is transmitted through FAIMS at an applied asymmetric waveform dispersion voltage (DV). In this report, we show that experimental CV peak shapes using dome tipped inner electrode FAIMS prototypes with inner/outer electrode radii of: (1) 0. 2 / 0. 4 cm and (2) 0. 4 / 0. 6 cm are a function of the longitudinal position of the inner electrode. Varying the longitudinal position of the inner electrode modifies the electric fields between the surfaces of the hemispherical shaped inner electrode and the outer electrode {{in the vicinity of the}} ion outlet. In this region the position-dependent electric field strength (E/N) effectively forms a second tandem FAIMS analyzer region having differing ion separation properties. The final tandem FAIMS separation is the intersection of the CV windows of these two differing FAIMS separations and, therefore, the peak width in the CV scan is dependent on the longitudinal tip displacement (LTD) of the inner electrode. CV scans are shown for a LTD range of 0. 14 to 0. 4 cm. These scans illustrate that it is possible to control the FAIMS resolution (CV/peak width) from about 1 for the 0. 2 / 0. 4 cm electrode set at <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> position to over 10 at the narrowest distance between the inner electrode and the ion outlet...|$|E
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} anal muscle (LAM) {{has been}} described as a vertical layer of muscular tissue interposed between the circular layers of the internal (IAS) and external (EAS) anal sphincters. There is, however, no general agreement in the literature on its composition and attachments. The aim of this study was to investigate the histological structure, attachments, and topography of the LAM in order to evaluate its role in continence and defecation, thus enhancing knowledge of the surgical anatomy of this region. After in situ formalin fixation, the pelvic viscera were removed from eight male and eight female cadavers (age range: 52 - 72 years). Serial macrosections of the bladder base, lower rectum and anal canal, cervix and pelvic floor complex, cut in the transverse (six specimens) and coronal (six specimens) planes, underwent histological and immunohistochemical studies. Four specimens were studied using the E 12 sheet plastination technique. The LAM was identified in 10 / 12 specimens (83 %). Transverse and coronal sections made clear that it is a longitudinal layer of muscular tissue, marking the boundary between the internal and external anal sphincters. From the anorectal junction it extends along the anal canal, receives fibers from the innermost part of the puborectalis and the puboanalis muscles, and terminates with seven to nine fibro-elastic septa, which traverse the subcutaneous part of the external anal sphincter, reaching the perianal dermis. In the transverse plane, the mean thickness of the LAM was 1. 68 +/- 0. 27 mm. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the LAM consists of predominantly outer striated muscle fibers and smaller numbers of inner smooth muscle fibers, respectively coming from the levator ani muscle and from the longitudinal muscular layer of the rectum. The oblique fibers suggest that the LAM may represent the <b>intermediate</b> <b>longitudinal</b> course of small bridging muscle bundles going reciprocally from the striated EAS to the smooth IAS and vice versa. The spatial result is the helical course of striated and smooth muscle fibers between the EAS and IAS, which contribute not only to the narrowing but also to some shortening of the anal canal during sphincter contraction. Thus, rather than being a boundary, the LAM gives anatomical evidence of a functional connection between two muscle systems with different structures and topography...|$|E
40|$|The load {{distribution}} factor concept allows the design engineer {{to consider the}} longitudinal and transverse effects of wheel loads as two separate phenomena and thus simplifying the analysis and design of the bridge. North American codes of practice do not provide the design engineer with sufficient guidance regarding elastic {{load distribution}} factors for skew composite bridges. These codes of practice also require a check {{to be made on}} the strength of the sections of the bridge at the ultimate limit state, but they specify the use of elastic load distribution factors for the evaluation of the design forces at the ultimate limit state. Such specifications could lead to an extremely conservative design in some cases and to unsafe design in other cases, since these factors do not represent the actual behaviour of the bridge at that state. Under a moving truck, the bridge exhibits forces which are significantly greater than those under a static truck load. The Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code specifies the dynamic load allowance as a factor of the first flexural frequency of the bridge based on the beam theory. This latter theory is reliable in the case of right bridges without transverse diaphragms. However, in the case of skew bridges or bridges with transverse diaphragms the use of the beam theory leads to substantial errors in the determination of the first flexural frequency and hence the dynamic load allowance. In this dissertation, the predictions of the elastic and the ultimate behaviours of single span simply supported and continuous two-span skew composite steel-concrete bridges are presented. The dynamic response of such bridges is also investigated. A finite element analytical model based on the ABAQUS program, is used for the analyses. The analytical model was verified and substantiated by results from tests on six single span simply supported and three continuous skew composite steel-concrete bridge models. The finite element model is employed to conduct six extensive parametric studies on prototype skew composite bridges, including more than 2500 bridge cases. A statistical package for best fit is used to generate empirical formulas for the following: (i) elastic shear and moment distribution factors for simply supported and continuous skew composite bridges; (ii) ultimate span and support moment distribution factors for continuous skew composite bridges; and, (iii) first flexural frequency of such bridges. The following design parameters were considered when appropriate: angle of skew; bridge aspect ratio; girder spacing; number of lanes; number of girders; the effect of transverse <b>intermediate</b> diaphragms; <b>longitudinal</b> and transverse flexural rigidities; longitudinal and transverse ultimate moments of resistance of the bridge sections; eccentric and concentric truck loading cases; effect of dead load; and, the span ratio. From the results of this design oriented dissertation, the engineer would be able to design skew composite bridges more reliably and economically. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
