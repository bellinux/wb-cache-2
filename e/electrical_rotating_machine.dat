40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new methodology of design of <b>electrical</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> The methodology {{is an extension}} of previous works of the second author. Indeed, associating combinatorial analytical models with exact global optimization algorithms leads to rational solutions of predesign. These solutions need to be validated by a numerical tool (using a finite-element method) before the expansive phase of hand-making a prototype. Such an automatic numerical tool for computing some characteristic values, such as the torque, was previously developed. The idea {{of this paper is to}} extend the exact global optimization algorithm by inserting the direct use of this automatic numerical tool. This new methodology makes it possible to solve design problems more rationally. Some numerical examples validate the usefulness of this new approach...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a new type of}} superconducting synchronous <b>rotating</b> <b>machine</b> whose self-induction is cancelled out, with the intention of achieving a very high power-to-weight ratio including the weight of the cooling system. Magnetic cores are used to direct the magnetic field from permanent magnets on the rotors onto superconducting wires on the stator, and the reaction of the Lorenz force is used to drive the rotors. Cancellation of self-induction in the cores enables the elimination of core-losses and magnetic saturation, permitting the core mass to be reduced significantly, and also reducing ac losses in the superconducting wires. In this work a prototype prepared using 100 m of second generation high temperature superconductor (2 G-HTS) wire is described, and its characteristics are measured and compared with a numerical simulation. We conclude that <b>electrical</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machines</b> with power-to-weight ratios comparable to jet engines could be developed with 2 G-HTS wire...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the {{characterisation}} of electric alloys used {{in the building of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> Firstly, it is shown that classical devices are not suitable. They are unable to predict the behaviour of magnetic sheets under their real working conditions:the distribution of the flux density through the section of the sheets is wrong and the anisotropy of magnetic permeability is not correctly taken into account[l][2]. Then, the results are useless to compute and design electrical machines. Then, we describe a new measurement device to enable us to test either circular smooth or slotted samples, {{with the use of a}} suitable electromagnetic travelling wave. analogous to that of the airgap of the real electrical machine[2]. Finally, we give the first results obtained with the first device realized in our Laboratory. They show clearly the possibility to take into account the physical phenomenon and translate them with respect to geometrical building parameters of <b>rotating</b> <b>machines.</b> 1.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{simulation}} of a synchronous generator with superconducting rotor windings. As many other <b>electrical</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machines,</b> superconducting generators are exposed to ripple fields that could be produced {{from a wide variety}} of sources: short circuit, load change, mechanical torque fluctuations, etc. Unlike regular conductors, superconductors, experience high losses when exposed to AC fields. Thus, calculation of such losses is relevant for machine design to avoid quenches and increase performance. Superconducting coated conductors are well known to exhibit nonlinear resistivity, thus making the computation of heating losses a cumbersome task. Furthermore, the high aspect ratio of the superconducting materials involved adds a penalty in the time required to perform simulations. The chosen strategy for simulation is as follows: A mechanical torque signal together with an electric load is used to drive the finite element model of a synchronous generator where the current distribution in the rotor windings is assumed uniform. Then, a second finite element model for the superconducting material is linked to calculate the actual current distribution in the windings of the rotor. Finally, heating losses are computed as a response to the electric load. The model is used to evaluate the transient response of the generator...|$|R

40|$|Amorphous {{magnetic}} materials (AMMs) {{have been used}} in low-frequency power transformer applications {{for more than two decades}} but not commercially utilized in high-frequency <b>rotating</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>machines</b> despite their low iron losses, which is an order of magnitude lower than conventional silicon iron.
