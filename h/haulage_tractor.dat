50|$|The company mainly {{concentrated}} on articulated and rigid eight-wheeler lorries, from the 1920s. One vehicle not in those lines that became well-known was the 6Ã—4 Pioneer. This was an off-highway, heavy <b>haulage</b> <b>tractor,</b> first produced in 1927. It showed outstanding cross-country performance {{due to the}} design that included the patent beam bogie rear axle, with 2 ft of vertical movement {{for each of the}} rear wheels. This design was the work of Oliver Danson North. The Pioneer proved popular in the oil field and forestry (logging) markets, and formed the basis of the British Army's Second World War R100 30-ton tank transporter. With the outbreak of war, development of new vehicles stopped and production {{concentrated on}} military Pioneers for use as artillery tractors, recovery and transporter vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of {{left-hand-drive}} Atkinsons were built for export to mainland Europe in the late 1960s, with pressed-steel cabs bought from Krupp after that company had ceased commercial vehicle production. Most were sold eventually in the U.K., via Comberhill Commercials of Wakefield. A different design of glass-fibre cab, launched in prototype form at the 1966 Commercial Motor Show, and named View-Line, had a deep single-piece main windscreen with wrap-around quarter glasses. The prototype had three separate chrome radiator grilles, but lacked {{the character of the}} exposed radiator models. Thereafter, although the Krupp Cabs, introduced in 1969, and View-Line cabs had concealed radiators, they carried a fibreglass replica of the Atkinson radiator outline with the 'Big A' device centred upon it. Both were available until 1970 and the merger with Seddon. Notable Atkinsons of the era were a fleet of 6x6 gritters built in 1962-73 on the orders of various U.K. highway authorities for use on the motorway network. These had Cummins NHK engines installed, rather than the more popular Gardner power units, due ostensibly to the use of steel in their construction, which didn't suffer salt corrosion to the same degree as the alloy-constructed Gardners. Early examples had AEC engines.From 1968 the standard Mk I glass-fibre clad cab was revised, with stronger ash framing, larger dimensions and wider, deeper windscreens. The traditional Withnell-tubed, exposed radiator was replaced with the more imposing enclosed version, which was concealed behind a glass-fibre shrounded metal grille - again carrying the Knight's Head, circular A logo and additional adornments in the form of engine manufacturer plates.This cab featured on the final Atkinson haulage models, the naming of which originated from an idea by Frank Whalley, the company publicity officer at the time. The most famous of the range were Two-axle tractor units were carried the name 'Borderer'. Three-axle rear-steer tractor units carried the name 'Leader'. Three-axle haulage chassis carried the name 'Searcher'. Four-axle chassis carried the name 'Defender'. Three-axle heavy <b>haulage</b> <b>tractor</b> units carried the name 'Venturer'. The two-axle haulage chassis were never given an official name, but was planned to carry the name 'Raider', although factory grille plates were never produced for this model.|$|E
40|$|The {{centralisation}} of the Mauritian sugar industry, {{resulting from}} the closing down of mills of lower crushing capacity, involved the re-organisation of cane transport {{and the establishment of}} transloading zones. Cost effective transport systems and operating conditions had therefore to be identified. Different systems comprising lorries, agricultural tractors and one <b>haulage</b> <b>tractor</b> operating at three existing transloading zones were assessed technically and economically. Most transport systems are characterised by low payload to tare weight and high power to payload ratios. Factors affecting the transport cycles were also studied. The waiting times recorded both at transloadingzones and mill yards were found to be of crucial importance. Their impact on costs predominated over technical aspects. Transport systems with 24 tonne payloadswere found to be the most cost effective. Night transportation was less costly, mainly because of significant reductions in down time.

40|$|<b>Haulage</b> <b>tractors</b> {{have been}} tested by the South African Sugar Association Experiment Station for a number ofyears. These tests, {{consisting}} ofa pto dynamometer test for engine performance and a road haulage test monitoring speed, load and fuel consumption over a known route, are timeconsuming and expensive. In this paper a computer model is outlined, using various tractor parameters and traction mechanics to simulate these tests. The predicted results from the computer model are compared with the results obtained from the pto and road haulage tests...|$|R
50|$|Daimler {{unveiled}} a new brand of trucks - BharatBenz - for the Indian market on 17 February 2011. The brand {{was intended to}} offer a range of trucks in the 6-49 ton range, with vehicles for applications such as <b>haulage,</b> tippers and <b>tractor</b> trailers. In 2012 BharatBenz unveiled its first range of trucks to the media, potential customers and partners in a six-day event in Hyderabad. The BharatBenz range of trucks includes Light Duty Trucks (LDT) & Heavy Duty Trucks (HDT) in the 9, 12, 25, 31 and 49 tonne categories, featuring various usages and applications. The first 3 Heavy-duty trucks (2523 R, 2523 C, & 3123 R) were launched on 26 September 2012. On 20 February 2013, DICV launched its Light/Medium-duty range of trucks. These trucks {{are based on the}} famous FUSO platforms.|$|R
50|$|The 190XT had a six {{cylinder}} {{engine and}} a 3.875 by 4.25 inch bore/stroke. Its displacement was 301 cubic inches and its rated RPMs was 2200. It was tested at 94 {{power take off}} and 79 drawbar (<b>haulage)</b> horsepower. The <b>tractor's</b> engine was a new design and, for the time, offered excellent performance for its displacement. Its main transmission, basically a carryover from the D19, had 4 forward and 1 reverse gear and was not synchronized. The 190XT had a power director like the D Series, but it could smoothly shift on the go just like the D series. The main transmission could not be shifted while the PTO was engaged and turning, and as such, the 190 did not offer true live PTO. The tractor could be started and stopped using the power director, but the tractor could not, for example, shuttle from forward to reverse without first stopping the PTO. The power director did split each gear allowing {{for a total of}} 8 forward speeds and 2 reverse speeds.|$|R
