50|$|The {{lifespan}} of {{the typical}} striped <b>grass</b> <b>mouse</b> is short.

50|$|Chamois eat {{various types}} of vegetation, {{including}} <b>highland</b> <b>grasses</b> and herbs {{during the summer and}} conifers, barks and needles from trees in winter. Primarily diurnal in activity, they often rest around mid-day and may actively forage during moonlit nights.|$|R
50|$|Cursor <b>grass</b> <b>mice</b> {{are members}} of the A. cursor species group, and very similar in {{appearance}} to other members of the group. In particular, they cannot easily be distinguished from the closely related montane <b>grass</b> <b>mouse,</b> which inhabits neighbouring regions to the immediate south. Although the cursor <b>grass</b> <b>mouse</b> is, on average, slightly larger than the montane species, there is too much overlap for this to be a reliable guide. Instead, they can most readily be distinguished by the presence of a gall bladder in A. cursor (absent in the montane species), by karyotypic analysis, or by means of PCR based techniques.|$|R
