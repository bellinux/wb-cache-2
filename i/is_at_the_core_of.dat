5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and {{prosperity of the}} individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{in which the individual}} plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E

25|$|Tracking the {{transmission}} of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data can show the spread of a disease and <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the specialty of epidemiology.|$|E
25|$|Yang–Mills {{theory is}} a gauge theory {{based on the}} SU(N) group, or more {{generally}} any compact, reductive Lie algebra. Yang–Mills theory seeks to describe the behavior of elementary particles using these non-Abelian Lie groups and <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces (i.e. U(1) × SU(2)) as well as quantum chromodynamics, {{the theory of the}} strong force (based on SU(3)). Thus it forms the basis of our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics.|$|E

25|$|Urban {{space is}} a {{precious}} commodity and public transport utilises it {{more efficiently than}} a car dominant society, allowing cities to be built more compactly than if they were dependent on automobile transport. If public transport planning <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> urban planning, it will also force cities to be built more compactly to create efficient feeds into the stations and stops of transport. This will {{at the same time}} allow the creation of centers around the hubs, serving passengers' daily commercial needs and public services. This approach significantly reduces urban sprawl.|$|E
25|$|For example, a wavelet {{could be}} created {{to have a}} {{frequency}} of Middle C and a short duration of roughly a 32nd note. If this wavelet were to be convolved with a signal created from the recording of a song, then the resulting signal would be useful for determining when the Middle C note was being played in the song. Mathematically, the wavelet will correlate with the signal if the unknown signal contains information of similar frequency. This concept of correlation <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> many practical applications of wavelet theory.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the racial jokes and innuendo brought out in its subsequent persistence in early sound film, blackface imagery in The Jazz Singer <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> the film's central theme, an expressive and artistic exploration {{of the notion of}} duplicity and ethnic hybridity within American identity. Of the more than seventy examples of blackface in early sound film 1927–53 that I have viewed (including the nine blackface appearances Jolson subsequently made), The Jazz Singer is unique in that it is the only film where blackface is central to the narrative development and thematic expression.|$|E
25|$|The church puts notable {{emphasis}} on the family, and the distinctive concept of a united family which lives and progresses forever <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> Latter-day Saint doctrine. Church members are encouraged to marry and have children, and as a result, Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. All sexual activity outside of marriage is considered a serious sin. All homosexual activity is considered sinful and same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name and generate a church record for them.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it {{is a step in the}} right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

25|$|The Book of Revelation <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> Christian eschatology. The {{study of}} Revelation is usually {{divided into four}} interpretative methodologies or hermeneutics. In the Futurist approach, Revelation is treated mostly as {{unfulfilled}} prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies. In the Preterist approach, Revelation is chiefly interpreted as having prophetic fulfillment in the past, principally, {{the events of the}} first century CE, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and the desecration of the Temple in the same year. In the Historicist approach, Revelation provides a broad view of history, and passages in Revelation are identified with major historical people and events. In the Idealist (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.|$|E
25|$|Jain {{philosophy}} {{arose from}} the shramana traditions. In its 2500 years post-Mahavira history, it remained fundamentally the same as preached by Mahavira, who preached essentially the same religion as the previous Tirthankara. Harry Oldmeadow notes that the Jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought to further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status of the components. The schisms into Śvetāmbara and Digambara traditions arose mainly on account of differences in question of practice of nudity amongst monks and liberation of women. Apart from these minor differences in practices, there are no major philosophical differences between the different sects of Jainism. The Tattvārthasūtra, which encapsulates major philosophical doctrines, is accepted by all traditions of Jainism. This coherence in philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like Jaini to remark that {{in the course of}} history of Jainism no heretical movements like Mahayana, tantric or bhakti movement developed outside mainstream Jainism. Thus, there are traditions within Jainism, but basically the same philosophy that <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> Jainism.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) {{have been shown to}} enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. Dyspareunia (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E

Nations, like individuals, she maintains have, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mary Poovey describes it, [...] "a collective 'understanding' that evolves organically, 'ripening' gradually to fruition".
