5|$|Successive Merina {{sovereign}}s ruled {{over the}} Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona's reign. This sovereign gave the growing city its current name; he established the Andohalo town square {{outside the town}} gate, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely. Andriamasinavalona <b>designated</b> specific <b>territories</b> for the hova (commoners) and each andriana (noble) subcaste, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced; members of subcastes were required to live within their <b>designated</b> <b>territories</b> and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others. Numerous fady (taboos), including injunctions against the construction of wooden houses by non-nobles {{and the presence of}} swine within the city limits, were imposed.|$|R

50|$|The {{aggression}} of {{this fish}} {{has been studied}} by ethologists and comparative psychologists. These fish have historically been the objects of gambling; two male fish are pitted against each other to fight and bets are placed on which one will win. One fish will arise the victor, the fight continuing until one participant is submissive. These competitions can result {{in the death of}} either one or both fish depending on the seriousness of their injuries. To avoid fights over territory, male Siamese fighting fish are best isolated from one another. Males will occasionally even respond aggressively to their own reflections in a mirror. Though this is obviously safer than exposing the fish to another male, prolonged sight of their reflection may lead to stress in some individuals. Not all Siamese fighting fish respond negatively to other males, especially when the tank is large enough for each fish to create their own <b>designated</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1924, the {{unemployment}} rate among Jews exceeded 30%, partially {{as a result of}} pogroms but also as a result of communism, which prohibited people from being craftspeople and small businessmen. With the goal of getting Jews back to work to be more productive members of society, the government established Komzet, the committee for the agricultural settlement of Jews. The Soviet government entertained the idea of resettling all Jews in the USSR in a <b>designated</b> <b>territory</b> where {{they would be able to}} pursue a lifestyle “socialist in content and national in form”. The Soviets also wanted to offer an alternative to Zionism, the establishment of Palestine as a Jewish homeland. Socialist Zionists such as Ber Borochov were gaining followers at that time and Zionism was a rival ideology to Marxism among left-wing Jews. The location that was initially considered in the early 1920s was Crimea, which already had a significant Jewish population Two Jewish districts (raiony) were formed in Crimea and three in south Ukraine. However, an alternative scheme, perceived as more advantageous, was put into practice.|$|E
50|$|With the {{conversion}} of WGN America into a traditional cable channel, WGN-TV chose to expand distribution of its Chicago Cubs, White Sox, Bulls and Blackhawks telecasts through syndication agreements with television stations in Illinois, Indiana and Iowa - primarily those affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV - that are within each team's designated market area (including sister stations WHO-DT (channel 13) in Des Moines and WQAD-TV (channel 8) in Moline, Illinois - respectively affiliated with NBC and ABC - which carry WGN's baseball telecasts on their respective Antenna TV- and MyNetworkTV-affiliated digital subchannels). Most notably, WISH-TV (channel 8) in Indianapolis reached agreements to carry the station's Cubs, White Sox and Blackhawks telecasts (as well as games from the former that are produced by WLS-TV) {{as part of its}} efforts to restore sports content to its lineup in the months following the loss of its CBS affiliation - ironically, to WGN-TV sister station WTTV (channel 4) - and its subsequent switch to The CW in January 2015. Some games also air on MyNetworkTV-affiliated sister WNDY-TV (channel 23) due to pre-emption limitations included in The CW's affiliation contracts.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} the {{relationship}} between urban form and law, regulation and policy in the built environment. It depicts the roots, the necessity and exponential growth of regulations across the urbanized world and portrays their effects on urban design and architecture. Through several contemporary case studies, this thesis investigates the power and flux of regulation on the formation of modern cities. It focuses on the hidden mechanisms that construct or dissemble cities, setting the argument for lawmaking {{as an act of}} design. Moreover, this thesis depict the design, deployment and operation of a Tangible Regulation Platform, a physical-technological apparatus made for the distilment of regulations. The platform is set to exemplify the effects of regulations on a <b>designated</b> <b>territory,</b> allowing planners, designers, stakeholders and community members a common ground for discussion and decision making. An accessible and self-explanatory tool, this platform illustrates the relationship between urban form and regulations, offering a seamless and transparent process of regulation-based urban design. Lastly, projecting on the foreseen future of law and urbanism, this thesis proposes an alternative data and performance-based approach for the making of new regulations. Beyond excelling the processes of design under regulations, this platform and other new tools are offered to help facilitate a discussion on the way future regulations will be devised, improving both the design processes and their final outcome. by Ariel Noyman.

40|$|Borders define {{jurisdiction}}s. To uphold borders is {{to claim}} jurisdiction; {{to claim the}} right to decide on the law. The nation state makes such a claim. It seeks jurisdiction over a particular territory. By implication, the nation state also acknowledges that other jurisdictions may apply beyond that territory. Borders work two-ways, and while they grant the nation state exclusive jurisdiction, they also limit the nation state’s claims to the <b>designated</b> <b>territory.</b> Supranationalism and multiculturalism undermine the idea of exclusive territorial jurisdiction. Supranationalism grants institutions the power to break through national borders and to overrule the nation state’s territorial arrangements. In this way, borders become increasingly porous. Multiculturalism, meanwhile, not only deligitimizes the nation state’s borders by weakening the collective identity of the people living behind them; it also encourages religious sub-groups to invoke rules from beyond the nation state’s borders, thereby undermining the very idea of territorial jurisdiction. ‘God’s heart has no borders’, to put it bluntly. Supranationalism and multiculturalism are thus antithetical to national sovereignty and to the borders therein implied. Supranationalism dilutes sovereignty, and so brings about the gradual dismantling of borders from the outside; multiculturalism weakens nationality, thus delegitimizing their existence altogether from the inside. !e idea of political organization that fundamentally opposes supranationalism and multiculturalism – the idea of the nation state – has been declared ‘outdated’ and ‘irrelevant’ by an overwhelming number of commentators. Yet while supranationalism and multiculturalism have dominated politics and academia over the last several decades, their popularity is questionable and debates about national identity divide most European countries at present.

40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of the {{research}} which went into the present study (a) to investigate the reasons {{for the establishment of a}} land settlement scheme in Newfoundland during the period, 1934 - 1942, and to examine the methods used to implement it;(b) to investigate the political, natural environmental (site, material resources) and human factors that contributed to failures or successes in particular settlements; (c) to examine the demographic and landscape structure of each of eight settlements initiated under the scheme both in the period of Government sponsorship and at the present time. From a geographical point of view the main problem was interpreted to require (a) a reconstruction of the spatial organization of the land settlements during their early years of development and (b) an examination of the sequential development of these same settlements from their present structure. [...] The study began during March 1969 with examination of the literature, the collection of data from the Commission of Government files contained in the Newfoundland Archives and government departments, and the interviewing of key personnel involved in the land settlement movement. During the period May - September 1969 field visits were made into each of the eight land settlements: Markland, Haricot, Lourdes, Midland, Brown's Arm, Sandringham, Winterland and Point au Mall, where informal interviews were conducted with as many original land settlers as possible. Formal questionaires were also completed for each household within the former <b>designated</b> <b>territory</b> established for land settlement. [...] It was found that the main purpose of the land settlement scheme was to relieve the problem of unemployment. In its initial stages the scheme proceeded purely as an experimental scheme without any clearly defined policy in such important matters as - site selection, settler selection, management, or land tenure. Though the scheme was reorganized as a result of policy changes implemented in 1939, the total program affected only a small proportion of the Newfoundland population, and more particularly, a very small proportion of families on relief. The prosperity that came with World War II appears to have done more to rehabilitate families who did enter the land settlements than the land settlement scheme itself. Since 1945 the land settlements appear to have evolved in much the same manner as other small settlements in Newfoundland, though each bears some population and landscape remnants of its origin...|$|E
