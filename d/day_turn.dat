5|$|Hunter Gordon Walker (Brown), who {{believes}} that Sam Winchester (Padalecki) will one <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> evil and become involved in a demonic war against humanity, escapes from prison. He tracks down Bela Talbot (Cohan)—a thief and frequent thorn in the Winchesters' sides—and threatens to kill her unless she reveals {{the location of the}} brothers. She refuses at first, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless mojo bag. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean (Ackles) capture the vampire Lucy (McNab), who has previously taken two victims. They interrogate her, and discover that another vampire named Dixon spiked her drink with his own blood at a club, transforming her. Dixon had taken her back to his home, but she escaped to feed. Lucy, still believing that she has only been drugged, is then killed by Dean, as there is no known cure for vampirism.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{makes her}} {{debut in the}} first season episode [...] "Evicted!" [...] and initially functions as an trickster antagonist, forcing Finn and Jake from their home. However, as the series progresses, Marceline becomes a close friend to Finn and Jake. Several backstory episodes have established that she was born to an unnamed human mother (voiced by Rebecca Sugar) and the demon Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Olivia's real-life father, Martin Olson). Furthermore, {{when she was a}} child, the cataclysmic Mushroom War occurred, and soon after she developed a father-daughter-like bond with Simon Petrikov, who would one <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> into the Ice King.|$|E

60|$|I am {{sure that}} had the fairy godmother {{appeared}} just then and touched Irene with her wand, David would have been interested rather than astonished. As for myself, I believe I have surprised this little girl's secret.

6000|$|Now Rupsen, the king, {{began by}} inquiring of himself why the Rajput had rated his {{services}} so highly. Then he reflected {{that if this}} recruit had asked so much money, {{it must have been}} for some reason which would afterwards become apparent. Next, he hoped that if he gave him so much, his generosity might some <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> out to his own advantage. Finally, with this idea in his mind, he summoned Birbal and the steward of his household, and said to the latter, [...] "Give this Rajput a thousand ounces of gold daily from our treasury." ...|$|E

Two years in the schools will make marvels of them. The lad will want more than that before he gains his full bulk and strength, but he will some <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> out such a gladiator as Rome has never seen; and if after a time we can find no champion to withstand him, we can match him against the lions. I will myself give Scopus orders concerning him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 19. I was at Court to-day, {{to speak}} to Lord Bolingbroke to look over Parnell's poem since it is corrected; and Parnell and I dined with him, and he has shown him three or four more places to alter a little. Lady Bolingbroke came down to us while we were at dinner, and Parnell stared {{at her as if}} she were a goddess. I thought she was like Parnell's wife, and he thought so too. Parnell is much pleased with Lord Bolingbroke's favour to him, and I hope it may one <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> to his advantage. His poem will be printed in a few days. Our weather {{continues}} as fresh raining as if it had not rained at all. I sat to-night at Lady Masham's, where Lord Treasurer came and scolded me for not dining with him. I told him I could not till Saturday. I have stayed there till past twelve. So nite dee sollahs, nite.|$|E
60|$|Their next {{visit was}} to WRIGGLE, a member for a {{metropolitan}} district, a disciple of Progress, who {{went with the}} times, but who took particular good care to ascertain their complexion; and whose movements if expedient could partake of a regressive character. As the Charter might some <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> up trumps as well as so many other unexpected cards and colours, Wriggle gave his adhesion to it, but of course only provisionally; provided that is to say, he might vote against it at present. But he saw no harm in it--not he, and {{should be prepared to}} support it when circumstances, that is to say the temper of the times, would permit him. More could hardly be expected from a gentleman in the delicate position in which Wriggle found himself at this moment, for he had solicited a baronetcy of the whigs, and had secretly pledged himself to Taper to vote against them on the impending Jamaica division.|$|E

His {{father had}} {{intended}} on him entering the clergy since childhood, and <b>Day's</b> <b>turn</b> to religion {{may have been}} an attempt to repair relations. He was ordained on 1 December 1580 and began serving as a vicar in Mundon, Essex. This did little to appease his father though, who wrote his deed to deprive Day of his inheritance. After his father's death in 1584, he successfully challenged the deed in court.|$|R
60|$|Lon McFane {{was a bit}} grumpy, what {{of losing}} his tobacco pouch, or else he might have told me, before we got to it, {{something}} about the cabin at Surprise Lake. All <b>day,</b> <b>turn</b> and turn about, we had spelled each other at going to the fore and breaking trail for the dogs. It was heavy snowshoe work, and did not tend to make a man voluble, yet Lon McFane might have found breath enough at noon, when we stopped to boil coffee, with which to tell me. But he didn’t. Surprise Lake? it was Surprise Cabin to me. I {{had never heard of}} it before. I confess I was a bit tired. I had been looking for Lon to stop and make camp any time for an hour; but I had too much pride to suggest making camp or to ask him his intentions; and yet he was my man, lured at a handsome wage to mush my dogs for me and to obey my commands. I guess I was a bit grumpy myself. He said nothing, and I was resolved to ask nothing, even if we tramped on all night.|$|E
60|$|The {{month of}} September wore itself away at Exeter very sadly. An {{attempt was made}} to bid Mrs. Western welcome back to her old home; but from the nature of the {{circumstances}} there could hardly be much heartiness in the attempt. Mrs. Thorne came over from Honiton to see her, but even between Cecilia and Maude Hippesley, who was certainly the most cherished of her Exeter friends, there could be no free confidence, although there was much sympathy. Mrs. Western could bring herself to speak evil to no one of her husband. She had, with much passion, told the entire story to her mother, but when her mother had begun to say hard words respecting him Cecilia had found it impossible to bear them. Had her mother taken Mr. Western's part, it may be doubted whether she could have endured that. There was no speech concerning him which was possible for her ears. She still looked forward to the chance of having him back again, and if he would come back, if he would take her back, then he should be entirely forgiven. He should be so forgiven that no mutual friend should have heard a word of reproach from her lips. She herself would know how hardly she had been used; but there should be no one to say that she had ever been heard to complain of her husband. Not the less was her heart full of wrath. Not the less did she during every hour of the <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> over in her thoughts the terrible injustice of which she had been the victim. But it can be understood that even to her old friend Maude Hippesley, who was now happy in her new home as Mrs. Thorne, she could not talk openly of the circumstances of her separation. But there was, alas, no other subject of such interest to her at the present moment as to give matter for free conversation.|$|E
6000|$|But his own actual {{business}} half an {{hour later}} was with a third floor on the Boulevard Malesherbes--so much as that was definite; {{and the fact of the}} enjoyment by the third-floor windows of a continuous balcony, to which he was helped by this knowledge, had perhaps something to do with his lingering for five minutes on the opposite side of the street. There were points as to which he had quite made up his mind, and one of these bore precisely on the wisdom of the abruptness to which events had finally committed him, a policy that he was pleased to find not at all shaken as he now looked at his watch and wondered. He HAD announced himself--six months before; had written out at least that Chad wasn't to be surprised should he see him some <b>day</b> <b>turn</b> up. Chad had thereupon, in a few words of rather carefully colourless answer, offered him a general welcome; and Strether, ruefully reflecting that he might have understood the warning as a hint to hospitality, a bid for an invitation, had fallen back upon silence as the corrective most to his own taste. He had asked Mrs. Newsome moreover not to announce him again; he had so distinct an opinion on his attacking his job, should he attack it at all, in his own way. Not the least of this lady's high merits for him was that he could absolutely rest on her word. She was the only woman he had known, even at Woollett, as to whom his conviction was positive that to lie was beyond her art. Sarah Pocock, for instance, her own daughter, though with social ideals, as they said, in some respects different--Sarah who WAS, in her way, aesthetic, had never refused to human commerce that mitigation of rigour; there were occasions when he had distinctly seen her apply it. Since, accordingly, at all events, he had had it from Mrs. Newsome that she had, at whatever cost to her more strenuous view, conformed, in the matter of preparing Chad, wholly to his restrictions, he now looked up at the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that if the case had been bungled the mistake was at least his property. Was there perhaps just a suspicion of that in his present pause on the edge of the Boulevard and well in the pleasant light? ...|$|E

50|$|The two {{living species}} thus seem to {{represent}} an entirely extinct and (as Passerida go) rather ancient lineage, as certainly as {{this can be}} said {{in the absence of}} actual fossils.
