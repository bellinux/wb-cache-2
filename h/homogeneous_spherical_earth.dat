25|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> {{appeared}} in Greek philosophy with Pythagoras (6th century BC), although most pre-Socratics (6th – 5th century BC) retained the flat Earth model. Aristotle provided evidence for the spherical shape of the Earth on empirical grounds by around 330 BC. Knowledge of the <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world from then on.|$|R

50|$|Early {{ideas about}} {{the figure of the}} Earth held the Earth to be flat (see flat Earth), and the heavens a {{physical}} dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth,</b> and that Polaris is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.|$|R
50|$|In the 15th century, the Spanish theologian Tostatus used what {{he thought}} was a {{reduction}} to absurdity arguing against a <b>spherical</b> <b>earth</b> using dogma, arguing that a <b>spherical</b> <b>earth</b> would imply the existence of antipodes, which would be impossible since this would require either that Christ has appeared twice, or that the inhabitants of the antipodes would be forever damned, which he claimed was an absurdity.|$|R
40|$|A <b>homogeneous</b> <b>spherical</b> {{polynomial}} (HSP) is {{the restriction}} to the sphere S^{n- 1 } of a homogeneous polynomial on the cartesian coordinates x_ 1,x_ 2, [...] x_n of R^n. A <b>homogeneous</b> <b>spherical</b> spline {{is a function}} that is an HSP within each element of a geodesic triangulation of S{n- 1 }. There has been considerable interest recently {{in the use of}} such splines for approximation of functions de ned on the sphere. In this paper we introduce the general (non-homogeneous) spherical splines and argue that they are a more natural approximating spaces for spherical functions than the homogeneous ones. It turns out that the space of general spherical polynomials of degree d is the direct sum of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>spherical</b> polynomials of degrees d and d- 1. We then generalize this decomposition result to polynomial splines defined on a geodesic triangulation (spherical simplicial decomposition) T of the sphere S^{n- 1 }, of arbitrary degree d and continuity order k...|$|R

50|$|The Flat Earth model {{gave way}} to an {{understanding}} of a <b>Spherical</b> <b>Earth.</b> Aristotle (384 - 322 BCE) provided observational arguments supporting the idea of a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth,</b> namely that different stars are visible in different locations, travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon, and the shadow of Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is round, and spheres cast circular shadows while discs generally do not.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Geometric {{spreading}} of Pn and Sn {{waves in}} a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model {{is different than}} that of classical headwaves and is frequency dependent. The behavior cannot be fully represented by a frequency-independent power-law model, as is com-monly assumed. The lack of an accurate representation of Pn and Sn geometric spread-ing in a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model impedes our ability to characterize Earth properties including anelasticity. We conduct numerical simulations to quantify Pn and Sn geometric spreading in a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model with constant mantle-lid velocities. Based on our simulation results, we present new empirical Pn and Sn geometric-spreading models in the form Gr; f 10 n 3 f=r 0 r 0 =rn 1 f logr 0 =rn 2 f and nif ni 1 logf=f 02 ni 2 logf=f 0 ni 3, where i 1, 2, or 3; r is epicentral distance; f is frequency; r 0 1 km; and f 0 1 Hz. We derive values of coefficients nij by fitting the model to computed Pn and Sn amplitudes for a <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> model having a 40 -km-thick crust, generic values of P and S velocities, and a constant-ve-locity uppermost mantle. We apply the new spreading model to observed data in Eur-asia to estimate average Pn attenuation, obtaining more reasonable results compared to using a standard power-law model. Our new Pn and Sn geometric-spreading models provide generally applicable reference behavior for <b>spherical</b> <b>Earth</b> models with con-stant uppermost-mantle velocities...|$|R
