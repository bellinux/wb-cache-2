Demand for the mirror outpaced his ability to manufacture them by hand resulting in outsourcing the manufacturing to that of injection molded plastic (3). Several other brands followed, initially designed for the bicycle industry then later as an industrial and tactical device. The success of mirrors mounted on bicycle helmets continued for decades, finally being adopted by construction and industrial workers as a safety device, on helmets of snowmobilers (3), and in tactical environments like Airsoft and SWAT applications adding a similar level of safety as mirrors on vehicles.|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} on the microbial contamination of orthodontic materials received from the manufacturer and if orthodontists pre-sterilise new products prior to use. These items may also become contaminated on the clinic or during laboratory construction. Recent regulations for decontamination in primary dental care (HTM 01 - 05) have been introduced requiring a 60 day limit for storage time of sterilised instruments. The aims of this investigation were to determine whether components of fixed and removable orthodontic appliances are free from microbial contamination prior to clinical use; to establish the current practice in orthodontics with regard to pre- sterilisation of new products and to investigate possible re-contamination of sterilised dental instruments. A range of orthodontic materials "as received" from the manufacturer and "bench-top exposed" items were investigated. Bacterial contamination during the construction of removable appliances was evaluated from initial impression, through to delivery of the final appliance. Molecular microbiological techniques were used to obtain bacterial DGGE profiles and facilitate 16 S rDNA identification. Questionnaires were distributed to consultant orthodontists to determine their current pre-sterilisation regimes for new orthodontic products. Twenty five <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> were sterilised. These were tested (5 mirrors at each time point) for microbial contamination immediately after autoclaving and then at 31, 60, 90 and 124 days. Bacteria were isolated from "as received" bands, archwires and impression trays, but the level of contamination was low (0 - 3. 65 x 102 cfu ml"). This was similar for clinic items. Much higher levels were found on removable appliances (0. 97 x 102 - 1. 52 xl 03 cfu mll). There was no cross-contamination from patients to the laboratory; contamination occurred within the laboratory itself. The majority of consultant-led departments do not pre-sterilise materials from the manufacturer (88 - 97 %). There was no bacterial growth from sterilised <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> after 5 days of incubation at 37 °C at any time period from 0 to 124 days post sterilisation. In conclusion, materials and appliances are not free from bacterial contamination prior to use in patients; improved cross infection control procedures are needed within the orthodontic laboratory. There is no current evidence for the 60 -day storage of sterilised dental instruments as advised by the Department of Health. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|García {{was born}} on 17 March 1805 either in Madrid, as has been {{traditionally}} stated, or {{in the town of}} Zafra in Badajoz Province, Spain. His father was singer and teacher Manuel del Pópulo Vicente Rodriguez García (Manuel García I, 1775-1832). His sisters were Maria Malibran (1808-1836) and Pauline Viardot (1821-1910). After abandoning his onstage career as a baritone, García began to teach at the Paris Conservatory (1830-48) and the Royal Academy of Music, London (1848-95). Jessie Bond, Camille Everardi, Erminia Frezzolini, Julius Günther, Jenny Lind, Mathilde Marchesi, Christina Nilsson, Julia Ettie Crane, Julius Stockhausen, Marie Tempest, and Henry Wood were among his pupils. He invented a laryngoscope in 1854 and the next year published observations of his own larynx and vocal cords made with a small <b>dental</b> <b>mirror</b> introduced into the throat and using sunlight reflected by another mirror. García was interested in movements connected with the production of the singing voice and did not anticipate the importance of laryngoscopy for medicine. Still, the University of Königsberg conferred upon him the honorary degree of M.D. He died in London in 1906 at the age of 101 years and was buried in the churchyard of St. Edward's Catholic church in Sutton Green, Surrey. His grave gives details of his many famous pupils and accomplishments.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to assess the prevalence rate of caries on individual permanent tooth surfaces, and to compare individual tooth surface caries rates among gender and age groups. Methods: Without drying the teeth, examinations were performed with <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> and blunt, sickle-shaped explorers under a dental chair light, according to WHO recommendations. Results: Caries distribution was higher in the maxillary jaw (62. 4 %) than in the mandibular jaw (37. 6 %). Except molars, approximal surfaces of all teeth demonstrated the highest caries rates, ranging from 58. 5 % to 77. 5 %. Occlusal fissures on the first and second molars contributed most significantly to caries frequency, from 52. 7 % to 66. 3 %. Females (59. 1 %) showed a higher incidence of caries than males (40. 9 %). Approximal surfaces of incisors, canines, premolars and occlusal fissure sites in molars showed the highest caries rates in both sexes. Caries were most common among individuals aged 17 to 25 years. Approximal surfaces of incisors, canines, premolars and occlusal surfaces in molars had the highest caries rates in all age groups, except for individuals older than 65 years of age. Conclusions: Gender and age do not affect the prevalence of caries on teeth sites. In addition, more caries are experienced in younger age groups, and their incidence decreases as age increases...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Purpose: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of a fifteen minute educational intervention on the ability of pediatric medical residents to detect caries during a thirty second oral exam. The secondary {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate attitudes and opinions regarding the training and integration of dentistry into medicine among the participating pediatric medical residents. Methods: Physicians enrolled in pediatric residency were recruited to participate in a survey and teaching intervention. The survey was administered to 38 first year residents. A total of 7 pediatric residents participated in the intervention. For the intervention each performed a preliminary oral examination of 2 different child volunteers, identifying the number of carious teeth. A 15 minute teaching intervention was then administered to participants by the primary researcher. Afterwards, each participant performed an oral examination on 2 different children with the use of a <b>dental</b> <b>mirror,</b> identifying the number of carious teeth. Descriptive statistics were calculated for resident survey responses pre and post intervention. Carious lesions detected pre and post intervention were also assessed (Stata 12. 1). Additionally, descriptive survey statistics were calculated for first year residents who did not participate in the intervention and only completed the survey. Results: There was a reduction in net difference of carious teeth identified after the intervention, however participants misidentified carious lesions before and after the intervention. Survey responses indicated that major barriers to <b>dental</b> <b>mirror</b> use include inadequate training and lack of availability of mirrors. Conclusions: The <b>dental</b> <b>mirror</b> training intervention did not appear to have an impact on the accuracy of identification of dental caries by pediatric residents. Attitudes and opinions regarding oral health may affect the acceptance of limited and focused dental education training. Multiple barriers exist to the integration of dentistry into medicine.

Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate dental health status in 12 -year olds in urban and rural populations in Banja Luka and determine possible risk factors in their oral health behavior. Subjects and Methods: The study involved 496 children, 12 -year-old pupils in primary schools in urban and rural regions of Banja Luka. Dental checkup was performed in classrooms at day light and using <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> and probes. Caries prevalence was analyzed using the Klein-Palmer system to obtain the mean decayed teeth values for the two regions. The pupils filled in questionnaires about their socioeconomic status, motivation and knowledge on oral health as well as oral hygiene and dietary habits. Results: High mean decayed teeth values were obtained in the rural population of pupils (4. 89 and 6. 74). Questionnaire data showed statistically significant differences regarding dental visits, fluoride prophylaxis, the frequency of tooth brushing and the age when pupils started to maintain oral hygiene.

A recent italian study {{has shown that the}} only demonstrable risk factor in 9 % of acute C/NANB hepatitis is dental treatment. There are no data on direct contamination by HCV of dental surgeries. Possible environmental contamination by HCV-RNA was investigated in dental surgeries after treatment of anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positive patients. Thirty-five anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positive patients with chronic hepatitis underwent dental treatment and were enrolled in this study. Eight had chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), 23 chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and 4 cirrhosis. A total of 328 samples collected from instruments and surfaces were tested after dental treatment of 35 anti-HCV positive patients. The presence of HCV-RNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to evaluate contamination of instruments and surfaces in dental surgeries.

Since the last territority-wide dental survey of Hong Kong {{preschool}} children was conducted in 2001, a survey to update the information is necessary. This study aimed to describe the dental caries experience of preschool children in Hong Kong and factors affecting their dental caries status. Methods A stratified random sample of children from seven kindergartens in Hong Kong was surveyed in 2009. Ethical approval from IRB and parental consent was obtained. Clinical examinations {{of the children were}} performed by two calibrated examiners using disposable <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors,</b> an intra-oral LED light and ball-ended periodontal probes. A questionnaire to investigate possible explanatory factors for caries status was completed by the children’s parents. Caries experience was recorded using the dmft index. Multifactor-ANOVA was used to study the relationship between dental caries experience, and the background and oral health-related behaviours of the children. Results Seven hundred children (53 % boys), mean age 5. 3 ± 0. 7 [*]years were examined. The mean dmft score of the surveyed children was 2. 2 and 51 % of them had no caries experience (dmft = 0).

40|$|Objective: To compare caries status {{assessment}} of posterior teeth of young Chinese adults by using clinical examination alone {{and with the}} supplemental use of bitewing radiographs. Methods: Two calibrated dentists examined the posterior teeth of 200 Chinese university students (aged 18 - 24 years) using <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> and probes under optimal lighting. Caries was diagnosed by visual detection of carious cavities. Duplicate examinations were performed to monitor intra- and inter-examiner variations. Bitewing radiographs were taken and examined by an independent dentist. Caries was recorded when a lesion extended into dentine. Results: Among the 3, 162 posterior teeth examined, 113 were detected with caries. More than one third (35. 4 %) of the caries found in the posterior teeth was not detected from reading the radiographs but was detected by clinical examination. About half (51. 4 %) of the caries {{was found on the}} bitewing radiographs only, leaving 13. 2 % being detected by using either method. With the supplement of bitewing radiographs, there was a 105 % {{increase in the number of}} carious lesions detected. This leads to a correction factor of 1. 13 for adjustment of the mean DMFT score obtained from conducting clinical examinations alone. Conclusion: Due to the significant number of clinically undetected carious cavities in these young Chinese adults who live in a community with water fluoridation, it may be advisable to use a correction factor to adjust the caries experience obtained from epidemiological surveys when bitewing radiographs are not available. © 2008 FDI/World Dental Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Mucosal anomalies incidence may be varied in different individuals, which {{can be related to}} many genetic and environmental elements. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the developmental anomalies of oral mucosa in the patients referred to department of Oral Medicine of Hamadan Dentistry faculty in 2014. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the developmental anomalies of oral mucosa were studied in 800 patients, who referred to Hamadan School of Dentistry in Iran. All the 800 patients were clinically examined using <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> on the dentistry unit in regard with diagnosis of mucosal anomalies. Demographic data and types of mucosal anomalies were recorded in a predesigned questionnaire. In order to analyze the study data, SPSS software (ver, 16) was applied via chi-square test at significance level of 0. 05. Results: Oral developmental lesions were observed in 700 patients (87. 5 %). The most common lesion was reported as fissured tongue (50. 9 %), followed by Fordyce granules (49. 5 %), Macroglossia (17 %), torousplatinus (13. 4 %). A significant association was detected between fissured tongue, macroglosia,fordice granule with gender and age, Varicosities and furred tongue with age and Torus palatines, Comissural lip pit and hairy tongue with gender.

40|$|Session - Oral Health ResearchOBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the oral health and oral hygiene habits of Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong who had cerebral palsy. METHODS: Students aged 12 years or above studying in three special schools of the Hong Kong Spastic Association were invited for this study. Parental consent was obtained and medical history of the subjects was checked before the examination. They were examined in the schools using <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors,</b> CPI probes and an intra-oral fiber-optic light. Information on the subject's oral hygiene habits was collected in an interview. RESULTS: From the 89 children invited, 65 (36 boys and 29 girls) participated in this survey. Their mean age was 15. 0 ± 2. 0 years. Most of them, 74 %, were spastic. About half (49 %) had mild mental retardation and 29 % were moderately retarded. They all practiced daily toothbrushing and about one third used mouthrinse. None of the surveyed students had healthy gum {{and more than half}} (57 %) had calculus. Only one-third of them had caries experience in their permanent dentition and the mean DMFT score was 1. 2 ± 1. 9. No significant differences in caries experience were found between boys and girls, and between those who were mentally retarded and those who were normal.

40|$|Oral PresentationSession 22 : P 2 Conference Theme: We are the FutureObjective: {{to explore}} the risk factors of severe ECC among the Hong Kong {{preschool}} children who have dental caries. Methods: All children attending grade 1 in 16 kindergartens in different districts in Hong Kong were screened. Ethical approval from IRB and parental consent was obtained. Children {{with at least one}} carious cavity were selected and clinically examined by a trained examiner using disposable <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors,</b> periodontal probes and an intra-oral LED light in the kindergartens. The visible plaque index (VPI) and the dmfs index were used for recording the oral hygiene and dental caries status, respectively. Information about the children‘s demographic and socio-economic background (such as age, place of birth, parent’s education level, family income), and oral health related behaviors (such as tooth brushing habit, frequency of snacking) was collected by a questionnaire completed by their parents. Results: A total of 359 children {{with a mean age of}} 40. 7 months (SD= 3. 7) were included in this study. Around half (48 %) of them had severe ECC (defined as having a dmfs score more than 3) while 52 % had a dmfs score of 1 to 3 (non-severe ECC). The mean dmfs scores were 1. 4 and 10. 0 in non-severe ECC and severe ECC groups, respectively. Over 95 % of the decayed teeth in both groups were untreated. Maxillary incisors had the highest caries prevalence at 39 %. Results of a backward stepwise logistic regression analysis found that only two variables, namely family income and VPI, remained in the final model (Chi-square= 27. 2; df= 3; p 0. 05). Conclusion: Low family income and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for severe ECC among preschool children with dental caries in Hong Kong...|$|R
40|$|Session - Cariology ResearchAIM: To {{describe}} {{the precision of}} diagnosis of fissure caries into dentine by clinical examination, taking bitewing radiograph, and using a qualitative laser-induced fluorescence detection device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were recruited from university students who had signs of early caries in the fissures of their molars found in an oral health screening programme. Two calibrated dentists performed a visual and then tactile examination by using portable fiber-optic light, <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> and sharp explorers. Bitewing radiographs were taken and scanned into a computer. The images were viewed for signs of dental caries. Status of the fissures in the molars were assessed using a laser-induced fluorescence detection device (DIAGNOdent, KaVo). Biopsy was performed during the restorative treatment of the clinically diagnosed carious fissures and this {{was used as the}} reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic methods, as well as the optimal cut-off point for DIAGNOdent reading were calculated. RESULTS: This study involved 145 first and second permanent molars in 41 subjects. The sensitivity & specificity of using visual examination, tactile probing, DIAGNOdent reading (> 35) and bitewing radiograph to diagnose fissure caries into dentine were 16 & 100, 89 & 44, 75 & 75 and 2 & 100, respectively. The diagnosis by a combination of tactile probing and DIAGNOdent reading had a sensitivity & specificity of 71 & 90. CONCLUSION: Tactile probing had a high sensitivity but a low specificity for detecting fissure caries into dentine while visual examination and bitewing radiograph had the reverse. Caries diagnosis based on the combined findings from tactile probing and qualitative laser-induced fluorescence detection had a good level for both sensitivity and specificity. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 21 st International Association for Dental Research (Southeast Asia Division) & 18 th Southeast Asia Association for Dental Education (SAADE) Annual Scientific Meeting, Bali, Indonesia, 6 - 8 September 2007...|$|R
40|$|Session 411 : Oral Epidemiology IIIPoster PresentationObjectives: To {{describe}} the dental and periodontal status of 12 -year-old Bulang children in China and the factors affecting their oral health status. Methods: An oral health {{survey was conducted}} in 2011 - 2012 with ethical approval. A sample of 12 -year-old Bulang (an ethnic minority group) children living in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, was selected using a multi-stage and stratified sampling method. One trained dentist examined the children in primary schools using <b>dental</b> <b>mirrors</b> attached to an intra-oral LED light and ball-ended CPI probes. Dental caries and periodontal status were assessed using criteria recommended by World Health Organization. A self-completed questionnaire was used to collect information regarding the children’s socio-demographic background and oral health related behaviors. Results: A total of 873 children (437 boys and 436 girls) were surveyed, and 34 % of them had caries experience in their permanent dentition. Their mean DMFT score was 0. 6 (SD= 1. 1) and 94 % of the score was contributed by untreated decayed teeth (DT). Most (91 %) children brushed their teeth at least once daily; {{but many of them}} had gingival bleeding on probing (69 %) and calculus (58 %). Only 30 % of them had no gingival bleeding nor calculus. About 28 % of the children took sweet snacks daily. More than half (58 %) of the children had toothache but only 26 % of them had visited a dentist. A multifactor-ANOVA analysis found that DMFT score was higher in girls and those who had toothache within a year. Conclusions: The prevalence and severity of dental caries experience among the 12 -year-old Bulang children in China was not high, but most of the decayed teeth were untreated. Their caries experience was associated with gender and incidence of toothache. Besides, their oral hygiene and periodontal health status was unsatisfactory...|$|R
