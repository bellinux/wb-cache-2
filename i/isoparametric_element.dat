Though {{numerical}} techniques such as reduced-integration or selective reduced-integration are used to avoid this effect, they do not necessarily guarantee {{the solution to the}} problem, even if they increase notably the possibility of convergence with the exact solution. In the present formulation, a new four-noded stiffened-plate bending element, having the elegance of the <b>isoparametric</b> <b>element</b> to model the arbitrary shape of the plate but without any numerical disturbing feature like shear-locking problem, is presented. Another unique feature is the arbitrary placement of the stiffener inside the plate element without any restriction of its orientation. Stiffened plates having various shapes, boundary conditions, and disposition of stiffeners are analyzed and compared with available results in the literature wherever possible...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of deformation into zones of intense shearing, known as shear bands, {{is a common}} phenomenon in inelastic deformation. The modeling of this phenomenon by the finite element method is hampered {{by a number of}} factors; the lack of a priori knowledge of the location, direction, and onset of the localized zones, and the inability of conventional <b>isoparametric</b> <b>elements</b> to model the high strain gradients which occur in these zones. This study develops new techniques for the finite element modeling of strain localization. Special <b>isoparametric</b> <b>elements</b> with enhanced strain fields derived from incompatible modes are developed to model the high gradients which occur during strain localization. The incompatible modes are modified to insure that the derived element stiffness satisfies the patch test, thereby preserving the convergence properties of the parent element. Use of these elements in place of conventional <b>isoparametric</b> <b>elements</b> allows equivalent results to be obtained with much less computational effort. Additionally, simple criteria predict the onset, direction, and location of the strain localization, allowing the enhanced elements to be used only when and where they are needed, further reducing the computational effort. Numerical experiments elucidate the effectiveness of the new formulation.
