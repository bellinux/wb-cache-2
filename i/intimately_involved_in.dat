5|$|Sergei Kirov, {{head of the}} Party {{organisation}} in Leningrad, {{was killed}} in 1934; some believed Stalin ordered his death. Kirov's death triggered a second crisis, the Great Purge. In 1938, out of the 28 People's Commissars in Molotov's Government, 20 were executed on the orders of Molotov and Stalin. The purges were carried out by Stalin's successive police chiefs, Nikolai Yezhov was the chief organiser and Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich and Molotov were <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the processes. Stalin frequently required Molotov and other Politburo members to sign the death warrants of prominent purge victims, and Molotov always did so without question.|$|E
5|$|The German-speaking {{scientists}} who isolated and described vitaminK (in addition to naming it as such) {{did so because}} the vitamin is <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the coagulation of blood following wounding (from the German word Koagulation). At the time, most (but not all) of the letters from F through to J were already designated, so {{the use of the}} letter K was considered quite reasonable. The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins, as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B-complex.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something out of the ordinary by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E

New component characteristics require a more integrated approach to radiation tolerance in system design. The Mars Observer Camera performance requirements could not be met with a design restricted to components of established radiation hardness. A balanced approach that <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> radiation effects <b>in</b> the system design process was required. This included low-cost, quick turnaround testing of total ionizing dose and heavy ion induced single event phenomena of upset and latchup. The results were used to inform the system design, which had to adapt to real component susceptibilities. Test results directly affected component selection, radiation shielding, and the data path and software architectures...|$|R
5|$|The King lent {{support to}} Fisher, {{in part because}} he disliked Beresford, and {{eventually}} Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained. The King was <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, who had retired in 1907.

40|$|Mammalian {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) {{signalling}} and macroautophagy (henceforth autophagy) regulate numerous pathological and physiological processes including cellular responses to altered nutrient levels. However, the mechanisms regulating mTOR and autophagy remain incompletely understood. Lysosomes are dynamic intracellular organelles 1, 2 <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> both <b>in</b> the activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC 1) signalling and in degrading autophagic substrates 3 - 8. Here {{we report that}} lysosomal positioning coordinates anabolic and catabolic responses to changes in nutrient availability by orchestrating early plasma membrane signalling events, mTORC 1 signalling and autophagy. Activation of mTORC 1 by nutrients correlates with its presence on peripheral lysosomes that are physically close to the upstream signalling modules, while starvation causes perinuclear clustering of lysosomes, driven by changes in intracellular pH (pHi). Lysosomal positioning regulates mTORC 1 signalling, which, in turn, influences autophagosome formation. Lysosome positioning also influences autophagosome-lysosome fusion rates, and thus controls autophagic flux by acting both at the initiation and termination stages of the process. Our findings provide a fundamental physiological role for the dynamic state of lysosomal positionin...|$|R

Willow is locked in an aerial battle with the vampire witch Kumiko, who reveals that they are both students of the unknown power Saga Vasuki and thus knows the counters to her spells. However, Willow turns this advantage against Kumiko by tapping into Kumiko's mind. Whether the spell had its intended effect is not clear, but Willow is plunged into {{a vision of a}} burning city, the Scythe, and the snake woman Willow was shown <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> with <b>in</b> Sephrilian's vision in 'Anywhere But Here'. The snake woman calls her 'Darling Willow' and asks if Willow thought she couldn't find her. She also asks if she thought she could hide from who she is and what is to come. Willow emerges from the vision and passes out, but the spell leaves Kumiko seemingly unaffected. As Willow begins to lose consciousness, Buffy steels herself, then jumps from the penthouse to stab Kumiko midair. She and an unconscious Willow continue falling.|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{immunity}} in both {{mouse and}} man {{results in the}} generation of immunological memory. Memory T cells are both friend and foe to transplant recipients, as they are <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> and <b>in</b> many cases absolutely required {{for the maintenance of}} protective immunity in the face immunosuppression, yet from the evidence presented herein they clearly constitute a formidable barrier for the successful implementation of tolerance induction strategies in transplantation. This review describes the experimental evidence demonstrating the increased resistance of memory T cells to many distinct tolerance induction strategies, and outlines recent advances in our knowledge {{of the ways in which}} alloreactive memory T cells arise in previously untransplanted individuals. Understanding the impact of alloreactive memory T cell specificity, frequency, and quality might allow for better donor selection in order to minimize the donor-reactive memory T cell barrier in an individual transplant recipient, thus allowing stratification of relative risk of alloreactive memory T cell mediated rejection, and conversely increase the likelihood of successful establishment of tolerance. However, further research into the molecular and cellular pathways <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> alloreactive memory T cell-mediated rejection is required in order to design new strategies to overcome the memory T cell barrier, without critically impairing protective immunity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{structure}} in solution of a Œ≤-loop in mutant Y 41 H of the single-stranded DNA binding protein encoded by gene-V of the filamentous phage M 13 has been elucidated using 2 -dimensional 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Furthermore, these studies {{enabled us to}} demonstrate that an identical structural element is present in wild-type gene-V-protein and that this element <b>intimately</b> is <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the binding of gene-V-protein to single-stranded DNA.

The structure is, however, identical to that of the DNA binding wing present in the single-stranded DNA binding protein encoded by the genome of the evolutionary distantly related filamentous phage IKe. The latter observations support our current view that in the binding of these proteins to single-stranded DNA a common structural motif is involved...|$|R

40|$|A {{particular}} {{strength of}} agile approaches {{is that they}} move away from ‚Äòintroverted‚Äô development and <b>intimately</b> <b>involve</b> the customer <b>in</b> all areas of development, supposedly leading {{to the development of}} a more innovative and hence more valuable information system. However, we argue that a single customer representative is too narrow a focus to adopt and that involvement of stakeholders beyond the software development itself is still often quite weak and in some cases non-existent. In response, we argue that current thinking regarding innovation in agile development needs to be extended to include multiple stakeholders outside the business unit. This paper explores the intra-organisational applicability and implications of open innovation in agile systems development. Additionally, it argues for a different perspective of project management that includes collaboration and knowledge-sharing with other business units, customers, partners, and other relevant stakeholders pertinent to the business success of an organisation, thus embracing open innovation principles...|$|R
40|$|Until about 3 decades ago, {{conflict}} between couples‚Äîeven when it involved vio-lence-was considered essentially a private matter, {{beyond the scope}} of govern-ment intervention. In this chapter I sketch the broad outlines of the landscape of the current policy response to different types of couple conflict, and to the sepa-rate but related issue of domestic violence. I then raise a few of the questions and issues that I believe need to be addressed in the future. Couple conflict has several different meanings and outcomes. Dictionary defi-nitions usually distinguish between conflict as a prolonged battle, struggle, or clash between at least two parties, and conflict as a controversy, difference, or disagreement. In the latter sense of difference and disagreement, some degree of conflict is woven into the fabric of every relationship between two <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> indi-viduals.

500|$|Final Fantasy VI entered {{development}} {{after the}} release of its predecessor Final Fantasy V in December 1992. The development of the game took just one year to be completed. Series creator and director Hironobu Sakaguchi could not be as <b>intimately</b> <b>involved</b> as <b>in</b> previous installments due to his other projects and his promotion to Executive Vice President of the company in 1991. For that reason, he became the producer and split director responsibilities for Final Fantasy VI up between Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito: Kitase was in charge of event production and the scenario, while Ito handled all battle aspects. Sakaguchi supervised Kitase's cutscene direction and ensured that the project would coalesce as a whole. The idea behind the story of Final Fantasy VI was that every character is the protagonist. All members of the development team contributed ideas for characters and their [...] "episodes" [...] for the overall plot in what Kitase described as a [...] "hybrid process". Consequently, Terra and Locke were conceived by Sakaguchi; Celes and Gau by Kitase; Shadow and Setzer by graphic director Tetsuya Nomura; and Edgar and Sabin by field graphic designer Kaori Tanaka. Then it was Kitase's task to unite the story premise provided by Sakaguchi with all the individual ideas for character episodes to create a cohesive narrative. The scenario of Final Fantasy VI was written by a group of four or five people, among them Kitase who provided key elements of the story, such as the opera scene and Celes' suicide attempt, as well as all of Kefka's appearances.|$|R
