40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis {{is to find}} out an {{incidence}} and prevalence of Microsporidia infection in uncooked cow´s milk. Samples of milk, faeces and urine from 147 milk cows were screened. One of them was positive for presence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi in sample of milk and stool repeatedly. Theoretic part includes information about Microsporidia, e. g. developmental cycle, transfer and course of disease, treatment and prevention. There is a description of heat treatment of milk as well. A methodical procedure of microsporidia DNA detection from samples of milk, feaces or urine is described in the practical part. The thesis is focused on experimental verification of sterilizing capabilities of various pasteurization methods. Milk was contaminated by Encephalitozoon cuniculi and then heat treatment according to the methods used in practice followed. Contaminated milk was offered to laboratory immunodeficient SCID mice. After three weeks mice were put to death and their organs were examined for the presence of Microsporidia DNA using molecular methods. Finding out of Microsporidia in examined organs was the evidence of insuffient <b>heat</b> <b>treatement...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the archaeal elongation factor 1 α from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsEF– 1 α) and some eubacterial ligands, such as eubacterial antibiotics, tetracycline and pulvomycin, and the modified guanosine nucleotide ppGpp was investigated. SsEF– 1 α had already been characterised for its structural and functional properties in the laboratory where the research work was carried out. This ubiquitous protein presents structural properties more similar to the eubacterial counterpart and functional propertis more similar to the eukaryal ones. Tetracycline and pulvomycin are eubacterial antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. Tetracycline prevents the binding of aa–tRNA to the A site of the ribosome, whereas pulvomycin inhibits {{the formation of the}} ternary complex between the elongation factor Tu (EF–Tu), GTP and aa–tRNA. The {{interaction between}} SsEF– 1 α and these antibiotics was demonstrated either by fluorescence spectroscopy in the aromatic region of the spectrum of this protein or by the effects produced by the antibiotic on some functional properties of the elongation factor. The results indicated that both antibiotics were able to inhibit archaeal protein synthesis and that pulvomycin, but not tetracycline, was able to reduce the affinity of SsEF– 1 α for aa–tRNA in presence of GTP. Moreover, tetracycline produced an increase in GDP/GTP exchange rate and a slight inhibition of the intrinsic GTPase; vice versa, in the presence of pulvomycin, the exchange rate was higher for both guanosine nucleotides and a stimulation of GTPase activity was observed. Furthermore, the interaction between SsEF– 1 α and tetracycline caused a reduction of stability to the heat treatment, whereas pulvomycin exerted a protective effect on the elongation factor against chemical denaturation. Regarding fluorescence spectroscopy, in the presence of tetracycline an increase in the quantum yield in the fluorescence spectrum of SsEF– 1 α was observed. A similar behaviour was also observed for Ss(GM) EF– 1 α but not for Ss(G) EF– 1 α, two engineered forms of the elongation factor; these results indicated that the M–domain is essential for the interaction with tetracycline. Pulvomycin, instead, exerted a strong fluorescence quenching at λmax which was accompanied by the appearance of a new peak at 360 nm for all proteins analysed, suggesting that the intact form of SsEF– 1 α is required for the interaction. ppGpp, also called "magic spot I", is a molecule involved in the “Stringent Control” both in eubacteria and plants during amino acid starvation. It is a compound structurally similar to GDP, characterised by the presence of an additional diphosphate group, bound through a phosphoester bond to the oxygen in position 3 ’ of ribose. The interaction between SsEF– 1 α and this molecule was investigated because ppGpp was found bound to a recombinant form of the elongation factor, used for crystallographic studies. ppGpp was able to inhibit in vitro protein synthesis; the affinity of SsEF– 1 α for aa–tRNA in presence of the nucleotide tetra–phosphate resulted intermediate between that for GDP and GTP. Moreover, ppGpp reduced the affinity of SsEF– 1 α for guanosine nucleotides through a competitive mechanism. Regarding the effect on the intrisic GTPase, the presence of ppGpp caused an increase of Km with any variation in kcat, indicating also in this case a competitive inhibition behaviour. Finally, the presence of the nucleotide tetra–phosphate rendered SsEF– 1 α more stable to <b>heat</b> <b>treatement.</b> In conclusion, the data presented demonstrated an {{interaction between the}} archaeal elongation factor 1 α from Sulfolobus solfataricus and some eubacterial ligands. These results could be used as probe to investigate phylogenetic relationship among living domain...|$|E
40|$|Supported Pd nanocatalysts were {{prepared}} by deposition of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) onto spherical mesoporous carbon beads (MB) functionalized by <b>heating</b> or acidic <b>treatement</b> (namely commercial MB, MB- 1500 for heating treatment and MB-H 2 O 2 for acidic one). The Pd NPs were synthesized by decomposition of [Pd 2 (dba) 3] (dba: dibenzylideneacetone) under dihydrogen either {{directly on the}} carbon supports without stabilizer leading to naked Pd NPs (Pd/MB series) or in solution {{in the presence of}} a polymer (PVP) or triphenylphosphine (TPP) as a stabilizer to obtain stable colloidal solutions that were further used to impregnate the carbon materials to have carbon-deposited Pd NPs (respectively Pd/PVP/H 2 and Pd/TPP/H 2). The so-obtained nanocatalysts displayed a Pd loading from 0. 5 to 14. 8 wt% and were characterized by different techniques (nitrogen physisorption at 77 K, H 2 -chemissorption and TPD, XRD, XPS and HRTEM). Their catalytic performance in deoxygenation of oleic acid was evaluated in batch and flow reaction conditions. Under batch conditions, it appeared that the extent of the reaction depended on the Pd loading, Pd dispersion on the MB supports and on Pd reduction state showing an influence of the support and the preparation of the catalyst. No aromatic compounds were detected as side products, but in the case of the Pd/MB series, octadecanol and octadecane were formed in large extents indicating a deoxygenation mechanism in which the hydrocarbons were produced via both decarbonylation/decarboxylation and dehydration. However, dehydration was detected only with Pd/MB catalyst containing naked Pd NPs, where cooperation between the Pd metal and oxidic support functional groups is possible, while on the Pd/TPP and Pd/PVP series, i. e. the catalysts exposing small Pd NPs, the decarbonylation/decarboxylation was the only deoxygenation route. Under flow conditions, except for the Pd/MB series, the conversion of stearic acid was superior for all the catalysts compared to batch conditions. The maximum in performance was achieved after only 0. 5 h. Afterwards, the yields in heptadecane suffered a severe decrease up to 3 h reaction time. However, at that time, stopping the feeding of the reactor with oleic acid and flushing the catalyst only with mesitylene allowed to recover the activity and the selectivity of the catalysts. Further experiments carried out in mixtures of H 2 /N 2 or in pure N 2 highlighted the strong role of dihydrogen ratios. Working with a 2. 5 : 1 N 2 /H 2 mixture is crossing out the dehydration route and even no traces of octadecanol nor octadecane have been detected. Then, complete removal of H 2 gave heptadecene in a high excess compared to heptadecane (almost 7 to 1) thus suggesting the decarbonylation/decarboxylation steps as the main route. ICP-OES measurements indicated no leaching of palladium and simple washing of catalysts with mesitylene allowed recycling without any change in conversion or product distribution. Noteworthy, mesitylene as solvent was completely recovered in the reaction products and exhibited no effect in this reaction...|$|R
