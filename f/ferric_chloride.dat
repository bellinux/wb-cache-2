40|$|Pure {{magnetite}} nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4) {{have been}} synthesised in water : by coprecipitation using two different approaches (from ferrous sulphate and {{a mixture of}} ferrous and <b>ferric</b> <b>chlorides).</b> All materials aggregated in aqueous suspension, but their subsequent dispersion on treatment {{with a variety of}} agents was observed to be different.

5|$|Iron(III) chloride, {{also called}} <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride,</b> is an {{industrial}} scale commodity chemical compound, with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the +3 oxidation state. The colour of iron(III) chloride crystals {{depends on the}} viewing angle: by reflected light the crystals appear dark green, but by transmitted light they appear purple-red. Anhydrous iron(III) chloride is deliquescent, forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air.

5|$|The <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> test is a {{traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The mixture is filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E

The corroded and inhibited iron surfaces were characterized by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray investigations. Results obtained revealed that {{the addition of the}} inhibitor decreased the pitting and uniform corrosion reactions of iron in aerated 3. 5 % NaCl solutions. This effect was found to increase by increasing the concentration of the inhibitor from 0. 5 mM to 2. 0 mM due to the adsorption of its molecules onto iron preventing the formation of ferrous and <b>ferric</b> <b>chlorides</b> and blocking flawed areas on the electrode surface.

40|$|Potassium ferrate (K 2 FeO 4) is a multi-functional green reagent {{for water}} {{treatment}} with considerable combined effectiveness in oxidization, disinfection, coagulation, sterilization, adsorption, and deodorization, producing environment friendly Fe(III) end-products during the reactions. This study uses a simple method to lower Fe(VI) preparation cost by recycling iron from a spent steel pickling liquid as an iron source for preparing potassium ferrate {{with a wet}} oxidation method. The recycled iron is in powder form of ferrous (93 %) and <b>ferric</b> <b>chlorides</b> (7 %), as determined by X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectrum (XANES) simulation. The synthesis method involves three steps, namely, oxidation of ferrous/ferric ions to form ferrate with NaOCl under alkaline conditions, substitution of sodium with potassium to form potassium ferrate, and continuously washing impurities with various organic solvents off the in-house ferrate. Characterization of the in-house product with various instruments, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), proves that product quality and purity are comparative to a commercialized one.

The binding of human recombinant prion protein (huPrPrec) to the surface of these nanoparticles was confirmed by FTIR and the size and structures of the particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Findings indicate that the rate of prion binding increased only slightly when the concentration of prion in the reaction medium was increased. Rate constants of binding were very similar on Fe 3 O 4 @Au and Fe 3 O 4 -LAA when the concentrations of protein were 1, 2, 1. 5, 2. 25 and 3. 57 μg/ml.

30|$|In {{this present}} investigation, three {{different}} methods, i.e. electrocoagulation, electro-oxidation and photochemical methods {{were carried out}} to treat pulp and paper effluent. Electrocoagulation process is the in situ production of coagulants by means of electrolysis. Electro-oxidation {{is a process of}} mineralizing pollutants by electrolysis using anodes. It is of two types: direct oxidation and indirect oxidation. In direct method, anodic electron transfer takes place similar to chemical oxidation on anodic surface. In indirect method demineralization takes place in the presence of <b>ferric</b> and <b>chloride</b> ions [6]. Photolysis involves the interaction of light with molecules to bring about their dissociation into fragments.

40|$|Purpose. Establish {{and compare}} {{the content of the}} total lipids in the liver, {{skeletal}} muscle, gill and brain pond carp active life condition and under artificial hibernation carbon. Methodology. The experiments were conducted on the Ukrainian scaly carp breed (Cyprinus caprio L.) weighing 250 – 270 g. To conduct research to form two groups (control — 5 copies of the fish and an experimental — each point hypobiosis exposure to 5 copies of the fish). Introduction of fish hypobiotically state conducted for the use of a patented model artificial hibernation. The selection of material performed by opening the first and second fish group on the 3, 6 and 24 hours of exposure, then it is frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Lipid extraction after homogenization of brain tissue, liver, skeletal muscle and gills was performed according to Folch. The content of the total lipids (from the weight of the dry residue) after extraction was determined using the gravimetric method. The separation into individual lipid fractions were determined thin layer chromatography by plates "Silufol". Quantitative determination of total phospholipids — hydroxamate method; cholesterol — colorimetric method with three <b>ferric</b> <b>chlorides.</b> All the results are treated variation-statistical method using the Student's t-tests. Findings. These results suggest that the content of total lipids, phospholipids and cholesterol in the tissues of the carp pond in the active state of life is significantly different. The content of the total lipids in the liver, skeletal muscle, gill and brain in a carp pond introducing carbon dioxide into a state of artificial hibernation (hypercapnic hypoxia-medium) is reduced in comparison with the control. Under these conditions, noted a slight increase in tissue phospholipids, as well as a significant increase in cholesterol and the coefficient (CL/PL), especially in the liver, indicating that the use of lipids in energy and adaptation processes. Originality. Lipid composition studied liver, skeletal muscle, gill and brain carp active life condition and carbon dioxide under artificial hibernation. The content of the total lipids in the tissues of the research carp throughout the exposition of artificial hibernation carbon dioxide decreases, indicating that the use of lipids in energy processes. The growth of the content of phospholipids and cholesterol in the tissues of the carp in the conditions of artificial hibernation carbon dioxide leads to the development of adaptive adaptation of organisms to the environment. Practical value. The results make it possible to assess the redistribution of lipids in fish tissue of the body due to changes in environmental conditions (artificial carbon hibernation) ...|$|R
