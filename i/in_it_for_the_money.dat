5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E

Claiming that Dante and Trish only {{escalated}} the situation by unwittingly providing the Devil Arms that were key to Sanctus’ plan, she gladly pays them next to nothing. But as Trish answers a call for a new job, Dante gets Lady back for it by allowing her to tag along without getting paid. It’s clear {{that none of them}} are <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> anyway, as all three charge into the night guns blazing.|$|E
25|$|Later it was re-edited by Zappa {{as part of}} {{a project}} called No Commercial Potential, which {{included}} three other albums: We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat.|$|E
50|$|As {{the years}} passed, the treaty became less {{relevant}} {{and both sides}} started to lose interest <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> Americans, the main issue became the ABM Treaty, which forbade the deployment of a nationwide missile defense system.

25|$|Uncle Meat is {{the fifth}} studio album by The Mothers of Invention, {{released}} as a double album in 1969. Uncle Meat was originally developed {{as a part of}} No Commercial Potential, a project which spawned three other albums sharing a conceptual connection: We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> Lumpy Gravy and Cruising with Ruben & the Jets.|$|E
25|$|During the litigation, Zappa reedited {{the album}} while {{recording}} in New York City {{for a project}} called No Commercial Potential, which ended up producing four albums: We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> the reedited second version of Lumpy Gravy, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat, which served as the soundtrack to the film of the same name, which was ultimately not completed until 1987.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} band's {{previous}} three albums, it {{is a concept}} album, influenced by 1950s doo wop and rock and roll. The album's concept deals with a fictitious Chicano doo wop band called Ruben & the Jets, represented by the cover illustration by Cal Schenkel, which depicts the Mothers of Invention as anthropomorphic dogs. It was conceived {{as part of a}} project called No Commercial Potential, which produced three other albums: Lumpy Gravy, We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> and Uncle Meat.|$|E
50|$|Based on Eusebius, it {{is known}} that Apollonius spoke in his work of Zoticus, who had tried to exorcise Maximilla, but had been {{prevented}} by Themison, and of the martyr-Bishop Thraseas, another adversary of Montanism.

500|$|In 2005, the U.S. National Recording Preservation Board {{included}} We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> in the National Recording Registry as [...] "Frank Zappa's inventive and iconoclastic album {{presents a}} unique political stance, both anti-conservative and anti-counterculture, and features a scathing satire on hippiedom and America's reactions to it". The same year, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him at No.71 on {{its list of}} the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} {{their first}} single [...] "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] on small independent record label, Backbeat records, {{on a limited}} run of 500. In October 1994 the single was re-released on the Parlophone label and reached number 43 in the UK Singles Chart, but failed to chart in the US. Supergrass released their debut full-length album I Should Coco in May 1995. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK Albums Chart. I Should Coco led the band to receive four newcomer awards in the year the album was released. [...] "Alright" [...] was released from the album, which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. This is the highest chart position the band have gained with a single except for [...] "Richard III" [...] from <b>In</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money.</b> <b>In</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> which was the first album to be produced entirely by Supergrass peaked at number two in the UK Albums Chart.

500|$|In a 1969 {{column for}} The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said that, apart from The Mothers of Invention's We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> Tommy {{is the first}} {{successful}} [...] "extended work" [...] in rock music, but Townshend's parodic side is more [...] "profound and equivocal" [...] than Frank Zappa. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that {{he is determined to}} [...] "give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity". Albert Goldman, writing in Life magazine, said that The Who play through [...] "all the kinky complications" [...] of the narrative in a hard rock style that is the antithesis of most contemporary [...] "serious" [...] rock. Goldman asserted that, based on innovation, performance, and [...] "sheer power", Tommy surpasses anything else in studio-recorded rock. Christgau named Tommy the best album of 1969 in his year-end list for Jazz & Pop magazine.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} {{on the first}} leg of his HIStory World Tour on September 1996. One month into the tour and several months after his divorce from Presley, Jackson's personal life made headlines as it was revealed that Debbie Rowe was pregnant with his child. One tabloid newspaper, the News of the World, told the story under the headline [...] "I'm Having Michael's Baby". Rowe reacted furiously to the publication, labeling the editorial staff [...] "bastards" [...] and complaining that they reported the story as if she and Jackson were freaks. J. Randy Taraborrelli later noted that the article, which had been put together from a secret tape recording between Rowe and a friend, had been fairly accurate. It detailed that Jackson was the father of the baby and that he would be raising the child alone. It also stated that Jackson impregnated Rowe artificially with his own sperm cells, a [...] "foolproof" [...] method of insemination. Further reports alleged that the relationship was an [...] "economic" [...] one; she was <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and he sought a baby.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Zappa {{prepared}} a remix of Cruising with Ruben & the Jets for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set The Old Masters I. The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, {{much as the}} 1984 remix of We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> had featured. Zappa stated [...] "The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> I {{decided to do it}} on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{dialogue}} on the reedited Lumpy Gravy, recorded simultaneously with We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> was spoken by a small group which included Motorhead Sherwood, Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour, All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a [...] "psychotic turkey".
