50|$|If {{the melt}} of an (organic) {{amorphous}} polymer is cooled down, it solidifies at the <b>glass-transition</b> <b>temperature</b> Tg. On cooling, the hardness of the polymer {{increases in the}} neighborhood of Tg by several orders of magnitude. This hardening follows the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation, not the Arrhenius equation. Organic polymers are thus called fragile glass formers. Silicon glass (e.g., window glass), is in contrast labelled as a strong glass former. Its viscosity changes only very slowly {{in the vicinity of the}} glass-transition point Tg and follows the Arrhenius law. Only via this gradual change in viscosity is glassblowing possible. If one would try to shape an organic polymer in the same manner as a glass, it would at first firmly and fully liquefy near Tg already at slightly higher temperatures. For a theoretical glassblowing of organic polymers, the temperature must be controlled very precisely.|$|E

50|$|Shape memory heparin {{mimicking}} polymers {{can be used}} {{to create}} devices that extract hemorrhaging tissue. Microactuator (right) is a prototype endovascular electromechanical clot-extraction device. This device consists of electromechanical microactuator mounted on the distal tip of either a Prowler-14 microcatheter The microactuator is fabricated using a shape memory polymer (SMP) shell over a shape memory nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol) wire backbone with attached copper leads to deliver a current. The microactuator maintains a straight rod shape until the applied current, provided by a DC power supply, heating the nitinol wire, causing the microactuator to transform into a corkscrew shape capable of retrieving a blood clot. At body temperature, the overlying SMP is in a glassy state and maintains the nitinol tightly coiled configuration in a straight form for endovascular delivery. Once the microactuator is positioned beyond the clot, joule heating is initiated. As the surrounding SMP is heated by conduction to its characteristic <b>glass-transition</b> <b>temperature</b> (Tg ≈ 80 °C), it transitions to its rubbery state, allowing the nitinol to resume its corkscrew shape. Retrieval of the blood clot occurs through a pull back motion. The nitinol is engulfed in a tight space even though it is expanding and as a result retreats thus extracting the tissue.|$|E

A solid solution is a solid-state solution of one or more solutes in a solvent. Such a mixture is considered a solution rather than a compound when the crystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by addition of the solutes, and when the mixture remains in a single homogeneous phase. This often happens when the two elements (generally metals) involved are close together on the periodic table; conversely, a chemical compound generally results when two metals involved are not near each other on the periodic table.|$|E
