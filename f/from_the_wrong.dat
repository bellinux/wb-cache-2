5|$|Boam's February 23, 1988 rewrite {{utilized}} many of Connery's comic suggestions. It {{included the}} prologue that was eventually filmed; Lucas {{had to convince}} Spielberg to show Indiana as a boy because of the mixed response to Empire of the Sun, which was about a young boy. Spielberg—who was later awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award—had {{the idea of making}} Indiana a Boy Scout. Indiana's mother, named Margaret in this version, dismisses Indiana when he returns home with the Cross of Coronado, while his father is on a long distance call. Walter Chandler of the Chandler Foundation features, but is not the main villain; he plunges to his death in the tank. Elsa introduces Indiana and Brody to a large Venetian family that knows Henry. Leni Riefenstahl appears at the Nazi rally in Berlin. Vogel is beheaded by the traps guarding the Grail. Kemal tries to blow up the Grail Temple during a comic fight in which gunpowder is repeatedly lit and extinguished. Elsa shoots Henry, then dies drinking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> Grail, and Indiana rescues his father from falling into the chasm while grasping for the Grail. Boam's revision on March 1 showed Henry causing the seagulls to strike the plane, and has Henry saving Indiana at the end.|$|E

However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly. It is believed {{that this is a}} result of Baum copying the map <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.|$|E
25|$|Ron {{is given}} his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, {{which is made}} out of ash and has a unicorn hair {{sticking}} out of the end. He holds the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of Chamber of Secrets, but it malfunctions dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> end. Ron's new wand is fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair, which he procures before the start of his third year at Hogwarts. He also shows signs of exceptional tactical ability, as evidenced by his skill at Wizard's Chess (which is played exactly like normal chess but with living pieces). Ron's talents are rarely shown, but he, like the other DA members, survives a violent encounter with adult Death Eaters in Order of the Phoenix, and it is implied that during the Death Eater assault in Half-Blood Prince he held his own quite well because he was being helped by Felix Felicis, the good luck potion. In Deathly Hallows, Ron loses his original wand, and takes Peter Pettigrew's wand for his own. Following this, Ron begins to demonstrate more aptitude and general knowledge, along with a sudden spurt in maturity after a terrible row with Harry. For a while, he effectively leads the trio in the hunt for the Horcruxes while Harry suffers a major depression.|$|E

25|$|In {{part the}} Treaty {{was an attempt}} to {{establish}} a system of property rights for land with the Crown controlling and overseeing land sale to prevent abuse and initially this worked well and the Governor had the sole right to buy and sell land from the Māori. Māori were eager to sell land, and settlers eager to buy. The Crown was supposed to mediate the process to ensure that the true owners were properly identified (difficult for tribally owned land) and fairly compensated, {{by the standards of the}} time. In particular, the Governor had the responsibility to protect Māori interests. Governor Grey set out to buy large tracts of Māori land in advance of settlement at low prices, later selling it to settlers at higher prices and using the difference to develop land access (roads and bridges). Donald McLean acted as Grey's intermediary and negotiator, and as early as 1840 was aware that Māori had no concept of the sale of land in British sense. Soon Māori became disillusioned and less willing to sell, while the Crown came under increasing pressure from settlers wishing to buy. Consequently, government land agents were involved in a number of dubious land purchases, agreements were sometimes negotiated with only one owner of tribally owned land and in some cases land was purchased <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> people altogether. Eventually this led to the New Zealand Wars which culminated in the confiscation of a large part of the Waikato and Taranaki.|$|E

The Daily Telegraph Tom Hoggins felt that while he could not properly judge the level without having played it, he still questioned whether Infinity Ward had approached the level <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> direction by letting the player use grenades to [...] "treat these civilians as human bowling pins". Writing for The Guardian, Keith Stuart criticized the skip feature, describing it as a [...] "cop-out" [...] for a level that the developer intended players to experience. Jim Sterling of Destructoid however was fully supportive of the level, as he thought that it was a statement that video games could discuss controversial topics, which he felt that many developers would often shy away from. He concluded by saying that if [...] "No Russian" [...] was able to make players question if the payoff was worth human sacrifice, then video games could finally be considered an art form.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{suggested}} Innerspace writer Jeffrey Boam {{perform the}} next rewrite. Boam {{spent two weeks}} reworking the story with Lucas, which yielded a treatment that is largely similar to the final film. Boam told Lucas that Indiana should find his father {{in the middle of}} the story. [...] "Given the fact that it's the third film in the series, you couldn't just end with them obtaining the object. That's how the first two films ended," [...] he said, [...] "So I thought, let them lose the Grail, and let the father–son relationship be the main point. It's an archaeological search for Indy's own identity and coming to accept his father is more what it's about [...]" [...] Boam said he felt there was not enough character development in the previous films. In Boam's first draft, dated September 1987, the film is set in 1939. The prologue has adult Indiana retrieving an Aztec relic for a museum curator in Mexico and features the circus train. Henry and Elsa (who is described as having dark hair) were searching for the Grail on behalf of the Chandler Foundation, before Henry went missing. The character of Kazim is here named Kemal, and is an agent of the Republic of Hatay, which seeks the grail for its own. Kemal shoots Henry and dies drinking <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> chalice. The Grail Knight battles Indiana on horseback, while Vogel is crushed by a boulder when stealing the Grail.|$|E

[...] According to the actress, Sharon does [...] "weird things" [...] and panics when stressed, and her mistakes [...] "eat away at her", as [...] "She doesn't do well with secrets". Case also described the character as feeling insecure and unworthy of being in a happy relationship, telling the Star-Banner that [...] "Sharon goes through many emotions in a week". MSN characterized Sharon as a [...] "bitch" [...] after a storyline in which she took over Newman Enterprises in 2012. Of the writing for her character, Case said it is indispensable: [...] "They both have to be there. I couldn't have gotten away with this without those lines". However, the actress has expressed displeasure with Sharon being paired with [...] "too many men" [...] because it [...] "waters her down", wanting to incorporate different aspects of Sharon into her performance.

500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".|$|E

[...] Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold." [...] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had [...] "registered an enduring appeal among viewers", with Braeden replying that, [...] "Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict." [...] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he [...] "always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki". He also stated {{in an interview that he}} considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: [...] "Young and Restless Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [...] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them." [...] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: [...] "Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years." [...] They also described their relationship as being a [...] "dominant force" [...] in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: [...] "Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making {{arrangements}} for the IRA operatives once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Soldier A" [...] stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who [...] "A" [...] was; [...] "A" [...] testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but [...] "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm [...] "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading [...] "A" [...] to believe that McCann was reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] shot McCann once in the back; [...] "A" [...] went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). [...] "Soldier B" [...] testified that he reached similar conclusions to [...] "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times.
