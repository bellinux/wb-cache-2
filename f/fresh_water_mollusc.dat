40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>mollusc</b> Biomphalaria glabrata is the intermediate host for the trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni, this parasite {{is responsible for the}} human disease Schistosomiasis. The significance of B. glabrata in the transmission of schistosomiasis is such that it has been selected for complete genome sequencing. The Biomphalaria glabrata embryonic cell line is an important resource for researchers investigating the interaction between the snail and parasite. The genome of the Bge cells was analysed at the chromosomal level, using DAPI karyotyping. The karyotype revealed extensive aneuploidy, whereby a modal chromosome complement of 63 and 67 was observed in two isolates of the Bge cells, which exceeds B. glabrata’s 2 n= 36 chromosome number. Indeed, in addition to characterising the Bge cell chromosomes, a method was established for mapping single copy B. glabrata genes onto the chromosomes from the Bge cells using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Despite the Bge cell’s inherent aneuploidy, the four genes mapped onto diploid homologous chromosomes. This methodology will be an important resource for the genome sequencing consortium. The interphase nucleus is an organised organelle, whereby chromosomes and gene loci {{have been shown to be}} located non-randomly and hence it is hypothesised that the organisation of the interphase nucleus is pertinent to the function of the genome. Since there is no data on how the genes of the snail genome behaves in interphase, it was assessed in the Bge cells line. Again, this is important for the sequencing initiative, but also for evolutionary biology. Radially distributed chromosome territories were observed in the nuclei of the Bge cells. The territory position was organised according to territory size, with small chromosome territories positioned towards the interior and large territories intermediately located. In addition, four B. glabrata genes were positioned non-randomly in the interphase nuclei of the Bge cells, again emphasising organised positioning of the genome. With co-culture of S. mansoni miracidia with the Bge cells there is up regulation of specific genes known to be involved in the host response to parasite. These genes are dramatically relocated within the interphase nuclei, implying that these are specific parasite induced nuclear events. An analysis of the genomic distribution of specific histone modified chromatin in the interphase nuclei of B. glabrata, revealed different nuclear distribution of modified chromatin. Indeed, a statistically significant difference in these patterns was observed between juvenile and adult snails, indicating developmental differences in the organisation of the snails’ genome. These differences maybe relevant to the snails’ resistance/susceptibility to the parasite...|$|E

Cossigny dissected a specimen in the mid-18th century and later sent it and its stomach contents to the French scientist René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur with a letter describing his findings. The gizzard and crop contained four [...] "nuts", which Cossigny was told were the seeds of either Calophyllum tacamahaca or Labourdonnaisia calophylloides. The Comoro and Seychelles blue pigeons also feed on C. tacamahaca, and the strong gizzard of the former helps in the digestion of the seeds. In 1812 Jacques Gérard Milbert provided the only description of the behaviour of the bird in the wild: The second is the pigeon with a mane; {{the inhabitants of the}} Ile de France Mauritius call it pigeon hollandais; the head, neck and chest are adorned with long pointed white feathers which it can raise at will; the rest of the body, and the wings, are a fine deep violet; the end of the tail is a purplish red. It is one of the finest species of its kind ... The second of these birds lives solitary in river valleys, where I have often seen it without being able to secure one.

When checked for aminoacylation capacity with homologous and heterologous enzymes and algal protein hydrolysate, the tRNA preparation from rat liver and <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> mussel, a <b>mollusc,</b> were found to be active. On the other hand, the tRNAs from earthworm, an annelid, and cockroach, an arthropod, were completely inactive with the homologous enzymes but showed partial activity with heterologous enzymes. Similar results were obtained with individual amino acids also. The low activity or inactivity of earthworm and cockroach tRNAs appears to be due to certain endogenous aminoacylation inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|In their {{account of}} the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>molluscs</b> of Celebes P. & F. SARASIN (1898) {{described}} the genus Protancylus. They pointed out certain resemblances between Protancylus and Ancylus {{as well as between}} Protancylus and ”Miratesta, Isidora und Planorbis”. However, they did not present any conclusion regarding the systematic position of the group. In his famous handbook THIELE (1931) placed Protancylus in the family Ancylidae. Furthermore, he regarded Protancylus as congeneric with some of the main genera of the family, e. g. Burnupia, Ferrissia, and Gundlachia. In connection with extensive studies of the family Ancylidae I had to examine the morphology and systematic position of Protancylus. As a result the genus Protancylus proper proved to be distinct from the other Ancylids and has to be removed from this family. Before I present the results of my own studies, however, it may be appropriate to briefly summarize the SARASIN’s findings. They found a well delimited hollow in each tentacle. Inside the bottom of the hollow they found a ganglion. They stated the presence of a comparatively large mantle cavity. Its inner end should be directed anteriorly, the opening more or less posteriorly though located at about the middle of {{the left side of the}} animal. Behind the mantle opening they noticed the strongly folded gill, which consists of one lamella only. They stated that the heart is anterior of the gill, what, however, is of only moderate importance as the gill is no ctenidium. The large gizzard was noticed and the radula was studied. They pointed out that the latter was more similar to the radula of certain Planorbidae than to that of Ancylus fluviatilis MüLLER. However, their information regarding the latter species was most unsatisfactory...|$|R

During the initial salt water phase, absolute and relative water flux rates were 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 l d(- 1) and 123. 0 +/- 6. 8 ml kg(- 1) d(- 1), respectively.

50|$|Changing {{landscape}} {{for the use}} of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and soils changes the flow of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> in the local environment and also affects the cycle of <b>fresh</b> <b>water.</b> As a result, more <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture.

40|$|During glacial periods, {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration {{increases and}} decreases by around 15 ppm. At the same time, the climate changes gradually in Antarctica.

Because the models and the <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes were different in these studies, it prevents any direct comparison and hinders finding whether the discrepancies arise from using different models or different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In this study we use the CLIMBER- 2 coupled climate carbon model to explore the impact of different <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> fluxes. In both preindustrial and glacial states, the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting slow-down of the AMOC lead to an uptake of carbon by the ocean and a release by the terrestrial biosphere.

The different CO 2 evolution thus depends on the AMOC response to the addition of <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> and the resulting climatic change, which are both model dependent.
