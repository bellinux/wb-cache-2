25|$|Projection {{construction}} is also affected by how {{the shape of}} the Earth or planetary body is approximated. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section</b> on projection categories, the earth is taken as a sphere in order to simplify the discussion. However, the Earth's actual shape is closer to an oblate ellipsoid. Whether spherical or ellipsoidal, the principles discussed hold without loss of generality.|$|E
25|$|Any {{discussion}} of planetary interactive forces has always started historically with the two-body problem. The {{purpose of this}} Section is to relate the real complexity in calculating any planetary forces. Note in this Section also, several subjects, such as gravity, barycenter, Kepler's Laws, etc.; and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>Section</b> too (Three-body problem) are discussed on other Wikipedia pages. Here though, these subjects are discussed {{from the perspective of}} the -body problem.|$|E
25|$|It is {{therefore}} possible to deduce {{that the energy}} produced by hydrolysis is {{used to create a}} true “stationary state”, that is a flux, instead of a simple equilibrium, one that is dynamic, polar and attached to the filament. This justifies the expenditure of energy as it promotes essential biological functions. In addition, the configuration of the different monomer types is detected by actin binding proteins, which also control this dynamism, as will be described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{host device}} can ask any {{inserted}} SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify {{the number of}} memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section)</b> {{with the number of}} bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.|$|E
25|$|The process-data model shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section</b> {{displays}} the acquisition initiation stages. It shows both {{the process and}} the data ensuing from the process, and parts of the image will also be used as references in the body of this article. The concepts and data found in the model are explained in separate tables which {{can be found in the}} section immediately following the model. A textual, and more thorough, explanation of the activities and concepts that make up the Acquisition Initiation process can be found in the remainder of this article.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section</b> {{preliminary}} timelines {{for construction}} of future stations are referenced. For example, construction of a north CTrain line is not expected until after 2023. The city has, on several occasions, accelerated construction of CTrain expansion due to demand and available money. For example, the McKnight–Westwinds station, which opened in 2007, was, as recently as 2002, not planned until beyond 2010. Similarly, the timeline of construction of the south line extension was also pushed up several years due to increasing population and traffic volume. There are plans to develop new routes into the centre north and the southeast of the city.|$|E

25|$|This {{equation}} is correct {{to a much}} wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, {{and for this reason}} will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low pressure conditions, such as the Earth's stratosphere. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence {{on the assumption that the}} wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average mean free path between gas molecule collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{completed}} from Manitoba to Quebec in 1960, many upgrades {{to the original}} routing of Highway17 had and would take place over the years. In addition to bypasses around almost every urban centre it encountered, many original sections have been downloaded to regional and local jurisdiction or decommissioned entirely to lay abandoned in the forest. Of special note is reroutings in the Ottawa Valley – where the highway follows {{very little of the}} original routing – and around Thunder Bay, where it has undergone several reroutings and upgrades since the 1920s. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section,</b> upgrades are listed from west to east due to complex chronologies.|$|E
25|$|Sher Shah gate located to {{the south}} of Khairu’l-Manazil-Masjid is said to be an {{entrance}} to the large city of Delhi that Sher Shah built in front of his fortress of Purana Qila. The gate, mostly built with red sandstone but with use of local grey quartzite in its upper storey, is thus called the Lal Darwaza (red gate). Arcades were built from this gate into the city, which were provided with series of dwellings with frontage of a verandah, which may have been used for commercial establishments. Kabuli or KhuniDarwaza (explained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section)</b> is another gate on the fringes of Sher Shah’s city. ASI has undertaken extensive conservation works of the gate and its surroundings at a cost of Rs7.5million (US$150,000).|$|E

25|$|The poem {{deals with}} legends, was {{composed}} for entertainment, {{and does not}} separate between fictional elements and real historic events, such as the raid by King Hygelac into Frisia. Though Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Anglo-Saxon manuscript, scholars generally agree {{that many of the}} other personalities of Beowulf also appear in Scandinavian sources. (Specific works are designated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section).</b> This concerns not only individuals (e.g., Healfdene, Hroðgar, Halga, Hroðulf, Eadgils and Ohthere), but also clans (e.g., Scyldings, Scylfings and Wulfings) and certain events (e.g., the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern). The dating of the events in the poem has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the barrows indicated by Snorri Sturluson and by Swedish tradition as the graves of Ohthere (dated to c. 530) and his son Eadgils (dated to c. 575) in Uppland, Sweden.|$|E
25|$|From Erfurt station, {{the route}} runs west on the {{northern}} side of the Gera valley, parallel to the tracks of the Halle–Bebra railway (Thuringian Railway). It separates from that line before Erfurt-Bischleben in order to cross over the river and a road and enter the Augustaburg Tunnel. After the tunnel, the line turns south and parallels the Autobahn 71. First, it runs {{on the western side}} of the Autobahn and crosses the Apfelstädt, a state road and the Thuringian Railway on the Apfelstädt viaduct. This is followed by the Gera Viaduct at Ichtershausen and crossings of the A4 at the Erfurt interchange, the A71 in a cutting and the Gera again. As far as Neuroda, it is then built on the western side of the A71. After passing under the A71 through the Sandberg Tunnel, it then follow a separate route. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section</b> of about seven kilometres, it passses over the Wümbach Viaduct to the new Ilmenau-Wolfsberg overtaking loops. On the way to Ilmenau, the line passes through the Thuringian Forest via nine tunnels with a total length of more than 22kilometres.|$|E
25|$|Gutiérrez was {{the first}} driver to attempt his lap in super pole and {{recorded}} fast times before locking his brakes and ran deep into the turn eight escape road, restricting him to qualifying fifth. López, seeking his first pole position in Formula E, was the next competitor to drive onto the track and took third, but was investigated for inadvertently using an excessive amount of electrical energy on his out-lap after mistakenly switching his car's settings. Although no penalty was applied, the switching of settings damaged his car's battery, leading to it being changed before the race. Turvey went fastest in the first sector before making a small error <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>section</b> and took fourth. Vergne went faster than López to move into provisional pole position. Buemi was the final driver to set his lap time, and despite making small errors in the final sector, he clinched pole position {{with a time of}} one minute and 2.319 seconds. The margin of gap to Vergne was 0.006 seconds, the closest in Formula E history. It was Buemi's second consecutive pole position, and the eighth of his career. After qualifying ended, Turvey was demoted ten places on the grid because his team changed an powertrain component.|$|E
