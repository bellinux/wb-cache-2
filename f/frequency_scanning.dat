50|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> {{interferometry}} (FSI) is {{an absolute}} distance measurement technique, for measuring the distance between a pair of points, along a line-of-sight. The power of the FSI technique lies {{in its ability to}} make many such distance measurements, simultaneously. For each distance to be measured, a measurement interferometer is built using optical components placed at each end of a line-of-sight. The optical path of each measurement interferometer is compared to the optical path in a reference interferometer, by scanning the frequency of a laser (connected to all interferometers in the system) and counting fringe cycles produced in the return signals from each interferometer.|$|E

50|$|The {{usage of}} true-time-delay TTD phase {{shifters}} instead of RF MEMS phase shifters allows UWB radar waveforms with associated high range resolution, and avoids beam squinting or <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning.</b> TTD phase shifters are designed using the switched-line principle or the distributed loaded-line principle. Switched-line TTD phase shifters outperform distributed loaded-line TTD phase shifters {{in terms of}} time delay per decibel NF, especially at frequencies up to X-band, but are inherently digital and require low-loss and high-isolation SPNT switches. Distributed loaded-line TTD phase shifters, however, can be realized analogously or digitally, and in smaller form factors, which is important at the subarray level. Analog phase shifters are biased through a single bias line, whereas multibit digital phase shifters require a parallel bus along with complex routing schemes at the subarray level.|$|E
50|$|With {{selective}} laser melting, thin layers of atomized fine metal powder are evenly distributed using a coating mechanism onto a substrate plate, usually metal, that is fastened to an indexing table that {{moves in the}} vertical (Z) axis. This takes place inside a chamber containing a tightly controlled atmosphere of inert gas, either argon or nitrogen at oxygen levels below 500 parts per million. Once each layer has been distributed, each 2D slice of the part geometry is fused by selectively melting the powder. This is accomplished with a high-power laser beam, usually an ytterbium fiber laser with hundreds of watts. The laser beam is directed in the X and Y directions with two high <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> mirrors. The laser energy is intense enough to permit full melting (welding) of the particles to form solid metal. The process is repeated layer after layer until the part is complete.|$|E

In this paper these time domain transient simulation related techniques are referred as dynamic <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> techniques to separate them from the traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> technique applied to subsynchronous resonance screening studies. The two traditional dynamic <b>frequency</b> <b>scanning</b> approaches, modal response and signal injection method, are based on the analysis of the subsynchronous response of the electromechanical system on one single frequency at the time. Although multi-run functionalities has made these methods convenient to use, they cannot be consid-ered effective, or screening study natured, if the damping analysis require for example modeling of highly detailed control systems or sensitivity studies covering high num-ber of operational conditions and parameters. Therefore, spectral injection technique allowing the analysis of sub-synchronous response over the whole subsynchronous frequency range at once is introduced to subsynchrnous damping analysis.
