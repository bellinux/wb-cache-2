This $40 million tunnel is {{situated}} in a densely urban site below the SkyWalk and {{in close proximity to}} Toronto Union Station and the InterContinental Toronto Centre hotel. The tunnel roof structure is designed to carry all 16 pre-existing railway tracks. The <b>ground</b> <b>structure</b> provides one vehicle lane north bound and two lanes south bound, one bicycle lane and one extra wide pedestrian sidewalk {{on each side of the}} tunnel.|$|E
25|$|The largest above <b>ground</b> <b>structure</b> is the bus station, {{with its}} {{entrance}} {{on the east}} side of Spadina Road just north of Bloor Street, which currently serves as the terminus of the 127 Davenport bus route. Originally, it was built to serve as a looping facility for the former 77 Spadina bus which operated until the underground streetcar loop was added and the buses were replaced by 510 Spadina streetcars. This rather subdued building, with its pseudo mansard roof and brick arches and no obvious bold signage like most other station entrances, is located at the easterly end of the Bloor line platforms. There is a more typical secondary entrance building, directly opposite, on the west side of Spadina Road.|$|E
25|$|Among Cortona's more {{important}} architectural projects are {{the church of}} Santi Luca e Martina (completed in 1664, {{the church of the}} Accademia di San Luca, located in the Roman Forum. While Cortona was principe or director of the Accademia from 1634–38, he obtained permission to dig in the crypt of the church, which led the likely mistaken finding of remains attributed to the first century Roman martyr and Saint Martina. This discovery led to further patronage for construction of the church. The layout is almost a Greek cross, with four nearly identical wings extending from the striking central dome. Much of the <b>ground</b> <b>structure</b> is undecorated, above intricately decorated. The overwhelmingly vertical decoration of the facade is granted liveliness by horizontal convexity.

The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a static discharger. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft lightning protection provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage field form an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various lightning protection systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent <b>ground</b> <b>structure.</b> Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E
25|$|On January 28, 2008, the MTA revised {{its costs}} and {{estimate}} of completion and indicated {{the project would}} likely not to include the domed structure which had been planned, or any substantial above-ground structure.

In June 2008, Chris Ward, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey prepared a report for David Paterson, governor of the state of New York, reversing years of optimism regarding the time and resources required to complete projects related to the reconstruction of the World Trade Center including the Fulton Center.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} had originally a round plan with an outer diameter of 11.2 m, and was perhaps surmounted by a dome. [...] On {{the south side}} there was a rectangular apse. The interior was hexagonal, and each side was adorned with a rectangular niche. Surveys executed before the demolition revealed window-like openings in the foundation (made of rubble) which hint {{to the presence of}} a crypt also during the early phase of the building. The brickwork of the above <b>ground</b> <b>structure</b> was made with freestone interlined with clay bricks. The Palaiologan-era burial chamber, measuring 2.9 m x 3.17 m, was covered with a flat dome. During the conversion into a mosque, the old entrance was closed with masonry because of the erection of the minaret, and a new entrance on the northwest side was opened. In the last phase of its life the edifice had a wooden roof and kept its internal hexagonal plant, with a deeply arched recess on each side, five of them bearing a window and one the entrance gate. Outside the building showed four alternating sides, two circular bearing two windows each and two projecting bays bearing respectively one window and the entrance gate. In front of the building the Ottomans erected a porch. During the demolition in 1930 traces of paintings stemming from the Palaiologan period could be still observed. On that occasion some architectural elements were dismantled and since then have been kept at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} some novel types of {{microwave}} bandpass filters using defected <b>ground</b> <b>structures</b> are investigated. In the microstrip technology {{the use of}} defected <b>ground</b> <b>structures</b> (DGS) allows designs of filters with tight couplings, without the necessity of using very narrow coupling gaps. In multilayer filters DGS {{can be used as}} coupling elements between resonators, allowing very compact filter designs. A study of the couplings between two planar microstrip resonators {{in the presence of a}} DGS, and between two planar resonators located on different layers and separated through a DGS in a multilayer structure, is presented. Based on the results of the study some models of planar microwave bandpass filters were designed and simulated, with a single or with two slots etched in the ground plane. These novel filter structures show a good compactness and can offer some technological advantages, compared to the classical.

The resonators allow the back-to-back and face-to-face embedding configuration, hence, greatly reduces the physical size of the filters. By changing the sizes of the two resonators independently, the lower and upper resonance frequencies can be adjusted to the desired values. A dual-band broadband bandpass filter was implemented with good compactness and low insertion loss. A good agreement is obtained between the simulation and measurement results. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{charging}} induced damage (CID) to metal-insulator-metal-capacitator (MIMC), is reported. The {{damage is}} caused by the build up of charges on an oxide surface during a water rinsing step. The excessive charging over a large capacitator area results in a discharge over the inter metal dielectric layer (IMD) towards a <b>grounded</b> <b>structure.</b> This CID leads to direct severe yield loss. The charging has been detected, measured and reduced {{with the help of a}} non contact surface potential measurement. In this way further yield losses have been prevented.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} for IASS-IACM 2008 International Conference in Ithaca, NY (Cornell University) Over {{the past}} two decades there has been an increasing interest in using {{what has come to be}} called Evolutionary Computation (EC) in the analysis and optimization of structural systems. These methods include Genetic Algorithms (GA), Evolution Strategies (ES), Simulated Annealing and other stochastic based numerical methods. Each of these methods shares the drawback that they are very computationally intensive compared to deterministic methods. Furthermore, the computational burden can rapidly increase as the size of the analyzed structure increases. This paper suggests that the level of computation can be significantly reduced by avoiding the common practice of using <b>ground</b> <b>structures</b> in coding the topology. Additionally, comparative examples show that a broader range of good solutions can be reached when the use of <b>ground</b> <b>structures</b> is avoided...|$|R
