Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and this was noted by <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> and students. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.|$|E

Cox took a job as an insurance agent after college, but his income disappointed him, and he sought out higher-paying work.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was born}} in 1754 in Nontron, a village in the Dordogne {{department}} of France. His uncle, {{a member of the}} order of Saint Anthony, encouraged him to study theology.

5|$|Chopin's polonaises show {{a marked}} advance on {{those of his}} Polish {{predecessors}} in the form (who included <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.|$|E

5|$|Narayan is {{associated}} with the Kirana gharana (stylistic school of Kirana) through Abdul Wahid Khan, but his performance style is not strongly connected to it. Most of Narayan's compositions are from the singing repertoire of <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> and were modified and adapted to the sarangi. He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught. Narayan disfavors the creation of new ragas, but developed compound ragas, including those of Nand with Kedar and Kafi with Malhar.|$|E

In 1936 he {{returned}} to Cilacap to teach at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school, having been trained by <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> at Wirotomo; that year he married Alfiah, a former schoolmate and the daughter of the rich batik merchant Raden Sastroatmojo. After the marriage Sudirman lived at his father-in-law's house in Cilacap so he could save money for his own home.

5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E

5000|$|He was nicknamed [...] "Invincible" [...] {{after he}} earned a perfect score for 19 {{straight}} wins in the annual castle games. Some {{say that he was}} not stronger than <b>his</b> <b>teacher,</b> Honinbō Shuwa. Out of respect for <b>his</b> <b>teacher,</b> Shusaku refused to play with white against <b>his</b> <b>teacher</b> thus there is no clear gauge of the difference in strength between them. Shusaku, for example, had a plus score against Ōta Yūzo but still found him a tough opponent, while Shuwa beat him easily.|$|R
50|$|He succeeded <b>his</b> <b>teacher</b> Isaac ben Samuel {{as head of}} {{the school}} of Dampierre, after which place he is often called, {{as well as by the}} epithet Isaac ha-Baḥur ("the younger"), to {{distinguish}} him from <b>his</b> <b>teacher,</b> Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaḳen ("the elder") (ר"י הזקן).|$|R
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. He turned to hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Madison School in San Francisco from 1918 to 1924, {{and then}} San Francisco Polytechnic High School.

He had always expected to attend the University of California, but at the urging of <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> at Rochester, he instead went to the University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1932, his master's degree in 1934, and his PhD in 1936. As an undergraduate, he belonged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. As a postgraduate he moved to Gamma Alpha.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} career as a poet at an early age, at about 11 or 12 years old. He was educated at first in Maʿarra and Aleppo, later also in Antioch and other Syrian cities. Among <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> in Aleppo were companions from the circle of Ibn Khalawayh. This grammarian and Islamic scholar had died in 980 CE when al-Maʿarri was still a child. Al-Maʿarri {{nevertheless}} laments the loss of Ibn Khalawayh in strong terms in a poem of his Risālat al-ghufrān. Al-Qifti reports that when on his way to Tripoli, Al-Maʿarri visited a Christian monastery near Latakia where he listened to debates about Hellenistic philosophy, which planted in him the seeds of his later scepticism and irreligiosity; but other historians such as Ibn al-Adim deny that he had been exposed to any theology other than Islamic doctrine.|$|E

Six months later, in February 2002, he learned of {{the sudden death of}} <b>his</b> <b>teacher</b> and was called back to Antai-ji.

5|$|He was {{intended}} to have the name Joachim, but this was stopped on request from Joachim G. Giæver who voiced his dislike for the name. He was then christened Halfdan, changed to Halvdan some years later. The family lived in Tromsø, where Paul Steenstrup Koht was a headmaster and mayor. The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the Liberal Party. Koht finished school here, taking his examen artium in 1890. His father was among <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> {{for a while in}} Norwegian and Greek. In 1893, one year after the death of Koht's father, the family moved to Bekkelaget, a borough in Aker. Koht studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo).|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to become}} a teacher, Soeman tried out for a course for {{potential}} teachers in Medan, North Sumatra, soon after graduation. After he was accepted, he spent two years studying in that city. Among <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> was , whose later short story collection Teman Doedoek (1937) became the first such work in the Indonesian literary canon. Outside of class, Soeman would listen to Kasim's stories about authors and the creative writing process; this sparked his interest in becoming a writer. After two years in Medan, Soeman continued to a normal school in Langsa, Aceh, where he stayed until 1923. There he met his future wife, Siti Hasnah.|$|E

As his father taught at their home, Soeman began learning to read the Quran at a young age. Meanwhile, from the traders who visited Wahid, he also heard stories of the crimes committed in major cities such as Singapore. In 1913 Soeman enrolled at a local Malay school, where <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> reinforced the importance of reading. Soeman took this lesson to heart, reading numerous books by European and Malay authors from the school library before he graduated in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Showing acting skill {{early in}} life, Bana began doing {{impressions}} {{of family members}} {{at the age of}} six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting tables.|$|E
5|$|Soedjatmoko later {{attended}} the Surabaya HBS (secondary school) and graduated in 1940. The school {{introduced him to}} Latin and Greek, and one of <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> introduced him to European art; he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists. He then continued to medical school in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta, {{he was drawn to}} the issue of poverty; this later became an academic interest of his. However, during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir– who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah– and participation in protests against the occupation.|$|E

Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet <b>his</b> <b>teachers</b> on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E
