5|$|Leggetts Creek has {{relatively}} {{high levels of}} total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> and electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the creek ranged from 538.00 to 979.50 micro-siemens per centimeter, {{with an average of}} 677.54 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> ranged from 50.00 to 680.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 411.96 milligrams per liter. The creek is fairly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 7.64 to 9.23 and averaging 8.20. The concentration of salinity in the creek averages 345 parts per million, but reaches levels as high as 435 parts per million and as low as 280 parts per million. This is within the recommended limit of 1000 parts per million, but a 2013/2014 study nevertheless recommended reducing the salinity of the creek.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of Eddy Creek was once measured to be 203.50 micro-siemens per centimeter. The concentration of total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> {{was measured to be}} 140 milligrams per liter and {{the concentration of}} dissolved oxygen was 66.50 percent. The pH of the creek was 6.99, and the concentration of salinity was 100 parts per million.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants {{should not be allowed to}} sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E

Only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The creek was found to be slightly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the maximum value was outside of the ideal range. The concentration of total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter.

5|$|Anions in {{the waters}} of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum in the mine pools in the area are typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters {{in the waters}}hed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of sewage contamination, including sewer odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has a permit to discharge sewage into the creek. Four combined sewer overflows {{are present in the}} watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's streambed, indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and bromides. In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated. For scientific and technical purposes, a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used.|$|E

40|$|Like many others, {{silicate}} <b>solids</b> <b>dissolve</b> {{when placed}} {{in contact with}} water. In a given aqueous environment, the dissolution rate depends highly on the composition {{and the structure of}} the solid, and can span several orders of magnitude. Although the kinetics of dissolution depends on the complexities of both the <b>dissolving</b> <b>solid</b> and the solvent, a clear understanding of which critical structural descriptors of the solid control its dissolution rate is lacking. Through pioneering dissolution experiments and atomistic simulations, we correlate the dissolution rates - ranging over four orders of magnitude - of a selection of silicate glasses and crystals, to the number of chemical topological constraints acting between the atoms of the <b>dissolving</b> <b>solid.</b> The number of such constraints serves as an indicator of the effective activation energy, which arises from steric effects, and prevents the network from reorganizing locally to accommodate intermediate units forming {{over the course of the}} dissolution...|$|R
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids,</b> alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

25|$|Blackwater rivers {{resemble}} clearwater {{rivers in}} having a low conductivity and relatively low levels of <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids,</b> but clearwater rivers have water that often only is somewhat acidic (typical pH ~6.5) and very clear with a greenish color. The main Amazonian clearwater rivers have their source in the Brazilian Plateau (such as Tapajós, Tocantins, Xingu and some right tributaries of the Madeira), but some originate in the Guiana Shield (such as Nhamundá, Paru and Araguari).|$|E
25|$|Both Reverse osmosis and {{electrodialysis}} (also called electrodialysis reversal) {{can remove}} arsenic {{with a net}} ionic charge. (Note that arsenic oxide, As2O3, is a common form of arsenic in groundwater that is soluble, but has no net charge.) Some utilities presently use one of these methods to reduce total <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> and therefore improve taste. A problem with both methods is the production of high-salinity waste water, called brine, or concentrate, which then must be disposed of.|$|E
