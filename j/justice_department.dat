5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other {{senior members of the}} <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b> The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{declared}} a police intervention against terrorists, {{the local media}} quickly questioned the officers' testimonies {{as well as the}} only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> to launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> to aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> the U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E

5|$|Although Congressional {{investigations}} {{focused on}} whether the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released.

5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> has launched a formal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Hsu and his associates.

5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{international}} investigations {{took place in}} the early 2000s regarding the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion.

Four Credit Suisse bankers were accused of fraud by the US <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> in 2011 for helping wealthy Americans avoid taxes.

5|$|At {{the request}} of the U.S. <b>Justice</b> <b>Department,</b> {{authorities}} conducted a June 4 raid and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands.

5|$|Attorney General George H. Williams {{administered}} the United States Department of Justice with slackness.

The Senate Judiciary Committee had found that Williams had dropped the case after his wife had received a $30,000 payoff. When informed of this, Grant forced Williams's resignation.

5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> and two were by the Republican George W. Bush <b>Justice</b> <b>Department.</b>|$|E
