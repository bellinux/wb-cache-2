5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E

25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} requires that, in general, {{the total}} entropy of any system can't decrease other than {{by increasing the}} entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, {{it is impossible for}} any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling, which performs adiabatic work. As a result, there is no possibility of a perpetual motion system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a chemical reaction, means that it is energetically more efficient.|$|E

25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E

[...] This impossibility only slowly disappeared as experimental practice became more widespread and more refined {{in the early years}} of the 19th century in places such as the newly established Royal Institution in London. Meanwhile, the analytical methods of rational mechanics began to be applied to experimental phenomena, most influentially with the French mathematician Joseph Fourier's analytical treatment of the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat,</b> as published in 1822.

2500|$|Steam engines have {{considerably}} less thermal efficiency than modern diesels, requiring constant maintenance and labour {{to keep them}} operational.

In places where water is available, it may be hard, which can cause [...] "scale" [...] to form, composed mainly of calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide and calcium sulfate. Calcium and magnesium carbonates tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside the surfaces of pipes and heat exchangers. This precipitation is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration. The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes.
