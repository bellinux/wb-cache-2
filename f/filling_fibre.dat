40|$|The RTM {{production}} process for composite components has established {{itself in the}} small to middle series market sector. Particularly the manufacture of complex components require {{a high level of}} experience and know-how. The application of process control techniques has had only limited success in the past and it is only in recent years with the development of fast processing technologies that new measuring techniques are economically as well as practically viable for integration into large scale {{production process}}es. The ultrasound technique presented in this paper can be employed firstly to monitor flow front and mould filling as well as fibre impregnation and secondly to monitor the curing process. The ultrasound sensors are designed for application at high temperature and pressures and can be incorporated behind the mould wall, leaving no impression or marks on the final moulded part. From the ultrasound data it was possible to correlate changes in process parameters with material properties and therefore optimise the RTM production process. The range of application for the ultrasound technology will be discussed and the results compared to conventional reference methods e. g. rheometry and DSC. This provides a foundation for the interpretation of the ultrasound data in terms of flow and cure behaviour and their significance for the RTM process (e. g. mould <b>filling,</b> <b>fibre</b> impregnation and cure).

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been much {{interest}} in designing optical tapers for nonlinear pulse manipulation in both standard[1] and semiconductor filled fibres[2]. Such tapers can be used to overcome the large linear losses in semiconductor <b>filled</b> <b>fibres</b> while allowing parabolic pulse generation or soliton propagation for example. However once the taper profile has been chosen to overcome the linear loss problem in semiconductor <b>filled</b> <b>fibres</b> the problem of two photon absorption (TPA) and associated free carrier effects remain.

40|$|We have {{prepared}} composite fibres {{based on the}} polyester, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), filled with both single walled nanotubes and graphene {{by a combination of}} solution and melt processing. On addition of ? 2 wt% filler we observe increases in both modulus and strength by factors of between ? 2 and ? 4 for both fillers. For the nanotube-based fibres, the mechanical properties depend strongly on fibre diameter due to a combination of defect and nanotube orientation effects. For the graphene <b>filled</b> <b>fibres,</b> the modulus is approximately invariant with diameter while the strength is defect limited, scaling weakly with diameter. Using this production method, the best fibre we prepared had modulus and strength of 42 GPa and 1. 2 GPa respectively (2 wt% SWNT). We attribute this reinforcement predominately to the dispersion quality resulting from the solvent exfoliation of both nanotubes and graphene. In general, marginally better reinforcement was observed for the nanotube <b>filled</b> <b>fibres.</b> However, because of the low cost of graphite, we suggest graphene to be the superior reinforcement material for polymer fibre...|$|R

Two types of FRP materials were used: glass fibres and carbon fibres. Different failure modes {{and the effect of}} concrete fill, type of confinement materials, reinforcement ratio based on tube thickness and type of loading are examined. The study shows that external confinement of concrete by means of modern materials, such fibre reinforced polymers, can enhance its strength and ductility as well as result in large energy absorption capacity. This has important safety implications, especially in regions with seismic activity. A model that predicts the behaviour of confined concrete which takes into account the stiffness and effectiveness of different confinement materials is briefly introduced...|$|R

40|$|FRP {{reinforcement}} {{has emerged}} as an attractive alternate of steel reinforcement due to its higher ultimate tensile strength and weight ratio, and corrosion resistant properties. This study presents the behaviour of Concrete <b>Filled</b> <b>Fibre</b> Reinforced Polymer Tubes (CFFT) with and without longitudinal FRP reinforcing bars under flexural loading. Four circular normal strength CFFT (two carbon FRP tubes and two glass FRP tubes) specimens and a steel reinforced concrete specimen (Reference) of 204 mm and 200 mm diameters respectively were cast and tested. One of the CFFT of each type of CFRP and GFRP CFFT was unreinforced while the other was reinforced. The reinforced CFRP and GFRP CFFT were reinforced with longitudinal 6 Ø 15 CFRP reinforcing bars and 6 Ø 15. 875 GFRP reinforcing bars, respectively. All the CFFT were tested under increasing flexural load until the fibres {{at the bottom of}} the CFFT were ruptured. Significant increases in the ultimate flexural load and ultimate midspan deflections were observed for reinforced CFFT than unreinforced CFFT. GFRP and CFRP reinforced CFFT demonstrated identical flexural behaviour while GFRP CFFT attained even higher ultimate flexural load than the Reference specimen, although both CFFT have similar ultimate midspan deflections...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable {{polymeric}} materials are becoming {{day by day}} ever more important in packaging, agriculture, single-use cutleries and other large consumer applications. The major part of those materials is used under the form of film, i. e. subjected to elongational flow, but the main {{problem is that they}} often offer poor mechanical properties. Adding nanofillers, like Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) may solve this problem but only if there is a full control of their orientation inside the material. Aim of this work is to investigate the processing-properties-morphology relationships for a system prepared under elongation flow of MaterBi and commercial MWCNTs. The materials were characterized both in shear and non-isothermal elongational flow and mechanical tests have been done on hot and cold drawn fibres. The morphology has been investigated by TEM. The shear viscosity increases dramatically {{in the presence of the}} MWCNTs, and the Cox-Merz relation does not hold. The mechanical properties of the hot stretched fibres strongly increase with the draw ratio but the increase is larger for the <b>filled</b> <b>fibres</b> because of the orientation of the MWCNTs. This is not true for the cold drawing because the very low mobility of the MWCNTs hinders their further orientation and the final properties seem driven by the matrix...|$|R
40|$|Concrete <b>Filled</b> <b>Fibre</b> Reinforced Polymer Tube (CFFT) for new columns {{construction}} has attracted significant research attention in recent years. The CFFT {{acts as a}} formwork for new columns and a barrier to corrosion accelerating agents. It significantly increases both the strength capacity (Strength enhancement ratio) and the ductility (Strain enhancement ratio) of reinforced concrete columns. In this study, based on predefined selection criteria, experimental investigation results of 134 circular CFFT columns under axial compression have been compiled and analysed from 599 CFFT specimens available in the literature. It has been observed that actual confinement ratio (expressed {{as a function of}} material properties of fibres, diameter of CFFT and compressive strength of concrete) has significant influence on the strength and ductility of circular CFFT columns. Design oriented models have been proposed to compute the strength and strain enhancement ratios of circular CFFT columns. The proposed strength and strain enhancement ratio models have significantly reduced Average Absolute Error (AAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Relative Standard Error of Estimate (RSEE) and Standard Deviation (SD) as compared to other available strength and strain enhancement ratios of circular CFFT column models. The predictions of the proposed strength and strain enhancement ratio models match well with the experimental strength and strain enhancement ratios investigation results in the compiled database...|$|R

The CFFT {{acts as a}} longitudinal and transverse reinforcement {{and serves as a}} formwork. The CFFT also acts as a barrier to corrosion accelerating agents and reduces the corrosion phenomenon in RC column specimens. A total of six circular CFFT specimens of 152. 5 mm in diameter and 305 mm in height were cast to investigate the axial compressive behaviour of two types of circular CFFT specimens with similar nominal confinement ratios. Type- 1 CFFT specimens consisted of 0. 5 mm thick Carbon FRP (CFRP) tube and Type- 2 CFFT specimens consisted of 1. 3 mm thick Glass FRP (GFRP) tube. Test results of CFFT specimens are also compared with FRP sheet confined concrete specimens with similar nominal confinement ratios. Tested CFFT specimens failed in a brittle manner due to rupture of fibres and crushing of concrete. Experimental results showed that CFRP CFFT specimens achieved almost similar confined concrete strengths and confined concrete axial strains to that of 2. 6 times thicker GFRP CFFT specimens. Tested CFFT specimens exhibited smaller confined concrete strengths and confined concrete axial strains than FRP sheet confined concrete specimens with similar nominal confinement ratios...|$|R

2500|$|Normally {{the cold}} Humboldt Current flows from south to north {{bringing}} nutrient rich plankton {{and with it}} an abundance of marine life along the Peruvian coast. For a few years every century, an El Niño event occurs that reverses {{the flow of the}} current resulting in extremely poor marine catches. In response to such a period of extreme poverty of resources, a priestly class may have arisen to provide leadership and to appeal to the gods for relief. Archaeological evidence for the existence of such elites includes prestige burials with status items such as elaborate clothing and jewelry. Since no prestige burials were found at El Paraiso, there is no direct evidence for the existence of elites. However, indirect evidence for elites lies in the size and complexity of the site. Division of labour and specialization is implied by the existence of a brick factory [...] and the use of rock <b>filled</b> <b>fibre</b> bags. From measuring the structures, archaeologists determined that El Paraiso was built according to a standardized set of engineering principles and measurements. This means that the El Paraiso site was carefully planned and was not just an ad hoc group of buildings. The conclusion is that a hierarchy was necessary to plan the site and to organize and coordinate a large labour force but the precise nature of the social organization remains elusive.|$|R
40|$|This thesis principally {{concentrates}} on the prevention of degrade due to collapse during the controlled kiln drying of timber. Collapse is an abnormal shrinkage which occurs in wood during drying to fibre saturation point (FSP). Formation of internal checking {{is often associated with}} it. Collapse is particularly common in native Australian eucalypt timbers. Specific work was also performed on the drying of karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell) and brushbox (Tristania conferta R. Br.) as part of the commercialisation process of the Clever Kiln Controller® (CKC). The CKC is a personal computer based kiln control package which uses sensed acoustic emissions (AE) and on-line modelling of drying to optimise the seasoning process. Collapse shrinkage occurs {{as a result of the}} physical flattening of water <b>filled</b> <b>fibre</b> cells due to the action of internal tension. The work on collapse presented in this thesis begins with stress-strain modelling of a single fibre under such conditions. This model predicted that collapse of fibres is precipitated at the inner fibre wall, and that fibre collapse is strongly dependant on temperature. Following the predictions of the single fibre model and observations of drying trials, the concept of a "collapse threshold temperature" was introduced. If wood at moisture content (MC) above FSP is dried at temperatures above the collapse threshold temperature, then it will collapse. If it is dried at temperatures below the collapse threshold temperature, then it will not collapse. This concept was first tested on a 20 m 3 kiln load of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. The timber was successfully dried to 40...|$|R

Hydrogel-based hollow fibres were obtained from AN- 69 copolymer, already known for its biocompatibility and tolerance in rodents. Permeability to IL- 4 and lack of cell leakage from the fibres were ascertained in vitro and in vivo. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts transfected with mouse IL- 4 gene were encapsulated in HF (6. 25 × 105 cells/HF). IL- 4 was detected in vitro in the culture supernatant of <b>filled</b> <b>fibres</b> for at least 19 days. IL- 4 or IL- 13 transfected CHO cells encapsulated in HF were implanted in the peritoneum of mice on days 11 – 13 after immunization with type II collagen.

Mice were monitored for signs of arthritis by observers unaware {{of the status of}} animals. Results of these experiments indicate that severity of the articular disease was significantly reduced in the groups of mice treated with CHO/IL- 4 or CHO/IL- 13 cells encapsulated in HF, compared with control groups receiving CHO/βgal cells encapsulated in HF. Histological analysis confirmed these data and extended them to a better inhibitory effect of encapsulated cells compared with free cells on inflammatory and destructive joint disease. Moreover, such long-term treatment with HF was well tolerated; macroscopic and histological aspects of peritoneal cavity were moderately inflammatory. Thus, our results may have important implications for clinical use of gene transfected cells as therapeutic agents in the treatment of autoimmune diseases...|$|R

Carbon black {{was used as the}} reference filler, while maleic anhydride-grafted-polyisoprene was used as a compatibilizer. The natural rubber vulcanizates were compounded on a two-roll mill, and test samples were prepared by compression moulding. The cure characteristics and physico-mechanical properties of the natural rubber vulcanizates were studied at filler loadings of 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 phr (parts per hundred parts rubber). The carbonized bamboo fibre was characterized for filler properties and sieved to 0. 08 µm and 0. 35 µm particle sizes. Results obtained showed that compatibilized carbonized bamboo <b>fibre</b> <b>filled</b> vulcanizates exhibited improvement in the cure properties investigated over the non-compatibilized vulcanizates. Carbon black exhibited higher tensile strength, modulus, hardness and elongation at break in the vulcanizates than carbonized bamboo fibre.

Specific gravity of the vulcanizates increased with increases in filler loading, and was found to be dependent on filler particle size.
