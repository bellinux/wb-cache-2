Fairings on the rotor hub and blade retentions, or a cleaned-up hub and retentions, appeared to be the most effective single modifications tested. The total drag of all protuberances and air leakage also contributed {{a major part of the}} drag - an 83 -percent increase over the <b>drag</b> of the <b>sealed</b> and faired production body. An additional increment of drag was caused by the basic shape of the fuselage - 19 percent more than the drag obtained when the fuselage shape was extensively refaired.

25|$|As {{the piston}} moves in and out, the <b>seal</b> <b>drags</b> and {{stretches}} on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. The piston {{is allowed to}} move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, {{eliminating the need for}} return springs.|$|R
40|$|The calm-water {{resistance}} for Surface Effect Ships (SESs) is {{studied with}} consideration for {{bow and stern}} seal interaction effects. Existing methods for SES resistance prediction {{have been unable to}} accurately predict bow/stern <b>seal</b> <b>drag,</b> which have been experimentally observed to be dominant in some cases in the low-speed regime. Prediction of the total resistance in the low-speed regime is of particular importance for SESs intended to operate at relatively low speeds (e. g. 40 knots) to ensure adequate propulsion power is installed to surpass the secondary drag hump. The primary objective of this work is to study the effects of bow/stern seal interaction on SES total resistance in steady-state operations. A simple, effective, 2 -D numerical model is developed based on coupling a linearized potential-flow solver with a single-degree-of-freedom seal model and rigid body vessel motion model. Systematic validation studies are shown for the fluid and solid models. The resistance of a model-scale SES is predicted with both rigid and flexible seals to determine the influence of seal flexibility. The predicted seal resistance and vessel motion, as well as surface wave patterns, are compared with published experimental results. The numerical model is found to offer accurate predictions for the low-speed resistance of SES <b>seal</b> <b>drag</b> and vessel motion. When combined with other methods for predicting the other components of resistance, the total resistance is predicted reasonably accurately across a large range of Froude numbers. In addition, the physical mechanism that causes the large drag hump at lower speeds is identified as being related to the interaction of the bow seal wave with the stern seal. This interaction is found to be most important at the subhump and to become relatively minor at higher speeds. Thus, a hybrid method is proposed where the numerical model for <b>seal</b> <b>drag</b> is used at low speeds and a more traditional prediction method that ignores seal effects is used at higher speeds, where seal effects are small. Based on the results of this work, {{it may be possible to}} improve SES seal designs and overall vessel performance by introducing the possibility for actively-controlled morphing/contouring seals...|$|R

40|$|Design of pre-swirl {{systems is}} {{important}} for the secondary air cooling system of gas turbine engines. In this paper, three pre-swirl nozzles, a cascade vane and two drilled nozzles are analysed and their performances are compared. The two drilled nozzles considered are a straight drilled nozzle and an aerodynamically designed nozzle. CFD analyses are presented for stand-alone and pre-swirl system 3 D sector models at engine operating conditions near to engine maximum power condition rotational Reynolds number (Re ?) up to 4. 6 ! 10. Nozzle performance is characterised by the nozzle discharge coefficient (C), nozzle velocity coefficient (?η) and cooling air delivery temperature. Two commonly used eddy viscosity models are employed for the study, the standard κ-ε and Spalart-Allmaras models with wall functions. Both models give very similar results for C and η and are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Effects of nozzle or vane number and sealing flow have been analysed. The cascade vanes perform slightly better than the aerodynamically designed drilled nozzles but the final design choice will depend on other component and manufacturing costs. An elementary model is presented to separate temperature losses due to the nozzle, stator <b>drag</b> and <b>sealing</b> flow. Copyright © 2011 by Rolls-Royce plc...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{investigations}} of several 1 / 14 -scale models of an inboard nacelle for the XB- 36 airplane {{was made in}} the Langley two-dimensional low-turbulence tunnels. The purpose of these investigations was to develop a low-drag wing-nacelle pusher combination which incorporated an internal air-flow system. As a result of these investigations, a nacelle was developed which had external drag coefficients considerably lower than the original basic form with the external nacelle drag approximately one-half to two-thirds of those of conventional tractor designs. The largest reductions in <b>drag</b> resulted from <b>sealing</b> the gaps between the wing flaps and nacelle, reducing the thickness of the nacelle training-edge lip, and bringing the under-wing air inlet to the wing leading edge. It was found that without the engine cooling fan adequate cooling air would be available for all conditions of flight except for cruise and climb at 40, 000 feet.

40|$|The Company of Biologists Ltd 2003 Elephant seals {{regularly}} perform dives {{during which}} they spend {{a large proportion of}} time drifting passively through the water column. The rate of vertical change in depth during these `drift' dives is largely a result of the proportion of lipid tissue in the body, with fatter seals having higher (more positive or less negative) drift rates compared with leaner seals. We examined the temporal changes in drift rates of 24 newly weaned southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pups during their first trip to sea to determine if this easily recorded dive characteristic can be used to continuously monitor changes in body composition of seals throughout their foraging trips. All seals demonstrated a similar trend over time: drift rates were initially positive but decreased steadily over the first 30 - 50 days after departure (Phase 1), corresponding to seals becoming gradually less buoyant. Over the following ~ 100 days (Phase 2), drift rates again increased gradually, while during the last ~ 20 - 45 days (Phase 3) drift rates either remained constant or decreased slightly. The daily rate of change in drift rate was negatively related to the daily rate of horizontal displacement (daily travel rate), and daily travel rates of more than ~ 80 km were almost exclusively associated with negative changes in drift rate. We developed a mechanistic model based on body compositions and morphometrics measured in the field, published values for the density of seawater and various body components, and values of drag coefficients for objects of different shapes. We used this model to examine the theoretical relationships between drift rate and body composition and carried out a sensitivity analysis to quantify errors and biases caused by varying model parameters. While variations in seawater density and uncertainties in estimated body surface area and volume are unlikely to result in errors in estimated lipid content of more than ± 2. 5 %, variations in drag coefficient can lead to errors of >= 10 %. Finally, we compared the lipid contents predicted by our model with the lipid contents measured using isotopically labelled water and found a strong positive correlation. The best-fitting model suggests that the <b>drag</b> coefficient of <b>seals</b> while drifting passively is between ~ 0. 49 (roughly corresponding to a sphere-shaped object) and 0. 69 (a prolate spheroid), {{and we were able to}} estimate relative lipid content to within approximately ± 2 % lipid. Our results suggest that this simple method can be used to estimate the changes in lipid content of free-ranging seals while at sea and may help improve our understanding of the foraging strategies of these important marine predators.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} leakage flow and windage heating for labyrinth seals with honeycomb lands {{is critical in}} understanding gas turbine engine system performance and predicting its component lifes. Variety of labyrinth seal configurations (number of teeth, stepped or straight, honeycomb cell size) are in use in gas turbines, and for each configuration, there are many additional geometric factors that can impact a seal’s leakage and windage characteristics. To achieve high performance in modern gas turbine engines, the labyrinth seals operate at low clearances and high rotational speed which are generally deployed with honeycomb lands on the stator. During the transient operation of aircraft engines, the stator and rotor mechanical and thermal growths differ from one another and can often result in the rotor’s incursion into the stator honeycomb structure. The incursions create rub-grooves in the honeycomb lands that can subsequently enlarge as the engine undergoes various manoeuvres. However, the effects of different honeycomb cell size, rotation and presence of rub-groove have not been thoroughly investigated in previously published work. The objective of the present research is to numerically investigate {{the influence of the}} above three factors on seal leakage and windage heating. The present work focuses the development of a numerical methodology aimed at studying above effects. Specifically, a three-dimensional CFD model is developed utilizing commercial finite volume-based software incorporating the RNG k-ε turbulence model. Detail validation of the numerical model is performed by comparing the leakage and windage heating measurements of several rig tests. The turbulent Schmidt number is found to be an important parameter governing the leakage prediction. It depends on honeycomb cell size and clearance for honeycomb seals, and Reynolds number in the presence smooth lands. The present numerical model with the modified RNG k- turbulence model predicts seal leakage and windage heating within 3 - 10 % with available experimental data. Using the validated numerical model, a broad parametric study is conducted by varying honeycomb cell size, radial clearance, pressure ratio and rotational speed for a four-tooth straight-through labyrinth seal with and without rub-grooves. They further indicate that presence of rub-grooves increases seal leakage and reduce windage heating, specifically at smaller clearance and for larger honeycomb cell size. Rotation significantly reduces leakage with smooth stator land and smaller honeycomb cells whereas the effect is minimal for larger (3. 2 mm) honeycomb cells. However, at very high rotational speed seal flow reduces in all seal configurations due to high temperature rise and Rayleigh line effects. At no rub condition and lower clearance, the larger honeycomb cells leak more flow due to high bypass flow through the honeycomb cells. This results into lower pocket swirl and higher windage. When the seal clearance increases the larger honeycomb cells offers more <b>drag</b> to the <b>seal</b> flow, therefore they leak less. At higher clearances the flow travels like a strong wall jet and isolates the pocket air from honeycomb cells. Hence, at open clearances labyrinth seals with any honeycomb cell size essentially produce the same pocket swirl and windage heating...|$|R
