25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> Chas. Greville's book, {{but have}} read {{a good deal}} of it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
500|$|The first trailer was {{launched}} on August 27, 2013. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, on which Deadline's Pete Hammond said, [...] "It would seem an absolute no-brainer that both (McConaughey and Leto) will be sitting {{front and center}} come March 2nd at the Dolby Theatre when Oscar winners are announced. If there are two better performances by anyone this year <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> them." [...] Focus Features released the film on November 1, 2013.|$|E

He went on to say: [...] "Until today <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a single incident or example of rape with a respected lady. Even an underworld don would not like to touch a girl with respect." [...] He also called the male victim [...] "wholly responsible" [...] for the incident because he [...] "failed in his duty to protect the woman".|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi now {{decided on}} marriage; they {{travelled}} to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 {{the couple were}} married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more music, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don't even know what colour my last opera is, and I almost don't remember it." [...] He began to remodel Sant'Agata, which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued {{to work for the}} next twenty years. This included major work on a square room that became his workroom, his bedroom, and his office.|$|E

I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E

500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only imagine that it is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E
500|$|The paceman was rested for {{the match}} against Derbyshire {{immediately}} after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings. Lindwall returned for the match against Glamorgan and took 2/36 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the next match against Warwickshire, he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen Tom Dollery and Abdul Hafeez Kardar—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138. In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low-scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman’s men won by nine wickets. Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford {{for the second time}} during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's benefit. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists’ first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in [...] "stupendous form ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler". Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled Jack Ikin for 99 and Dick Pollardwho later claimed to have not seen the ballfor a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but William Roberts successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury. The paceman was rested from the non-first-class match against Durham, which was a rain-affected draw.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{rejected}} Breyer’s {{example of}} a double murderer arbitrarily receiving a lighter sentence than a murderer, citing news reports on WRAL-TV as explanation. [...] Noting that, “in my decades on the Court, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> a capital crime {{that could not be}} considered sufficiently ‘blameworthy’ to merit a death sentence”, Thomas concluded by spending several pages graphically describing some of those crimes, including several rapes and several murders committed by the mentally retarded and by juveniles.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Linnaeus {{classified}} the kraken as a cephalopod, designating {{the scientific}} name Microcosmus marinus {{in the first}} edition of his Systema Naturae (1735), a taxonomic classification of living organisms. The creature was excluded from later editions. Linnaeus's later work, Fauna Suecica (1746), calls the creature singulare monstrum, [...] "a unique monster", and says of it Habitare fertur in mari Norwegico, ipse non dum animal vidi, [...] "It is said to inhabit the seas of Norway, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> this animal".|$|E

2500|$|In 1934, Kirchner visited Berne and Zurich, {{finding the}} former more {{pleasing}} than the latter, and met Paul Klee. In {{the winter of}} 1935, a new school was being planned {{to be built in}} Frauenkirch and Kirchner offered to paint a mural. This project was dropped and instead Kirchner created a sculpture to be placed above the door of the schoolhouse. Reflecting on the inauguration of the schoolhouse in 1936 he writes, [...] "the new school was inaugurated yesterday. It was a celebration with songs, dancing and speeches, followed by drinking such as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> or experienced in decades...They made a point of including me and so there I was, sitting once again amongst these people who had received me with such kindness and friendliness on the alp twenty years ago.

2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} God's promise in [...] "and, behold, I am with you, and {{will keep you}} {{wherever}} you go," [...] answered all of Jacob's requests, except that for sustenance. Jacob prayed in [...] "If God will be with me," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "Behold, I am with you." [...] Jacob prayed, [...] "And will keep me," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "And I will keep you." [...] Jacob prayed, [...] "In this way that I go," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "wherever you go." [...] Jacob prayed in [...] "So that I come back to my father's house in peace," [...] and God assured Jacob, [...] "and will bring you back." [...] But the Rabbis taught that God did not answer Jacob's request for sustenance. Rabbi Assi, however, taught that God answered Jacob's request for sustenance, too, for in [...] God says, [...] "for I will not forsake you," [...] and forsaking applies to sustenance, as in , [...] "Yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread." ...|$|E
