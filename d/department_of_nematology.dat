50|$|After Webber {{retired in}} 1929, Leon Dexter Batchelor became the second {{director}} of the CES. Under his direction, the land, capital facilities, and operating budget expanded significantly, and the station moved into several new areas of agricultural science, including statistics and experimental plot design, herbicides to reduce weeds, and the first studies {{of the effects of}} air pollution on crops. It was during this time that the station battled a mutation of Citrus tristeza virus, resulting in some 9000 trees (87% of the station's orchards) being destroyed in order to contain the outbreak. After Batchelor retired in 1951, Alfred M. Boyce became the new director, and the CES entered another period of growth as agricultural production in Southern California boomed after World War II. The old divisional structure was replaced along departmental lines, and five new departments were added, including the nation's first <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>nematology.</b> A committee on air pollution research was also developed in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Boyce {{became an}} {{associate}} professor of entomology at Riverside in 1933 while he continued to work at the Citrus Experimentation Station. He was advanced to full professor in 1942 and became the head of the entomology department in 1943. At the urging of Harry Scott Smith, Boyce made an overseas trip in 1951 on behalf of the Foreign Agricultural Service to identify natural predators of the Scale insect as a measure of biological control, to protect California's olive crop. Boyce took his wife Dr. Janet Mabry Boyce (also an entomologist) along to capture and import the appropriate insects. Upon their return, Boyce was appointed the head of the station at Riverside replacing the retiring Leon D. Batchelor. Boyce was a proponent of nematology, supporting the creation of a separate <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>nematology</b> within University of California with Dr. Dewey J. Raski as the new department's chair. Boyce appeared on the March 25th, 1956 episode of The New Edgar Bergen Hour In 1960, Boyce was appointed the first Dean of the College of Agriculture where he remained until his retirement from teaching in 1968. He continued to serve as an agricultural advisor to the Rockefeller Foundation until 1974. Boyce's papers are archived at UCR.|$|E

While an undergraduate, Van Gundy worked part-time at an H.J. Heinz research facility. There he met J.C. Walker: a professor teaching at University of Wisconsin - Madison. Walker offered Van Gundy an assistant-ship to continue studying cucumbers after Van Gundy's graduation from Bowling Green State University. Van Gundy went to University of Wisconsin for graduate work where he completed his Ph.D in 1956 and his postdoctoral studies in February 1957. Van Gundy interviewed with Dewey J. Raski for a nematology position at University of California, Riverside (UCR); Van Gundy {{was hired by the}} co-located University of California Citrus Experiment Station as a junior nematologist in March 1957.In 1966 Van Gundy took a sabbatical from teaching to study Meloidogyne javanica and Tylenchulus semipenetrans in Australia with Harry Wallace and Alan Bird.Van Gundy was promoted to full professor in July 1968. In 1969 {{during the height of the}} Vietnam War, Van Gundy defended the University’s position refusing classified Department of Defense research projects, citing the restriction against publication counter to the interests of involved graduate and postdoctoral students. That same year Van Gundy founded the Journal of Nematology for the Society of Nematologists, becoming the journal's first editor-in-chief. Beginning in 1970 Van Gundy served as Assistant Vice Chancellor for Research until 1972 when he was recruited by the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources's dean, William Dugger, to chair the <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>nematology.</b> [...] In 1978, Van Gundy was named a fellow of the American Phytopathological Society. Van Gundy continued to chair nematology at UCR until he took a sabbatical in 1984 to study rhizobacteria. That work resulted in Van Fundy being awarded a patent for Rhizobacterial plant protection.|$|E

A joint study of the <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nematology,</b> Agricultural University, Wageningen (biotic parametes). To assess the quality of soils an ecological typology based on the free-living nematode fauna is in development. Herefore knowledge {{on the relationship between}} the presence of nematodes and the physical and chemical soil parameters is essential. Fifteen different forest ecosystems spread on 30 locations were sampled between 4 / 4 / 88 and 26 / 5 / 88. This sampling program covered all the sandy soils of the Netherlands. In 71 samples were analysed: water content; pH, texture, organic matter, nitrate, ammonium, total nitrogen, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, base capacity and CEC. The analysis of the biotic parameters and the interpretation of the data will be published in another paper...|$|E

Seven wild and cultivated cucurbitaceous rootstocks and two cucumber scions (variety and hybrid) were used for screening studies against the root knot nematode. Forty fifth day after inoculation, the plants were evaluated for shoot length, root length, shoot fresh and dry weight as well as root fresh and dry weight, number of galls per 10 gram of root, egg mass and females per gram of root, root knot index, soil nematode population per 200 cc of soil and reproduction factor. The lowest number of galls and egg masses were observed in Citrullus colocynthis followed by Cucumis metuliferus which exhibited resistant reaction with root knot index (RKI) of 2. The other rootstocks viz., Cucurbita ficifolia, Cucurbita moschata, C. maxima and Luffa cylindrica {{were found to be}} moderately resistant to root knot nematode with root knot index of 3.

The pelidnotine scarabs (Scarabaeidae: Rutelinae: Rutelini) are a speciose, paraphyletic assemblage of beetles that includes spectacular metallic species ("jewel scarabs") as well as species that are ecologically important as herbivores, pollinators, and bioindicators. These beetles suffer from a complicated nomenclatural history, due primarily to 20 th century taxonomic and nomenclatural errors. We review the taxonomic history of the pelidnotine scarabs, present a provisional key to genera with overviews of all genera, and synthesize a catalog of all taxa with synonyms, distributional data, type specimen information, and 107 images of exemplar species. As a result of our research, the pelidnotine leaf chafers (a paraphyletic group) include 27 (26 extant and 1 extinct) genera and 420 valid species and subspecies (419 extant and 1 extinct). Our research makes biodiversity research on this group tractable and accessible, thus setting the stage for future studies that address evolutionary and ecological trends. Based on our research, 1 new species is described, 1 new generic synonym and 12 new species synonyms are proposed, 11 new lectotypes and 1 new neotype are designated, many new or revised nomenclatural combinations, and many unavailable names are presented.

40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> Zoology, Rand Afrikaans University, 28 August 1973 Taxonomy is {{outlined}} as that {{branch of}} zoology {{dealing with the}} discovery, identification, naming, description, and classification of animal species. A century or two ago taxonomy, along with morphology and anatomy, {{was one of the}} main fields of interest in zoology. After about the middle of the nineteenth century, with the advent of experimental biology, many biologists regarded taxonomy as an obsolete science. On the basis of several examples from the field <b>of</b> <b>nematology,</b> it is shown that taxonomy is still essential, especially for the more applied branches of biology, such as agriculture. It is pointed out that the emphasis on ecology in the more recent past, and the demands that ecology makes upon taxonomy, tends to reinstate taxonomy in its proper place as one of the most basic biological sciences. In refutation of the frequently heard accusation that taxonomy has been static for the last century or more, attention is drawn to the continuous consideration of new approaches and the adaptation of new techniques...|$|R
