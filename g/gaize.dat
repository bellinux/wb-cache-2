Due to the alternating layering of weathering/erosion-prone shales and more resistant sandstones and limestones, a cuesta landscape has formed there in the past several million years. The most conspicuous of these cuestas is the White Jura of Franconia and the Swabian Jura. Uplands formed by relatively weathering/erosion-resistant sandstones of the early/middle Buntsandstein are the Palatinate Forest, the Odenwald, the Spessart, the Südrhön and the Burgwald. Ridges of Muschelkalk limestone are found mainly in the Thuringian Basin. Probably the most well-known occurrence of Cretaceous sandstones is the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.|$|R

More than 1000 pebbles (2 cm < equivalent diameter of the rock fragment < 5 cm) have been sampled in stony soils developed {{from each of the}} five lithologies. We demonstrated that the water content at saturation of the studied pebbles was equal to the water content at − 100 hPa and to the water content at field capacity. A linear relationship between the water content at − 100 hPa and at − 15, 840 hPa enabled to derive a simple pedotransfer function to determine the available water content of the rock fragments. We also proposed a second simple pedotransfer function, which expresses the available water content from the dry bulk density of the rock fragments only. A simulation at the horizon scale for a loamy-clay stony horizon showed that the SAWC could be strongly misjudged when the rock fragments were not taken into account: for a stony horizon containing 30 % of pebbles, the SAWC is underestimated by 5 % for chert pebbles and by 33 % for chalk pebbles...|$|R

40|$|In the hydrogeological {{image of}} Poland the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze stand out with {{numerous}} springs of differentiated yields. In the active water circulation zone {{of this region}} there are different carbonate rocks. In the near-surface zone there are mostly maastricht deposits developed into lime silicate rocks, marls or chalk which are locally covered with Paleocene <b>gaizes,</b> Neogene limestones and sandstones. In the plateau areas these rocks are covered with {{a thin layer of}} sand-dust sediments and locally with a thick loess cover. The usable underground water horizon occurs in the Cretaceous carbonate rocks and locally even in the Tertiary and Quaternary ones. Differentiated tectonic systems of oriented cracks strongly affect the underground water circulation and the occurence of springs. About 1550 springs were recorded in the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze of which about 1230 are still functioning. The springs with a small yield are the most common for 57 % of outflows do not reach 1 1 /s. All the springs supplied with water from the upper aquiferhorizons existing in the highest parts of drainage basins are in this group. The yield 1 - 10 l/s appears in 29 % of springs; only 13 % of springs exceeds 10 l/s. 160 springs of the yield above 10 l/s were recorded in the researched area. Out of these 11 springs permanently exceed 100 l/s and 8 such springs are located in the Roztocze and 2 more in the vicinity of this region. From the hydrological point of view the springs exceeding 10 l/s are of greatest significance They supply about 78 % of water flowing out of the springs in the Lublin Upland and the Roztocze hence they decide about the quantity of water flowing in the rivers during the precipitation-free period. In the Roztocze and {{in the western part of}} the Lublin Upland about 38 % of water directly derives from the springs and the comparable quantity of water inflows to the rivers through the direct river-bed drainage.

The comparison results successfully validated the capability of LDAS with new RTM to simulate near surface soil moisture at various environments, supporting that LDAS can generally simulate soil moisture with a reasonable accuracy for both humid vegetated fields and arid bare soil fields while the LSM overestimates near surface soil moisture for humid vegetated fields and underestimates soil moisture for arid bare soil fields...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{hydrological}} cycle over the Tibetan Plateau, two GPS receiving stations were established at Naqu in {{eastern part of}} the plateau and at <b>Gaize</b> in western part of the plateau in August 2000. Diurnal variations in atmospheric water vapor over the plateau during summer are investigated by analyzing the GPS-derived precipitable water (PW), surface meteorological observation data and GMS (Geostationary Meteorological Satellite) infrared (IR) data. The precipitable water changes greatly on a time scale of 10 - 20 days in the summer season. The minima of the diurnal variation appear in the morning and in the evening in dry periods. This may be caused by evaporation from the earth’s surface and transport of water vapor by the local circulations. In wet periods, cloud activity and precipitation showed a clear diurnal cycle with a maximum in the afternoon to evening. However, the precipitable water changes little during the day. In wet periods, the precipitable water is close to the saturated precipitable water, the amount of water vapor concentrated by convergence is almost equal to that removed by precipitation in the afternoon to evening over the plateau...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{examines}} precipitation samples {{collected at the}} Yushu meteorological station on the eastern Tibetan Plateau from November 2000 to November 2002. Results show that air-temperature effects control d 18 O in precipitation in this area. Values of d 18 O in precipitation positively correlate with air temperature, especially for monthly averages. Our data also show d 18 O values in precipitation positively correlate with dew point and surface pressure in the Yushu region. Similar to other stations (Tuotuohe, Nagqu, <b>Gaize</b> and Shiquanhe) lying in the transition zone between the regions in the south dominated by the monsoon {{and those in the}} north dominated by the westerlies, because of the effect of monsoon precipitation, precipitation rates are high, and heavy isotopes are more depleted in summer at the Yushu station. Accordingly, values of d 18 O in precipitation correlate more strongly with air temperature and dew point before the monsoon onset and after the monsoon retreat than during the monsoon period. That is, intense monsoon activities weaken the correlations between d 18 O and air temperature and dew point. Clearly, dew point, surface pressure and the monsoon intensity contribute to controlling the d 18 O values in precipitation at the Yushu station...|$|E

We used the SLHF daily and monthly data to differentiate the global and seasonal variability from the transient local anomalies. The temporal scale of the observed variations is 1 – 2 months {{before and after the}} earthquakes, and spatial scale is about 10 °× 10 °. The result suggests that the SLHFs adjacent the epicenters all are anomalous high value (>μ+ 2 σ) 8 – 30 days before the shocks as compared with past several years of data. Different from the abnormal meteorological phenomenon, the distribution of the anomalies was isolated and local, which usually occurred in the epicenter and its adjacent area, or along the fault lines. The increase of SLHF was tightly related with the season which the earthquake occurs in; the maximal (125 W/m 2, Pu’er earthquake) and minimal (25 W/m 2, <b>Gaize</b> earthquake) anomalies were in summer and winter, respectively. The abundant surface water and groundwater in the epicenter and its adjacent region can provide necessary condition for the change of SLHF.

40|$|The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) global land surface {{temperature}} (LST) /emissivity products supply daily, 8 -day, and monthly global temperature and narrowband emissivity data. This article uses these products {{to calculate the}} surface long wave radiation of natural objects such as sand, soil, vegetation, etc., based on the Planck function and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The results show that using the narrowband emissivity of a single band instead of the broadband emissivity results in large errors of up to 100 W m− 2 of the calculated long wave radiation. A method to calculate broadband emissivity in the entire TIR spectral region from the narrowband emissivities of the MODIS bands (29, 31, and 32) in the thermal infrared region is proposed. Using the broadband emissivity, the surface long wave radiation could be calculated to an accuracy better than 6 W m− 2 in the temperature region of 240 – 330 K, {{with a standard deviation}} of 1. 22 W m− 2, and a maximum error of 6. 05 W m− 2 (not considering the uncertainty associated with the MODIS LST/emissivity products themselves).

40|$|Purpose: Beginning {{more than}} 30 years ago, {{opencast}} lignite mining in the "Bełchatów" area {{is an important}} source of accompanying minerals. Lignite mining in the "Bełchatów" mine yields, on average, more than 35 million tonnes per annum and requires removing more than 110 million cubic meters of overburden. Therefore the mine outside of the main mineral exploitation of lignite, leads to a large-scale economy of accompanying minerals. Part of the minerals are present in the overburden and are exposed on the slopes of the opencast mine; these minerals are selectively exploited in the event of the absence of recipients stored on anthropogenic deposits. The object of this mineralogical-geochemical study is a group of transitional rocks such as opoka-rocks, <b>gaize</b> and marls exposed when contact occurs between Neogene sediments and Mesozoic basement rocks in the "Bełchatów" lignite deposit. In the case of these rocks, during preliminary geological research carried out on the mine, doubt often appear as to their explicit petrographic character and hence their practical use. Advanced mineralogical methods allow mistakes in their identification to be avoided and a geomechanical study indicates possible direction of their practical use. Methods: The heterogeneous petrographic character of the examined rocks required the use of a broad research spectrum. The following microscopes were used in the framework of the mineralogical research: Polarizing Olimpus BX 51 and electron (SEM) FEI Quanta 200 FEG equipped with an X-ray spectrometer (EDX Genesis) and backscattered electron detector (BSE). In addition, observations were carried out using a cathodoluminescence apparatus, the Cambridge Image Technolgy Ltd CCL 8200 mk 3 model, and a polarizing microscope, type Nikon Optiphot 2. Determination of the phase composition (qualitative and quantitative) was made using X-ray diffraction and utilizing the powder method of Debye-Sherrer. An X-ray diffractometer, a Philips PW 3020 X'PERT, was also used in the study. Analyses by Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy were performed using the production apparatus BIO-RAD, model FTS 165, equipped with a package of programs for the digital processing of results. The chemical composition was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a spectrophotometer Philips PU 9100 Xi Camera SX- 100 and atomic emission spectroscopy with inductively coupled plasma (ICP AES) using spectrometer 40 PLASMA. The geomechanical properties were determined in accordance with the following standards: open and total porosity (PN-EN 1936 : 2001) compressive strength in air – dried state (PN-EN 1926 : 2001), bulk density and density (PN-EN 1936 : 2001), relative humidity (PN-EN 1925 : 2001); absorbability of stone material (PN-EN 13755 : 2002) and abrasion on the face of Boehme (PN- 84 /B- 04111). Results: Mineralogical-petrographic studies of the transitional rocks showed that the dominant component was SiO 2 which was presented in the form of opal type A and CT, chalcedony, quartz and microquartz. In addition, {{it was found that the}} rocks studied had been covered by secondary mineralization processes. The observations carried out showed that these rocks underwent primary silicification and decalcination processes, which contributed to the diverse petrographic nature of the rocks studied and secondarily experienced a change in their physico-mechanical properties. The silification process was the result of diagenetic processes taking place within the Neogene argillaceous rocks occurring when a sub-coal series is situated in the immediate vicinity of the bedrock. There was a release of extruded silica-rich water from the clays during the mechanical compaction process. Some amounts of silica may also be derived from plagioclase dissolution and the transformation of terrigenous material, mainly grains of potassium feldspar. The precipitation of silica from porous solutions occurred most when coinciding with the presence of carbonic acid formed by the decomposition of organic substances of vegetable origin. Practical implications: The studies carried out have a significant practical implication, as the transitional sediments from the "Bełchatów" lignite deposit can be used in the production of building materials. Originality/value: Against the background of a number of published papers on the rocks accompanying lignite seams there is a lack of the "Bełchatów" mineralogical-petrographic studies of the transitional sediments in the Mesozoic-Neogene contact zone in the "Bełchatów" lignite deposit taking into account the aspect of raw materials.

The silification process was the result of diagenetic processes taking place within the Neogene argillaceous rocks occurring when a sub-coal series is situated in the immediate vicinity of the bedrock. There was a release of extruded silica-rich water from the clays during the mechanical compaction process. Some amounts of silica may also be derived from plagioclase dissolution and the transformation of terrigenous material, mainly grains of potassium feldspar. The precipitation of silica from porous solutions occurred most when coinciding with the presence of carbonic acid formed by the decomposition of organic substances of vegetable origin. Practical implicationsThe studies carried out have a significant practical implication, as the transitional sediments from the "Bełchatów" lignite deposit can be used in the production of building materials. Originality/valueAgainst the background of a number of published papers on the rocks accompanying lignite seams there is a lack of the "Bełchatów" mineralogical-petrographic studies of the transitional sediments in the Mesozoic-Neogene contact zone in the "Bełchatów" lignite deposit taking into account the aspect of raw materials. This paper has been produced to fill the void in this area...|$|E
