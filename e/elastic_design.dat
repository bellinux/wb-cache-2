The Performance based Plastic design is a displacement based method which uses pre-selected target drift and yield mechanisms as design criteria whereas the <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> method {{is based on the}} conventional force based limit state method. The nonlinear static pushover analysis shows formation of hinges in columns of the frame designed using <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> approach leading to collapse.

Although the ground motions caused large displacements in the Performance based Plastic design frame as it was seen from the acceleration and displacement responses obtained from the nonlinear time history analysis, the structure did not lose stability.

Due to limitation of analytical methods, various numerical approaches such as finite element methods (FEM) [1]–[6], meshfree methods [7],[8], and natural element method [9], just to mention a few, have therefore been developed.|$|R

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{approach is}} proposed to obtain reliable {{estimates of the}} peak response of nonlinear systems to excitations specified via a response∕design seismic spectrum. This is achieved without resorting to numerical integration of the governing nonlinear equations of motion. First, a numerical scheme is utilized to derive a power spectrum which is compatible in a stochastic sense to a given <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> spectrum. This spectrum is then treated as the excitation spectrum {{in the context of}} the statistical linearization method to determine effective parameters, damping and stiffness, corresponding to an equivalent linear system (ELS). The obtained parameters are used in conjunction with the linear design spectrum, for various values of damping, to estimate the response of certain nonlinear systems. The case of single‐degree‐of‐freedom systems with cubic stiffness nonlinearity and hysteretic systems whose restoring force traces a bilinear law are considered in conjunction with the <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> spectrum prescribed by the European aseismic code provisions (EC 8). Monte Carlo simulations pertaining to an ensemble of non‐stationary EC 8 design spectrum compatible accelerograms are conducted to confirm that the average peak response of the nonlinear systems compare reasonably well with that of the ELS. This is true, even in cases where the response of the nonlinear oscillators deviates significantly from the linear one. In this manner, the proposed approach yields ELS which can reliably replace the original nonlinear systems in carrying out computationally efficient analyses in the initial stages of the aseismic design of structures under severe seismic excitations. Furthermore, the potential of this approach for developing inelastic design spectra from a given <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> spectrum is established...|$|E

Several deficiencies in the ATC- 40 Procedure A are demonstrated. This iterative procedure did not converge {{for some of the}} systems analyzed. It converged in many cases, but to a deformation much different than dynamic (nonlinear response history or inelastic design spectrum) analysis of the inelastic system. The ATC- 40 Procedure B always gives a unique value of deformation, same as that determined by Procedure A if it converged. These approximate procedures underestimate significantly the deformation {{for a wide range of}} periods and ductility factors with errors approaching 50 %, implying that the estimated deformation is about half the ‘‘exact’’ value. Surprisingly, the ATC- 40 procedures are deficient relative to even the <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> spectrum in the velocity-sensitive and displacement-sensitive regions of the spectrum.

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} the new concept of elastic block ciphers, symmetrickey encryption algorithms that (1) for a variable-size input do not expand the plaintext (i. e., {{do not require}} plaintext padding) and (2) adjust their computational load proportionally to the size increase. Contrary to stream ciphers, elastic block ciphers maintain the diffusion property and non-synchronicity of traditional block ciphers. Elastic block ciphers are ideal (when combined with encryption modes) for applications where length-preserving encryption is most beneficial, such as protecting variable-length database fields or network packets. We present a general algorithm for converting a traditional block cipher, such as AES, to its elastic version, and analyze {{the security of the}} resulting cipher against key recovery attacks. Our approach allows us to “stretch ” the supported block size of a block cipher up to twice the original length, while increasing the computational load proportionally to the expanded block size. Our approach does not allow us to use the original cipher as a “black box ” (i. e., as an ideal cipher or a pseudorandom permutation as is used in constructing modes of encryption). Nevertheless, under some reasonable conditions on the cipher’s structure and its key schedule, we reduce certain key recovery attacks of the elastic version to such attacks on the fixed-size block cipher. This schema and the security reduction enable us to capitalize on secure ciphers and their already established security properties in developing <b>elastic</b> <b>designs.</b> We note that we are not aware of previous “reduction type ” proofs of security in the area of concrete (i. e., non “black-box”) block cipher design.

40|$|Load-bearing masonry {{buildings}} {{are composed of}} concrete slabs and supporting masonry walls, and in Australia usually incorporate slip joints in the interfaces between walls and slabs for serviceability reasons. The apparent conflicting requirements of the slip joints, to slip under long-term loads and to transmit short-term loading from wind and earthquake actions, together {{with the lack of}} attention to the design of slip joints, make slip in the joints likely to occur when the building is subjected to a lateral loading. Joint slip leads to a redistribution of loading in the building wall system, resulting in wall shear loads different from that determined using the current standard <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> procedures. Redistribution of loading may be also caused by softening of the masonry. This paper has assessed the realistic response of various load-bearing masonry buildings, including the potential for slip in the joints and softening of the masonry, and evaluated the level of wall shear load deviations resulting from the application of current design procedures. Analyses of the buildings, using non-linear static and dynamic finite element models, have indicated that joint slip may occur in buildings subjected to earthquake loading. The application of current <b>elastic</b> <b>design</b> procedures, which do not account for loading redistribution, resulted in major wall shear load deviations, such as overestimations of up to + 75 % and underestimations of up to - 62 %.
