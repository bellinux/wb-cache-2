5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular top and face to the parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding <b>Edge,</b> <b>to</b> return to Manchester.|$|E

5|$|The card {{featured}} eight televised matches, {{including two}} main events {{which resulted in}} Rob Van Dam defeating <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> retain the WWE Championship and D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) defeating Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey) in a 5-on-2 Handicap match. One bout was featured on the undercard, in which John Cena defeated Sabu in an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, which featured superstars from the Raw and ECW brands at ringside.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase {{got off to}} a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> get the pin.|$|E

5|$|A {{preliminary}} Raw brand feud {{was between}} Shawn Michaels and Edge. Their feud started at Taboo Tuesday 2004 when Michaels was voted over <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. At New Year's Revolution 2005, Edge lost {{a shot at}} the title in an Elimination Chamber with Michaels as special referee. In the Elimination Chamber, Michaels superkicked Edge, followed by a lionsault from Chris Jericho, with Jericho making the cover. Believing it was Michael's fault that he was not crowned champion, Edge speared Michaels and the two men were booked into a match at Royal Rumble.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) {{defeated}} Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, {{they were}} {{given the opportunity to}} be in charge of Raw for a month; On the November 29 episode of Raw, Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal. The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match. Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoitâ€™s shoulders to touch the mat. The referee began counting, which moments later led to <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> submit to the maneuver. The following week, with Chris Jericho in charge, Vince McMahon vacated the World Heavyweight title, concluding the match ended in a tie. On the December 13 episode of Raw, Eric Bischoff, who had resumed his position as General Manager, scheduled an Elimination Chamber match between Triple H, Edge, Benoit, Chris Jericho, Orton and Batista at New Year's Revolution for the vacant World Heavyweight title. The following week, Bischoff concluded with adding a Special Guest Referee for the Elimination Chamber: Shawn Michaels. At New Year's Revolution, Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign.|$|E

Kane tried to {{interrogate}} Edge during their fight but in the end, Edge unknowingly double pinned his rival, keeping Kane as World Heavyweight Champion before wheeling Kane into a barricade. On November 26, Edge was offered {{a chance at a}} rematch with Kane for the title if we would let Bearer go free. But Edge did not keep his word. At the end of the night, Edge lured Kane outside and drove over a dummy of Paul Bearer before driving off with the real one again.|$|E
5|$|Crawford debuted on WWE's main roster on the June 13, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, as Alicia Fox, in a {{backstage}} segment with Vickie Guerrero, which saw her portraying Guerrero and Edge's wedding planner. During their wedding reception the following month, Triple H revealed Edge kissing Fox {{the day before}} the wedding on camera. Fox involved herself in the WWE Championship match at The Great American Bash when she attempted to help Edge, but she was stopped by Guerrero. The confusion surrounding her interference caused <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> accidentally spear Guerrero.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recording}} of the album Pop in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find {{the rest of the}} band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by guitarist The Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album's electronic feel.|$|E

5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> the stipe).|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Edge defended the WWE Championship against Triple H and Jeff Hardy in a Triple Threat match. Hardy {{performed}} a Swanton Bomb on Triple H but Edge pulled Hardy {{out of the}} ring, voiding the pinfall. Edge attempted a Spear on Triple H but Triple H avoided the move and Edge executed a Spear through a broadcast table on Hardy. Triple H executed a Pedigree on Edge but Vladimir Kozlov pulled Triple H out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. Kozlov attacked Triple H but Matt Hardy stopped Kozlov. In the end, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge but Hardy executed a Swanton Bomb on Edge, causing Triple H to roll out of the ring, and pinned <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> win the title.|$|E

5|$|Kirby's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game, a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Kirby {{series for the}} Game Boy portable console. It is a Breakout clone; the player controls paddles along the screen's <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The game's 55 levels include power-ups, bonus rounds, and minigames. Kirby's Block Ball was developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R. The team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match Kirby's signature characteristics. Kirby's Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995, later in Europe, and last in North America in 1996.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 2008, Hardy {{was drafted}} from the Raw brand to the SmackDown brand, {{as a part}} of the 2008 WWE draft. Hardy made his SmackDown debut on the July 4 episode, {{defeating}} John Morrison. Hardy participated in the WWE Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven and also challenged for the Championship at No Mercy and Cyber Sunday, but failed to win each time. He was originally scheduled to be in the WWE Championship match at Survivor Series, but, in storyline, was found unconscious in his hotel, allowing the returning <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> replace him in the match and win the title. At Armageddon in December 2008, Hardy defeated the defending champion Edge and Triple H in a triple threat match to capture the WWE Championship, his first world championship.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches on the SmackDown brand was between The Undertaker and Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At Backlash, the Undertaker defeated <b>Edge</b> <b>to</b> retain the title by {{forcing him to}} submit to the gogoplata, a chokehold move that causes opponents to spit blood (scripted) from their mouths. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, authority figure Vickie Guerrero stripped the title from the Undertaker, after claiming the gogoplata was an illegal submission hold and she did it to protect the other wrestlers. The following week, Guerrero booked Undertaker in a match for the vacant title at Judgment Day against Edge, who last eliminated Batista in a battle royal, an elimination style match where the last person in the ring is the winner, to become the number one contender.|$|E
