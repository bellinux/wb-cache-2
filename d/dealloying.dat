50|$|Selective leaching, {{also called}} <b>dealloying,</b> demetalification, parting and {{selective}} corrosion, is a corrosion type in some solid solution alloys, when in suitable conditions {{a component of}} the alloys is preferentially leached from the material. The less noble metal is removed from the alloy by a microscopic-scale galvanic corrosion mechanism. The most susceptible alloys are the ones containing metals with high distance between each other in the galvanic series, e.g. copper and zinc in brass. The elements most typically undergoing selective removal are zinc, aluminium, iron, cobalt, chromium, and others.|$|E

One such approach employs thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG Thiol) to destabilize gold nanoparticles prepared by citrate reduction so that they self-assemble into mesoporous gold sponges. Mesoporous gold sponges are attractive materials for molecular sensing by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), for catalysis, and for fuel cell construction. The following approach is “green” because PEG Thiol is biocompatible, and because it requires relatively little energy; PEG Thiol-triggered self-assembly of mesoporous gold sponges occurs at room temperature. By contrast, the most popular method of generating mesoporous gold sponges, <b>dealloying</b> Au-Ag alloys, employs electrochemical corrosion.|$|E
