5|$|Thermal energy causes {{some of the}} {{molecules}} at {{the outer edge of}} the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loss</b> comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.|$|E

Insulated pressure vessels can store liquid hydrogen (LH 2); low-temperature (90 K) compressed hydrogen (CH 2); or ambient temperature CH 2. In this analysis, hydrogen temperatures, pressures and venting losses am calculated for insulated pressure vessels fueled with LH 2 or with low-temperature CH 2, {{and the results are}} compared to those obtained in low-pressure LH 2 tanks. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>losses</b> are calculated as a function of daily driving distance during normal operation; as a function of time during long periods of vehicle inactivity; and as a function of initial vessel temperature during fueling. The number of days before any venting losses occur is also calculated {{as a function of the}} daily driving distance. The results show that insulated pressure vessels have packaging characteristics comparable to those of conventional, low-pressure LH 2 tanks (low weight and volume), with greatly improved dormancy and much lower boil-off. Insulated pressure vessels used in a 17 km/l (40 mpg) car do not lose any hydrogen when the car is driven at least 15 km/day in average. Since almost all cars are driven for longer distances, most cars would never lose any <b>hydrogen.</b> <b>Losses</b> during long periods of parking are also relatively small. Due to their high-pressure capacity, these vessels would retain about a third of their full charge even after a very long dormancy, so that the owner would not risk running out of fuel. If an insulated pressure vessel reaches ambient temperature, it can be cooled down very effectively by fueling it with LH 2 with no losses during fueling. The vessel has good thermal performance even when thermally insulated with inexpensive microsphere insulation. In addition, the insulated pressure vessels greatly ease fuel availability and infrastructure requirements, since it would be compatible with both compressed and cryogenic hydrogen reveling...|$|R

The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate magnetic levitation as a possible suspension mechanism, eliminating the use of current physical supports and so doing reducing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>losses</b> due to boil-off. A conceptual design of a container which makes use of magnetic suspension is presented in this study. The concept is validated on the basis of the forces obtainable between a paramagnetic aluminium plate and an electromagnet, as well as the forces obtainable between a neodymium magnet and a bulk Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide superconductor. The forces between the paramagnetic aluminium plate and electromagnet were determined mathematically and tested experimentally. The forces between the magnet and superconductor were determined mathematically and by finite element modelling and simulations using ANSYS Multiphysics. The results obtained in the mathematical- and finite element studies were then validated experimentally. It was found that the forces obtained experimentally between the aluminium plate and electromagnets are inadequate for magnetic suspension of the inner vessel given in the conceptual design. It was also found that the forces obtained experimentally and in the simulation studies for the magnet and superconductor of this study were inadequate due to shortcomings in the magnet and superconductor obtained for experimental tests. The conclusion of this study is that electromagnetic levitation should not be used as a magnetic suspension mechanism for storage of liquid hydrogen. It is also concluded that superconducting levitation can not be used as a suspension mechanism for the concept presented in this study, unless the methods suggested to increase the levitation forces between the neodymium magnet and superconductor are executed.

We have investigated the effects of electron irradiation on kerogens of type I and III in a 200 kV transmission electron microscope (TEM), at 293 K and 92 K, using various fluences. Using synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and NanoSIMS, we have demonstrated a progressive amorphization coupled with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loss</b> and a significant deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/H) fractionation, with dD increasing by up to 1000 ‰. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>loss</b> is non-linearly related to the fluence. Irradiation under cryogenic conditions (92 K) hinders amorphization and D/H elevation. We suggest that these effects are controlled by radiolysis (carbonAhydrogen bonds are broken and hydrogen is lost), coupled with recombination. The amorphization and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loss</b> are rate-limited by defect diffusion which controls the recombination probability. The D/H increase appears to follow a Rayleigh distillation law with an apparent fractionation factor similar to the equilibrium fractionation factor of the isotopic exchange reaction CH 4 + HDMCH 3 - D + H 2. This study represents a first step to estimate the kinetics and timescales of D/H fractionation under ionizing radiation. Extrapolatation of this fractionation behavior to natural environments remains difficult at this point because simultaneous irradiation by protons and other cosmic rays at various energies also occurs.
