5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas {{as he did with}} his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E

5|$|Burke {{experimented with}} a variety of musical styles {{throughout}} the game's development. Burke's original compositions were lighthearted as befitting for a Nintendo game, but became darker along with other parts of the game to match the Xbox audience when Microsoft acquired Rare. The composer thought that this transition was reflected in the soundtrack, with some Nintendo-style music juxtaposed against the roaring orchestral tracks. Burke estimates that he had written four hours of audio for the project and ultimately recorded 80 minutes with an orchestra and choir over <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Prague. The team recorded the orchestra and choir separately. Sumthing Else Music Works published the soundtrack on compact disc and for download via the iTunes Store and Amazon. It was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition award.|$|E
5|$|By 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During {{a weekend}} in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's {{keyboard}} player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP. Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track Brothers and Sisters EP, which they had quickly recorded over <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the Hole in 2004 but {{says that he}} left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|The {{fire started}} on August 17, 2013 at 3:25pm in the Stanislaus National Forest, east of Groveland, when a hunter {{lost control of}} an illegal campfire. The hunter was not {{identified}} publicly until a year later, when two felony, and two misdemeanor charges were filed against Keith Matthew Emerald of Columbia, California. The fire had only burned 40 acres when it was discovered, but it grew to 10,000 acres within 36 hours and 100,000 acres after just <b>four</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> two days, in mid-August, the fire burned nearly 90,000 acres. The fire's rapid spread was attributed to drought and extreme weather conditions. It burned into backcountry areas of Yosemite National Park. The park remained open, and though Yosemite Valley was never in danger, the fire did burn 78,895 acres of parkland. Heavy smoke was, at times, a factor.|$|E

Previously emergency vehicles (ambulances) were not charged a toll, however beginning July 3, 2003, they must pay the standard $1toll. To allow quick passage through the toll barrier, these vehicles pay through a charge account.

5|$|Adi Da's {{father told}} Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E
