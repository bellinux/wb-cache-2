50|$|Degradation is {{a process}} that takes place in many materials. The speed depends on the environment.Conventional {{polyethylene}} (PE) and polypropylene (PP) plastics will typically take decades to degrade.

25|$|Aspartame {{is rapidly}} hydrolyzed {{in the small}} intestines. Even with {{ingestion}} of very high doses of aspartame (over 200mg/kg), no aspartame {{is found in the}} blood due to the rapid breakdown. Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into residual components, including aspartic acid, phenylalanine, methanol, in ratio of 4:5:1 by mass and <b>further</b> <b>breakdown</b> products including formaldehyde and formic acid. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartame. In some fruit juices, higher concentrations of methanol can be found than the amount produced from aspartame in beverages.|$|R

Since there were no larger differences of the values, the mesial and distal CBD were averaged and this was used for further assessment.

Values exceeding these numbers were marked as outliers.|$|R
