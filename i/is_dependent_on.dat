5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet been studied, however.|$|E

50|$|GFO distinguishes {{processes}} and objects. Processes unfold in time, they have temporal parts. Objects (called presentials) have no temporal parts, and may only exist <b>on</b> time-boundaries. Presentials <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> processes. This {{can be seen}} as a derivation of the dependency-relations in the formalization of time: processes are always framed by a chronoid; and as time-boundaries <b>are</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> chronoids, so <b>are</b> presentials <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> processes.|$|R
40|$|Upward {{combustion}} of 316 {{stainless steel}} (SS) rods is discussed and a combustion model is presented. The effects of varying oxygen pressure and rod diameter on the rate limiting processes for combustion of 316 SS are evaluated. The rate-limiting steps for combustion up 316 SS rods are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the incorporation and mass transport of {{oxygen in the}} molten mass, and heat transfer between the molten mass and rod. Both these rate-limiting steps are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> rod diameter. Small (d/r/ = 0. 051 cm) 316 SS rods are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> convective heat transfer, and larger rods (d/r/ not less than 0. 32 cm) are shown to <b>be</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> oxygen incorporation and mass transport in the molten mass...|$|R

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have referred to a narrower timeframe.|$|E

He finds only one character, the Columbia University-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of ellipses, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary silat (traditional martial arts) stories.|$|E
5|$|In normal untransformed cells, EFS {{acts as a}} SRC family kinase {{substrate}} in neurite outgrowth, {{a process}} that <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> activity of SRC kinases. Reciprocally, EFS activates SRC signaling through c-CRK and RAP1. Further, SRC directly phosphorylates residues Y576 and Y577 tyrosine sites on the EFS, enhancing targeting FAK, and eventually the solubility and/or stability of the complex. Through SRC, EFS may also negatively regulate expression of E-cadherin at adherens junctions, a function that has been reported for other CAS proteins (NEDD9 and BCAR1); however, this point has not been directly established for EFS.|$|E
5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity <b>is</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E
