40|$|The present paper {{outlines}} {{an experimental}} study {{to obtain an}} optimal setting of turning process parameters (cutting speed, <b>feed</b> rate <b>and</b> depth of cut) resulting in an optimal values of the <b>feed</b> force <b>and</b> radial force when machining EN 31 B steel with TiC-coated tungsten carbide inserts. The effects of cutting parameters on the <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> radial force were experimentally investigated. Experimentation was conducted as per Taguchi's orthogonal array. Three cutting parameters with three levels are arranged in L 9 orthogonal array. The orthogonal array, measured values of <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> radial force, signal-to-noise ratios, and analysis of variance are employed in order to study the <b>feed</b> force <b>and</b> radial force. The analysis of the results shows that the optimal settings for low values of <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> radial forces are high cutting speed, low <b>feed</b> rate <b>and</b> depth of cut...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> water {{deprivation}} on gastrointestinal tract and intestinal mucosa development of chicks at 24, 48, and 72 h posthatching. The treatments were water <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> ad libitum, water ad libitum <b>and</b> no <b>feed,</b> no water but <b>feed</b> ad libitum, <b>and</b> no water <b>and</b> no <b>feed.</b> The relative weight of the yolk sac was not influenced by the treatments. However, at 48 and 72 h posthatching, the relative weight of the liver increased, and the gizzard + proventriculus weight decreased in birds receiving feed ad libitum. An increase in jejunum and ileum relative weights and lengths was observed when the birds were supplied with <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> water. The lack of water produced the same effect as the lack of feed, both causing a higher number of villi per area with reduction in villus size, when compared with <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> water ad libitum treatments. The {{results of this study}} revealed that <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> water are able to affect intestinal villus development after hatching, indicating that both <b>feed</b> <b>and</b> water must be supplied to the chicks immediately after hatching...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Salmonella in southern Africa in farm <b>feeds</b> <b>and</b> by-products {{of animal origin}} during 1982 - 1988 was determined.

5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter <b>feeding,</b> <b>and</b> during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
