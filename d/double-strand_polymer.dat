Ladder-making and -breaking are highly cooperative, with Hill coefficients of 3. 0 and 3. 7, respectively. Self-assembly of the ladder holds the pi-system in a planar conformation, enhancing the conjugation, resulting in a red-shift and intensification of the Q-band.

Here we use a self-consistent quantum molecular dynamics method to study the effect of an applied electric field along the molecular axis on {{charge transfer}} through single-stranded and <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>polymer</b> molecules with an injected electron or hole and assess the consequences for electronic applications. Charge transfer through both single-stranded and <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>polymer</b> molecules is predicted, regardless of the sign of the injected charge, the molecular structure and the base sequence. The amount of charge transfer through a <b>double-stranded</b> DNA <b>polymer</b> molecule is slightly lower than through the corresponding two isolated single-strands as a result of the lower charge transport through the purine-pyrimidine base-stacking as compared with through DNA nucleobase-stacking.

Properties of spherical harmonics are then exploited in truncating and numerically solving the resulting transfer matrix. This allows efficient computation of phase diagrams and force-extension curves (isotherms). While the main focus is on exposition of the transfer matrix technique, we provide general arguments for a reentrant melting transition in stiff double strands.

40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} that supramolecular polymers self-assemble following {{small changes in}} the environment. The degree of responsiveness depends {{on the degree of}} cooperativity at play during the assembly. Undertanding how to modulate and quantify cooperativity is therefore highly desirable for the study and design of responsive polymers. Here we show that the cooperative assembly of a porphyrin-based, <b>double-stranded</b> <b>polymer</b> is triggered by changes in building blocks and in salt concentration. We develop a model that accounts for this responsiveness by assuming the binding of the salt countercations to the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>polymer.</b> Using our assembly model we generate plots that show the increase in concentration of polymer versus the normalized concentration of monomer. These plots are ideally suited to appreciate changes in cooperativity, and show that, for our system, these changes are consistent with the increase in polymer length observed experimentally. Unexpectedly, we find that polymer stability increases when cooperativity decreases. We attribute this behaviour to the fact that increasing salt concentration stabilizes the overall polymer more than the nucleus. In other words, the cooperativity factor , defined as the ratio between the growth constant Kg and the nucleation constant Kn decreases as the overall stability of the polymer increases. Using our model to simulate the data, we generate cooperativity plots to explore changes in cooperativity for multistranded polymers. We find that, for the same pairwise association constants, the cooperativity sharply increases with the number of strands in the polymer. We attribute this dependence {{to the fact that the}} larger the number of strands, the larger is the nucleus necessary to trigger polymer growth. We show therefore that the cooperativty factor  does not properly account for the cooperativity behaviour of multistranded polymers, or any supramolecular polymer with a nucleus composed of more than 2 building blocks, and propose the use of the corrected cooperativity factor m. Finally, we show that multistranded polymers display highly cooperative polymerisation with pairwise association constants as low as 10 M- 1 between the building blocks, which should simplify the design of responsive supramolecular polymers...|$|R

The parametric {{representation of the}} kinetic dependencies of tryptophan fluorescence intensity changes recorded at two wavelengths allowed us to detect and characterize a new essentially unfolded kinetic intermediate.

It was shown that the equilibrium transition between inactivated and completely unfolded states is also a two-step process and proceeds via an essentially unfolded kinetic intermediate. The new kinetic pathway of actin unfolding-refolding was proposed. According to it, the founded essentially unfolded kinetic state is the on-pathway intermediate, while inactivated actin is the off-pathway misfolded state stabilized by aggregation of partially folded macromolecules of protein.

Comparing melting curves 1 and 3 (Figure  3), we can see that the duplex hybridized on the tube is characterized with a lower thermal stability (Тm[*]=[*] 38 °C). Also, the form of the melting curve 3 changes essentially (the curve becomes more flat), the temperature interval of the transition increases (ΔT[*]≈[*] 27 °С), and the hyperchromic coefficient lowers (h[*]≈[*] 0.37).

Here, we introduce a rigorous characterization of Shannon Information in biomolecular systems and apply it to DNA replication in the limit of no dissipation.

We use empirical stacking free energies to calculate the probabilities of incorporation of the nucleotides. The copied strand is, to first order of approximation, a state of independent and non-indentically distributed random variables for which the nucleotide that is incorporated by the polymerase at each step is dictated by the template strand, and to second order of approximation, a state of non-uniformly distributed random variables with nearest-neighbor interactions for which the recognition of secondary structure by the polymerase in the resultant <b>double-stranded</b> <b>polymer</b> determines the entropy of the replicated strand.

40|$|The {{statistical}} mechanics of a ribbon polymer {{made up of}} two semiflexible chains is studied using both analytical techniques and simulation. The system is {{found to have a}} crossover transition at some finite temperature, from a type of short range order to a fundamentally different sort of short range order. In the high temperature regime, the 2 -point correlation functions of the object are identical to worm-like chains, while in the low temperature regime they are different due to a twist structure. The crossover happens when the persistence length of individual strands becomes comparable to the thickness of the ribbon. In the low temperature regime, the ribbon is observed to have a novel "kink-rod" structure with a mutual exclusion of twist and bend in contrast to smooth worm-like chain behaviour. This is due to its anisotropic rigidity and corresponds to an infinitely strong twist-bend coupling. The <b>double-stranded</b> <b>polymer</b> is also studied in a confined geometry. It is shown that when the polymer is restricted in a particular direction to a size less than the bare persistence length of the individual strands, it develops zigzag conformations which are indicated by an oscillatory tangent-tangent correlation function in the direction of confinement. Increasing the separation of the confining plates leads to a crossover to the free behaviour, which takes place at separations close to the bare persistence length.

One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} facing the analysis of high-throughput microarray measurements is how to extract in a systematic and rigorous way the biologically relevant components from the experiments {{in order to establish}} meaningful connections linking genetic information to cellular function. Because of the significant amount of experimental information that is generated (expression levels of thousands of genes), computer-assisted knowledge extraction is the only realistic alternative for managing such an information deluge. Mathematical programming offers an interesting alternative for the development of systematic methodologies aiming towards such an analysis. We summarize recent developments related to critical problems in the analysis of microarray data, namely: tissue clustering and classification, informative gene selection and reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks. We demonstrate how advances in non linear and mixed-integer optimization provide the foundations for the rational identification of critical features unraveling fundamental elements of the underlying biology thus enabling the interpretation of volumes of biological data.

The expression of the genetic information, which is stored in DNA, takes places in two stages: transcription, during which DNA is transcribed into mRNA, a single stranded complimentary copy of the base sequence of the DNA, and translation, during which mRNA provides the blue-print for the production of specific proteins.

A ‘structure–function' picture emerges in which extension of genes induced by moderate packing exposes coding sequences and improves their interaction with the transcription/translation machinery. However, tighter packing impairs the penetration of the machinery into the brush.

40|$|All-or-nothing {{molecular}} assembly events, {{essential for}} the efficient regulation of living systems at the molecular level, are emerging properties of complex chemical systems that are largely attributed to the cooperativity of weak interactions. The link between the self-assembly and the interactions responsible for the assembly is however often poorly defined. In this work we demonstrate how the chelate effect (multivalence cooperativity) can {{play a central role}} in the regulation of the all-or-nothing assembly of structures (supramolecular polymers here), even if the building blocks are not multivalent. We have studied the formation of <b>double-stranded</b> supramolecular <b>polymers</b> formed from Co-metalloporphyrin and bi-pyridine building blocks. Their cooperative nucleation–elongation assembly can be summarized as a thermodynamic cycle, where the monomer weakly oligomerizes linearly or weakly dimerizes laterally. But thanks to the chelate effect, the lateral dimer readily oligomerizes linearly and the oligomer readily dimerizes laterally, leading to long double stranded polymers. A model based on this simple thermodynamic cycle can be applied to the assembly of polymers with any number of strands, and allows for the determination of the length of the polymer and the all-or-nothing switching concentration from the pairwise binding constants. The model, which is consistent with the behaviour of supramolecular polymers such as microtubules and gelators, clearly shows that all-or-nothing assembly is triggered by a change in the mode of assembly, from non-multivalent to multivalent, when a critical concentration is reached. We believe this model is applicable to many molecular assembly processes, ranging from the formation of cell–cell focal adhesion points to crystallization...|$|R
40|$|The title compound, C 12 H 11 N 3 O 2, a hemiamidal, was {{synthesized}} by solvent-free {{aldol condensation}} {{at room temperature}} by grinding picolinamide with isonicotinaldehyde in a 1 : 1 molar ratio. In the mol­ecule, the two pyridine rings are inclined to one another by 58. 75  (6) °. They are linked, at positions 2 and 4, by the hemiamidal bridge (–CO—NH—CHOH–). The NH-group H atom forms an intra­molecular hydrogen bond with the N atom of the picolinamide pyridine ring. In the crystal, symmetry-related mol­ecules are linked via N—H⋯O hydrogen bonds, involving the NH group H atom of the hemiamidal bridge and the hy­droxy O atom, forming inversion-related dimers, with graph-set R 2 2 (8). Adjacent mol­ecules are also linked via O—H⋯N hydrogen bonds, involving the hy­droxy substituent and the 4 -pyridine N atom. Together these inter­actions lead {{to the formation of}} <b>double-stranded</b> ribbon-like hydrogen-bonded <b>polymers</b> propagating in [010]. The latter are further connected via C—H⋯O hydrogen bonds involving the carbonyl O atom, so forming a two-dimensional network in (011) ...|$|R
