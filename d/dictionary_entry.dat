His works have received criticism, in his lifetime and since, as being oversimplistic: [...] a view expressed notably by the 20th-century Polish novelist and dramatist Witold Gombrowicz, who described Sienkiewicz as a [...] "first-rate second-rate writer". Nonetheless, the Polish historian of literature Henryk Markiewicz, writing the Polski słownik biograficzny (Polish Biographical <b>Dictionary)</b> <b>entry</b> on Sienkiewicz (1997), describes him as a master of Polish prose, as the foremost Polish writer of historical fiction, and as Poland's internationally best-known writer.|$|E

She notes that Chodkiewicz possessed an iron will, which he was able to impose on the troops under his command, and that he was an efficient commander, although more respected and feared than beloved by his troops. Dobrowolska notes that he was an energetic and explosive antithesis of the composed Żółkiewski, another great hetman of this era, whom Chodkiewicz disliked and competed with throughout his life.|$|E

[...] Brooks' Master Sandy's Snapdragon suggests another mythical origin, relating the fire of snap-dragons to Saint George and the dragon. Chambers suggests that it hearkens back to druidic fire-worship. According to the Oxford English <b>Dictionary</b> <b>entry</b> for flapdragon, [...] "the original sense [...] may have been identical with a dialectal sense of snapdragon, viz. a figure of a dragon's head with snapping jaws, carried about by the mummers at Christmas; but of this there is no trace in our quots".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the term}} Ceaușism became widely used inside Romania, usually as a pejorative, it never {{achieved}} status in academia.

A Romanian Encyclopedic <b>Dictionary</b> <b>entry</b> in 1978 underlines the concept as [...] "a new, superior, stage in the Socialist development of Romania [...] begun by the 1971–1975 Five-Year Plan, prolonged over several [...] Five-Year Plans".|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{consider}} the character 信 xìn, meaning [...] "truth", [...] "faith", [...] "sincerity", and [...] "trust". [...] Its radical is 亻 rén [...] "human" [...] (a compressed form of 人) {{and there are}} seven additional strokes in the remaining portion (言 yán, [...] "speech"). [...] To look up this character in a dictionary, one finds the radical for [...] "human" [...] {{in the part of}} dictionary that indexes radicals. The various radicals will be organized by the number of strokes they themselves contain. 人 and its compressed version 亻 contain only two strokes, so it will be near the beginning of the list. Locating it, one can see the page for the index on that radical, and one then normally passes through the lists of characters with one additional stroke, two additional strokes, etc. until one reaches the entries with seven additional strokes. If the chosen radical matches the radical used by the dictionary compiler (which can be difficult to guarantee for more complicated characters), and if both the user and the dictionary compiler count strokes the same way (also often a problem with characters that the user is unfamiliar with), the entry will be in that list, and will appear next to an entry number or a page number where the full <b>dictionary</b> <b>entry</b> for that character can be found.|$|E
