5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or <b>deflagration</b> in the 4-inch magazines. The same <b>deflagration</b> would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland.

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic <b>deflagration.</b>|$|E
5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises {{the temperature of the}} core, and as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a <b>deflagration</b> flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins. Oxygen fusion is initiated shortly thereafter, but this fuel is not consumed as completely as carbon.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report some {{specific}} {{features of the}} numerical technique used to study the dynamic evolution of massive white dwarfs following the explosive ignition of nuclear fuel under degenerate conditions. We focus on three important points: (1) how to construct a stable initial model for white dwarfs with a central density ρc > 109 g cm- 3 {{in the context of}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH); (2) the procedure devised in the numerical handling of combustion fronts and thermal discontinuities; and (3) a proposed method based on techniques of analysis of dynamic sets of points to characterize the flame front structure. As we will show, the combination of these methods along with the standard SPH technique makes the study of <b>deflagrations</b> in massive white dwarfs feasible even in three dimensions. After explaining in detail the numerical scheme, we show the results of several calculations, in three dimensions, addressed to checking the ability of the hydrocode to handle <b>deflagrations</b> in massive white dwarfs in two density regimes. First, several tests were carried out under the physical conditions that characterize Chandrasekhar-mass models for Type Ia supernovae, and some of the results were compared with standard one-dimensional calculations. We also explored the consequences of <b>deflagrations</b> at very high densities, where electron captures play a fundamental role in the further evolution of the white dwarf, and where collapse to a neutron star instead of an explosion is expected. Our calculations support the idea that the SPH method and various fractal analysis techniques can successfully be used to model the gross features of <b>deflagrations</b> in white dwarfs provided that the nuclear energy injected at the first stages of the explosion is sufficient to dominate the numerical noise. An extensive number of calculations for both Type Ia supernovae explosions and accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf to a neutron star are in progress and will be reported in future publications.

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{is devoted}} {{to the study of the}} {{combustion}} processes of a homogeneous methane-air mixture subject to thermal stratifications within a Rapid Compression Machine (RCM). Temperature fields obtained in non-reactive conditions have been documented in a previous study and the present work aims at correlating these data with the combustion process. The analysis of chemiluminescence images enables the delineation of two propagation regimes, namely spontaneous ignition fronts and <b>deflagrations.</b> The first one is observed for short ignition delays as the fluid features a fairly large and homogeneous hot core zone. The second one dominates the combustion process for longer ignition delays. Indeed, despite a global homogenization of the temperature fields, the hottest zones are fairly narrow and surrounded by non negligible thermal gradients, which favors the formation of <b>deflagrations.</b> The results thus clearly show a strong correlation between the pre-ignition temperature field and the subsequent combustion process. They are commented in the light of recent literature. In a second part, quantitative predictions of the occurrence of autoignition fronts and <b>deflagrations</b> are performed by employing a criterion issued from the analysis of direct numerical simulation data (Sankaran et al., 2005). The results are in good agreement with others previously obtained through chemiluminescence imaging for early and intermediate stages of combustion. It is more difficult to conclude for later instants. The present work highlights the relevance but also suggests some limitations of the corresponding criterion for the analysis of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion processes at the cylinder scale. Furthermore, the quantitative data gathered within the RCM demonstrates the relevance of this device for further investigations of these fundamental issues...|$|R
