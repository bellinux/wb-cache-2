Consequently, supply chains that distribute to and source from the BOP suffer from hindrances in information exchange between supply chain partners and are particularly vulnerable to <b>information</b> <b>separation.</b> The paper examines how service organizations operating at the BOP use ICT to reduce <b>information</b> <b>separation</b> in their supply chains. Noting the importance of and problems plaguing the delivery of healthcare services at the BOP, we use the healthcare services supply chain as the context for our study. We first draw from the literature on BOP supply chains and healthcare supply chains, to identify key <b>information</b> <b>separation</b> problems. We then develop, from secondary and published sources, a detailed case study on the BOP initiatives {{of one of the}} largest healthcare organizations in India. We analyze this case to reveal (1) particular ICT applied to healthcare supply chains at the BOP, (2) how these ICT reduce <b>information</b> <b>separation</b> in healthcare supply chains, and (3) developmental outcomes of <b>information</b> <b>separation</b> reduction. The study contributes to the emergent literature that addresses developmental impacts of ICT at the BOP. It provides, for practice and policy, key issues that private and public service providers must consider in order to build effective supply chain processes and delivery mechanisms at the BOP...|$|R

This concept is applied to the whole source sequences as stationary processes and thus provides a universal contrast applicable to both the instantaneous and convolutive mixture cases. For practical implementation, we introduce several degraded forms of this contrast, computable from a finite-dimensional distribution of the reconstructed source processes only. From them, we derive several sets of estimating equations, generalizing those considered earlier.

Second, the measurements are limited to samplings of given data types so that properties of the data types are common to any sampling. Thus, the unknowns to be estimated can be reduced to those observable to the data types. Finally, estimation is intended to compare an unknown system to internationally defined physical units. Measurements separate into comparisons with physical units (calibrations) and comparisons among unknowns. Generally, measurements are of the second type and their processing compares the unknown system to intermediate physical standards which appear as unobservable parameters that limit the achievable estimation accuracy.

The EEG carries brain activity in form of neurophysiological components which are usually embedded in much higher in power electrical muscle activity components (EMG, EOG, etc.). A novel multichannel EEG analysis approach is proposed in order to discover representative components related to muscular activity which are not related to ongoing brain activity but carry common patterns resulting from non-brain related sources. The proposed adaptive decomposition approach is also able to separate signals occupying same frequency bands what is usually not possible with contemporary methods. ...|$|R
