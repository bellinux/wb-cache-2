40|$|The inframammary {{incision}} is {{the most}} versatile and popular approach in breast augmentation. For an optimal aesthetic result, the incision site should be chosen {{in such a way}} that the scar is carefully hidden in the (new) inframammary fold. Based on an assumption of the senior author (B. <b>v.</b> <b>d.</b> <b>L.)</b> that the Pythagorean theorem (alpha(2) + beta(2) = gamma(2)) is suited to describe the ratios of implant and incision location variables, the authors developed an almost perfect road-map for accurate determination of the right incision location in augmentation mammaplasty with round implants through the inframammary incision. The authors plenary judged the photographs of 263 augmented breasts whether the scar of the augmentation mammaplasty was located in the neo-inframammary fold. In all cases, the Pythagorean theorem was used to determine the exact location of the site of incision. In only four of the 263 augmented breasts (1. 5 percent), the position of the scar was a little below the neo-inframammary fold and thereby visible with the patient in the upright position. A scar correction to reposition the scar into the inframammary fold was performed in one patient on one breast by means of additional skin excision above the scar; in the two other cases, the scar was accepted by the patients as being not too bothersome. The Pythagorean theorem is an effective method for determining the right incision site in augmentation mammaplasty with round implants through an inframammary approach...|$|R
40|$|PMCID: PMC 3720686. [...] et al. Macrophages are {{professional}} phagocytic {{cells that}} orchestrate innate immune responses and have considerable phenotypic diversity at different anatomical locations. However, the mechanisms {{that control the}} heterogeneity of tissue macrophages are not well characterized. Here {{we found that the}} nuclear receptor LXRα was essential for the differentiation of macrophages in the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen. LXR-deficient mice were defective in the generation of MZ and metallophilic macrophages, which resulted in abnormal responses to blood-borne antigens. Myeloid-specific expression of LXRα or adoptive transfer of wild-type monocytes restored the MZ microenvironment in LXRα-deficient mice. Our results demonstrate that signaling via LXRα in myeloid cells is crucial for the generation of splenic MZ macrophages and identify an unprecedented role for a nuclear receptor in the generation of specialized macrophage subsets.

Despite recent progress in spin-current research, the detection of spin current has mostly remained indirect. By synchronizing a microwave waveform with synchrotron x-ray pulses, we use the ferromagnetic resonance of the Py (Ni_ 81 Fe_ 19) layer in a Py/Cu/Cu_ 75 Mn_ 25 /Cu/Co multilayer to pump a pure ac spin current into the Cu_ 75 Mn_ 25 and Co layers, and then directly probe the spin current within the Cu_ 75 Mn_ 25 layer and the spin dynamics of the Co layer by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. This element-resolved pump-probe measurement unambiguously identifies the ac spin current in the Cu_ 75 Mn_ 25 layer. We acknowledge helpful discussion with Arne Brataas.

40|$|As {{synthetic}} biology {{moves away from}} trial and error and embraces more formal processes, workflows have emerged that cover the roadmap from conceptualization of a genetic device to its construction and measurement. This latter aspect (i. e., characterization and measurement of synthetic genetic constructs) has received relatively little attention to date, but it is crucial for their outcome. An end-to-end use case for engineering a simple synthetic device is presented, which is supported by information standards and computational methods and focuses on such characterization/measurement. This workflow captures the main stages of genetic device design and description and offers standardized tools for both population-based measurement and single-cell analysis. To this end, three separate aspects are addressed. First, the specific vector features are discussed. Although device/circuit design has been successfully automated, important structural information is usually overlooked, {{as in the case}} of plasmid vectors. The use of the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA) is advocated for selecting the optimal carrier of a design and its thorough description in order to unequivocally correlate digital definitions and molecular devices. A digital version of this plasmid format was developed with the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) along with a software tool that allows users to embed genetic parts in vector cargoes. This enables annotation of a mathematical model of the device's kinetic reactions formatted with the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). From that point onward, the experimental results and their in silico counterparts proceed alongside, with constant feedback to preserve consistency between them. A second aspect involves a framework for the calibration of fluorescence-based measurements. One of the most challenging endeavors in standardization, metrology, is tackled by reinterpreting the experimental output in light of simulation results, allowing us to turn arbitrary fluorescence units into relative measurements. Finally, integration of single-cell methods into a framework for multicellular simulation and measurement is addressed, allowing standardized inspection of the interplay between the carrier chassis and the culture conditions.

40|$|Small {{pollutant}} concentration gradients between levels above a plant canopy result in large uncertainties in estimated air–surface exchange fluxes when using existing micrometeorological gradient methods, including the aerodynamic gradient method (AGM) and the modified Bowen ratio method (MBR). A modified micrometeorological gradient method (MGM) is proposed {{in this study}} for estimating O 3 dry deposition fluxes over a forest canopy using concentration gradients between a level above and a level below the canopy top, taking advantage of relatively large gradients between these levels due to significant pollutant uptake in the top layers of the canopy. The new method is compared with the AGM and MBR methods and is also evaluated using eddy-covariance (EC) flux measurements collected at the Harvard Forest Environmental Measurement Site, Massachusetts, during 1993 – 2000. All three gradient methods (AGM, MBR, and MGM) produced similar diurnal cycles of O 3 <b>dry</b> deposition velocity (<b>V</b> <b>d</b> (O 3)) to the EC measurements, with the MGM method being the closest in magnitude to the EC measurements. The multi-year average <b>V</b> <b>d</b> (O 3) differed significantly between these methods, with the AGM, MBR, and MGM method being 2. 28, 1. 45, and 1. 18 {{times that of the}} EC, respectively.

40|$|Human {{liver cancer}} {{research}} currently lacks in vitro models that can faithfully recapitulate the pathophysiology {{of the original}} tumor. We recently described a novel, near-physiological organoid culture system, wherein primary human healthy liver cells form long-term expanding organoids that retain liver tissue function and genetic stability. Here we extend this culture system to the propagation of primary liver cancer (PLC) organoids from {{three of the most}} common PLC subtypes: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and combined HCC/CC (CHC) tumors. PLC-derived organoid cultures preserve the histological architecture, gene expression and genomic landscape of the original tumor, allowing for discrimination between different tumor tissues and subtypes, even after long-term expansion in culture in the same medium conditions. Xenograft studies demonstrate that the tumorogenic potential, histological features and metastatic properties of PLC-derived organoids are preserved in vivo. PLC-derived organoids are amenable for biomarker identification and drug-screening testing and led to the identification of the ERK inhibitor SCH 772984 as a potential therapeutic agent for primary liver cancer. We thus demonstrate the wide-ranging biomedical utilities of PLC-derived organoid models in furthering the understanding of liver cancer biology and in developing personalized-medicine approaches for the disease.

Apart from an early negative shift of - 11 mV in the voltage dependence of tension in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> muscles during the first week, the other changes in K contractures following denervation occurred progressively during the first 3 weeks and then stabilized. There was a clear difference in charge movement in denervated e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibres but little change in denervated soleus fibres, so that the characteristics of charge movement in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> and soleus became very similar. The maximum amount of charge movement fell from an average normal value of 23 nC/microF to 6 nC/microF in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> within the first 2 weeks. The voltage sensitivity shifted to more negative potentials (by about - 12 mV on average) within the first week. There was no significant change in the slope of the relationship between charge and membrane potential. The effects of denervation on charge movement could only partly explain the changes in K contractures. The only obvious parallels were the early negative shift in the voltage dependence of charge movement and tension in denervated e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibres. The other changes in K contractures in denervated fibres could be due to a change in the relationship between charge movement and Ca concentration in the myoplasm or an increase in the Ca affinity of the myofilaments. Although charge movement fell to about a quarter of normal in denervated e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibres, membrane capacity increased approximately 3 -fold.

The self-reinnervated soleus fired phasically and synchronously with l. g. during walking but the {{activity was}} not trimmed {{to the extent that}} is seen in normal soleus.

The rate of spontaneous relaxation was faster in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibers: the time for 120 mM K contractures to decay to 50 % of maximum tension was 9. 8 +/- 0. 5 s (mean +/- SEM) in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> and 16. 8 +/- 1. 7 s in soleus. The rate of decay depended on membrane potential: in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.,</b> the 50 % decay time was 14. 3 +/- 0. 7 s for contractures in 80 mM K (Vm = 25 mV) and 4. 9 +/- 0. 4 s in 160 mM K (Vm = - 3 mV). In contrast to activation, which occurred with less depolarization in soleus fibers, steady state inactivation required more depolarization: after 3 min at - 40 mV in 40 mM K, the 200 mM K contracture amplitude in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fell to 28 +/- 10 % (n = 5) of control, but remained at 85 +/- 2 % (n = 6) of control in soleus. These different inactivation properties in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> and soleus fibers were not influenced {{by the fact that}} the 200 mM K solution used to test for steady state inactivation produced contractures that were maximal in soleus fibers but submaximal in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> : a relatively similar depression was recorded in maximal (200 mM K) and submaximal (60 and 80 mM K) contracture tension. A steady state "pedestal" of tension was observed with maintained depolarization after K contracture relaxation and was larger in soleus than in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibers. The pedestal tension was attributed to the overlap between the activation and inactivation curves for tension vs. membrane potential, which was greater in soleus than in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibers. The K contracture results were confirmed with the two- microelectrode voltage clamp: the contraction threshold increased to more positive potentials at holding potentials of - 50 mV in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> or - 40 mV in soleus. At holding potentials of - 30 mV in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> or 0 mV in soleus, contraction could not be evoked by 15 -ms pulses to + 20 mV. Both K contracture and voltage-clamp experiments revealed that activation in soleus fibers occurred with a smaller transient depolarization and was maintained with greater steady state depolarization than in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> fibers. The K contracture and voltage-clamp results are described by a model in which contraction depends on the formation of a threshold concentration of activator from a voltage-sensitive molecule that can exist in the precursor, activator, or inactive states...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} Monge problem in metric spaces with a {{geodesic}} distance: (X, d) is a Polish space and <b>d</b> (<b>L)</b> is a geodesic Borel distance which makes (X, <b>d</b> (<b>L))</b> a non branching geodesic space. We show {{that under the}} assumption that geodesics are d-continuous and locally compact, we can reduce the transport problem to 1 -dimensional transport problems along geodesics. We introduce two assumptions on the transport problem pi which imply that the conditional probabilities of the first marginal on each geodesic are continuous or absolutely continuous w. r. t. the 1 -dimensional Hausdorff distance induced by <b>d</b> (<b>L).</b> It is known that this regularity is sufficient {{for the construction of a}} transport map. We study also the dynamics of transport along the geodesic, the stability of our conditions and show that in this setting <b>d</b> (<b>L)</b> -cyclical monotonicity is not sufficient for optimality...|$|R
40|$|Single neurones were {{recorded}} in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (<b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n.) of adult cats anaesthetized {{with a mixture of}} halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. The multibarrel-glass micro-electrodes were filled with sodium acetate, L-glutamate, acetylcholine (ACh), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and bicuculline. In normally innervated, spontaneously active <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. cells, ACh and L-glutamate elicited increased firing rates. After elimination of the excitatory input from the retina by retinal photocoagulation, the effects of ACh and L-glutamate were similar. This proves that both drugs have direct excitatory effects on <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. cells and that disinhibition is not the most prominent influence of ACh in the <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. The excitatory action of ACh on relay cells in the <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. was strongly influenced by barbiturates. Sub-narcotic levels of sodium pentobarbitone completely abolished the excitation by ACh while the response to L-glutamate remained unchanged. Excitation, centre-surround antagonism and periphery effects were elicited by spots of light and by large field phase-reversing gratings with and without central sparing of the receptive field area. Binocular inhibition was elicited with the phase-reversing grating presented to the non-dominant eye. After localized destruction of the retinal receptive field area, retinogeniculate excitation ceased and an isolated lateral inhibition was observed in the acutely deafferented <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. cells. The time course and strength of this inhibition was disclosed by raising the background discharge with microiontophoretically applied L-glutamate. With increasing size of retinal lesions the strength of isolated lateral inhibition decreased exponentially. A maximal intrageniculate range of more than 1000 microns was derived from computations of the lateral extent of deafferentation in the <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. The inhibition acted beyond the classic surround inhibition of <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. cells and thus was named long-range lateral inhibition. Microiontophoretically applied GABA elicits a strong inhibitory effect at the <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> g. n. cells which is antagonized by bicuculline. Centre-surround antagonism, binocular inhibition and long-range inhibition were blocked by bicuculline and thus proven to be GABAergic. Each class of inhibition was differentially influenced by microiontophoretically applied ACh. Long-range inhibition was disinhibited, centre-surround antagonism was enhanced, and binocular inhibition was not significantly changed. In contrast to ACh excitation, the disinhibitory action of ACh was not suppressed by pentobarbitone. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|The {{force of}} contractures {{produced}} by 14 - 400 mM-K+ (as methanesulphonate) {{was measured in}} whole mouse soleus (sol.), extensor digitorum longus (e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.),</b> and in bundles from these muscles. Frog semitendinosus muscles were used for comparison. Whole mouse muscles displayed biphasic contracture responses lasting more than 5 min when provoked by 150 m M-K+. Contractures of bundles dissected from these muscles were monophasic and had a short duration. The time required for the muscle bundles to contract and relax to 1 / 2 maximum force (T) was an inverse function of [K+]. T was increased by lowering [K+] from 400 to 50 mM {{by a factor of}} 8. 3 and 7. 0 in proximal and distal portions of sol. and by a factor of 4. 2 and 2. 8 in proximal and distal portions of e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.,</b> respectively. The force-[K+] relation was steeper for sol. than for e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.,</b> and the proximal portions were more sensitive to K+ than the distal portions, particularly in e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> The capability of the muscles to produce force in response to 400 mM-K+ after a 10 min exposure to 30 or 50 mM-K+ was high in sol., somewhat lower in proximal parts of e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> and in frog semitendinosus, and lowest in distal parts of e. <b>d.</b> <b>l.</b> It was concluded that K contractures of mouse muscles are basically monophasic, and that biphasic contractures of whole muscles arise because of K+-diffusion delays, slow responses to intermediate [K+], and differences in responsiveness of the fibres contained in a particular muscle...|$|R
