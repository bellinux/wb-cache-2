25|$|Because {{the land}} is flat and the stand is so high, {{there is a very}} tall rear arcade {{promenade}} (traffic-able to vehicles and pedestrians) running the length of the stand beneath the upper seats and a huge sub-floor beneath the remainder of the stand. The brickwork in this section of the building is in red <b>face</b> <b>brick,</b> with decorative dark-glazed bricks to the arches along the arcade and supporting the upper seating tiers.|$|E
25|$|Located in {{the western}} corner of the site {{adjacent}} to Bowen Park the building is a single-storey structure comprising two smaller elements separated by an access gate. The walls of the buildings are <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> and each has a hipped roof clad with metal custom orb sheeting. Recent additions to these structures appear to include the cement rendering of the brickwork to the Bowen Bridge Street facade and the installation of metal roller doors to the ticket issuing areas.|$|E
25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured <b>face</b> <b>brick,</b> screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel tapering I-beams bolted together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- back facing each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|E

25|$|To {{the north}} of the ticket hall is an office and service room for the station manager. Parts of the timber framing to the ticket windows are visible on its {{south-eastern}} wall. The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is <b>face</b> <b>brick,</b> while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet cubicles and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E
2500|$|The Dairy Industry Hall is a long, narrow, two-storey {{building}} constructed {{along the}} southwest {{side of the}} John Reid Pavilion. The facade to Gregory Terrace is of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> with the words [...] "Dairy Industry Hall" [...] in steel lettering. The most noticeable features of the building include the zigzag roof structure and glazed south wall. The building consists of three solid walls with the remaining long side-wall completely glazed to allow southern light to flood the internal spaces. This glazed wall is protected by the roof extending to form an arcade along the side. The structural system of the building is expressed, with the concrete structural beams and columns painted externally and in-filled with panels of <b>face</b> <b>brick.</b> The steel roof beams are exposed on the upper floor ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} {{closest to}} Gregory Terrace {{is referred to}} as [...] "No.8 The Avenue." [...] Its frontage to Gregory Terrace consists of a <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> wall with rectangular casements of narrow metal louvre ventilators and a large central steel roller door providing access from the street. The gabled roof structure is visible from Gregory Terrace. The gable nearest Alexandria Street is of a different design to the two gables at the rear and possibly constitutes the earliest part of the building, the outer part being an addition. The earliest part of the building most probably dates from the late 1920s. There is evidence of this earlier smaller timber structure in the timber wall separating buildings Nos.8 and 9 that only extends across half the breadth of the current interior space. The rear of this building is clad with metal sheeting with the same casements of narrow metal louvres. The interior is a large space with numerous supporting posts and exposed roof trusses. There are entrances from the rear, the side and front and a through way in the dividing wall between this building and the adjacent Building No.9. Building No.8 is wider than the other buildings.|$|E

2500|$|The station building, {{completed}} in 1959, {{sits on the}} easternmost island platform serving tacks 1 and 2, about half way between each platform end. A long, thin rectangle in plan, oriented with the platform and tracks, the building has a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab and supported on pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams which cantilever off a deep, continuous white-painted lintel that itself rests on ten brick piers, almost {{two and a half}} metres tall. The roof and its integral beams cantilever by approximately two metres to provide shelter to the platform along each track. The edges of the roof slab are lined with fibrous cement boarding, which is not original. The ten brick piers and associated maroon-painted concrete beams occur at about three and a half metre intervals with a range of materials filling the gaps in the north-eastern and south-western facades: from orange-coloured <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> to screened openings, some small sections of render at each end, to various aluminium-framed windows and doors. On the north-western facade are two banks of aluminium-framed louvre windows with sills approximately two metres off the ground. [...] "GRACEVILLE" [...] is lettered in maroon-painted timber across the white-painted lintel above these windows. This lettering also features on two similar bulkheads on the south-western facade, {{as well as at the}} south-eastern end. This last facade has more depth with the walls stepping back from each corner leaving brick columns. In the centre is a single door to a small room facing the trains coming from the south.|$|E

Above the central opening is a concrete relief panel of the Royal Arms. Openings in the fence {{on either side of}} the porch provide access to concrete stairs which lead to smaller open porches {{on either side of the}} entrance projection. Large round headed arched openings on the face of the facade give access to these porches. On the outer side of these openings are segmental arched window openings, surrounded with <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> quoining.
