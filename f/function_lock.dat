40|$|Cell-cell {{contacts}} {{are fundamental}} to multicellular organisms and {{are subject to}} exquisite levels of control. Human RPTPmu is a type IIB receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that both forms an adhesive contact itself and is involved in regulating adhesion by dephosphorylating components of cadherin-catenin complexes. Here we describe a 3. 1 angstrom crystal structure of the RPTPmu ectodomain that forms a homophilic trans (antiparallel) dimer with an extended and rigid architecture, matching the dimensions of adherens junctions. Cell surface expression of deletion constructs induces intercellular spacings that correlate with the ectodomain length. These {{data suggest that the}} RPTPmu ectodomain acts as a distance gauge and plays a key regulatory <b>function,</b> <b>locking</b> the phosphatase to its appropriate functional location...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} damage due to fatigue of {{a typical}} lock gate on the United States waterway transportation system. <b>Functioning</b> <b>lock</b> gates are essential for this mode of transportation because they control water levels and provide access through dams for ships. Fatigue cracking is caused by cyclic loading and corrosion. Cyclic loading on a lock gate was imitated using a finite element model. This model was used to calculate stress ranges for a cycle so {{that the number of}} cycles to failure could be calculated. The proportion of cycles to cycles to failure is known as the fatigue capacity. A linear fatigue damage accumulation rule (Miner’s Rule) helped determine the fatigue critical regions within the gate. Twenty-seven sections of high stress were identified and analyzed. A section {{at the base of the}} lock gate sustained the most damage and was determined to be the most fatigue susceptible location. Further analysis and experimentation will validate these results so that retrofits become a possibility in preventing damage due to fatigue caused by cyclic loading...|$|R
50|$|Since {{most modern}} desktop {{computers}} have a full-size keyboard {{with both a}} numeric pad and separate arrow keys, Num Lock is rarely used (always on) for its original purpose, and ends up confusing the user if it has for some reason been turned off without the user being aware of this. This can be more of an issue on most laptop computers, since activating the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> typically requires use of the Fn key and if a user accidentally switches it on they may {{have no idea how}} to switch it off. If a full-size keyboard is plugged into a laptop, then the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> is normally on (as expected) for the external keyboard, and the user would not have to activate the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>function</b> to use the numeric keypad for numeric entry. Since Apple keyboards never had a combination of arrow keys and numeric keypad (but some lacked arrow keys, function keys and a numeric keypad altogether), Apple has keyboards with a separate numeric keypad but no functional Num Lock key. Instead, these keyboards include a Clear key.|$|R

50|$|Gates {{were used}} to {{separate}} one space from another in traditional Korean architecture. This function made them symbols {{of the process of}} opening and closing spaces. As an object attached to a gate, the latch became imbued with this symbolism while also serving a practical <b>function</b> as a <b>lock.</b> The latch is a wooden bar that <b>functions</b> as a <b>locking</b> device on the inside of a hinged gate of a traditional-style building. It was often decorated with auspicious animals. A turtle-shaped hinge panel was traditional and very common, as the turtle is a symbol of long life and security. The basis for this association with security is the hard shell of a turtle, which it was believed would become a strong guard shielding a family from harm. Additionally, as turtles do not lose their grip on prey they have caught, a turtle-shaped latch implies that the door has been firmly shut.|$|R
