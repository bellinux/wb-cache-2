This requires models to be applied {{so that they are}} useful to water decision makers charged with setting targets that provide adequate water flows to sustain landholders and communities. This article examines why and how the innovative {{application of}} river-system models can facilitate interactions between water science and water management in Australia’s Murray–Darling Basin (the Basin). A trajectory river-modelling method was applied to run multiple short historical climate sequences through a river-system model to provide <b>historical</b> <b>probabilities.</b> These can allow better assessment of the risks and impacts associated with stream flow and water availability. This method allows known historical variability to be presented, and produces relevant results for a 10 – 15 -year water-sharing plan lifetime. The benefits were demonstrated in the Basin’s Lachlan Catchment where modelled river-flow results demonstrated the increased variability between shorter 15 -year sequences than for a single 114 -year run. This approach highlighted the benefits of expressing modelling results as <b>historical</b> <b>probabilities</b> to inform short-term and strategic water-planning efforts...|$|R

40|$|Practitioners and {{academics}} usually calculate {{the present value}} of the costs of financial distress by multiplying the <b>historical</b> <b>probability</b> of default by the expected loss in value given default, and then by discounting this product by a government bond yield. We argue that this practice is wrong and that it underestimates the true present value of distress costs, because financial distress is more likely to happen in bad times. The adjustment for systematic distress risk implies that the risk-adjusted probability of financial distress is larger than the <b>historical</b> <b>probability.</b> Alternatively, the correct valuation of distress costs must use a discount rate that is lower than the risk free rate. We propose a formula for the valuation of distress costs, and suggest two alternative strategies to perform the risk adjustment. The first strategy uses corporate bond spreads to derive risk-adjusted probabilities of financial distress. The second strategy is to estimate the risk adjustment directly from historical data on distress probabilities, using several established asset pricing models. Both methods suggest that risk exposure increases the NPV of financial distress costs, but the magnitude of the risk-adjustment is more significant if we use the bond sprea...|$|E

40|$|Valuing {{financial}} securities often {{assumes that the}} contractual obligations of the security {{are going to be}} honored. However, frequently a party to a contract will default on its obligations. Because the contractual features of defaultable securities are usually complex {{and it is difficult to}} find comparable securities for which to observe prices, valuation requires formal models that take into account the security's complexities and the uncertainties surrounding future cash flows. Many financial institutions hold large amounts of these securities in their portfolios, and it is important that these institutions have a reliable estimate of the resulting credit exposure. Understanding the strengths and drawbacks of various modeling approaches is also important for implementing prudent risk-management policies to manage credit exposures.; The author of this article reviews developments in valuation models for defaultable securities dating back to Merton (1974), concluding that although researchers have improved considerably on the basic Merton framework, problems remain. For example, many of the institutional features of bankruptcy and defaults, such as rescheduling of debts, cannot be readily incorporated in the models discussed without making the models intractable. He points out the need for the next generation of valuation models to incorporate at least some institutional features and be able to use the <b>historical</b> <b>probabilities</b> of defaults and credit rating changes without making unnecessarily strong assumptions.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the market}} for credit baskets and single tranche bespoke CDOs keeps growing very rapidly, we witness a lively debate about the merits and {{shortcomings}} of the base correlation model, which is currently the recognized market standard. Difficulties such as the lack of arbitrage-freedom and the witnessed impossibility to calibrate in some market situations are motivations to research a different standard for mark-to-market and risk management. To contribute to this ongoing debate, we describe here a new modeling framework based on a structural, bottom-up approach. Points of interest for this model are {{that it can be}} made consistent with many data sources such as rating transition <b>probabilities,</b> <b>historical</b> default <b>probabilities,</b> single name credit spread curves and equilibrium recovery swap rates. Remarkably enough, we find that the model can be calibrated simultaneously to synchronous datasets for the iTraxx and CDX term structures for tranche spreads across the entire capital structures, including the index basis, and for maturities up to 10 years. The model makes use of an innovative mathematical framework based on spectral analysis and provides numerically noiseless spreads and hedge ratios. As far as execution times are concerned, the model is at least as fast if not faster than the most simplified analytic versions of the base correlation model. 1...|$|R

40|$|Enterococci {{levels are}} {{measured}} to assess water safety in recreational beaches through a state surveillance program. This surveillance informs {{the public of}} beach safety, yet the sampling methodology is limited to only making an advisory posting one sample at a time. This methodology poses a challenge for managers such as: 24 hour advisory waiting period, untested days and extreme variability of enterococci levels in the environment. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to integrate adaptive management methodologies that can assist managers to proactively assess beach water safety. This study explored the utility of a historical analysis and logistic regression modeling as a method and as an advisory tool. The analysis utilized 10 years of enterococci surveillance data (7, 422 samples) from 15 sub-tropical beaches in Miami-Dade County, Florida. It was determined that Miami beaches have historical low enterococci exceedance counts (3 % of total data), that there are some beaches that are more propense to higher exceedance counts than others and that the wet season overall did not readily appear to affect exceedances counts. The logistic regression model utilized an exceedance/ non-exceedance dichotomy and spatial, temporal and annual variables. The model indicated that the overall range of probability of having an exceedance for the sampled beaches under each variable was less than 10 %. The ability to use this model and get probability results showed that logistic regression is an accurate statistical tool that provides the <b>historical</b> <b>probabilities</b> of an exceedance on a beach and can complement a random sampling methodology. Furthermore it’s a simple and inexpensive methodology that provides the ability to categorize and recognize patterns estimating the surveillance-managed sample sites probabilities that provides foresight as to where to focus resources in order to reduce risk and facilitating beach management.

40|$|We compare {{observed}} corporate cumulative default probabilities {{to those}} calculated using a stochastic model {{based on an}} extension of the work of Black and Cox and find that corporations default as if via diffusive dynamics.

The ability to represent observed default behavior by a single analytic expression and to differentiate credit-rating-dependent default behavior with a single variable recommends this model for a variety of risk management applications including the mapping of bank default experience to public credit ratings. ...|$|R
