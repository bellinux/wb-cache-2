5|$|Other {{characters}} include various schoolmates {{and staff}} members. Weenus (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a nerdy, psychopathic robot who is even {{lower on the}} social pyramid than the protagonists. Dreadnot (Dana Snyder) is a teacher at Harry S. Apocalypse who finds joy in torturing and invoking pain into his students. Their principal, Thunderbite (also voiced by Snyder), is an oversized, skull-shaped robot who, when not causing pain, acts sweet and motherly to the students. Megawatt (also voiced by Sinterniklaas) is a spoiled rich kid who <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> the female robots, most of whom he blows up; to Thrasher's disdain, he is dating Maimy. Tacklebot (Roger Craig Smith), Megawatt's friend and musclehead jock, acts violent and hostile toward the protagonists.|$|E
25|$|The flowers have {{a strong}} and sweet scent which <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> bees and other pollinators.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fuel}} of a LFTR is a molten salt mixture, it <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> use pyroprocessing, high {{temperature}} methods working {{directly from the}} hot molten salt. Pyroprocessing does not use radiation sensitive solvents and is not easily disturbed by decay heat.|$|E
50|$|The tightly-packed rosettes <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> mealy bugs.|$|R

50|$|This {{species is}} a rhizomatous {{perennial}} herb with square stems growing 2 to 3 feet tall. It may spread {{to form a}} colony. The oppositely arranged leaves are lance-shaped and mint-scented. The inflorescence contains tubular reddish purple flowers with purplish bracts beneath. The flowers <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> insects. The seed heads <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> birds.|$|R
25|$|While {{the design}} {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> a general hearing aid user, open-fit devices can by their design have problems when connected to Assistive Listening Devices (ALD's). This {{problem has been}} addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the hearing aid.|$|E
25|$|The single-cylinder bikes have {{a strong}} {{following}} and are thought by many of their riders to be better off-roaders than the heavier boxer-engined bikes. Like the larger two-cylinder models, they offer significant capacity to carry gear and supplies over long distances. Their versatility <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> riders who intend to spend weeks, months, even years travelling on two wheels.|$|E
25|$|Although Rawdon knows Becky <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> men, he {{believes}} her reputation is spotless {{even though she}} is widely suspected of romantic intrigue with General Tufto and other powerful men. Nobody dares to suggest otherwise to Rawdon because of his temper and his reputation for duelling. Yet other people, particularly the Marquis of Steyne, find it impossible to believe that Crawley is unaware of Becky's tricks. Steyne in particular believes Rawdon is fully aware Becky is prostituting herself, and believes Rawdon is going along with the charade in the hope of financial gain.|$|E

30|$|Attractiveness: “the {{capability}} of the software product <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> the user”.|$|R
50|$|The flowers <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> butterflies, {{with the}} nectar {{providing}} a food source for them.|$|R
25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of paying for a hotel. The ability to get additional sleep {{on the way to work}} <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> many commuters using public transport.|$|E
25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear {{programme}} than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. The plus side of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E

6000|$|... 4. Bright red flowers <b>are</b> very <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> butterflies, and <b>are</b> {{sometimes}} specially {{adapted to}} be fertilised by them, {{as in many}} pinks (Dianthus deltoides, D. superbus, D. atrorubens), the corn-cockle (Lychnis Githago), and many others. Blue flowers <b>are</b> especially <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> bees and other hymenoptera (though they frequent flowers of all colours), no less than sixty-seven species of this order having been observed to visit the common [...] "sheep's-bit" [...] (Jasione montana). Dull yellow or brownish flowers, some of which smell like carrion, <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> flies, as the Arum and Aristolochia; while the dull purplish flowers of the Scrophularia <b>are</b> specially <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> wasps.|$|R
50|$|Marathons <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> genre movie fans, or {{families}} that like watching their favourite movies/TV shows in blocks at a time.|$|R
500|$|Jordan is {{classified}} as a country of [...] "high human development" [...] with an [...] "upper middle income" [...] economy. The Jordanian economy, {{one of the smallest}} economies in the region, <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> foreign investors based upon a skilled workforce. The country is a major tourist destination, and also attracts medical tourism due to its well developed health sector. Nonetheless, a lack of natural resources, large flow of refugees and regional turmoil have hampered economic growth.|$|E
500|$|Flashman is [...] tall, weighs [...] (12½ {{stone in}} the first book, {{fourteen}} {{stone in the}} last), has broad shoulders and <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> women. He was forced into marriage in the first book, after he [...] "caddishly deflowered" [...] Elspeth Morrison, {{the daughter of a}} wealthy Scottish textile manufacturer with whom he had been billeted. Despite being married—and the fact he deeply loves his wife—Flashman is [...] "a compulsive womaniser" [...] who has bedded 480 women by the tenth book in the series, which was set in 1859. Elspeth is also probably unfaithful to him on several occasions. Flashman notes that he has three [...] "prime talents, for horses, languages, and fornication"; he was also described by the master-at-arms of the 11th Hussars as a strong swordsman and was skilled with a lance, particularly at tent pegging. When it is necessary for him to control his fear, he will perform bravely, although is more adept at saving his own skin at the expense of others.|$|E
2500|$|Both lakes exhibit good water quality, through Greenleaf Lake {{has been}} prone to intense algal blooms. [...] The {{shallower}} Sioux Lake <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> waterfowl, while Greenleaf supports game fish like panfish and smallmouth bass. [...] Land animals include white-tailed deer and wild turkeys in abundance.|$|E
50|$|These {{plants are}} trees or shrubs. The seeds have brightly colored arils that <b>are</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> birds, which {{disperse}} the seeds.|$|R

2500|$|Nutmeg {{is highly}} {{neurotoxic}} to dogs and causes seizures, tremors, and nervous system disorders {{which can be}} fatal. [...] Nutmeg's rich, spicy scent <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> dogs which {{can result in a}} dog ingesting a lethal amount of this spice. [...] Eggnog and other food preparations which contain nutmeg should not be given to dogs.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ritchie Yorke, who {{published}} his biography, Into the Music in 1975, the album enjoyed rave reviews {{at the time}} of release. [...] He cited one dissenting critic Charlie Gillett, who wrote in Let It Rock: [...] "The trouble with Hard Nose the Highway is that although the music is quite often interesting, it doesn't have a convincing emotional basis...Despite the lack of inspiration and of melodic focus, the record <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> listen to. [...] But Van Morrison has set high standards for himself and Hard Nose the Highway doesn't live up to them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diospyros virginiana is {{believed}} to be an evolutionary remnant that was consumed by the [...] megafauna that roamed the North American continent until 10,000 years ago and would have eaten the fruit, assisting in its dispersal. However, as it <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> raccoons, rodents, and smaller animals, the loss of large grazing herbivores and omnivores in historical times has not seriously affected the tree's survival strategy as compared to Kentucky Coffeetree and Osage Orange which are inedible to most extant wildlife and saw their ranges greatly diminish without mastodons and other dispersal agent fauna. [...] A 2015 study supports the notion that elephants would have been a more effective disperser of the seeds than living North American mammals ...|$|E
25|$|The scenic {{beauty of}} Athirappilly falls has always <b>been</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> filmmakers. It {{has been used}} as a {{location}} for several Malayalam films.|$|R

2500|$|James [...] "Jamie", Jr. – 33 years old, {{the older}} son. He has {{thinning}} hair, an aquiline nose and {{shows signs of}} premature disintegration. He has a habitual expression of cynicism. He resembles his father. [...] "On the rare occasions when he smiles without sneering, his personality possesses the remnant of a humorous, romantic, irresponsible Irish charm – the beguiling ne'er-do-well, with a strain of the sentimentally poetic". He <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> women and popular with men. He is an actor like his father but has difficulty finding work due to {{a reputation for being}} an irresponsible, womanizing alcoholic. He and his father argue a great deal about this. Jamie often refers to his father as [...] "Old Gaspard", a character from the opera Les cloches de Corneville, who is also a miser.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technology}} {{required the}} use of leather flaps to seal the vacuum pipes. The natural oils were drawn out of the leather by the vacuum, making the leather vulnerable to water, rotting it and breaking the fibres when it froze {{during the winter of}} 1847. It had to be kept supple with tallow, which <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> rats. The flaps were eaten, and vacuum operation lasted less than a year, from 1847 (experimental service began in September; operations from February 1848) to 10 September 1848. Deterioration of the valve due to the reaction of tannin and iron oxide has been cited as the last straw that sank the project, as the continuous valve began to tear from its rivets over most of its length, and the estimated replacement cost of £25,000 was considered prohibitive. It has been suggested by Christian Wolmar that the whole project was an expensive flop.|$|E
2500|$|Some of Newman's {{short and}} earlier poems are {{described}} by R. H. Hutton as [...] "unequalled for grandeur of outline, purity of taste and radiance of total effect"; while his latest and longest, The Dream of Gerontius, attempts {{to represent the}} unseen world {{along the same lines}} as Dante. His prose style, especially in his Catholic days, is fresh and vigorous, and <b>is</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> many who do not sympathise with his conclusions, from the apparent candour with which difficulties are admitted and grappled; while in his private correspondence there is charm. James Joyce had a lifelong admiration for Newman's writing style and {{in a letter to his}} patron Harriet Shaw Weaver remarked about Newman that [...] "nobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church".|$|E
50|$|The oblast has {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> investors. In 2002, Moody's rating agency confirmed a Caa1rating {{based on the}} region's long-term foreign currency liabilities.|$|R
50|$|Fringe theatres <b>were</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> {{people in}} the 1960s due to their adventurousness, became less wild in the 1970s while the {{standards}} of production rose.|$|R
