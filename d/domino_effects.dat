40|$|It is {{well known}} that the <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> can {{have a major impact on}} {{accidents}} in storage facilities, as it can increase the consequences of an initial event considerably. However, quantitative risk assessments (QRAs) do not usually take the <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> into account in a detailed, systematic way, mostly because of its complexity and the difficulties involved in its incorporation. We have developed a simple method to include the <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> in QRAs of storage facilities, by estimating the frequency with which new accidents will occur due to this phenomenon. The method has been programmed and implemented in two case studies. The results show that it can indeed be used to include the possibility of <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> occurrence in a QRA.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{likelihood}} of occurrence of <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> {{in a group of}} neighbouring companies in Msasa Industrial area. Study Design: A case study approach was used. Place and Duration of Study: Msasa industrial area, Harare Zimbabwe between June 2011 and June 2012. Methodology: Information was sought through interviews, questionnaires and observations from 15 companies in Msasa. The What If Analysis (WIA) was also used to postulate the potential upsets that may result in accidents. A semi qualitative approximate <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> analysis procedure was used to simulate the likely sequence of an event after its initiation. Discussion: In the cluster, <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> was most likely to be initiated and propagated by fires (pool, flash, fireballs or jet), explosions (confined vapour cloud explosions (CVCE), boiling liquid expanding vapour explosions (BLEVE), vented explosions, vapour cloud explosions, and dust explosions) and toxic release with effects ranging from being catastrophic, critical, marginal or negligible. It was found that there has been no domino risk analysis and hence was a strong possibility of destruction of the entire industrial area and neighbouring residential areas {{in the case of the}} forecast domino accidents. Toxic and dust releases were most likely to contaminate neighbouring residence leading to exposed toxic substance for long periods after the release. Conclusion: Msasa industrial area may pose a serious <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> risk, hence the need to make it mandatory for <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> analysis studies in industrial areas and sharing safety information with neighbouring companies and communities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of risk analysis, the {{accidents}} caused by the <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> are those inducing the most catastrophic consequences. The consequences of these latter are at various levels and may affect not only the industrial sites, but also people, environment and economy. The probability of the <b>domino</b> <b>effects</b> is increasingly high due to development in industrial complexes, the proximity of such industrial plant, the storage of dangerous substances and the transportation networks. The diversity of these factors is even more critical that they are often related {{to the emergence of}} new threats that exploit the malicious acts and human error. Although the literature abounds in several studies on <b>domino</b> <b>effects,</b> it is necessary to deepen their analysis, and pay more attention to their modeling.

40|$|The domino {{sequences}} {{found in}} major accidents have been analyzed {{for a large}} set of cases (330); the first event triggering the <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> was an explosion or a fire, both with approximately the same contribution; the same proportion has been found when all <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> steps were considered. Although fire effects usually reach a distance much shorter than those of an explosion, as fire is the most frequent major accident it is often found {{as the first step}} of domino sequences. This is especially true in the case of BLEVEs. Both in fixed plants and in the transportation of hazardous materials, {{in the event of a}} fire, if flames affect a vessel and the fireproofing layer has been damaged, a BLEW can occur at any moment 127 BLEW accidents involving <b>domino</b> <b>effect</b> have been analyzed.
