40|$|The current flamenco {{seems to}} be crossed by a {{distinction}} between {{on the one hand}} the supporters of tradition {{and on the other hand}} those of creativity.

40|$|When I started {{studying}} Romania’s {{rural areas}} I {{was happy to}} find out among others that “the village” has not lost ground but continues as a topic of interest for specialists. The Romanian village has regained importance due {{to a change in}} the mind-set of a population segment that has come to regard the rural environment as an attractive place to live in. Consequently, a new type of migration occurred, i. e. urban-rural migration, which co-existed with the rural exodus up to 1996 and gained momentum after 2002. The new rural residents seek the same extent of housing comfort they enjoyed before moving to permanently live in the country, plus the other advantages of living in less polluted environments, with larger dwelling areas. For a clearer picture of the quality of rural housing we aim to assess the public utility infrastructure quality and the population’s access to utilities by determining the density of the sewerage, drinking water and natural gas networks and by inventorying the dwelling installations (for sewerage and the supply of drinking water, electric power, thermal energy). My second target is to identify the dwellings stock-related issues in terms of the number, structure and space of dwelling units, by analyzing the dwelling space indicators (the number of habitable rooms per house, the number of persons per habitable room/house, the habitable space per person) and by <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of the auxiliary rooms (bathrooms and kitchens) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} review of the {{available}} data concerning the centrifugal visual system (CVS) of vertebrates [Rep?nt, J., Ward, R., Miceli, D., Rio, J. P., M?na, M., Kenigfest, N. B., Vesselkin, N. P., 2006. The centrifugal visual system of vertebrates: a comparative analysis of its functional anatomical organization, Brain Res. Rev. 52, 1 - 57], we have shown that this feature of the visual system is not a particularity of birds, but is a permanent component of the vertebrate central nervous system which nevertheless shows considerable morphological and functional variation from one taxonomic group to another. Given these findings, the primary objective of the present article {{is an attempt to}} specify the evolutionary significance of this phylogenetic diversity. We begin by <b>drawing</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of this variation under several headings: the intracerebral location of the retinopetal neurons; the mode of intra-retinal arborizations of the centrifugal fibres and the nature of their targets; their neurochemical properties; and the afferent supplies of these neurons. We subsequently discuss these variations, particularly that of the intracerebral location of the retinopetal neurons during development and in adult forms, using the neuromeric terminology and in the framework of cladistic analysis, and seek to interpret them in a phylogenetic context. From this analysis, it becomes evident that the CVS is not a homogeneous entity formed by neurons with a common embryological origin, but rather a collection of at least eight distinct subsystems arising in very different regions of the neuraxis. These are the olfacto-retinal, dorsal thalamo-retinal, ventral thalamo-retinal, pretecto-retinal, tecto-retinal, tegmento-mesencephalo-retinal, dorsal isthmo-retinal and ventral isthmo-retinal systems. The olfacto-retinal system, which is probably absent in Agnatha, appears to be a pleisiomorphic characteristic of all Gnathostomata, while on the other hand the tegmento-mesencephalo-retinal system appears to be present only in Agnatha. Our cladistic analysis also shows that the remaining six subsystems are polyphyletic in origin and have arisen independently on several occasions in different radiations of Gnathostoma. In conclusion, we suggest that, {{in the course of the}} palaeontological history of vertebrates, these different retinopetal pathways have been selected on the basis of widely different environmental pressures which remain to be identified...|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the major sources of data on mortality, {{morbidity}} and health in Europe and in other developed regions in order to examine their potential for analysing mortality and morbidity levels and trends. The review is primarily focused on routinely collected information covering a whole country. No attempt is made to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>inventory</b> of sources by country; the paper deals instead with the pros and cons of each source for mortality and morbidity studies in demography. While each source considered separately can already yield useful, though partial, results, record linkage among data sources can significantly improve the analysis. Record linkage can also lead to the detection of possible causal associations that could eventually be confirmed. More generally, Big Data can reveal changing mortality and morbidity trends and patterns that could lead to preventive measures being taken rather than more costly curative ones.|$|R
