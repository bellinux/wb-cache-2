40|$|This {{research}} {{used the}} {{finite element method}} (FEM) to investigate {{the influence of the}} slope of grain (SoG) on the strength-reducing effect of <b>face</b> <b>knots.</b> The results showed that the SoG may reduce the modulus of rupture (MoR) of knotty beams by up to 50 %. In addition, this negative influence was found to be markedly dependent upon both the knot position and the side of the specimen where the SoG is perceptible. Centerline knots were more susceptible to the SoG influence than margin <b>knots.</b> For the <b>face</b> <b>knots,</b> this effect also became worse when accounting for the SoG at faces (SoG(f)) in comparison to the edges (SoG(e)). The worst case scenario occurred however, when both the SoG(f) and SoG(e) were assumed. Further investigations are suggested to improve timber efficiency as current lumber grading standards do not discern these features...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of different types}} of knots and fiber deviations on the bending of wood, as managed using visual grading standards, was analytically discussed in this research by means of the finite element method. The effect of each geometrical variable on the strength and stress distribution has been studied individually. This was accomplished after validating a previously presented finite element model that accounted for the three-dimensional shape of the knots and fiber deviations. The simulated sizes and positions were those commonly managed by the standards for strength grading. The research presents the effect of: (1) the size and position of cylindrical face knots; (2) size and position of truncated conical face knots; (3) size and position of shallow conical face knots; (4) size and position of conical edge knots; (5) inclination of <b>face</b> <b>knots.</b> In each case, the analytical predictions of the modulus of rupture and stress distribution are detailed. Seven characteristic positions with distinct mechanical behavior were found, which should be accounted for in order to improve the wood grading efficiency...|$|R
60|$|Betsy {{might have}} laughed aloud {{had she not}} remembered how {{sensitive}} to ridicule Shaggy's brother was, for the handkerchief with which he had masked his features was a red one covered with big white polka dots. In this two holes had been cut--in front of the eyes--while two smaller ones before the nostrils allowed the man to breathe freely. The cloth was then tightly drawn over the Ugly One's <b>face</b> and <b>knotted</b> {{at the back of}} his neck.|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty radiata pine boards were dried using {{different}} methods (air drying, commercial kiln drying and laboratory kiln drying) to study the effect of knot, wood and seasoning variables {{on the nature of}} knot checking. Among the knot variables, the largest knot group (diameter> 75 mm) was found associated with the highest check rate and the most severe checks. Medium size group (25 mm < diameter â‰¤ 75 mm) had significantly lower check rate. <b>Face</b> <b>knots</b> were significantly more liable to cracking than any type else. The major check directions of a knot generally ran across the symmetrical axes of the knot. In wood variables, due to lower number of medium size knots butt half had higher check rate than upper part of stem. After studying the density and check ratio of northern outer wood, southern outer wood and core wood, a reverse relation was found between the density and the check ratio. Final moisture content affected knot checking directly because it is proportional to shrinkage. Temperature did not show significant influence. Air dried timbers, especially those exposed to air without shield, had more severe checks than those exposed to other drying conditions. There were no relationships found among sawn pattern, dimensions of boards and check rate of knots...|$|R

60|$|They {{crossed the}} street, and, to the obvious amazement {{of the little}} congregation, stood in the doorway. A gaunt shepherd, with weather-marked <b>face</b> and <b>knotted</b> fingers, handed them clumsily a couple of chairs. Some of the small farmers rose and made a clumsy obeisance to their {{temporal}} lord. Gideon Strong, six feet four, with great unbent shoulders, and face as hard and rugged as iron, frowned them down, and {{showed no signs of}} noticing his presence. Elsewhere he would {{have been one of the}} first, proud man though he was, to stand bareheaded before the owner of his farm and half a county, but in the house of God, humble little building though it was, he reckoned all men equal.|$|R

50|$|At 08:33 on 16 February, barely {{three minutes}} late from their {{intended}} time, and <b>facing</b> 16-18 <b>knot</b> winds over the drop zones, {{the first of}} one thousand troopers of the 503rd PRCT based at Mindoro, began dropping out of C-47 troop carriers of the US Thirteenth Air Force and to float down on the surprised Japanese defenders, remnants of Maj. Gen. Rikichi Tsukada's Kembu Group at the two tiny go-point areas of Topside's western heights. However, some paratroopers were blown back into Japanese held territory. No troopers drowned, although some who were unable to climb the cliffs through hostile territory, or had fallen close to the rocks, had to be rescued near Wheeler Point.Despite the grueling air and naval bombardment that left the defending troops dazed and scattered, they vigorously rallied, and fierce fighting erupted almost immediately. At one point that same morning, they threatened to drive a salient into the paratroopers' tenuous foothold on 'Topside'.|$|R
50|$|Careful {{inspection}} {{reveals the}} two {{faces of the}} completed fiador knot, where the four strands emerge, are not identical. One has {{the appearance of a}} crown knot surrounding the emerging strands and is somewhat resistant to spreading when they are pulled apart. By comparison, the strands emerging from the other <b>face</b> of the <b>knot</b> are not nearly as well-contained and if pulled apart, the fiador knot easily distorts and splays. Depending on how the fiador knot is tied, these distinct faces can be positioned differently with respect {{to the side of the}} knot with the two loops and the side with a single loop and the two free ends.|$|R
60|$|In {{the palace}} about him seethed, all unknown to Gahan, a vast unrest. Warriors and chieftains pursued {{the duties of}} their vocations with dour <b>faces,</b> and little <b>knots</b> of them were {{collecting}} {{here and there and}} with frowns of anger discussing some subject that was uppermost in the minds of all. It was upon the fourth day following Tara's incarceration in the tower that E-Thas, the major-domo of the palace and one of O-Tar's creatures, came to his master upon some trivial errand. O-Tar was alone in one of the smaller chambers of his personal suite when the major-domo was announced, and after the matter upon which E-Thas had come was disposed of the jeddak signed him to remain.|$|R
60|$|One {{twilight}} {{when he was}} trotting leisurely {{across the}} ranges to give Akela the half of a buck that he had killed, while the Four jogged behind him, sparring a little, and tumbling one another over for joy of being alive, he heard a cry {{that had never been}} heard since the bad days of Shere Khan. It was what they call in the Jungle the pheeal, a hideous kind of shriek that the jackal gives when he is hunting behind a tiger, or when there is a big killing afoot. If you can imagine a mixture of hate, triumph, fear, and despair, with a kind of leer running through it, you will get some notion of the pheeal that rose and sank and wavered and quavered far away across the Waingunga. The Four stopped at once, bristling and growling. Mowgli's hand went to his knife, and he checked, the blood in his <b>face,</b> his eyebrows <b>knotted.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} formalism {{in quantum}} mechanics gives {{meaning to the}} physical concepts and entities, as the birth and the historic evolution of quantum theory tell us, {{as well as it}} is evidenced by the entanglement between the different interpretations of the theory and the formal aspects of the theory itself. Concepts characterizing quantum mechanics, as quantum entanglement or non-locality, were recognized and really understood in their implications only after the formulation of quantum theory. Teaching quantum mechanics in upper secondary school cannot leave out the consideration of the interlacing between formalism and concepts. On this peculiar point there are centered pilot experimentations in Italian last year upper secondary school classes. The experimentations are carried out following a learning/teaching quantum mechanics proposal developed in previous researches. According to this proposal students <b>face</b> quantum <b>knots</b> and concepts in the phenomenological context of light polarization. The aim of the proposal is the construction of the formal thinking creating a challenging educational environment in which student explore hypothesis and, step by step, build a coherent interpretation of the specific phenomenology explored, generalizing the results in other contexts. From analysis of students learning path many indications emerged on how students use the vectorial representation of state as cognitive organizer of state concept. Moreover the linear operator representation of observables was used as an instrument to yield the quantum description of microscopic systems. The integration of these results with phenomenographic studies on classical vs quantum conceptions developed by students showed diverse grades of coherences of the conceptual students schemas and the formal ones...|$|R
5000|$|I wish I {{could give}} the public a true picture of the queen as she {{appeared}} at her best, but this would be impossible, even had she permitted a photograph to be taken, for her charming play of expression while in conversation, the character and intellect which were then revealed, were only half seen when the face was in repose. She wore her hair like all Korean ladies, parted in the center, drawn tightly and very smoothly away from the <b>face</b> and <b>knotted</b> rather low {{at the back of}} the head. A small ornament...was worn on the top of the head fastened by a narrow black band. Her majesty seemed to care little for ornaments, and wore very few. No Korean women wear earrings, and the queen was no exception, nor have I ever seen her wear a necklace, a brooch, or a bracelet. She must have had many rings, but I never saw her wear more than one or two of European manufacture...According to Korean custom, she carried a number of filigree gold ornaments decorated with long silk tassels fastened at her side. So simple, so perfectly refined were all her tastes in dress, it is difficult to think of her as belonging to a nation called half civilized...Slightly pale and quite thin, with somewhat sharp features and brilliant piercing eyes, she did not strike me at first sight as being beautiful, but no one could help reading force, intellect and strength of character in that face...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to unbalanced energy budgets, animals must allocate resources among competing physiological systems to maximize fitness. Constraints can {{be imposed on}} energy availability or energy expenditure, and adjustments can be made via changes in metabolism or trade-offs with competing demands such as body-mass maintenance and immune function. This study investigates changes in constitutive immune function and the acute-phase response in shorebirds (red <b>knots)</b> <b>faced</b> with limited access time to food. We separated birds into two experimental groups receiving either 6 h or 22 h of food access and measured constitutive immune function. After 3 wk, we induced an acute-phase response, and after 1 wk of recovery, we switched the groups to the opposite food treatment and measured constitutive immune function again. We found little effect of food treatment on constitutive immune function, which suggests that even under resource limitation, a baseline level of immune function is maintained. However, birds enduring limited access to food suppressed aspects of the acute-phase response (decreased feeding and mass loss) to maintain energy intake, and they downregulated thermoregulatory adjustments to food treatment to maintain body temperature during simulated infection. Thus, under resource-limited conditions, birds save energy on the most costly aspects of immune defense...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{flexibility}} {{is a phenomenon}} where physiological functions in animals are reversibly adjusted in response to ecological constraints. Research usually focuses on effects of single constraints, but under natural conditions animals face a multitude of restrictions acting simultaneously, and potentially generating conflicting demands on the phenotype. We investigated the conflicting demands of low temperatures and a low quality diet on the phenotype of a shorebird, the red knot Calidris canutus. We tested the effects of switching diet from a high quality trout food to low quality hard-shelled bivalves in captive birds acclimated to temperatures reflecting natural winter conditions. Feeding on bivalves generated a digestive constraint forcing the birds to increase {{the height and width}} of their gizzard by 66 % and 71 %, respectively, over 30 days. The change in gizzard size was associated with an initial 15 % loss of body mass and a reduction in size of the pectoral muscles by 11 %. Because pectoral muscle size determines summit metabolic rate (M(sum), an indicator of cold endurance), measured M(sum) declined by 9 %. Therefore, although the birds were acclimated to cold, gizzard growth led to a loss of cold endurance. We propose that cold-acclimated <b>knots</b> <b>facing</b> a digestive constraint made a phenotypic compromise by giving-up cold hardiness for digestive capacity. Field studies suggest that phenotypic compromises occur in free-living red knots as well and help improve survival...|$|R
