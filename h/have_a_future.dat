5|$|Linnaeus {{entered the}} Växjö Katedralskola in 1724, {{where he studied}} mainly Greek, Hebrew, {{theology}} and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. In the {{last year at the}} gymnasium, Linnaeus' father visited to ask the professors how his son's studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the first}} series of Cold Feet began in January 1998. Bullen {{continued}} his method of developing storylines based on his own life; {{he and his wife}} had their first child in the latter half of 1997, so he integrated their experiences into the storyline of characters Pete and Jenny, who have their first child in Cold Feets first episode. Throughout 1998, he retained his job at the BBC, working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing Cold Feet. During the second series he cut back to one show per week. By the time of the third series in 2000, he felt confident enough that he would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> in television that he was able to give up radio presenting completely. He moved from his home in London to Cambridge, where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends.|$|E

25|$|In October 2007, Roeder joined Championship side Norwich City, {{signing a}} {{contract}} until 2010, with Norwich {{bottom of the}} division and four points adrift of safety. His first game in charge was on 4 November in the East Anglian Derby against Ipswich Town, a match that ended 2–2 after Norwich had been 2–0 down at half-time. His first win came in the home game against Coventry City (24 November), which he followed up with a first away win of the season for Norwich in the 3-1 defeat of fellow strugglers Blackpool (27 November), who previously had not lost at home that season. He then guided the team out of the relegation zone with wins over Plymouth Argyle, Sheffield United, Scunthorpe United, Barnsley, Southampton, Preston North End and Cardiff City. The Canaries rose rapidly up the table {{as a result of}} this good run of form and, at one stage, it looked as though they could make a shock late burst into the play-offs, similar to the run under Nigel Worthington in the 2001/2002 season. Roeder began an overhaul of the squad in the January transfer window, releasing players such as Julien Brellier and David Strihavka who had been signed by his predecessor and who he did not consider to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> at the club. He made the loan signing of Matty Pattison permanent and also renewed the loan deals for Ched Evans and Mo Camara. Roeder also made four loan signings including Matthew Bates, Keiran Gibbs, Alex Pearce and James Henry. Despite a poor run of form through February and March, Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship for another season, though survival was not confirmed until a 3-0 home win against QPR in the penultimate fixture of the season.|$|E

He had a three-point field goal percentage of [...]429, which ranked second in the league. The departure of head coach Rob Spon convinced Owumi to leave the team.

500|$|In 1970, Mike Flanagan was {{suffering}} arm problems, and many scouts {{decided that he}} did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity and wait to see if his arm would recuperate. [...] The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst on a baseball scholarship. [...] During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. [...] Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer Jeff Bagwell in return. [...] The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in.|$|E

Finn agrees that their children would be raised as she chooses, so to confirm her trust and appreciation of him, she allows him to touch the side of her breast as they make out. Later, Finn is also reinstated as quarterback, but it occurs because his replacement Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is injured during a game, dislocating his shoulder. Finn feels responsible and confesses his guilt to Emma, who tells him it is unlikely God is communicating specifically with him through a grilled cheese sandwich.

500|$|He started 2002–03 well, {{taking his}} place in the team due to {{injuries}} to other players. He made his first appearance in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Macclesfield Town on 10 August 2002, with chairman John Batchelor claiming Smith had a [...] "wonderful game and if we can get that sort of attitude from everyone in the team we won't have any problems". Smith was dropped to the bench for a 1–1 home draw with Wrexham on 29 October 2002 due to a change in formation, having started every match in 2002–03 prior to this match, although he did play as a 48th-minute substitute. He suffered a hamstring injury in early-November 2002, making his return in a 1–0 victory away to Rochdale on 23 November. Smith received his first red card of 2002–03 for a second bookable offence in a 1–1 home draw with Hull City on 28 December 2002, resulting in a one-match suspension. This meant he missed York's match against Torquay on 11 January 2003, and after a short spell on the sidelines returned in a 2–1 home win over Macclesfield on 2 February. Smith finished 2002–03 with 39 appearances for York, and was described by the Evening Press as the [...] "surprise star of the season". Despite being in outstanding form and becoming a fans' favourite, he was not offered a new contract with York at the end of 2002–03 by Dolan, although he hoped to still to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> at the club. This decision was reversed by newly appointed player-manager Chris Brass, and Smith signed a new one-year contract in July 2003.|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Medved {{characterized}} {{examples of}} the [...] "so bad it's good" [...] class of low-budget cult film through books such as The Golden Turkey Awards. These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs, such as Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) and The Room (2003). [...] Similarly, Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls (1995) bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video. [...] Catching on, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer capitalized on the film's ironic appeal and marketed it as a cult film. [...] Sometimes [...] fans will impose their own interpretation of films which have attracted derision, such as reinterpreting an earnest melodrama as a comedy. [...] Jacob deNobel of the Carroll County Times states that films can be perceived as nonsensical or inept when audiences misunderstand avant-garde filmmaking or misinterpret parody. [...] Films such as Rocky Horror can be misinterpreted as [...] "weird for weirdness sake" [...] by people unfamiliar with the cult films that it parodies. [...] deNobel ultimately rejects {{the use of the}} label [...] "so bad it's good" [...] as mean-spirited and often misapplied. [...] Alamo Drafthouse programmer Zack Carlson has further said that any film which succeeds in entertaining an audience is good, regardless of irony. The rise of the Internet and on-demand films has led critics to question whether [...] "so bad it's good" [...] films <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> now that people have such diverse options in both availability and catalog, though fans eager to experience the worst films ever made can lead to lucrative showings for local theaters and merchandisers.|$|E
