25|$|The oldest known <b>harvestman,</b> {{from the}} 400-million-year-old Devonian Rhynie chert, already has {{almost all the}} {{characteristics}} of modern species, placing the origin of harvestmen in the Silurian, or even earlier.|$|E
40|$|Most {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} papers on prey–predator interactions are for animals with long-range detection, animals that can detect and react to predators long before these touch the prey. Heavy-bodied and chemically defended <b>harvestmen</b> (Arachnida, Opiliones) are {{an exception to}} this general pattern and rely on contact to detect arthropod predators. We examined the interactions between the Brazilian wandering spider Ctenus ornatus with <b>harvestmen</b> (Mischonyx cuspidatus) or control prey (Gryllus sp. and M. cuspidatus immature, both with soft integuments). Considering a prey–predator system in which fleeing from or reacting to a predator at a distance is not possible, we predicted both a high survival value of near-range defense mechanisms and that mortality would be higher {{in the absence of}} such defense mechanisms. We also expected the predator to behave differently when interacting with <b>harvestmen</b> or with a control prey without such defense mechanisms. Our results from laboratory experiments partially matched our predictions: First of all, histological sections showed that the integument of adult <b>harvestmen</b> is thicker than that of immature <b>harvestmen</b> and that of crickets. Adult <b>harvestmen</b> were less preyed upon than the control prey; the heavy armature increases the survival rate but the secretions from the scent glands do not. The predator did behave differently when attacking <b>harvestmen</b> compared to crickets. Despite the large size difference between predator and <b>harvestmen,</b> the protection provided by the armature allowed some of the <b>harvestmen</b> to survive encounters without pre-contact detection, thus greatly reducing the reliance on long-range detection to survive encounters with predators. <b>Harvestmen</b> call for theoretical and empirical work on prey–predator interactions that take into account the possibility that prey may not detect the predator before contact is established.

40|$|Most {{soil and}} leaf litter {{invertebrates}} lack efficient inventory methods. We evaluated {{the efficiency of}} the pitfall traps (or Barber method) and Winkler extractor (or Winkler method) in a beech forest on limestone in southwestern Romania using <b>harvestmen</b> (Arachnida: Opilionidae) as target group. The aim was to test if the relative abundance, species richness and species composition differ between the two methods. The <b>harvestmen</b> relative abundance and species richness were different when assessed by the two sampling methods. Winkler extractor captured greater numbers of <b>harvestmen</b> than pitfall traps, whereas pitfall traps caught more <b>harvestmen</b> species. <b>Harvestmen</b> assemblages as determined by Winkler method were found to be more similar with natural <b>harvestmen</b> assemblages. If the aim of the study is to analyse the community patterns Winkler extractor could be more efficient then pitfall traps. Our study suggests that the choice of the sampling method should be applied {{depending on the type of}} the investigation...|$|R
50|$|Gonyleptidae is a neotropical {{family of}} <b>harvestmen</b> (Order Opiliones) {{with more than}} 800 species, {{the largest in the}} Suborder Laniatores and the second largest of the Opiiones as a whole. The largest known <b>harvestmen</b> are gonyleptids.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{their long}} history, few <b>harvestman</b> fossils are known. This is mainly {{due to their}} {{delicate}} body structure and terrestrial habitat, making it unlikely {{to be found in}} sediments. As a consequence, most known fossils have been preserved as amber.|$|E
25|$|No fossil harvestmen {{are known}} from the Triassic. They are also so far absent from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil, which has yielded many other {{terrestrial}} arachnids. An unnamed long-legged <b>harvestman</b> was reported from the Early Cretaceous of Koonwarra, Victoria, Australia, which may be a Eupnoi.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of its {{exquisite}} preservation, the Rhynie chert boasts the most diverse non-marine fauna of its time. Typical members of the Rhynie chert arthropod fauna include the crustacean Lepidocaris, the euthycarcinoid Heterocrania, the springtail Rhyniella praecursor, the <b>harvestman</b> Eophalangium sheari, Acari (mites), and trigonotarbids in the genus Palaeocharinus.|$|E

40|$|During {{the years}} 1993 – 2001 the {{monitoring}} of the soil surface fauna {{was carried out in}} a floodplain fo- rest in the Ranšpurk National Nature Reserve (south Moravia). The <b>harvestmen</b> assemblages fluctuation is described in detail in this paper. The method of pitfall traps was used. A total of 3174 individuals of seven <b>harvestmen</b> species were collected. The species composition was very similar to other research results from the southern Moravian floodplain forest. Only the dominance values differ from the values in the other localities. All of the registered species prefer moisture and shadow places. The highest abundance was observed in Astrobunus laevipes (Canestrini, 1872), Nemastoma lugubre (Müller, 1776), Oligolophus tridens (C. L. Koch, 1936) and Rilaena triangularis (Herbst, 1799). The dynamics of <b>harvestmen</b> occurrence during the year had a different development than in other groups of invertebrates. <b>Harvestmen</b> mostly occurred in pitfall traps in autumn and winter months. The highest abundance of <b>harvestmen</b> in traps was observed in December and January. In July 1997, disastrous flood affected all groups of invertebrates. The flood had a minimal impact on the abundance of <b>harvestmen</b> in pitfall traps...|$|R
5000|$|Relationships {{with other}} arachnids are obscure. Plesiosiro means [...] "close to Siro", {{which is a}} genus of cyphophthalmid (Cyphophthalmi); the most {{primitive}} group of the living <b>harvestmen</b> (Opiliones). These <b>harvestmen</b> do, in some ways, resemble the reconstructed body plan of the haptopods.|$|R
25|$|The Opiliones have {{a single}} pair of eyes {{in the middle of the}} head, {{oriented}} sideways. A 305-million-year-old fossilized <b>harvestman</b> with two pairs of eyes was reported in 2014. However, some species are eyeless, such as the Brazilian Caecobunus termitarum (Grassatores) from termite nests, Giupponia chagasi (Gonyleptidae) from caves, and all species of the Guasiniidae.|$|E
25|$|Harvestmen (Opiliones) are {{an order}} of arachnids often {{confused}} with spiders, though the two orders are not closely related. Research on <b>harvestman</b> phylogeny (that is, the phylogenetic tree) {{is in a state}} of flux. While some families are clearly monophyletic, that is share a common ancestor, others are not, and the relationships between families are often not well understood.|$|E
25|$|The Dyspnoi are {{probably}} the best studied <b>harvestman</b> group regarding phylogeny. They are clearly monophyletic, and divided into two superfamilies. The relationship of the superfamily Ischyropsalidoidea, comprising the families Ceratolasmatidae, Ischyropsalididae and Sabaconidae, has been investigated in detail. It {{is not clear whether}} Ceratolasmatidae and Sabaconidae are each monophyletic, as the ceratolasmatid Hesperonemastoma groups with the sabaconid Taracus in molecular analyses. All other families are grouped under Troguloidea.|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} <b>harvestmen</b> occur in natural {{subterranean}} cavities using these habitats as shelters and sites of oviposition. Many species have evolved in these environments, thus becoming cave-dwellers. In {{a few cases}} <b>harvestmen</b> {{have been reported in}} artificial cavities (mines), but without details about their distribution or natural history. Based on faunal inventories carried out in 111 artificial cavities in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, this work aimed to register species of <b>harvestmen</b> that are associated with these artificial cavities. Seventeen species were found in 12 municipalities, in addition to new occurrences for 14 of these species and some new behavioral notes. Two undescribed species were also recorded. This study highlights that artificial cavities may be used as shelters by <b>harvestmen,</b> mainly in human-modified landscapes...|$|R

25|$|Several Opiliones in Argentina {{appear to}} be vulnerable, if not endangered. These include Pachyloidellus fulvigranulatus, which is found only on top of Cerro Uritorco, the highest peak in the Sierras Chicas chain (provincia de Cordoba) and Pachyloides borellii is in {{rainforest}} patches in northwest Argentina which are in an area being dramatically destroyed by humans. The cave-living Picunchenops spelaeus is apparently endangered through human action. So far, no <b>harvestman</b> has been included {{in any kind of}} a Red List in Argentina, so they receive no protection.|$|E
25|$|An urban legend {{claims that}} the <b>harvestman</b> is the most venomous animal in the world, but {{possesses}} fangs too short or a mouth too round and small to bite a human, so is not dangerous (the same myth applies to Pholcus phalangioides and the cranefly, which are both also called a 'daddy longlegs'). This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen has venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and {{not strong enough to}} break human skin.|$|E
500|$|Although the 1964 floods had {{initially}} generated support for New Melones, a spirited {{opposition to the}} dam arose from both the river recreation industry and environmentalists who saw the Stanislaus River canyon as having greater value than a reservoir. River runners protested {{the threat to the}} Stanislaus River, which was becoming {{one of the most popular}} whitewater runs in the United States, with the first commercial rafting company established in 1962. The river flowed through the deepest limestone canyon in the US, with cliffs rising [...] above the water in places. Other natural features of the area included extensive limestone caves, and endemic species such as Banksula melones, the Melones cave <b>harvestman.</b> In addition, more than one hundred archaeological and historical sites, left over from Native American inhabitation and the Gold Rush period, were all situated in the reservoir flood zone.|$|E

2500|$|In 1796, Pierre André Latreille erected {{the family}} [...] "Phalangida" [...] for the then known harvestmen, but {{included}} the genus Galeodes (Solifugae). Tord Tamerlan Teodor Thorell (1892) recognized the suborders Palpatores, Laniatores, Cyphophthalmi (called Anepignathi), but also included the Ricinulei as a <b>harvestman</b> suborder. The latter {{were removed from}} the Opiliones by Hansen and William Sørensen (1904), rendering the harvestmen monophyletic.|$|E
2500|$|The legs {{continue}} to twitch {{after they are}} detached because [...] 'pacemakers' {{are located in the}} ends of the first long segment (femur) of their legs. These pacemakers send signals via the nerves to the muscles to extend the leg and then the leg relaxes between signals. While some harvestman's legs twitch for a minute, others have been recorded to twitch up to an hour. The twitching has been hypothesized to function as an evolutionary advantage by keeping the attention of a predator while the <b>harvestman</b> escapes.|$|E
5000|$|Opiliones - phalangids, <b>harvestmen</b> or daddy-long-legs (6,300 species) ...|$|R
25|$|Opiliones (formerly Phalangida, {{and better}} known as <b>harvestmen</b> or daddy longlegs) are arachnids that are {{harmless}} to people and {{are known for their}} exceptionally long walking legs, compared to their body size. , over 6,500 species of <b>harvestmen</b> have been discovered worldwide. The order Opiliones is divided into five suborders: Cyphophthalmi, Eupnoi, Dyspnoi, Laniatores, and the recently described Tetrophthalmi. Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 410-million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland and 305-million-year-old rocks from France; they look surprisingly modern, suggesting that the basic structure of the <b>harvestmen</b> has not changed much since then.|$|R
50|$|<b>Harvestmen</b> breathe through tracheae, {{somewhat}} like insects. Air enters through {{a pair of}} spiracles located behind the last pair of legs, on the opisthosoma. Unlike as in insects, the tracheae end in hemolymph near the organs, instead of leading into them. The oxygen-binding respiratory pigment of <b>harvestmen</b> is hemocyanin, which is typically found in arachnids with book lungs, which <b>harvestmen</b> do not possess. The pattern of tracheal branching seems to be rather consistent in all <b>harvestmen.</b> A main trunk projects upward and forward from each spiracle into the prosoma, where it narrows gradually until it ends in the chelicerae of each side. Lateral branches lead to the other appendages. Except in Cyphophthalmi, the branches from each side meet and form a single transverse trachea. Gonad, genitalia and digestive tract also receive branches.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} other karst {{invertebrates}} {{that are also}} endangered in Travis County and neighboring Williamson County. They include Texella reddelli (Bee Creek cave <b>harvestman),</b> Texella reyesi (Bone Cave <b>harvestman),</b> Tartarocreagris texana (Tooth Cave pseudoscorpion), Neoleptoneta myopica (Tooth Cave spider), Rhadine persephone (Tooth Cave ground beetle), Batrisodes texanus (Coffin Cave mold beetle). All of these karst invertebrates are considered troglobites, which are characterized by living their entire lives underground, have small or absent eyes, elongated appendages, and other adaptations to their subterranean environment. A widely accepted theory {{for the evolution of}} [...] troglobites is that during a series of climatic changes in the Pleistocene epoch, certain creatures wandered into the caves for a more stable environment and over time evolved into the invertebrates they are today. Troglobites prefer to inhabit the dark zone of the cave where the humidity and temperature are relatively constant. High temperatures nearly 100% humidity is required for most troglobites. There are some 7,700 species of troglobites, but this is probably {{only a small portion of}} the population because most of them have not been discovered. Even though they spend their entire life under ground in total darkness they depend very much on the world above. Rootlets from the trees above crawl down into the caves providing bug food. The bugs that feed on these rootlets are the troglobites prey. Moisture and heat from above and the natural springs within the caves provide the humidity that is needed to support their life. Because all of these invertebrates share similar habitats, they face many of the same threats as the Kretschmarr Cave mold beetle that has led to their endangerment.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a legend}} that daddy long-legs spiders {{have the most}} potent venom of any spider, but that their fangs are either too small or too weak to {{puncture}} human skin; the same legend is also repeated of the <b>harvestman</b> and [...] crane fly, also known as [...] "daddy long-legs" [...] in some regions. Indeed, pholcid spiders do have a short fang structure (called uncate due to its [...] "hooked" [...] shape). Brown recluse spiders also have uncate fang structure, but are able to deliver medically significant bites. Possible explanations include: pholcid venom is not toxic to humans; pholcid uncate are smaller than those of brown recluse; or there is a musculature {{difference between the two}} arachnids, with recluses, being hunting spiders, possessing stronger muscles for fang penetration.|$|E
