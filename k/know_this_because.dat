We <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the lithography {{is different from}} the 1847 edition.

50|$|It {{turns out}} that the whole charade was a plot on behalf of the Krishnan kingdom of Balhib to break the Terran ban on high {{technology}} to that primitive world. Schmidt <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he himself is the real Erik Koskelainen, on Earth incognito for rest and relaxation {{in the wake of his}} interplanetary excursions.|$|R

2500|$|In the perfect, many {{languages}} generalized the -aui ending {{most frequently}} {{found in the}} first conjugation.

Radford wrote that psychological factors such as the power of suggestion and pareidolia can better explain the reported events. According to Radford, [...] "No one suggests that those who reported seeing the Miracle of the Sun—or any other miracles at Fátima or elsewhere—are lying or hoaxing. Instead, they very likely experienced what they claimed to, though that experience took place mostly in their minds." ...|$|E

He abandoned his pursuit of the two Folk and sprang up the bluff toward the rest of us, clawing at the crumbling rock and snarling as he clawed his upward way. At this awful sight, the last one of us sought refuge inside our caves. I <b>know</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> I peeped out and saw the whole bluff-side deserted, save for Saber-Tooth, who had lost his footing and was sliding and falling down.|$|E
60|$|Jukes {{remained}} indifferent, as if rendered irresponsible by {{the force}} of the hurricane, which made the very thought of action utterly vain. Besides, being very young, he had found the occupation of keeping his heart completely steeled against the worst so engrossing that he had come to feel an overpowering dislike towards any other form of activity whatever. He was not scared; he <b>knew</b> <b>this</b> <b>because,</b> firmly believing he would never see another sunrise, he remained calm in that belief.|$|R
60|$|It {{was because}} she had broken with Billy that Loretta had come visiting to Santa Clara. Billy could not understand.

Daisy <b>knew</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> it was in her arms that the weeping had been done. And Daisy's husband, Captain Kitt, knew, too. The tears of Loretta, and the comforting by Daisy, had lost him some sleep.|$|R

Many fish break away on the nine-thread. I <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> I tried it out. Fifteen of those small tuna, one after another, broke my line on the first rush.

He hated to own it, but the proof was overwhelming. She knew the power of her beauty and had treated him as a confiding fool. He was not revengeful and had been a fool, but it hurt him badly to realize that she was not what he had thought. He hardly spoke to Lucille, who came in now and then, and did not ask for Clare, as he had hitherto done. The girl did not <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>because</b> she was taking the rest she needed after a week of strain.|$|E

60|$|Morellet, one of {{the best}} known of the little group of friends and brother {{students}} at the Sorbonne, has recorded other authentic traits. Turgot, he says, united the simplicity of a child to a peculiar dignity that forced the respect of his comrades. His modesty and reserve were those of a girl, and those equivocal references in which the undisciplined animalism of youth often has a stealthy satisfaction, always called the blood to his cheeks and covered him with embarrassment. For all that, his spirit was full of a frank gaiety, and he would indulge in long bursts of laughter at a pleasantry or frolic that struck him. We may be glad to <b>know</b> <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> without express testimony to the contrary, there would have been some reason for suspecting that Turgot was defective in that most wholesome and human quality of a capacity for laughter.|$|E

He {{fell in love with her}} without reflection, instinctively--or, perhaps, because it was arranged so--I do not understand these things.

Your daughter could not live, as some women do, unshocked and cheerfully among rude and primitive peoples whose morality is not your morality, in the wilder regions of the earth. It was also evident that she could not live sumptuously in England on the interest of Â£8,000. You see what he made of it. If he died, Miss Gascoyne would be free.
