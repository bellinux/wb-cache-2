500|$|According to Mills, his housemate in 1946–47, [...] "Dodo was {{the most}} {{dedicated}} of players. He practiced {{an incredible amount of}} hours, often all day long. He wouldn't stop to eat. He would eat at the piano with one hand and keep playing with the other. He had no other interests that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of.</b> He could play forever." [...] At this time, Marmarosa did not drink or take hard drugs, but his behavior was often eccentric. Mills reported that [...] "Dodo was just a big kid [...] He never really grew up because he never allowed anything but the piano to be important to him. The piano was his life. He heard things in his head that he wasn't able to play and it frustrated him. Once, he got mad at the old upright piano we had and chopped it up with an axe." ...|$|E

Parnell told Power to his face that he was [...] "a damned scoundrel," [...] and Power made a coarse reply ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, Sub-Zero was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} character named simply Ninja, a mysterious member of [...] "the Lin Kuei, a legendary clan of Chinese ninja." [...] He wrote that inspiration came from the controversial book The Chinese Ninja Connection by Li Hsing, which [...] "posits historical evidence {{for the existence of}} the Lin Kuei and their influence on the Japanese ninja. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> there being some controversy about the author’s claims. So when we split the character in two for palette swaps, I thought it would be fitting that one was of Chinese origin and the other Japanese to kind of embody the argument." [...] Sub-Zero was then named Tundra, but the name was changed after a member of the design team saw the film The Running Man, in which the first assassin fought by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character used the name, albeit not hyphenated. Midway programmer Josh Tsui portrayed the unmasked younger Sub-Zero in the character's Mortal Kombat II ending.|$|E

2500|$|James {{recounts the}} role cricket played in his family's history, and his {{meetings}} with such early West Indian players as George John, Wilton St Hill, the great batsman George Headley and the all-rounder Learie Constantine, but {{focuses on the}} importance of the game and its players to society, specifically to colonial era Trinidad. James argues for the importance of sport in history, and refers to its roots in the Olympic Games of Ancient Greece. [...] He documents the primacy of W. G. Grace in the development of modern cricket, and the values embraced by cricket {{in the development of the}} cultures of the British Empire. He approaches cricket as an art form, as well as discussing its political impact - particularly the role of race and class in early West Indian cricket. [...] "Cricket", he writes, [...] "had plunged me into politics long before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it. When I did turn to politics, I did not have too much to learn." [...] Cricket is approached as a method of examining the formation of national culture, society in the West Indies, the United Kingdom, and Trinidad. Education, family, national culture, class, race, colonialism, and the process of decolonisation are all examined through the prism of contemporary West Indian cricket, the history of cricket, and James's life as a player of—and commentator and writer on—the sport of cricket.|$|E
2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E
