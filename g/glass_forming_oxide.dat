The basic network structure for these glasses {{is described as}} well as the positioning of tin in the network. Data suggests that the amount of phosphate present in the glass regulate the glass forming properties of tin.

40|$|International {{audience}} TiO 2 –B 2 O 3 sol–gel {{films were}} prepared using titanium(IV) isopropoxide as a Ti source and boric acid (H 3 BO 3) as B precursor. B 2 O 3 doping {{was found to}} improve the characteristics of TiO 2 films making them suitable to use as blocking TiO 2 layers in DSSC B 2 O 3 acted as a flux and <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> <b>oxide</b> leading to amorphous vitreous layers having an average thickness of 50 nm. Films were transparent, adherent and perfectly continuous without any leakage current. X-ray diffraction measurements prove that crystallinity decreases with boron content meaning that amorphous phase was favoured. Surface morphology was investigated by atomic force microscopy. It showed that film surface {{became more and more}} smooth. The Eg Raman-active phonon mode at 145 cm− 1 reveals the same arrangement of TiO 2 octahedra observed in the anatase phase. The Lorentzian multipeak fitting showed {{the emergence of a new}} mode at 152 cm− 1 whose mode intensity increased with boron content; we attributed it to the presence of boron. The influence of B 2 O 3 dopant on the optical properties was examined by UV-visible spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Refractive index, extinction coefficient and optical band gap have been extracted by fitting ellipsometric spectra with the double new amorphous model. Difference between the optical gap values obtained from UV-visible spectra and those calculated by ellipsometry did not exceed 0. 3 eV. The optical band gap increased from 3. 4 to 3. 9 eV by increasing boron content from 0 to 20 %. The increase of Eg is expected to induce an enhanced output ddp into DSSC. </p...|$|E
40|$|Understanding glass {{formation}} and predicting <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability (GFA) are vitally important {{and they are}} long-standing challenges in the metallic glasses community. Recently, a number of criteria {{have been developed to}} evaluate GFA, based mainly on fitting the experimental data of the critical cooling rate for <b>glass</b> <b>forming.</b> In this study, physically accepted boundary conditions have been imposed to evaluate the GFA criteria, and their combination with statistical analysis result in identifying the best GFA criterion useful for various <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> systems, including <b>oxide</b> <b>glasses,</b> cryoprotectants, and metallic glasses.

From the DSC studies, we have obtained the fragility parameter m which corresponds to the slopes of Arrhenius (ln Q vs. 1 / T g, were Q is the heating rate) plots, and the glass transition width Δ T g. Also, from the low-frequency Raman scattering, and in particular the boson peak intensity of the glasses at T g, we have estimated the fragility ratio r R (T g) = I min / I max whose value serves as another (empirical) fragility criterion. Finally, from high pressure Raman measurements on the glasses, we have estimated the Grüneisen parameter γ T for each glass, which constitutes the fourth fragility parameter adopted in this work. Considering the four parameters Δ T g, m, r (T g) and γ T and the generally accepted (empirical) fragility criteria, we conclude that the mixed tellurium-zinc oxides constitute strong-to-intermediate glass formers...|$|R
40|$|Incineration {{of waste}} is {{increasing}} in the UK as landfill resources diminish. Municipal waste incineration produces waste residues; bottom ash, fly ash {{and air pollution}} control (APC) residues. The present research project focuses on APC residues, which are a hazardous waste arising from cleaning of incineration flue gases. APC residues must be pre-treated before disposal at hazardous landfill or placed in permanent secure storage. The aim of this research project was to produce novel glass-ceramics from optimised combinations of waste materials to provide a stabilised, safe material of value and to provide an alternative to disposal. Pre-treatment of the APC residues by washing was necessary to remove soluble chloride phases. Electrostatic precipitator (EP) dust and soda-lime glass cullet were combined with the washed APC residues as sources of <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> <b>oxides</b> and borate. An optimised boratecontaining silicate glass was produced from the wastes, from which dense, sintered glass-ceramics and bulk glass-ceramics were successfully fabricated. A powder sintering method was used to produce a dense sintered material from washed APC residues, EP dust and glass cullet. It was determined {{that the use of}} commercially available sodium borate (Neobor®) could be used to replace the waste source of borate to produce a sintered material of equal mechanical and physical properties. The main crystalline phases of all heat treated materials were wollastonite and gehlenite. The resulting mechanical and physical properties of the glass-ceramics and sintered materials indicated they would be acceptable as construction materials. The results of the research project indicate that thermal treatment is a convenient technology for the safe utilisation of a problematic waste (APC residues from municipal waste incineration) in new products of potential commercial interest.

40|$|Glass-forming ability (GFA) is the {{easiness}} {{to vitrify}} a liquid on cooling, while glass stability (GS) is the glass resistance against devitrification on heating; {{but it is}} questionable {{if there is any}} direct relationship between these two parameters. Therefore, to test this possibility, we assess and compare GFA and several GS parameters through quantitative criteria. GFA and GS were calculated for six stoichiometric <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> <b>oxides</b> that only present surface (heterogeneous) crystallization in laboratory time scales: GeO 2, Na 2 O. 2 SiO 2, PbO. SiO 2, CaO. Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2, CaO. MgO. 2 SiO 2 and 2 MgO. 2 Al 2 O 3. 5 SiO 2; plus Li 2 O. 2 SiO 2 and Li 2 O. 2 B 2 O 3 that, in addition to surface nucleation, also present homogeneous (internal) crystallization. We gauge GFA by the critical cooling rate, q(cr), which was calculated from an estimated number of heterogeneous nucleation sites per unit surface, N-s, and from experimental crystal growth rates, u(T), assuming a detectable surface crystallized fraction X-c = 0. 001. We define GS parameters by fourteen different combinations of the following characteristic differential thermal analysis (DTA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) temperatures: the glass transition temperature (T-g), the onset crystallization temperature on heating (T-x(h)), the peak crystallization temperature on heating (T-c(h)), and the c melting point (T-m). To obtain the experimental GS parameters for each glass we carried out DSC runs using coarse and fine powders, and completed the necessary data with literature values for T-m The results for fine and coarse particles were quite similar. Most of the GS parameters that consist of three characteristic DSC temperatures show excellent correlation with GFA, however, rather poor correlations were observed for parameters that use only two characteristic temperatures. We thus demonstrated that certain, but not all GS parameters can be used to infer GFA...|$|R
40|$|A {{process is}} {{described}} for recovering fissile {{materials such as}} uranium, and plutonium, and rare earth elements, from complex waste feed material, and converting the remaining wastes into a waste glass suitable for storage or disposal. The waste feed is mixed with a dissolution <b>glass</b> <b>formed</b> of lead <b>oxide</b> and boron oxide resulting in oxidation, dehalogenation, and dissolution of metal oxides. Carbon is added to remove lead oxide, and a boron oxide fusion melt is produced. The fusion melt is essentially devoid of organic materials and halogens, and is easily and rapidly dissolved in nitric acid. After dissolution, uranium, plutonium, and rare earth elements are separated from the acid and recovered by processes such as PUREX or ion exchange. The remaining acid waste stream is vitrified to produce a waste glass suitable for storage or disposal. Potential waste feed materials include plutonium scrap and residue, miscellaneous spent nuclear fuel, and uranium fissile wastes.

40|$|Miedema’s {{approach}} has been useful in determining the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> composition range for a particular alloy system. The concept of mixing enthalpy and mismatch entropy {{can be used in}} order to quantify Inoue’s criteria of bulk metallic glass formation. In the present study, <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> composition range has been determined for different binary and ternary (Zr, Ti, Hf) –(Cu, Ni) alloys based on the mixing enthalpy and mismatch entropy calculations. Though copper and nickel appear next {{to each other in the}} periodic table, the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of the copper and nickel bearing alloys is different. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> behaviour of Zr and Hf is similar, whereas it is different from that of Ti. The smaller atomic size of Ti and the difference in the heat of mixing of Ti, Zr, Hf with Cu and Ni leads to the observed changes in the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> behaviour. Enthalpy contour plots can be used to distinguish the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> compositions on the basis of the increasing negative enthalpy of the composition. This method reveals the high <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of binary Zr–Cu, Hf–Cu, Hf–Ni systems over a narrow composition range. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} widely known that Pd-Ni-Cu-P alloy system {{possesses}} the largest <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability among the bulk metallic glasses.

However, this apparent contradiction between <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability and fragility is not unique among vitreous materials.

40|$|Glass {{formation}} is basically to avoid nucleation upon quenching. However, {{the growth of}} each nucleus is also important as certain undercooling is needed.

It is concluded that the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of a eutectic alloy system depends on the type of the eutectics, i. e. symmetric or asymmetric eutectic coupled zone. For the alloy systems with symmetric eutectic coupled zone, the best <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> alloys should be at or very close to the eutectic composition.

40|$|Formation of bulk {{metallic}} glass in quaternary Ti–Zr–Cu–Ni alloys by relatively slow cooling from the melt is reported. Thick strips of {{metallic glass}} {{were obtained by}} the method of metal mold casting. The <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of the quaternary alloys exceeds that of binary or ternary alloys containing the same elements due {{to the complexity of}} the system. The best <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> alloys such as Ti 34 Zr 11 Cu 47 Ni 8 can be cast to at least 4 -mm-thick amorphous strips. The critical cooling rate for glass formation is of the order of 250 K/s or less, at least two orders of magnitude lower than that of the best ternary alloys. The glass transition, crystallization, and melting behavior of the alloys were studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The amorphous alloys exhibit a significant undercooled liquid region between the glass transition and first crystallization event. The <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of these alloys, as determined by the critical cooling rate, exceeds what is expected based on the reduced glass transition temperature. It is also found that the <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability for alloys of similar reduced glass transition temperature can differ by two orders of magnitude as defined by critical cooling rates. The origins of the difference in <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of the alloys are discussed. It is found that when large composition redistribution accompanies crystallization, glass formation is enhanced. The excellent <b>glass</b> <b>forming</b> ability of alloys such as Ti 34 Zr 11 Cu 47 Ni 8 is a result of simultaneously minimizing the nucleation rate of the competing crystalline phases.
