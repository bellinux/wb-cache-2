Her final public engagements included planting a cross at the Field of Remembrance on 8 November 2001; a reception at the Guildhall, London, for the reformation of the 600 Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 15 November; and attending the re-commissioning of [...] on 22 November.|$|E
500|$|Robert Johnson of San Antonio Express-News praised Jackson and her {{producers}} {{for taking}} a chance on a new sound. He wrote: [...] "Under the enormous pressure of her $40 million deal with Virgin Records, Jackson had to deliver something big enough to put her {{on a first-name basis}} with the world... 'janet.' isn't perfect, but it should be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> the Queen of Pop." [...] "Dammit, Janet!," [...] marveled Melody Maker. [...] "The last Jackson hero(ine) has carried peacock feathers to the dance. Holier than Mahalia." [...] "Janet will please most people," [...] remarked The Daily Telegraph, [...] "because it is crammed with the sort of tender, joyous pop music that lingers long after smarter records have been forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} establishing Ellie's physical appearance was [...] "critical". They {{felt that she}} needed to appear young <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> relationship with Joel—who is in his 40s—believable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. A redesign of Ellie's physical appearance was publicized in May 2012; Druckmann stated that the change was to make her look more like Johnson. Prior to the redesign, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page; in June 2013, Page accused Naughty Dog of [...] "ripping off [...] likeness". The team felt that Ellie was important for the game's marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie {{from the front of the}} game's packaging to the back, [...] "everyone at Naughty Dog just flat-out refused".|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco for USA Today noted {{after the}} episode [...] "Showmance": [...] "Jessalyn Gilsig's self-centered, ridiculously strident Terri {{just needs to}} go, period." [...] Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times deemed Terri [...] "beyond annoying" [...] in the {{following}} episode, [...] "Acafellas", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented after the episode [...] "Preggers": [...] "So far, Terri has been an incredibly unlikable character. More firmly establishing her as this devilish type of schemer at least pushes her far <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> actions entertaining, even as we root against her." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Throwdown": [...] "the pregnancy subplot is dragging down the show, and tonight that subplot nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode. Terri's fake pregnancy and Quinn’s real one started out {{a few weeks ago}} as an interesting way to insert some realism and tension into a delightfully surreal musical-comedy universe. By now, however, I watch Glee and feel sorry for Jessalyn Gilsig. I’ll bet the actress didn’t initially sign on to have her character Terri become a shrill, lying nag whose main function is to bring husband Will — and by extension, us — down." ...|$|E
500|$|BuddyTV staff {{columnist}} Don Williams {{felt the}} addition of Ruby was a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, that the character distracted viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place", and that Cassidy [...] "was cast more for her looks than her acting prowess". However, he later admitted Ruby [...] "remains {{one of the more}} interesting and ambiguous evildoers on the series". Although IGN's Diana Steenbergen had looked forward to Ruby's introduction, she ultimately found the third-season incarnation a [...] "wasted" [...] character who did little to improve the series. Her main concerns consisted of Ruby's [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] qualities and her tendency to make the Winchesters [...] "look stupid". Cassidy [...] "never quite [...] " [...] the [...] "tough chick" [...] persona of Buffy the Vampire Slayers Faith or Battlestar Galacticas Six. TV Guides Tina Charles, however, liked Ruby's action-packed introduction in [...] "The Magnificent Seven". She was [...] "intrigued" [...] by the character in [...] "The Kids Are Alright", and felt Cassidy was [...] "doing a good job". Ruby made a [...] "plausible addition" [...] to [...] "Malleus Maleficarum", with Charles finding it [...] "cool" [...] to learn Ruby's backstory due to its implications for Dean's storyline. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune thought Cassidy [...] "wasn't awful" [...] in [...] "The Magnificent Seven". Though [...] "not great enough for Ackles to really play off of" [...] in [...] "Malleus Maleficarum", the actress was [...] "good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> weaker acting chops kind of work for her". While under the impression that Ruby had been killed off in [...] "No Rest for the Wicked", Peterson wrote that the character [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting" [...] and deemed her a [...] "decent traveling [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, it was {{reported}} that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year. Benjamin said of her return: [...] "I'm really looking forward to returning to EastEnders for this episode. It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented [...] "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," [...] while a spokesperson for the show added [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, [...] "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{eight days}} the bridal pair said {{farewell}} to the king, and set sail for the youth's own country, taking with them a whole shipload of treasures as the princess's dowry.

5000|$|Reviews of the EP were {{generally}} positive, with IGN stating, [...] "Calling Raven's vocals 'pop' {{is not a}} slam, as she has a strong <b>enough</b> voice <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> worthy of some attention." [...] Sixx also praised Raven, he said, [...] "I’ve written with artists as diverse as Josey from Saliva(band) to Meat Loaf and Vince Neil, but Marion is the most talented new artist I’ve worked with since I’ve been making music." ...|$|R
50|$|Corcoran's initial {{interest}} in country music involved yodelling.

5000|$|TV Guide says, [...] "As {{the doomed}} pair, Novak and Harvey are {{passable}} but {{little more than}} that. Harvey looks too old for the role and fails to give his character much life, while Novak, although making a valiant attempt, never conveys <b>enough</b> passion <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> role believable. Further denying any dramatic potential is Forbes' uninspired adaptation of Maugham's novel. Rather than probe the psychological makeup of the characters, the script consistently focuses on superficial motivations with all the emotional intensity of a high-school drama-society production." ...|$|R

Speaker Nograles also said that, [...] "It's the victim's sole and very personal decision here. The woman is old enough and intelligent <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up <b>her</b> own mind.

'Besides,' added Tom, 'there is really nothing--nothing to tell. I'm not going to commit myself. I don't know whether I ever shall.
