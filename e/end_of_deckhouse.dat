40|$|Two-beam {{deckhouse}} theory including shear deflection is developed. Estimated {{value of}} deck shear-lag factor "r " {{is included in}} the theory. The longitudinal stress distribution is obtained using the developed theory and Bleich's method. The results are compared at midship and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>deckhouse.</b> The agreement between the results at midship is reasonable. The difference between the results at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>deckhouse</b> is more distinguishable. Thesis Supervisor: Alaa E. Mansou...|$|E
50|$|In September 1981, Dr. MacInnis, {{working on}} the Canadian Coast Guard {{icebreaker}} CCGS Pierre Radisson, led a six-man team that used a remotely operated vehicle to record video and 35mm. color photographs. Chris Nicholson (Benthos) managed the remotely operated vehicle in tandem with Emory Kristoff (National Geographic). More than one thousand images revealed a debris field with the fallen mast, the ship’s copper-sheathed lower hull, and a flat-roofed deckhouse. A small cabinet on the aft <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> held a compass and signal light. Below the cabinet was the wooden steering wheel. The ship was wrapped in soft, pink coral. This expedition was documented by the CBC’s Fifth Estate in a segment hosted by Bob McKeown.|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} design, {{in addition to}} the 3-inch gun mounted forward of the bridge, there were two single 20 mm guns mounted on top of the bridge. In September 1944, as a trial, a third 20 mm gun was installed on a small elevated platform mounted on a pedestal between the bridge and the smokestack on Terebinth (AN-59), but {{it was found that the}} arc of fire was restricted, that the platform was too hot to permit the storage of ready ammunition, and that the gun crew became ill from engine fumes. Instead two additional single 20 mm guns were installed at the after <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> on AN 39-63 and 66-69. In April 1945 the four single mounts were ordered to be replaced with four twin mounts, but this change does not seem to have been made.|$|R
50|$|The {{full-length}} <b>deckhouse</b> {{is built}} <b>of</b> Georgia pine, with a similarly constructed pilothouse on top, set slightly {{back from the}} front <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse.</b> Both are sheathed with tongue-and-groove planking. Windows are sash units designed to drop into self-draining metal pockets in the bulkheads. A saloon fills the front <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse,</b> finished with oak match board. Aft of a bulkhead a companionway ladder leads to the pilothouse. The middle <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> covers the boiler and engine room spaces. The rear <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> contains the galley, provided with a Shipmate coal-burning stove. The deckhouse ends at toilets, officers to port and crew to starboard.|$|R
5000|$|Sluys ended 13 {{years in}} the Devonport reserve when she was sold to Iran in 1966. Renamed [...] she {{completed}} a three-year refit at Vosper Thornycroft at Southampton. Her profile was radically altered. She was given a new, plated foremast to carry the parabolic aerial of a Plessey AWS 1 long range search radar. A fully enclosed bridge replaced the usual [...] "open sundeck" [...] above the forward superstructure. She retained her 4.5 inch main armament, but these were now controlled by a modern radar and fire control system. Her AA armament now consisted of four single 40/60 mm guns and a quadruple Sea Cat missile launcher on the after <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a new <b>deckhouse</b> which stretched from just aft of the funnel to the quarterdeck. She commissioned in 1970 as a training ship. During 1975/6 she was refitted at Cape Town and fitted with surface-to-surface missile launchers. During a later refit {{carried out by the}} Russians, her main gunnery radar and control systems were again modernised, although she retained her original guns and the Sea Cat system was replaced by a modern Russian surface-to-air missile system. She was still in existence in the early 1990s although believed to be non-operational.|$|R
50|$|At the {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> Operation <b>Deckhouse</b> VI, the amphibious transport dock ship visited Subic Bay; Hong Kong; Okinawa, and Yokosuka, Japan, before departing the latter port on 24 March {{to return home}} to San Diego. After a three-day stop at Pearl Harbor at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the month, she arrived in San Diego on 8 April.|$|R

5000|$|Dufour Yachts {{was founded}} in 1964 by {{engineer}} and racing sailor Michel Dufour. Dufour was working at a factory that manufactured parts for locomotives near La Rochelle, France, when he realised that the fiberglass used for fabrication in the workshop he headed could be the ideal building material for boats. Shortly after, Dufour arrived at the plant with his co-worker, Francis Deschamps, and a clay model <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> <b>of</b> what {{would go on to}} be the company’s first boat, the Sylph.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was some}} {{damage to the}} superstructure. Her flying bridge had been smashed away and the {{deckhouse}} had light damage and broken windows. A canvas awning had been rigged on top <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> behind the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|In a deck-level overview, from bow to stern, the LBK had a blunt rounded prow {{directly}} behind which stood two hand winches and just further aft a hatch to the under-deck level. Within 20’ the hull had achieved its full width of 21’ The foremost section <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> contained the 17’6” servery area (approximately 16’ width), where the cooked food was portioned into containers for distribution. The middle section <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> was the 25’ the galley (approximately 16’ width). Accommodation {{for the one}} officer aft, over the engines. At deck level aft was the steering shelter which, along with the various fuel tanks, was provided with 2.5" [...] plastic armour.|$|R

60|$|The inside <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> {{was full}} <b>of</b> {{stagnant}} heat perfumed by a slight scent {{which seemed to}} emanate from the loose mass of Mrs. Travers' hair.

40|$|This {{propeller}} {{was built}} in 1925 by Earle's Shipbuilding & Engineering Company, Hull, Great Britain. She was owned by Eastern Steamship Company, Port Colborne, Ontario until 1936 when she was sold to Upper Lakes & St. Lawrence Transportation Company, Toronto, Ontario. She was sold to Jemmig Enterprises, Chatham, Ontario in 1960, becoming "H. J. McManus" in 1961. She was then sold to Tank Truck Transport, Point Edward, Ontario in 1962, becoming "Chembarge No. 4 " in 1963. She was towed to Humberstone, Ontario, in November 1961 for removal <b>of</b> <b>deckhouses</b> by Marine Salvage, and converted to barge. She developed a sulfuric acid leak from tank into bilges at Sarnia, Ontario and was towed into Lake Huron where she was scuttled in Canadian waters on July 11, 1964...|$|R
2500|$|The {{day after}} the accident, all {{that could be seen}} of the Advance was [...] "one of the masts, some planking, and a {{confused}} heap of rigging, sails, and tackle". A few scraps of wreckage and part <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> were strewn across a nearby beach.|$|R

25|$|During and {{following}} the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> World War II, the Arizona's wrecked superstructure was removed and efforts began to erect a memorial at the remaining submerged hull. The Pacific War Memorial Commission was created in 1949 to build a permanent memorial in Hawaii. Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander of the Pacific Fleet attached a flag pole to the main mast of the Arizona in 1950 and began a tradition of hoisting and lowering the flag. In that same year a temporary memorial was built above the remaining portion <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse.</b> Radford requested funds for a national memorial in 1951 and 1952 but was denied because of budget constraints during the Korean War.|$|R
500|$|Erich Steinbrinck carried five 12.7 cm SK C/34 guns {{in single}} mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top <b>of</b> the rear <b>deckhouse.</b> Her {{anti-aircraft}} armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2cm C/30 guns in single mounts.

60|$|The little portly lady waddled away, and {{a minute}} or two later Benicia rose languidly, and moved towards the {{companion}} door through which she had disappeared.

60|$|The steamer was a fast one. The day was {{pleasant}} {{with the first}} warmth of Spring, and Geoffrey sat under the lee <b>of</b> a <b>deckhouse</b> languidly enjoying a cigar and looking out across the sparkling sea. Gillow, who came up now and then for a breath of air, envied him each time he returned to pore over papers that rose and fell perplexingly on one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the saloon table. It {{was hard to get}} his scale exactly on the lines of the drawings; the sunrays that beat in through the skylights dazzled his eyes, and his sight did not become much keener after each visit to the bar. Nevertheless, few persons would have suspected English Jim of alcoholic indulgence as he jotted down weights and quantities in his pocket-book.|$|R

60|$|Jimmy {{had been}} {{prepared}} for such an emergency, {{and he was on}} deck in five minutes, fully dressed with his sea-boots and slickers on; and Aynsley joined him in the lee <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> with a pilot coat over his pajamas. The engines were turning slowly, and the rolling of the yacht and the showers of spray showed that the sea was getting up.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can well}} believe it," [...] murmured Lingard, {{and stepped out}} of the cabin, {{shutting}} the door after him gently. For half a minute, perhaps, the stillness continued, and then suddenly the chair fell over in the darkness. Next moment Mrs. Travers' head appeared {{in the light of the}} lamp left on the roof <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse.</b> Her bare arms grasped the door posts.|$|R
60|$|Lighted dimly by {{the lantern}} {{on the roof}} <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> Mrs. Travers {{remained}} very still with lowered head and an aspect of profound meditation. It lasted but an instant before she moved off and brushing against Lingard passed on with downcast eyes to her deck cabin. Lingard heard the door shut. He waited awhile, made a movement toward the gangway but checked himself and followed Mrs. Travers into her cabin.|$|R
60|$|He clawed his way out, and, as he {{hung with}} waist across the spar and both hands busy while the Tyee, flinging the spray all over her, plunged upon the long, foam-tipped roll, a big Empress liner {{came up from}} the eastward, white and majestic. She drove close by the {{schooner}} with a slow and stately dip and swing, and Jimmy Wheelock, clinging to the Tyee's reef-points, smiled somewhat curiously as he glanced up at her. Her tall side rose above him like a wall, {{and he saw the}} cluster of saloon passengers beneath the tier <b>of</b> <b>deckhouses</b> move toward the rail to gaze down upon the little dingy vessel, and the two trim officers high above them in the sunshine on the slanting bridge. That was his world--one in which steam did the hard work, and man merely pressed the telegraph handle or laid a finger on a spoke of the little steering wheel; but it was a world on which he had turned his back, and {{there was nothing to be}} gained by repining.|$|R
50|$|Ollanta had {{capacity}} for 950 tons of freight, 66 first class {{passengers on the}} upper deck <b>of</b> her <b>deckhouse</b> and 20 second class passengers in the forward part of the ship.

She was the Peruvian Corporations most luxurious steamer on the lake and the culmination of nearly 70 years development of Titicaca steamers since the building of Yavari started in 1862.|$|R
60|$|What amused him was {{to observe}} the fire which had been burning night and day before Tengga's {{residence}} suddenly extinguished. He pictured to himself the wild rush with bamboo buckets to the lagoon shore, the confusion, the hurry and jostling in a great hissing of water midst clouds of steam. The image of the fat Tengga's consternation appealed to Jorgenson's sense of humour for about five seconds. Then he took up the binoculars from the roof <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse.</b>|$|R
60|$|The bow {{drew out}} and {{lengthened}} into an increasing strip of side. Another mast became visible, {{with a double}} row <b>of</b> white <b>deckhouses</b> and a tier of boats between. Here and there a cluster of diminutive figures showed up among them, and then the great ship sped by with the whole of her size revealed. The sloop plunged madly on her screw-torn wake, but in another minute or two she had drawn away and was melting into the haze again.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, Ikaluk {{provided}} comfortable accommodation for six {{officers and}} 16 crew members in single cabins {{even when the}} ambient temperature dropped to [...] In addition, she had two six-person cabins for 12 passengers commuting between oil rigs and coastal bases.

60|$|He glanced away {{along his}} {{shoulder}} {{through the door}} <b>of</b> the <b>deckhouse</b> at the growing brightness of the day. She did so, too. It was coming. It had come! Another day! And it seemed to Mrs. Travers a worse calamity than any discovery she had made in her life, than anything she could have imagined to come to her. The very magnitude of horror steadied her, seemed to calm her agitation as some kinds of fatal drugs do before they kill. She laid a steady hand on Jorgenson's sleeve and spoke quietly, distinctly, urgently.|$|R
5000|$|During World War I {{intelligence}} reports {{suggested that the}} Germans were building {{a new class of}} cruiser which could outgun the existing C-class light cruisers.
