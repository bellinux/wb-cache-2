To resolve issues of representation, legislative <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> were implemented across the region. Although twenty years have since passed, the impact of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> is still under question. The current literature on <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> measures their impact on women’s political participation, descriptive representation, and symbolic representation.

Linnea Sandström Lange finds the book to be full of empirical insights into the efficacy of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> arguing that the rather pessimistic immediate picture painted by the studies detailed in the book should be counterbalanced by acknowledging the as yet unclear long-term effects of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas...</b>|$|R

Looking closely at the normative arguments upon which gender quotas’ adoption rests, this paper asks whether <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> can contribute to social transformation, and under which conditions. It investigates how current conceptualizations of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> narrow their scope and their potential contribution to transformative politics, and proposes some venues to articulate <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in the framework of a broader social justice project.

While a substantial literature explores the factors for the global diffusion in the adoption of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> such as who is for or against <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> for what reasons, and with what impact, little {{attention has been paid to}} the issues surrounding the holding of elections in post-conflict countries. Elections in post-conflict countries are an integral part of the process of choosing representatives, conferring legitimacy on the state, and developing democratic politics. Although United Nations peacekeeping missions provide assistance for holding elections in post-conflict countries, it is not easy to plan and hold them since these countries face many difficult and contradictory issues, which are particular to their situation. This article reviews these issues and examines the analytical perspectives that reflect the situation of post-conflict countries.

This analysis finds that <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> have a positive significance in post-conflict societies. However, since <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> are controversial, it is important and necessary to hold wide-ranging discussions to determine the most appropriate way, paying due consideration to free and fair elections among NGO and politicians. It is preferable to seek assistance from the Electoral Assistance Division of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs. The international community would need to provide assistance to formulate and facilitate these discussions. At the same time, the international community would need to demonstrate that without the women’s political participation, democracy could never be established. Further research area would be to examine the long-term impacts of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in post-conflict societies...|$|R
40|$|Once {{a country}} {{allergic}} to {{any type of}} preferential treatment or quota measure for women, France has become a country that applies <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> to regulate women's presence and representation in politics, the business sector, public bodies, public administration, and even some civil society organizations. While research has concentrated on the adoption of electoral <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in many countries and their international diffusion, few studies focus on explaining the successful diffusion of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> from politics to other domains in the same country.

We consider an Italian law which introduced <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> in local elections in 1993, and was abolished in 1995. As not all municipalities went through elections during the period the reform was in force, we can identify two groups of municipalities and use a Difference in Differences estimation to analyze {{the effect of}} <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> on the quality of elected politicians. We find that <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> are associated with a higher average number of years of schooling of elected politicians, with the effect ranging from 0. 12 to 0. 18 years of education. This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than their male colleagues, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men. The positive effect on quality is confirmed also when we measure the latter with alternative indicators of the quality of politicians, it persists in the long run and it is robust to the inclusion of political ideology. <b>gender</b> <b>quotas,</b> municipal elections, difference in differences, average years of education...|$|R

More precisely, this contribution focuses on: i) a comparative analysis of the quota rules set for the different sectors; ii) the domestic factors playing a role in the putting on the agenda and adoption of gender quotas; and iii) inter-, supra-, and transnational factors and the interplay of different political levels in the adoption of <b>gender</b> <b>quotas.</b> The analysis shows that Belgium, a traditional laggard when it comes to gender equality, imposes <b>gender</b> <b>quotas</b> by law on a broad range of sectors (elected political office, advisory committees, boards of listed and state-owned companies, and decision-making bodies in universities), turning Belgium into a world leader in <b>gender</b> <b>quotas.</b> This top-down process would not have been possible without the persistent agency of the women’s movement, especially actors embedded within the women’s branches of a certain number of political parties, and the underlying concept of citizenship – because it echoes it.
