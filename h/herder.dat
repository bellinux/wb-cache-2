5|$|Another {{interest}} of his was indology – {{one of the}} main goals of his failed expedition to be financed by Catherine II had been to reach India. He translated the Sanskrit play Shakuntala using a Latin version provided by Sir William Jones; this strongly influenced <b>Herder</b> and triggered German interest in the culture of India.|$|E
30|$|The <b>herders</b> have {{multiple}} sources of income, though mainly dependent on yak husbandry and cordyceps collection and sale. In general, 94.7 % of the <b>herders</b> consider livestock {{as a primary}} source of income and cordyceps collection and sale as a secondary {{source of income for}} their families. However, 5.3 % of <b>herders</b> consider cordyceps collection and sale as the main source of annual income. Some 67.7 % of the <b>herders</b> practise backyard farming to obtain basic agriculture products. None of the <b>herders</b> in the study area farm to sell products. Some 63 % of <b>herders</b> also collect alpine medicinal plants in small quantities for self-consumption. Occasionally, <b>herders</b> also take the opportunity to transport tourist products (food, cooking utensils, tents, personal baggage) when tourists come hiking in their areas.|$|R
30|$|In 2008, 44.5 % of Ilmotiok <b>herders</b> {{reported}} {{moving their}} cattle to Mpala vs. 25 % of Tiamamut <b>herders</b> (chi 2 [*]=[*] 14.11, p[*]<[*] 0.227), {{but the difference}} was not statistically significant. Similarly, 37 % of both Ilmotiok and Tiamamut <b>herders</b> migrated to Sukuton in 2008. Tiamamut <b>herders</b> report migration to other areas in 2008, such as Endana (12.5 %), Fois (6.25 %), and Koija (6.25 %). <b>Herders</b> in Ilmotiok do not cite using any other outside patches during this year; however, they do cite moving stock to affines or relatives in other neighbourhoods in their own group ranch to acquire grazing access (Lorubay or Naserian). <b>Herders</b> who moved their stock to Mpala (Tiamamut) during this period behaved in accordance with our prediction based on ecological factors.|$|R

5|$|Some English {{surnames}} {{from the}} Middle Ages name animals. These have different origins. Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are metonyms for a swineherd, while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an oxherd and Shepherd (1279 onwards) means {{as it sounds}} a <b>herder</b> of sheep.|$|E
5|$|The Khoikhoi herders {{produced}} the geometric imagery, probably depicting <b>herder</b> groups. They {{are also the}} creators of the more worldly indentations in that area that served as grinding hollows and game boards. Some of the stones bear marks from use as gong stones; they make unusual sounds when hit.|$|E
5|$|The {{legends of}} Krishna's {{childhood}} and youth {{describe him as}} a cow <b>herder,</b> a mischievous boy whose pranks earns him the nickname a Makhan Chor (butter thief), and a protector who steals {{the hearts of the}} people in both Gokul and Vrindavana. The texts state, for example, that Krishna lifts the Govardhana hill to protect the inhabitants of Vrindavana from devastating rains and floods.|$|E
40|$|In mobile pastoralism, {{strategies}} of mobility are highly heterogeneous within communities; some <b>herders</b> are frequently mobile {{and others are}} not. Moreover, pastoral mobility changes over time, especially after external intervention. Although changes in the {{strategies of}} <b>herders</b> affect and are affected by other <b>herders,</b> the interactions between <b>herders</b> with different strategies {{and the effect of}} changes in the external environment on their strategies have not been explicitly studied. We examined such interactions with a multi-agent model, simulating the herders' basic decision-making process, simplified rangeland ecosystem, and animal survival. The results showed clear co-existence of wealthy and poor <b>herders</b> at an intermediate cost of moving. The movement pattern revealed that an indirect interaction between wealthy and poor <b>herders</b> was the key to their co-existence, suggesting that very simple rules of pastoral mobility inherently contain a mechanism for the co-existence of wealthy and poor <b>herders.</b> At an intermediate cost of moving, the two groups have access to different pastures, thus reducing direct competition for poor <b>herders</b> and enabling their survival in drought years. Such interaction between <b>herders</b> suggests that any interventions in mobile pastoralist societies should take into account that impacts on the mobility of any one group can influence the entire social structure.

50|$|Conflict between {{livestock}} <b>herders</b> and cheetahs is also {{threatening the}} population outside protected areas. Several <b>herders</b> killed cheetahs to prevent livestock loss, or for trophies, trade and fun. Some <b>herders</b> {{are accompanied by}} large mastiff-type dogs into protected areas. These dogs killed five cheetahs between 2013 and 2016.|$|R
30|$|In 2010, {{there are}} again {{significant}} differences between group ranches regarding migration behaviour (Ilmotiok vs. Tiamamut; chi 2 [*]=[*] 15.023, p[*]<[*] 0.020). First of all, the number of locations that <b>herders</b> report migrating to with their livestock is significantly reduced from 2009 to 2010 (23 vs. 7, respectively). Here the majority of Ilmotiok <b>herders</b> report moving livestock back to their home patch (37 %), to Ngabolo (36 %), or to Sukuton (18 %). In contrast, 31 % of Tiamamut <b>herders</b> report moving to Fois, 16 % to Ivan’s farm, 39 % to Sukuton, and 8 % to Ngabolo and Tiamamut. Note that only 8 % of Tiamamut <b>herders</b> report returning livestock to their home patch vs. 37 % of Ilmotiok <b>herders.</b> Here Ilmotiok <b>herders</b> are making very good decisions based on our predictions by moving their stock to Ngabolo, but not by moving them to Sukuton. Similarly, <b>herders</b> from Tiamamut are making good decisions by migrating to Fois, which is next to Segera-Endana and Ivan’s, which is next to Mpala.|$|R
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep <b>herder</b> in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Enlightenment histories, {{which have been}} seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von <b>Herder</b> in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} versions of Krishna's life story, of which three are most studied: the Harivamsa, the Bhagavata Purana, and the Vishnu Purana. They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their specifics, details, and styles. The most original composition, the Harivamsa is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's {{life as a}} poor <b>herder</b> but weaves in poetic and allusive fantasy. It ends on a triumphal note, not {{with the death of}} Krishna. Differing in some details, the fifth book of the Vishnu Purana moves away from Harivamsa realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies. The Vishnu Purana manuscripts exist in many versions.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} Ilaria Tani {{examines}} {{the notion of}} Besonnenheit, introduced in the second chapter of <b>Herder's</b> Abhandlung über den Ursprung der Sprache (1772). Coming from pietistic vocaboulary, this notion constitutes a key-word in <b>Herder's</b> remarks about the links between language and sensibility and an essential reference for the debate between representationism and espressivism in <b>Herder's</b> thought...|$|R
30|$|Our {{findings}} show that the two regions of Choekhortoe and Dhur reported different depredation rates, which also indicates that the reduction in livestock population may be partly influenced by peoples’ access to better alternative economic opportunities, which is also recommended for further study. Livestock intensification programmes, including pasture improvement and financial compensation, may be a potential short-term solution to reduce conflict between <b>herders</b> and predators. Issuing permits for cordyceps collection only to the local <b>herders</b> and instilling the sense of stewardship to highland <b>herders</b> may reduce the conflicts between wild predators and <b>herders.</b> This is because with more income, <b>herders</b> could plan and improve their herding practices so as to better protect their livestock from wild predators, if the competition with outsiders for cordyceps collection can be reduced. Getting additional financial sources may help the <b>herders</b> improve their guarding practices through building proper herd and corral facilities.|$|R
30|$|Pastoralists {{working on}} the private ranch contended with strict herding conventions. Of {{importance}} to respondents was that ranch managers made all decisions independent of <b>herders,</b> including where and when to move herds, where and when to graze livestock, and when to treat for ticks or other diseases. While <b>herders</b> had decision-making roles in, for example, choosing exact routes to take to reach grazing areas prescribed by managers, they noted that this amounted to little autonomy. In cases where <b>herders</b> were resistant to managers’ instructions, reasons were practical. Often <b>herders</b> were instructed to graze livestock in areas known for high wildlife density, for example, and <b>herders</b> rarely felt that the risks were worthwhile. Given that employees were animal caretakers rather than owners, <b>herders</b> unanimously {{felt that there was}} little incentive to risk injury or death to graze in wildlife-rich areas, even if those areas held more nutritious or abundant grasses.|$|R
5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and <b>herder</b> culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
5|$|In 1778, {{he went to}} Germany to take a {{teaching}} position as a Natural History professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel, where he met Therese Heyne, the daughter of classicist Christian Gottlob Heyne. She later {{became one of the}} first independent female writers in Germany. They married in 1785 (which was after he left Kassel) and had three children, but their marriage was not happy. From his time in Kassel on, Forster actively corresponded with important figures of the Enlightenment, including Lessing, <b>Herder,</b> Wieland and Goethe. He also initiated cooperation between the Carolinum in Kassel and the University of Göttingen where his friend Georg Christoph Lichtenberg worked. Together, they founded and published the scientific and literary journal Göttingisches Magazin der Wissenschaften und Litteratur. Forster's closest friend, Samuel Thomas von Sömmering, arrived in Kassel shortly after Forster, and both were soon involved with the Rosicrucians in Kassel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century, René Descartes' {{mechanical}} philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine, a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution. Between 1650 and 1800, some naturalists, such as Benoît de Maillet, produced theories that maintained that the universe, the Earth, and life, had developed mechanically, without divine guidance. In contrast, most contemporary theories of evolution, such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried <b>Herder,</b> regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground. He wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over the course of many generations, producing races and even new species, a description that anticipated in general terms the concept of natural selection.|$|E

If multiple, overlapping claims to reindeer are m be found in Chukotka 3 {{they are less likely to}} occur among the <b>herders</b> themselves than between the <b>herders</b> and the state. In the former Soviet Union as well as in post-Soviet Russia, reindeer <b>herders</b> in Chukotka have competed with state agencies for ownership and control of individual reindeer, and have come out the losers...|$|R

30|$|TAPs use grazing {{resources}} {{commonly referred}} to as Tsamdros in the local language, with usufructory rights; <b>herders</b> do not own the land. During the interviews with the <b>herders,</b> it emerged that Tsamdro user rights (which many <b>herders</b> until recently assumed as exclusive private ownership) exists in three forms: private use, joint ownership between a couple of households and communal holdings.|$|R
5|$|Like Yellowstone National Park before it, Yosemite National Park was {{at first}} {{administered}} by various units of the United States Army. Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19, 1891, and set up Camp A.E. Wood (now the Wawona Campground) in Wawona. Each summer, 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park. Approximately 100,000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite's high meadows each year. The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders, but instead escorted them several days' hike from their flock, which left the sheep vulnerable. By the late 1890s sheep grazing {{was no longer a}} problem, but at least one <b>herder</b> continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi {{was born}} near Qasr Abu Hadi, {{a rural area}} outside the town of Sirte in the deserts of Tripolitania, western Libya. His family came from a small, {{relatively}} uninfluential tribal group called the Qadhadhfa, who were Arabized Berber in heritage. His mother was named Aisha (died 1978), and his father, Mohammad Abdul Salam bin Hamed bin Mohammad, was known as Abu Meniar (died 1985); the latter earned a meagre subsistence as a goat and camel <b>herder.</b> Nomadic Bedouins were illiterate and kept no birth records. As such, Gaddafi's date of birth is not known with certainty, and sources have set it in 1942 or {{in the spring of}} 1943, although his biographers David Blundy and Andrew Lycett noted {{that it could have been}} pre-1940. His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters. Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli {{traveled}} through Europe in the retinue of the Lubomirski family, including Izabela, {{and as a}} tutor of young Henryk Lubomirski. During that time he developed extensive contacts at various European courts in Courland, Austria (Vienna), Italy (Turin) and France (Paris). During his three-year stay in the Lubomirskis' Parisian residence, he was in touch with many important men of the Age of Enlightenment. He met—often through another Florentinian, Filippo Mazzei—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette, Luigi Landriani, Girolamo Lucchesini, and the Marquis de Condorcet. He also corresponded with J. G. <b>Herder.</b> In Poland, he developed close contacts with Ignacy Potocki and Julian Ursyn Niemcewicza. From 1787 he also tutored Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, later an important politician in the Russian Empire, on whom Piattoli would retain significant influence.|$|E
40|$|Goat {{husbandry}} is {{the main}} rural livelihood in the northern Patagonian steppe of Argentina, and <b>herders</b> kill any carnivore that they believe threatens their herds, including the endangered Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita). We evaluated the use of local, mediumsized, mixed-breed guarding dogs to reduce predation and retaliatory killing of carnivores. We interviewed 64 <b>herders,</b> and delivered 37 puppies to 25 <b>herders.</b> Most economic loss was attributed to cougars (Puma concolor) and culpeos (Lycalopex culpaeus). All <b>herders</b> with dogs that reached the working stage reported reduced rates of predation, and 88 % reported {{that they no longer}} kill carnivores. Among <b>herders</b> who were not using dogs, 89 % of them reported increased predation, and 100 % of them confirmed that they kill carnivores. Mixedbreed dogs can be effective in reducing both predation losses and retaliatory killing, but their success depends on the ability and willingness of <b>herders</b> to train and use them properly...|$|R
30|$|Instead, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of hired <b>herders,</b> herding was a technocratic activity, where landowners relied on technology and protocols for instructing <b>herders</b> on how to do their work. Landowners utilized highly mechanized infrastructure for weekly cattle ‘dips’ to prevent livestock from acquiring diseases, mobile bomas for ease of transport, radios assigned to boma ‘headmen’ to communicate herding locations throughout the day, and cell phones among long-term <b>herders</b> to confirm daily movements. Rather than relying on flexible resource-use patterns (Galvin 2009), <b>herders</b> were constrained to highly regulated movements, modes of communications, and top-down rules that rarely incorporated employees’ opinions or choices. Though some <b>herders</b> reported that these regulations made herding ‘easier’, <b>herders</b> generally agreed that they were also a constant source of conflict among employees and managers. <b>Herders</b> noted the hierarchies of management and of tools to manage were more challenging than the job itself: ‘Some people, you know when you are managing people, there is a big problem. Some people [herdsmen] come in shouting….’ Conflicting opinions and strict rules about herding decisions were frequently cited as reasons for employee termination and for frequent ‘Temporary Hires’.|$|R

5|$|Scottish {{artists in}} the later eighteenth century were {{strongly}} influenced by the Enlightenment, which stressed rationalism and human inquiry, of which Scotland was a major centre of influence. Artists like Alan Ramsey formed The Select Society, with philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith and produced his Dialogue on Taste, which made a major contribution {{to the study of}} aesthetics. Scotland also played a major part in the origins of the Romantic movement through the publication of James Macpherson's Ossian cycle, which was proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work to bring about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, influencing <b>Herder</b> and Goethe.|$|E
5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow <b>herder</b> playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|Although Scotland {{increasingly}} {{adopted the}} English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct {{national identity and}} began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form. James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation, claiming to have found poetry written by Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal written in 1762 was speedily translated into many European languages, and its deep appreciation of natural beauty and the melancholy tenderness of its treatment of the ancient legend did more than any single work {{to bring about the}} Romantic movement in European, and especially in German, literature, influencing <b>Herder</b> and Goethe. Eventually {{it became clear that the}} poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, in 2011, <b>herders</b> {{continue}} to report herd migrations, but once again, {{the number of}} sites listed as being used is reduced from seven to five.
