The {{aim of this study}} was to identify determinants for change in perceived disability, as measured with the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain after rehabilitation. Methods: Data were gathered for 84 outpatients. Psychophysical capacity (psychophysical static leg lift, psychophysical static trunk <b>lift,</b> and psychophysical <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> capacity), physical lifting capacity, perceived lifting effort, aerobic capacity and RMDQ were assessed. Associations between change in RMDQ and potential determinants were calculated. Variables associated with change in RMDQ were entered in a multivariate linear regression analysis (backward).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the intra- and interrater reliability of tests from the Ergo-Kit (EK) functional capacity evaluation method in adults without musculoskeletal complaints. DESIGN: Within-subjects design. SETTING: Academic {{medical center in}} The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven subjects without musculoskeletal complaints (15 men, 12 women). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven EK tests (2 isometric, 3 <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting,</b> 2 manipulation tests) were each assessed 3 times (over 4 days), twice by 1 rater (R 1) and once by another rater (R 2). Intrarater reliability was calculated using the EK test scores assessed by R 1. Interrater reliability was calculated using the EK test scores assessed by both raters. Counterbalancing the rater order made possible the calculation of 2 interrater reliability levels (at time intervals of 4 and 8 d). All reliability levels were expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Intrarater and interrater reliability (8 -d time interval) was high (ICC, >. 80) for the isometric lifting tests, moderate (ICC range,. 50 -. 80) for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> tests, and low (ICC,. 80), and it was moderate (ICC range,. 50 -. 80) for both manipulation tests.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{flexible}} approach for the efficient computation of the mixed volume of a tuple of polytopes. In order to compute the mixed volume, a mixed subdivision of the tuple of polytopes is needed, which can be obtained by embedding the polytopes in a higher-dimensional space, i. e., by <b>lifting</b> them. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> is opposed to the static approach. This means that one considers one point at a time and only fixes the value of the lifting function when the point really influences the mixed volume. Conservative lifting functions have been developed for this purpose. This provides us with a deterministic manipulation of the lifting for computing mixed volumes, which rules out randomness conditions. Cost estimates for the algorithm are given. The implications of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> on polyhedral homotopy methods for the solution of polynomial systems are investigated and applications are presented. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{stability}} {{has been}} characterized in static but not in dynamic movements. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether movement pace and direction of dynamic trunk flexion influence the control of spinal stability. Twenty healthy subjects performed <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> movements at 20 and 40 cycles per minute. Lyapunov exponents were calculated from the measured trunk kinematics to estimate stability. Complexity of torso dynamics required at least five embedded dimensions thereby indicating that torso dynamics requires more than the 3 -dimensions of movement for sufficient characterization. Dynamic stability is was greater in slow lifting movement than in fast movements. Asymmetric movements demonstrated greater multi-dimensional kinematic divergence than asymmetric movements. This indicates that the sagittal plane of movement may not be a principle dynamic axis of torso movement.

2500|$|On 13 July 1908 the airship was reinflated {{with fresh}} {{hydrogen}} to ensure maximum lift for the planned 24-hour endurance trial, {{which was to}} be a return flight to Mainz. Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed {{until the end of the}} month. [...] The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31hours of flight. The flight to Zürich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. [...] Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the relief valves as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ4 was only being kept in the air by <b>dynamic</b> <b>lift</b> generated by flying with a nose-up attitude, the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, [...] short of Mainz. [...] All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about [...] and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untertürkheim. Accordingly, LZ4 was set down at 7:51 am at Echterdingen.|$|E

The aim of the current study was to quantify the effect of laterally slanted ground surfaces on the biomechanical response. Ten subjects performed both isometric weight-holding tasks and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> exertions (both using a 40 % of max load) while standing on a platform that was laterally tilted at 0, 10, 20 and 30 ° from horizontal. As the subject performed the isometric exertions, the electromyographic (EMG) activity of trunk extensors and knee extensors were collected and during the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks the whole body kinematics were collected. The whole body kinematics data were used in a dynamic biomechanical model to calculate the time-dependent moment about L 5 /S 1 and the time-dependent lateral forces acting on the body segments.

For most body segments, the estimated trajectories of segment Euler angles have less than 5 ° RMSE (in each dimension) with 5 -point cubic spline interpolation when there is no measurement error of interpolation points. Sensitivity analysis indicates that when the measurement error exists, the root mean square error (RMSE) of estimated trajectories increases. Comparison among different lifting conditions showed that lifting a load from a high initial position yielded a smaller RMSE than lifting from a low initial position.

The one existing approach is too expensive in practice because of the usage of recursive liftings of the given point configuration. Instead, we define a single lifting which yields the desired count and defines a homotopy continuation for computing all solutions.
