5|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2015, {{when it was}} revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that <b>her</b> <b>use</b> of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E
5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. <b>Her</b> <b>use</b> of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E
5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and <b>her</b> <b>use</b> of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Edward and Wallis Simpson blossomed at Fort Belvedere; the couple spent their first {{weekend at the}} fort {{at the end of}} January 1932, and by early 1935 two rooms had been combined at the fort for <b>her</b> <b>use.</b> Notable interior decorators to work on the fort under Edward included Sybil Colefax, Lady Mendl, Maison Jansen, and Herman Schrijver. Edward and Wallis entertained most weekends at the house; guests present included 'courtiers and diplomats, American men of affairs and English Society, garnished with a sprinkling of statesmen, soldiers and sailors'. Giles Gilbert Scott added a guest wing to the fort after Edward's accession as king in 1936. In 1936 Wallis moved permanently to the fort after receiving threatening anonymous letters, and left Fort Belvedere for the final time on 3 December 1936, a week before Edward's abdication.|$|E
5|$|Because of his father's {{success in}} {{business}} and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides {{being one of the}} leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from her own father, and King Kamehameha III had granted <b>her</b> <b>use</b> of the ahupuaʻa of Hilo after her marriage. During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of ancient Hawaiian royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after Pitman sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956. In the 1850s the family moved to the capital of Honolulu where Benjamin Pitman took up banking and built a beautiful two-story house that he named Waialeale ("rippling water") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that <b>her</b> <b>use</b> of loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He {{also felt that}} Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade an effort by the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
50|$|Ritsuko Okazaki {{was born}} in Hashima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture on 29 December 1959. She was born left-handed. During her childhood, she was forced by <b>her</b> mother to <b>use</b> <b>her</b> right hand. However, after hearing that it was bad to force <b>her</b> to <b>use</b> <b>her</b> right hand, her mother quickly advised <b>her</b> to <b>use</b> <b>her</b> natural hand.

5|$|The Book of Household Management {{has been}} edited, revised and {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly <b>her</b> <b>use</b> of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|The eldest {{daughter}} of Charles Wintour, {{editor of the}} London Evening Standard (1959–76), her father consulted her {{on how to make}} the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the US, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned to London and was the editor of British Vogue between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. <b>Her</b> <b>use</b> of the magazine to shape the fashion industry {{has been the subject of}} debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.|$|E

In response, Clinton has said that <b>her</b> <b>use</b> of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts, though not their own private email servers.|$|E
