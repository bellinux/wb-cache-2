40|$|Gelatin {{microspheres}} are {{well-known for}} {{their capacity to}} release growth factors in a controlled manner, but gelatin microspheres do not calcify {{in the absence of}} so-called bioactive substances that induce deposition of calcium phosphate (CaP) bone mineral. This study has investigated if CaP nanocrystals can be incorporated into gelatin microspheres to render these inert microspheres bioactive without compromising the drug releasing properties of gelatin microspheres. Incorporation of CaP nanocrystals into gelatin microspheres resulted into reduced biodegradation and drug release rates, whereas their calcifying capacity increased strongly compared to <b>inert</b> <b>gelatin</b> microspheres. The reduced drug release rate was correlated to the reduced degradation rate as caused by a physical cross-linking effect of CaP nanocrystals dispersed in the gelatin matrix. Consequently, these composite microspheres combine beneficial drug-releasing properties of organic gelatin with the calcifying capacity of a dispersed CaP phase...|$|E
40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{characteristic of}} the enzymatic oxidation of ascorbic acid by highly purified preparations of ascorbic acid oxidase, is the pronounced inactivation of the enzyme that occurs {{during the course of}} the reaction (1). It is the purpose of this communication to present data showing that the enzyme inactivation occurring during the reaction, is due to causes which, for the purposes of discussion and clarification, may be divided into two categories: (1) Inactivation due to environmental conditions during the reaction; i. e., pH, substrate concentration, dilution, rate of shaking, etc., and (2) inactivation due to some factor inherent in the ascorbic acid-ascorbic acid oxidase-oxygen reaction. The first type of inactivation may be minimized by the use of the <b>inert</b> protein <b>gelatin</b> in the enzyme dilution under a prescribed set of environmental conditions (1). The second type of inactivation is not minimized to any great extent by the use of added gelatin. The groundwork for a study of the latter type of inactivation of ascorbic acid oxidase was laid by Steinman and Dawson (2), when they reported that catalase, peroxidase, and methemoglobin markedly protect ascorbi...|$|R
