5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is <b>hatched,</b> the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly <b>hatched</b> chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs <b>hatched,</b> and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan <b>hatched</b> 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators.

40|$|Accelerated <b>hatching</b> {{is one of}} few defences {{available}} to embryos, and is effective against many egg-stage risks. We present the first analysis of genetic variation in <b>hatching</b> plasticity, examining premature <b>hatching</b> of American toad embryos in response to pathogenic water moulds. We reared eggs from half- and full-sib families in the presence and absence of water mould. <b>Hatching</b> age and hatchling size showed low cross-environment genetic correlations, suggesting that early-induced <b>hatching</b> can evolve largely independently of spontaneous <b>hatching.</b> We found less phenotypic and additive genetic variation for early-induced <b>hatching</b> than spontaneous <b>hatching,</b> and a stronger correlation between egg and induced hatchling sizes. Directional selection by the pathogen may have eroded variation in early-induced <b>hatching,</b> pushing it against the constraint of <b>hatching</b> gland development. Later <b>hatching</b> has a second, muscular component. This pattern of variation may characterize defences based on developmental transitions, although other inducible defences show more variation in induced phenotypes. © 2008 The Authors.

40|$|ABSTRACT Within certain {{limitations}} of timing, embryos {{of one of}} the two species, Bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) and Japanese quail (Cotumix cotumix japonica), influ-enced the <b>hatching</b> time of embryos of the other species when embryonating eggs of the two species were in contact during the latter stages of incubation. When the expected <b>hatching</b> time of Bobwhite quail was approximately three days later than that of Japanese quail, neither species exerted a significant influence over the <b>hatching</b> time of the other. Virtual synchroniza-tion of <b>hatching</b> time was achieved when Japanese quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> approxi-mately two days ahead of Bobwhite quail and was accomplished by a significant speeding-up of <b>hatching</b> time of the Bobwhite quail coupled with a significant retarding of <b>hatching</b> time of the Japanese quail. Synchronization occurred where Japanese quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> approximately one day ahead of Bobwhite quail; however, in this case, the synchronization was achieved solely by a significant retarding of <b>hatching</b> time of the Japanese quail. When eggs of the two species were set at such a time that they were expected to <b>hatch</b> at approximately the same time, synchronization of <b>hatching</b> time was easily achieved. Where Bobwhite quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> approximately one day ahead of Japanese quail, sycnhronization of <b>hatching</b> time was not achieved even though <b>hatching</b> time of the Japanese quail was sig-nificantly speeded-up. Where Bobwhite quail were expected to <b>hatch</b> two days ahead of Japanese quail, neither species exerted a significant influence over the <b>hatching</b> time of the other...|$|R
5|$|A <b>hatch</b> or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow <b>hatches</b> to be opened and closed are called <b>hatch</b> cover. In general, <b>hatch</b> covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, <b>hatches</b> must be large, but large <b>hatches</b> present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the <b>hatches,</b> and these areas must be reinforced. Often, <b>hatch</b> areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hatching</b> {{care has}} been {{reported}} for many taxonomic groups, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The sophisticated care that occurs around <b>hatching</b> time {{is expected to have}} an adaptive function supporting the feeble young. However, details of the characteristics of the adaptive function of <b>hatching</b> care remain unclear. This study investigated the <b>hatching</b> care of the subsocial shield bug, Parastrachia japonensis (Heteroptera: Parastrachiidae) to verify its function. Results show that the P. japonensis mothers vibrated the egg mass intermittently while maintaining an egg-guarding posture. Then embryos started to emerge from their shells synchronously. Unlike such behaviors of closely related species, this vibrating behavior was faint, but lasted more than 6 h. To investigate the effect of this behavior on <b>hatching</b> synchrony and <b>hatching</b> success, we observed the <b>hatching</b> pattern and the <b>hatching</b> rate in control, mother-removed, and two artificial vibration groups. Control broods experienced continuous guarding from the mother. Intermittent artificial vibration broods were exposed to vibrations that matched the temporal pattern of maternal vibration produced by a motor. They showed synchronous <b>hatching</b> patterns and high <b>hatching</b> rates. However, for mother-removed broods, which were isolated from the mother, and when we provided continuous artificial vibration that did not match the temporal pattern of the maternal vibration, embryo <b>hatching</b> was not only asynchronous: some embryos failed to emerge from their shells. These results lead us to infer that <b>hatching</b> care in P. japonensis has two functions: <b>hatching</b> regulation and <b>hatching</b> assistance. Nevertheless, severa...|$|R

5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly <b>hatched</b> chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have <b>hatched.</b> The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E
40|$|Eggs of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and ring-necked {{pheasants}} (Phasianus colchicus) were incubated in clutches {{arranged to}} stimulate embryos to <b>hatch</b> earlier or later than normal. This manipulation of <b>hatching</b> time {{was achieved by}} combining eggs of different age in the same clutch. To ensure <b>hatching</b> synchrony, embryos {{communicate with each other}} during the last stage of incubation, resulting in either a delay or an acceleration of <b>hatching.</b> Embryos of both species that accelerated their <b>hatching</b> time suffered a higher mortality rate after <b>hatching.</b> Combining mortality with the proportion of hatchlings that suffered from leg deformities, impeding their movements, resulted in a cost also to pheasant chicks delaying their <b>hatching.</b> Chicks of both species accelerating <b>hatching</b> time had a lower minimum mass and a shorter tarsus length than control chicks, whereas chicks delaying <b>hatching</b> time either grew as well or slightly better than control chicks. Mallard chicks had better balance and mobility immediately after <b>hatching</b> the longer they stayed in the egg. This indicates that the period immediately before <b>hatching,</b> is an important period for muscular and organ maturity. Reducing this period results in costs affecting post-hatching survival. The strategy to assure synchronous <b>hatching</b> in mallards and pheasants probably reflect a trade-off between the negative effects of shifting the age at <b>hatching</b> away from normal and differences in predation risk during different stages of reproduction...|$|R
