40|$|For {{experiments}} on mechanical products composed of several components, {{such as a}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> conventional methods of designing and implementing factorial experiments can be impractical because of the prohibitive costs of obtaining certain components with factors set to prespecified values. A further difficulty is that often some {{of the factors that}} are believed to influence the product's performance are not features of a single component but are derived as functions of the dimensions of several components arising from the product's assembly. Experiments are proposed which use a sample of measured components to explore the influence of such derived factors. An algorithmic method for obtaining efficient designs is presented and applied to finding plans for studies on the gear pump. An experiment on the pump is described which involved both conventional and derived factors. This experiment led to new knowledge on how to improve the engineering design of the pump and, in particular, on how to improve its robustness to the varying pressures that are experienced in operation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{the issue}} of machine {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis {{as a part of}} maintenance system became global due to the potential advantages to be gained from reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and increased machine availability. The aim of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of a new fault diagnosis method based on power spectral density (PSD) of vibration signals in combination with decision trees and fuzzy inference system (FIS). To this end, a series of studies was conducted on an external <b>gear</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump.</b> After a test under normal condition, a number of different machine defect conditions were introduced for three working levels of pump speed (1000, 1500, and 2000 rpm), corresponding to (i) Journal-bearing with inner face wear (BIFW), (ii) Gear with tooth face wear (GTFW), and (iii) Journal-bearing with inner face wear plus Gear with tooth face wear (B&GW).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a problem of vibration-based {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis of pumps used in the tractor steering system. The vibration-based machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis incorporate a number of machinery fault detection and diagnostic techniques. The vibration signal from a piezoelectric transducer was captured for the following conditions: Normal pump (GOOD), Journal-bearing with inner face wear (BIFW), gear with tooth face wear (GTFW), and Journal-bearing with inner face wear plus gear with tooth face wear (G&BW) for three working levels of pump speed (1000, 1500, and 2000 rpm). Then Power Spectral Density (PSD) of vibration spectra was calculated. According to the results, fault diagnosis of hydraulic pump is a difficult task using spectrum of vibration signals alone.

40|$|External spur <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{exceedingly}} useful {{components in}} common hydraulic systems. The main issue with external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is that all}} current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the <b>gears</b> inside the <b>pump,</b> a set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of a variable displacement <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> will allow a more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the <b>gears</b> inside the <b>pump.</b> More specifically, changing the timing of the gears’ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gears’ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process. This includes the design of new gears, bearing blocks, and additional hydraulics for use in a modified existing commercial pump. Simulations have shown the implementation of the design allowed for a 67 % reduction in displacement, and thus successful introduction of variable displacement into an external <b>gear</b> <b>pump.</b> Additional {{research is needed to determine}} the optimal designs for the actuation system and variable displacement concept used in the <b>gear</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>pumps</b> (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic <b>pump</b> types (<b>gear,</b> vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the <b>pump</b> housing. Some <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>pump,</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
