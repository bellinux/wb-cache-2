40|$|The {{finite element}} model of the seat rail is {{established}} with a spring-damping element to simulate {{the ball in the}} rail <b>joint</b> <b>part.</b> The stiffness and damping parameters of the <b>joint</b> <b>part</b> are determined by the combination of finite element method and experiment. Firstly, the natural frequencies and modes of the guide rail are obtained by modal experiment. The stiffness of the spring-damping element is optimized in the finite element software to make the natural frequencies and modes of the system consistent with the experimental ones. Secondly, the dynamic response curve of the key nodes is obtained through sweeping experiment, and the damping of the spring-damping element is optimized in the finite element software to make the nodal response of the system output consistent with the experiment. Then, the gap of the <b>joint</b> <b>part</b> of the car seat rail is studied considering the factors of load and structure randomness. The influence factors of the gap are selected by Hammersley experimental design method. The results show that the gap is normally distributed, and therefore the confidence interval of the gap is obtained.

40|$|In our {{previous}} study, the evaluation {{system for the}} finger–jointed laminae was constructed. This system was composed of three parts. The first part is the motive power part for the hydraulic pomp and cylinder. The second part is the AE measurement part. The third part is the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. In this study, the optimum condition needed in the evaluating test with this evaluation system was examined. In addition, {{the effects of the}} temperature and the open assembly time in finger jointing on the strength properties of the finger–jointed laminae with this evaluate system were examined. The main results are summarized as follows: The peak in the waveform of AE signals obtained by the evaluation system was recognized in the laminae with starved joint. The peak and the starved <b>joint</b> <b>part</b> were corresponded. In evaluation test of the finger–jointed laminae with this system, the necessary conditions set in this test were the deflection and the feed speed, and these optimum conditions were 3 mm and high speed (480 mm/s), respectively. The strength properties of the finger–jointed laminae with the open assembly time showed the tendency to decrease with higher the temperature in jointing. Therefore, {{it became clear that the}} high temperature in jointing was the condition that the starved <b>joint</b> <b>part</b> was caused. The MOE and MOR of the finger–jointed laminae showed the tendency to decrease with increasing the maximum value of the AE accumulated signal. Thus, it was clear that there was a high correlation between the maximum value and the strength properties. Therefore, this evaluation system was promising for the detection of the difference of the bonding performance caused by the influence of bonding conditions such as the temperature and the open assembly time in jointing...|$|E
