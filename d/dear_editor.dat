40|$|Decreased {{levels of}} plasma BDNF in first-episode {{schizophrenia}} and bipolar disorder patients <b>Dear</b> <b>Editors,</b> Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), {{the most abundant}} neurotrophin in the brain, promotes the growth and maintenance of intercellular connections, serves as a neurotransmitter modulator, and participates in plasticity mechanisms, such as long-term potentiation and learning (Shoval and Weizman, 2005). Consequently, abnormal BDNF signaling can influence neuronal differentiation and synaptic function leading to altered brain development and functioning. The ability of BDNF to cross the blood–brain barrier (Pan et al., 1998) suggests that blood serum BDNF levels may reflect BDNF levels in the brain. However...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Editors,</b> Proving that a {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) mutation is pathogenic is not {{a trivial}} task because mtDNA is highly polymorphic and some seeming polymorphism may be introduced through the sequencing process or incomplete digestion with restriction enzymes as an artifact. Several criteria assist in deciding whether a novel base change is pathogenic (Chinnery and Schon, 2003; DiMauro and Schon, 2001). Among these criteria, mutation in heteroplasmic state could easily be misused. The recent claim that a mitochondrial mutation associated with schizophrenia (Marchbanks et al., 2003) constituted such a case and should be received with some scepticism, especially in view {{of a number of}} published pitfalls where polymorphism...|$|R

We are glad that they agree, from their behavioural perspective, with our detailed physiological analysis, that keeping mice at 30 °C to achieve this aim, as has recently been advocated, is ‘unwise’. We do, however, take issue with several of their arguments, in particular the suggestion that we stated ‘mice are most comfortable at 20 – 22 °C’, that our arguments are ‘empirically incorrect, obfuscating and highly detrimental {{to the welfare of}} mice’, and that we made an ‘overly simplistic presentation of the underlying biology’...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{jumping to}} {{conclusions}} linked {{to change in}} delusions in early psychosis <b>Dear</b> <b>Editors,</b> Symptom-related cognitive biases such as jumping to conclusions (JTC) can potentially {{be the focus of}} cognitive therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp; Lecomte et al., 2003) and metacognitive training (MCT; Moritz et al., 2011). To provide support for such an approach it is important to demonstrate correspondence between change in delusions and change in JTC. JTC studies typically employ the beads task, where an individual is presented with two jars containing different ratios of beads of two colours, and is asked to decide from which jar a series of beads are being drawn. A cross-sectional association between delusions and JTC is a well replicated finding in cognitive neuropsychiatry research. In past work, we demonstrated a correspondence between change i...|$|R

40|$|Investigating {{emotion in}} {{psychiatry}} with the International Affective Picture System <b>Dear</b> <b>editors,</b> We {{would like to}} stress how important the investigation of emotion in psychiatry has been through a study published by our group in this journal. 1 This study aimed at determining Brazilian norms for subjective affective assessment of the photographs included in the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) following the methodology used in the original study. 2 Such photographs {{can be used for}} the study of emotional responses in normal subjects and for the diagnosis and assessment of emotional disorders in Brazilian clinical populations. The IAPS, designed to be used in studies worldwide as a standardized emotional material, comprehends hundreds of high-resolution colored pictures which represent several aspects of the daily life (sports, fashion, landscapes, pornography, violence, etc.). They act as powerful producers of emotions, which can be easily presented in the laboratory, thus allowing precise experimental control of factors such as exposure time. 3 Among the main psychiatric conditions in which the IAPS has been recently used to investigate emotion we can cite anxious patients, 4 psychopaths, 5 depressive patients, 6, 7 dru...|$|R

40|$|Assessment of the {{performance}} of a rapid point of care syphilis test in a London genitourinary medicine clinic <b>Dear</b> <b>Editors,</b> We read with interest the paper by Pai et al. 1 who conducted an innovative observational study of screen-ing for syphilis, hepatitis B and HIV with rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) on pregnant women presenting for antenatal care in rural India. While the prevalence of syphilis infection was only 0. 2 %, a high level of acceptance was observed. Whilst data are available from similar populations using syphilis POCTs, there remains paucity of data for use in {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) populations. The UK is currently experiencing an epidemic of syphilis among MSM. The Health Protection Agency in 2009 reported a resurgence of syphilis in MSM and more diagnosis than in any other year since 1950. 2 Our genitourinary (GU) medicine clinic diagnoses some of the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections in the UK and MSM comprise one of the most important target populations. Although rapid POCTs are now available for specific Treponema pallidum antibodies, clinical trials 3, 4 of these tests have been so far mostly limited to resource-poor settings where they have been shown to be an effective strategy. Few data are available from these tests used within the UK. 5, 6 Reliable rapid testing might enable quicker diagnosis and treatment on the day of clinic attendance and expedited partner notification. We undertook a pilot evaluation of the Treponema pallidum (TP) Determine POCT (Alere Medical, Stockport, UK) to assess its utility in a GU medicine clinic setting in London. Gold standard testing for syphilis within our clinic has traditionally relied on (1) dark field microscopy (DFM) examination of sus-pected infectious lesions, (2) treponemal serological test-ing (Architect Syphilis chemiluminescence assay [CLIA...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Editors,</b> Attached please find {{an article}} entitled, “Tax Reform and Promoting a Culture of Philanthropy: Guatemala’s ‘Third Sector’ in an Era of Peace,” for {{submission}} to your journal. The {{research for this}} article was conducted thanks to funding from the U. S. Student Fulbright Program. This article addresses {{the gap between the}} visionary documents of Guatemala’s emerging democracy and actual public policy when it comes to tax reform and the country’s nonprofit sector. Guatemala is a particularly fruitful part of the world to study these two themes because of the important role played by its civil society in ending the country’s long civil war and striking a lasting peace. Also timely is the establishment of the 2006 - 07 Pacto Fiscal, or national commission for tax reform. At stake in this study is not only Guatemala’s tax reform effort but also the fiscal well-being of other postwar, transitional democracies in the global south and their respective civil society sectors. The article formulates possible ways to utilize Guatemalan tax reforms to both expand the country’s meager tax base and generate a thriving culture of philanthropy to benefit nonprofit and/or non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The regulatory framework of the NGO sector in developing countries like Guatemala is particularly important in an atmosphere of increased government contracts and partnerships with nonprofits for traditionally State-sponsored public services.

40|$|<b>Dear</b> <b>Editors,</b> we {{have read}} with {{interest}} the paper by Regueiro et al (1) regarding long term Infliximab (IFX) use as maintenance therapy to prevent Crohn’s disease (CD) recurrence after ileo-colonic resection. This study is the continuation of a previous randomized, two armed trial, that evaluated the rate of endoscopic recurrence at one year after surgery, in patients randomized to IFX or placebo. The proportion of endoscopic recurrence was lower in the IFX group compared with placebo (9 % vs. 85 %) (2). In the current open-label study, the same patients, according to their endoscopic findings at one year, were given the option to continue, to stop, or to start IFX therapy. Then patients were followed for at least 5 years after surgery. Patients on long-term IFX therapy, irrespective of original assignment to IFX or placebo, presented higher rate of endoscopic remission and lower rate of surgical recurrence compared with other patients during the whole follow-up period. These data are important because confirm that starting anti-TNFα immediately after surgery (3 - 5) or shortly after endoscopic recurrence (6 - 7) permits to obtain a low recurrence rate in the long-term. Moreover, the Authors demonstrated that early anti-TNFα treatment is associated to a lower need for additional surgery compared to patients who started the treatment in response to endoscopic recurrence. This study is particularly relevant considering the paucity of data currently available in medical literature {{on the role of}} anti-TNFα drugs in the post-surgical setting. However, not all the data available in literature have been quoted as we have recently published the first randomized three armed study evaluating the rate of endoscopic recurrence at two years follow-up in patients treated with Adalimumab (ADA), azathioprine or mesalamine. Also in our study, the rate of endoscopic recurrence was significantly lower in ADA group compared with azathioprine and mesalamine, (6. 3 % vs. 64. 7 % vs. 83. 3 %, respectively (8). Moreover, we provided a follow-up period of two years with detailed clinical, radiologic and endoscopic data at 1 and 2 years after surgery and, further, we directly compared the anti-TNFα treatment with the most traditional drugs, such as mesalamine and azathioprine. Therefore our data and those published by Regueiro et al confirm that patients with risk factors for disease recurrence and additional surgery, such as cigarette smoking, young age, ileocolonic involvement, penetrating/fistulizing disease behavior, early immunomodulator administration and short disease duration before surgery should be considered to start treatment with anti TNFα shortly after surger...|$|R
