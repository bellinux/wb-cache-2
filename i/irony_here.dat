The <b>irony</b> <b>here</b> is that, given the ever-decreasing spirals of pop revivalism, in order to be truly contemporary, rather than eschewing her past, Madonna would need to be ripping herself off circa 1984." [...] John McAlley from Entertainment Weekly commented that the music was [...] "loud, energetic, well-sung, and perhaps a little too often beside the point" [...] and that [...] " [...] struggle to rise above its [...] theatrics." [...] He added that one will be [...] "awed by Madonna's palpable life force and intelligence. [...] There are plenty of reasons to bow at this artist's feat." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that [...] "through the concert, Madonna made a display of arrogance, tossing off profanities, striking tough postures and glaring more often than she smiled. She represents self-love backed by plenty of gym time and a whole troupe of devoted flunkies, all laboring to delight an audience she only seems to disdain. Music makes the people come together, she sang in the finale– together, that is, if Madonna is clearly in charge."

2500|$|Chapter 6 {{continues}} to intersperse songs amongst the prose. [...] "When old corruption", sung by Quid, is a satire {{on the medical}} profession {{and may have been}} suggested by The Devil Upon Two Sticks (1768), a three-act comedic satire by Samuel Foote, which was itself based on the satirical Alain-René Lesage novel Le Diable boiteux (1707). The Devil Upon Two Sticks had been revived on the London stage in 1784, so it would have been topical at the time of writing. The poem also seems to parody parts of Book II of the John Milton epic Paradise Lost (1667), particularly the scenes outlining the genealogy of the sentries of the Gates of Hell, Sin and Death. Chapter 6 is also an important chapter for Suction, insofar as it is here he outlines his primary philosophy; [...] "Ah hang your reasoning I hate reasoning I do every thing by my feelings." [...] The satire in this section comes from Sipsop's discussion of the surgery of Jack Tearguts, and how his patients react; [...] "Tho they cry ever so he'll Swear at them & keep them down with his fist & tell them that he'll scrape their bones if they don't lie still & be quiet."

2500|$|Another {{major theme}} {{throughout}} {{the play is}} the contrast between Margaret and Henry, something which is introduced when they first meet. Henry thanks God for bringing Margaret to him, and exclaims [...] "For thou hast given me in this beauteous face/A world of earthly blessing to my soul,/If sympathy of love unite our thoughts" [...] (1.1.21–23). The <b>irony</b> <b>here,</b> much commented on by critics, is that this unity is exactly what does not happen – their thoughts never unite, and their contrasting and incompatible attitudes are seen time and again throughout the play. For example, after the false miracle, Henry is distraught and laments, [...] "O God, seest thou this and bear'st so long?" [...] (2.1.150), while Margaret's response is much more mundane; [...] "It made me laugh to see the villain run" [...] (2.1.151). When Buckingham arrives to bring news to Henry of Eleanor's dabbling in necromancy, Henry's reaction is pious and sorrowful, [...] "O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,/Heaping confusion on their heads thereby" [...] (2.1.181–182). Margaret's response, however, is combative, using the news to forward her own agenda; [...] "Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,/And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best" [...] (2.1.183–184). Later, when Horner and Thump are about to fight, Henry sees the contest as a sacred point of honour: [...] "A God's name, see the lists and all things fit;/Here let them end it, and God defend the right" [...] (2.3.54–55). Margaret however, is simply {{looking forward to a}} fight; [...] "For purposely therefore,/Left I the court to see this quarrel tried" [...] (2.3.52–53). Henry is [...] "fatally married to his polar opposite." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{accreditation}} {{process has}} changed dramatically {{in the last ten}} years. This article explains why and outlines the new expectations that are used for evaluation. The author, Ron Baker, is one of the directors of the commission that sends evaluators to this college. In the article, Baker refers to “external constituencies ” applying pressure to accreditation commissions to raise their standards of accountability. These “constituencies” would include the general public (taxpayers), political parties, state legislatures and the Congress. It also includes college and university systems around the US. One of the unexplained <b>ironies</b> <b>here</b> is that institutions of higher education themselves have lobbied for tougher standards of accreditation because since the 1980 s they have faced competition from new, private institutions that offer accredited courses in non-conventional ways. The new types of colleges – no campus, classes on weekends, online courses, etc. – can receive federal funds for financial aid and give degrees that have the same standing as though given by traditional institutions. Big university systems like the University of California have gone to Congress and argued that these new “colleges ” may not be offering courses equivalent to the public institutions or traditional private colleges. They argue that these degrees may not have rigorous standards backing them up. Some of these colleges have very high aggregate grade point averages, leading critics to say their system is based on the slogan, “You pay, you get the A. ” Also, the students at these institutions are eligible for financial aid and thus compete for the funds with conventional institutions. Therefore, regional accreditation commissions have adopted more rigorous standards of accreditation and accountability...|$|R

50|$|The great <b>irony</b> {{suggested}} <b>here</b> {{of course}} {{is that it is}} just when the modern mind believes it has most fully purified itself from any anthropomorphic projections, when it actively construes the world as unconscious, mechanistic, and impersonal, it is just then that the world is most completely a selective construct of the human mind. The human mind has abstracted from the whole all conscious intelligence and purpose and meaning, and claimed these exclusively for itself, and then projected onto the world a machine. As Rupert Sheldrake has pointed out, this is the ultimate anthropomorphic projection: a man-made machine, something not in fact ever found in nature. From this perspective, it is the modern mind's own impersonal soullessness that has been projected from within onto the world--or, to be more precise, that has been projectively elicited from the world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In a {{standard}} (rhetoric) perspective ironic communication {{is considered a}} semantic inversion between the literal (primary) meaning and the nonliteral (implicated) one. Nevertheless, in common use irony is not necessarily bound to the rhetoric concept of semantic inversion. Rather, it {{can be defined as}} an alteration of a reference aiming at stressing the reality of a fact by means of the apparent dissimulation of its true nature. In a communicative perspective, irony aims to get an effective protection of interpersonal relationships, so as to leave wide ranges of freedom for managing both meanings and interaction. The point of view herein followed concerns irony as a paradigmatic expression of miscommunication, since it is a chance in widening the psychological space available to the communicators. Irony as miscommunication fits rather well the MaCHT framework proposed by Anolli. In fact, by means of an ironic remark, the speaker can lay the responsibility of the ironic value of the utterance on the intention ascription of the interlocutor. In particular, the present chapter intends to sketch out a new theoretical perspective of ironic communication as miscommunication, by proposing the fencing game (or <b>irony</b> situation) model. <b>Here</b> <b>irony</b> is not considered only as a comment or remark at a linguistic level but also as a complex communicative interaction between interlocutors, depending on contextual constraints and opportunities...|$|R

In June 1839, after the Cherokee Removal to Indian Territory, Major Ridge, his son John Ridge, and nephew Elias Boudinot (Cherokee) were accused of the same crime as that of Doublehead and themselves became the targets of assassins.

40|$|This study {{examines}} irony predominantly {{as it appears}} in German spontaneous spoken discourse. The main data employed for the study are four conversational texts, {{each of which has}} a different irony content. In Chapter One I survey the literature on irony in the fields of rhetoric, literature, and literary criticism, as well as its treatment in linguistic frameworks (based on Austin 1962 / 1975, Searle 1969). I then compare the function and use of irony in German spontaneous conversation with counterparts in pre-composed conversation. In Chapter Three I discuss some uses of irony in non-Western cultures as contrasted with the functions of irony in modern German culture. Irony emerges as a mode of experience that is closely related to the culture of its inception. This aspect of irony is particularly evident in the difficulties encountered in the internal translation (paraphrase) of ironic discourse (pre-composed as well as spontaneous) or translation from one language or culture to another. In Chapter Four I examine difficulties in translation of instances of irony. Finally, in Chapter Five I distinguish irony from related tropes and concepts. Irony employs a feature of quality, which has usually been associated with opposition. I have expanded the concept of opposition and added the feature of multilayeredness as a necessary condition. <b>Irony</b> is seen <b>here</b> for the most part as an intended incongruence. A pair of readings co-exist, producing the incongruence. Both remain present in an interactive way. I conclude that irony, even though extensively studied and described, remains resistant to precise definition and demarcation. Irony is not only employed as a nonce phenomenon at the propositional level, it can also function as a pervasive feature of discourse, a lifetime, an era, or even of life itself...|$|R
40|$|The Methors of Jalpaiguri {{who have}} not {{received}} the attention of any enquirer till now, have in their due course conserved and continued their rich tradition which is abundant with rituals, aphorisms and songs. These have been passed down orally {{from one generation to}} another. In the process {{they have been able to}} enact and continue their cultural practices in spite of the impact of the colonization and modernization around them. As one goes deeper into studying the tradition of Methor community it is very evident that it is the women who play the major role in preserving and continuing their culture and at the same time helping in maintaining the institution called family. Therefore, any attempt to study the life and culture of the Methors in general requires a better appraisal of women’s role in their culture and everyday practices. In this paper, I try to address some received conceptions and lay bare some striking realities which demonstrate the fact that women do play a major role in any oral tradition. Thus, it becomes very important to analyze the women’s songs. This, in fact, is an interesting way to explore the potential worth of the oral tradition of the entire community. This kind of study portrays contemporary life, documents the everyday behavior of Methor women. The songs reveal their ideas, hopes and fears, aspirations and conventions, which are connected with their traditional past. According to Karl Marx, “anyone who knows anything of history knows that the great social changes are impossible without the feminine. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex. ” (Cited in Jane E. Way, 1981 : 3). However, woman as an entity remains mostly ignored in researches done on oral tradition.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 166 - 172. The {{reason for}} this study was to {{determine}} if there is any connection between nostalgia and the debunking effect in the work of N. P. van Wyk Louw Starting with a thorough explanation of the term nostalgia to establish any implications the word might have. They can be summarised as: A longing for a simple life without loneliness where the person will feel at home. A desire to reach a better understanding of God and the primordial as the source of all life. Nostalgia develops as a result of a interrelationship between the past, present and the future and an interrelationship between the abstract and concrete aspects of nostalgia. In short: Nostalgia is a desire to establish an Utopian existence. It was found that the secondary literature on the topic is of a limited nature. The literature relating to Van Wyk Louw concentrates mostly on Nuwe Verse and Tristia and especially on the type of language used in "Klipwerk" and the fact that the author resided in the Netherlands while writing these two books. To outline the developement of nostalgic tendencies, the theme-poem of every book was looked at and it was found that Alleenspraak, Die Halwe Kring and Gestaltes en Diere encompasses the desire aspect of nostalgia, while Nuwe Verse and Tristia have a bearing on the remembrance aspect. The study of the love-, monologue- and prophet-figures showed that the search for certainty and unity leads has a debunking effect. Innocence brings the primordial into play which was studied using the poem "Die Swart Luiperd". The study showed that it is impossible to return to origin of life. With the debunking of the abstract aspects of nostalgia, attention was given to the earthly aspects. In this regard it was also found that the human being is isolated. Lastly, the poem "Groot Ode" was looked at to see if the poet has any answer to the debunking effect of nostalgia. <b>Here</b> <b>irony</b> was suggested as an answer to the debunking effect of nostalgia and as something that would make nostalgia bearable...|$|R
