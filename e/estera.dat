40|$|Background: As {{insecticide}} resistance may {{jeopardize the}} successful malaria control programmes in the Mekong region, a large investigation was previously {{conducted in the}} Mekong countries to assess the susceptibility of the main malaria vectors against DDT and pyrethroid insecticides. It showed that the main vector, Anopheles epiroticus, was highly pyrethroid-resistant in the Mekong delta, whereas Anopheles minimus sensu lato was pyrethroid-resistant in northern Vietnam. Anopheles dirus sensu stricto showed possible resistance to type II pyrethroids in central Vietnam. Anopheles subpictus was DDT- and pyrethroid-resistant in the Mekong Delta. The present study intends to explore the resistance mechanisms involved. Methods: By use of molecular assays and biochemical assays {{the presence of the}} two major insecticide resistance mechanisms, knockdown and metabolic resistance, were assessed in the main malaria vectors of the Mekong region. Results: Two FRET/MCA assays and one PCR-RFLP were developed to screen a large number of Anopheles populations from the Mekong region for the presence of knockdown resistance (kdr), but no kdr mutation was observed in any of the study species.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Spontaneous {{bacterial}} peritonitis (S B P) is {{a severe}} and frequent complication of cirrhosis {{with a high}} mortality rate. A bacteriological laboratory is not always available for all departments admitting cirrhotic patients with ascitis. It follows that alternative methods for rapid diagnosis of SBP are an urgent requirement. Objective: This study was planned to compare between leucocyte esterase reagent strips as a bed side test and standard manual polymorphnuclear leucocytes (PMN) counting in the ascitic fluid as regards efficacy and rapidity in diagnosis of SBP. Subjects & methods: The study included 100 patients with liver cirrhosis resulting from chronic hepatitis C infection complicated by ascites and SBP. All patients were subjected to complete clinical examination, laboratory investigation that include CBC, PT, INR, LFT, s., creatinine and blood urea, pancreatic enzymes (amylase & lipase), ESR, tuberculin test, radiological investigations including CXR, pelvi-abdominal US and CT, in addition to specific investigations that include cytological, bacteriological and biochemical examination of ascitic fluid as well as examination of ascitic fluid by leucocyte <b>esteras</b> strips. Results: There was a highly statistically significance of leucocyte esterase reagent strips in diagnosis of SBP with high specificity 91. 5 %, sensitivity 83 % and accuracy 88 %. There was positive correlation (r = + 0. 56) between ascitic fluid PMN counts and the corresponding result of leucocyte esterase reagent strip test which was statistically of high significance (P value = 0. 000). Conclusion: It's concluded that the reagent strip testing of ascitic fluid is a very sensitive and specific method for diagnosis of SBP i...|$|R
40|$|Human T cell clones contain {{enzymes that}} can cleave the {{substrate}} N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester (BLT). All CTL clones tested {{in this study}} secreted BLT-serine esterase activity, whereas only one of three tested non-cytolytic T cell clones secreted this enzymatic activity upon Ag-specific activation. BLT-serine esterase secretion could also be induced by the Fc gamma+ target cell Daudi {{in the presence of}} mAb specific for the TCR/CD 3 complex, CD 2, or the T cell activation Ag Tp 103. In addition, anti-CD 3 and a mitogenic combination of anti-CD 2 mAb, induced secretion of BLT-serine esterase in the absence of target cells, whereas anti-Tp 103 failed to do so. The secreted BLT-serine esterase activity induced by the various ligands was inhibited by the serine esterase inhibitors PMSF and m-ABA, but not by N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Significant BLT-serine esterase activity was induced by target cells or soluble anti-CD 3 in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 + ions, provided that extracellular Mg 2 + ions were present. The cytotoxic activities by the human CTL clones were completely blocked under these conditions. All ligands that induced BLT-serine esterase secretion in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, induced a transient rise of intracellular Ca 2 +. Soluble anti-CD 3 mAb did not induce a transient rise in intracellular Ca 2 + or secretion of BLT serine esterase in CTL preincubated for 2 h with 5 mM EGTA. These findings indicate that mobilization of intracellular Ca 2 + in human CTL clones is required for induction of secretion of BLT-serine <b>esteras...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is {{a common}} disease in children. Approximately 3 - 5 % of girls and 1 % of boys develop a UTI. In children, prompt treatment is essential because UTI may be {{a risk factor for}} developing renal insufficiency or end stage renal disease. Howevet; prompt treatment depends on having a rapid diagnosis. Urine dipstick testis a useful and commonly used because it is low cost and gives rapid results, compared to urine cultures for diagnosing UTis. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test is debatable. Objective To compare urine dipstick test (leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and combined leukocyte es terase and nitrite) to urine culture for diagnosing UTis. Methods A diagnostic study was held in H. Adam Malik Hospital from May to June 2010. There were 70 children aged 2 to 14 years and recruited by consecutive sampling. Two midstream urine specimens were collected from subjects after cleaning the external urethral orifice. The first specimen was used for urine dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite. The second urine specimen was cultured in the laboratory. Urinalysis for leukocyte esterase and nitrite studies were performed with fresh and uncentrifuged urine. Leukocyte <b>esteras</b> e and nitrite caused a change in dipstick color apparent within 2 minutes. Urinalyses were considered to be positive for UTI if either leukocyte esterase or nitrite were positive. The results of urine culture were used as the golden standard. Results The sensitivities of leukocyte esterase and nitrate tests were 90. 5 % and 73. 8 %, respectively. However, the sensitivity for combined leukocyte esterase and nitrite test was 96. 4 %. Nitrite test was more specific (60. 7 %) than the leukocyte esterase test (39. 3 %). The specificity of both tests taken together was 64. 3 %. For leukocyte esterase alone, nitrate alone, and the two combined the positive predictive values (PPV) were 69. 1 %, 73. 8 %, and 64. 3. %, respectively, and the negative predictive values (NPV) were 73. 3 %, 60. 7 %, and 96. 4 %, respectively. Conclusion Urine dipstick test for leukocyte esterase and nitrite combined may be a good alternative diagnostic test for UTis in children than leukocyte esterase or nitrite by themselves in areas with limited resources...|$|R
