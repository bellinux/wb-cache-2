5|$|In the Greater Toronto Area, local Tamil {{communities}} and organizations began {{to set up}} demonstrations by January 2009, following similar movements in the United Kingdom and India regarding the large civilian casualties from the Sri Lankan Civil War. Tamil Student Associations at the University of Toronto and Ryerson University staged demonstrations on campus to promote awareness of the <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> to fellow students. During the week of 25 January, several Tamil media outlets announced a strike, requesting all Tamils to not attend work or school during the week and {{take part in the}} protests that would happen in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{scholarly}} consensus over {{the presence of}} the Sri Lankan Tamil people in Sri Lanka, also known as Eelam in Sangam literature. One theory states that there was not an organised Sri Lankan Tamil people presence in Sri Lanka until the invasions from what is now South India in the 12th century AD; another theory contends that Tamil people were one of the original inhabitants of the island. Theories about Tamil people's presence in Sri Lanka feed into the cycle of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict.</b> Another theory states that the Sri Lankan Tamils are descendant of the Nagas, who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language around 3rd BCE.|$|E
5|$|The Ossetian {{people are}} {{indigenous}} to North Ossetia, {{located in the}} North Caucasus. Controversy surrounds the date of Ossetian arrival in Transcaucasia. According to one theory, they first migrated there during the 13th and 14th centuries AD, and lived alongside the Georgians peacefully for centuries. In 1918, conflict began between the landless Ossetian peasants living in Shida Kartli, who were influenced by Bolshevism and demanded ownership of the lands they worked and the Menshevik government backed ethnic Georgian aristocrats, who were legal owners. Although the Ossetians were initially discontented with the economic policies of the central government, the tension soon transformed into <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict.</b> During uprisings in 1919 and 1920, the Ossetians were covertly supported by Soviet Russia, but even so, were defeated.|$|E
50|$|Tatu Vanhanen in his 1999 book <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Conflicts</b> Explained by <b>Ethnic</b> Nepotism empirically {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} the degree of ethnic homogeneity, the degree of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts,</b> and the degree of democratization in the nations of the world. He found that more ethnically heterogeneous nations had more <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The degree of democratization explained very little of the degree of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> except that very authoritarian states such as the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia could suppress <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts.</b> <b>Ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> were only slightly less common in more economically developed countries. They appeared within all racial groups, cultures, and geographical regions. In Vanhanen's view, people have a genetic tendency to easily learn ethnic attitudes and psychological mechanisms leading to prejudice, scapegoating, and discrimination.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt to employ the constructivism of Alexander Wendt to {{understand}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> in South Asia. The article surveys the theoretical literature on constructivism to create a set of propositions regarding <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> and attempts to test these propositions for several of South Asia’s <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The article argues that <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> are essentially identity conflicts in which the definition or construction of threats, enemies and friends plays a pivotal role. <b>Ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> evolve according to how identities are defined, the def-initions being predicated on the material condition facing the communities themselves in relation to the manifest practices of the state. In contrast to realist discourses that see only endless conflicts and an invariable security dilemma for groups, and liberalism that defines <b>ethnic</b> peace (or <b>conflict)</b> in terms of transaction costs and utility calculations, the constructivist reading of ethnicity enables International Relations to interrogate ethnicity in cultural-ideational terms. By using constructivist propositions to a select set of <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> in South Asia, the article attempts to explain the salience of ethnicity as a pervasive mode of conflict in the subcontinent.

This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and {{has worked with the}} Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict.</b> In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.|$|E

40|$|This paper locates armed <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> in Northeast India across four {{interactive}} qualitative variables: ethnic exclusivity {{and colonial}} isolation; {{strategy of the}} armed groups; the use of violence; and external connections. The Indian state’s response to these armed <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> is located within three conceptual parametres: proportionate use of force; dialogue and negotiations; and structural changes in the affected areas. Cases of armed <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> utilized for empirical illustration includes the Dima Halam Daogah (DHD) and the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in Assam, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim led by Thuingaleng Muivah and Isak Chisi Swu-NSCN (IM) based in Manipur and Nagaland, and the United National Liberation Front (UNLF) based in Manipur. A few policy recommendations are also offered to better address armed <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> in India’s Northeastern landscape. The two main research questions the paper addresses are the following: 1. Why does Northeast India suffer from multiple armed <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> since 1947 ? 2.

40|$|<b>Ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> {{and their}} links to {{international}} human trafficking have recently received {{a surge in}} international attention. It appears that <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflicts</b> exacerbate the internal displacement of individuals from networks of family and community, and their access to economic and social safety nets. These same individuals are then vulnerable to being trafficked by the hopes of better economic prospects elsewhere. In this paper, we empirically examine this link between <b>ethnic</b> fragmentation, <b>conflicts,</b> internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees and international trafficking, making use of a novel dataset of international trafficking.

25|$|Clifford Geertz, a {{founding}} scholar of primordialism, asserts {{that each person}} has a natural connection to perceived kinsmen. In time and through repeated conflict, essential ties to one's ethnicity will coalesce and will interfere with ties to civil society.

Thus, when considered through a primordial lens, <b>ethnic</b> <b>conflict</b> in multi-ethnic society is inevitable.|$|E
