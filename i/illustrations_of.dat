5|$|The food most {{associated}} with Purim is called ozne haman ("Haman's ears"). These are three-cornered pastries filled most often with poppy seed, but also other fruit fillings.

5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{inspired}} by Madame de Genlis's Adèle et Théodore (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of <b>illustrations</b> <b>of</b> the Bible {{for which she}} provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. These various sets were very popular and could be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The prints were usually hung on walls or bound into books.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's {{methods of}} {{observation}} included dissection (Aristotle's lost companion work, The Dissections, contained <b>illustrations</b> <b>of</b> these), so he observed animal anatomy directly, though his {{interpretations of the}} functions of the structures he observed were subject to error.

5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his <b>illustrations</b> <b>of</b> Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Clathrus ruber was {{illustrated}} in 1560 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gesner in his Nomenclator Aquatilium Animantium—Gesner mistook the mushroom for a marine organism.

5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well.

5|$|The {{history of}} the bikini {{can be traced back}} to antiquity. <b>Illustrations</b> <b>of</b> Roman women wearing bikini-like {{garments}} during competitive athletic events have been found in several locations. The most famous of them is Villa Romana del Casale. French engineer Louis Réard introduced the modern bikini, modeled by Micheline Bernardini, on July 5, 1946, borrowing the name for his design from the Bikini Atoll, where post-war testing on the atomic bomb was happening.|$|E
5|$|The taxon Laevistrombus was {{introduced}} in the literature as a subgenus of Strombus by Tetsuaki Kira (1955) in the third printing of the 1st edition of Coloured <b>Illustrations</b> <b>of</b> the Shells of Japan. It comprised two species, Strombus (Laevistrombus) canarium and Strombus (L.) isabella Lamarck, 1822. No type specimen was designated, and Kira gave no formal description or statement of differentiation, as required by the ICZN code to validate the name. In a later version of the book, Laevistrombus was elevated to genus level, but a description was still lacking. Rüdiger Bieler and Richard Petit (1996) considered it a nomen nudum, and the authorship was transferred to Robert Tucker Abbott (1960), who had provided a proper description and <b>illustrations</b> <b>of</b> Laevistrombus and specified a type species, Strombus canarium L., in the first volume of his monograph Indo-Pacific Mollusca. The currently accepted combination, Laevistrombus canarium, was proposed by Jack John Sepkoski Jr. (2002), who elevated Laevistrombus to genus level based on palaeontological data.|$|E
5|$|The travel {{journal of}} the Dutch ship Gelderland (1601–1603), rediscovered in the 1860s, {{contains}} the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius. They {{have been attributed to}} the professional artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct Mauritian birds, and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century <b>illustrations</b> <b>of</b> the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability.|$|E
