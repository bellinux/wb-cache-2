40|$|Abstract. The Wastewater Treatment Plant of Zalau, Salaj county, Romania was {{designed}} to treat approximately 18. 425 m wastewater per day, {{and in order to}} follow the discharge parameters for the chemical oxygen demand indicators (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspension solids (SS), the aeration basins have been conceived to function as a unit on nitrification and denitrification. The concentration of the dissolved oxygen is being maintained at the level of 1 mg/l, on the aeration basin, so as to prevent the growth of autotrophic bacteria and nitrification process. Existing Wastewater Treatment Plant has been designed for a population equivalent of 50. 500 people and the aim of the project is to enlarge treatment plant capacity to 90. 900 population equivalent and reach the maximum effluent quality. The Wastewater Treatment Plant, is built only for the nitrification process, reduces the nitrogenous chemical compounds but not the phosphor – nitrogen compounds. The exclusive use of nitrification process in the WWTP leads to an overloading of the stream waters with manure.

40|$|The heat {{generated}} during EDM melts the work material and thereby allows large amounts to be removed, but an unfavorable {{surface of a}} recast layer (RCL) will also be created. This layer has entirely different properties compared to the bulk. Hence, it is {{of great interest to}} efficiently remove this layer and to verify that it has been removed. The main objective of this work has been to study the efficiency of <b>grit</b> blasting for <b>removal</b> of RCL on an EDM aero space shaft. Additionally, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) has been evaluated as a nondestructive measurement to determine RCL presence. The results show that the grit-blasting processing parameters have strong influence on the ability to remove RCL {{and at the same time}} introduce beneficial compressive stresses even after short exposure time. Longer exposure will remove the RCL from the surface but also increase the risk that a larger amount of the blasting medium will get stuck into the surface. This investigation shows that a short exposure time in combination with a short grit-blasting nozzle distance is the most preferable process setting. It was further found that handheld XRF equipment can be used as a nondestructive measurement in order to evaluate the amount of RCL present on an EDM surface. This was realized by analyzing the residual elements from the EDM wire...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{fractional}} {{volume of}} the reservoir sand shall {{be taken to the}} ground when the crude oil is brought up from the ground. With the deepening of the oil extraction the sand content of oil recovery is increasing. Although many measures have been used such as prevent sand, block sand and so on, the viscosity of heavy oil is big and the fractional of sand is carried into the crude oil gathering system inevitably, causing a series of problems at ground equipment, having a serious impact on the normal production and gathering of crude oil. The larger size of sand can be removed by the sedimentation and the smaller sand can be removed by hydrocyclone devices. Hydrocyclone is a separation plant used to separate non-uniform phase mixtures. It can be used to complete the liquid clarification and to wash particles, liquid degassing and <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> grading and classification of solid particles and the separation of two non-miscible liquids and others.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and <b>grit</b> <b>removal.</b> Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse screens and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse screens. Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or fine screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|E

The characterisation of the wastewater is given (TSS, COD, BOD 5, N and P content) in order to compare it with the discharge limit values. Different lines of treatment are chosen according to the expected treatment performances which are 99 % for the TSS, 90 % for the COD, 98 % for the BOD 5, 68 % for the N-tot content and 90 % for the P-tot. The unit treatments are compared together and the choice to work with the €/ton of product enables to analyse more easily the different treatments. The investment cost is going to be considered for a period of 20 years as well as taking into account the increase of the price for the water, the electricity and the raw materials and the operating costs such as the maintenance, the repairs, etc. Considering the generated waste, two main steps of treatment are needed {{in order to meet the}} discharge limit requirements. A screening and a <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> step as a pre-treatment enables to reduce the coarsest materials and then the physical-chemical decantation using the coagulation/flocculation is performed to remove a significant part of the suspended solids. To reduce the other pollutants, the three additional possibilities are membrane technologies which are very compact but with a high investment cost, the activated sludge which is classic in a pulp mill with a reasonable cost and a high performance, and then the aerated lagoonss which are cheap but a large space is necessary. After, the treatment for the sludge has to be done and according to the flow of the output sludge, the only suitable equipment possible is the centrifugation.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScWater {{scarcity}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly relevant problem for urban centres, especially in Southern Africa. However, water availability {{is not the only}} concern for consumers, because water quality is just as relevant. Many studies have revealed adverse health effects in organisms exposed to polluted waters, and the main source of that water pollution was traced back to sewage treatment works (STWs). Physiological systems that are affected include the endocrine system (as well as the reproductive system) and the immune system. Recently, the Stellenbosch STW started upgrading its facility, but this procedure would also affect the STW‘s operations. Stellenbosch STW uses an activated sludge treatment, but also employs trickling filters (biofilters). After screening and <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> wastewater enters trickling filters, and then undergoes activated sludge treatment (aerobic basin). After activated sludge treatment (and settling) some water is chlorinated before entering a maturation pond. The other water goes directly to a larger maturation pond (for a longer period), instead. The final effluent then gets discharged into the Veldwagters River. Since STW operations {{is an important factor in}} STW effluent quality, this study aimed to investigate the water quality (at Stellenbosch STW) during the upgrade. Specifically, the bacterial quality, the steroidal quality (testosterone, progesterone, estrone: E 1, 17 β- estradiol: E 2 and 17 α-ethinyl estradiol: EE 2) and the potential immunotoxic quality of waters were assessed. Water samples were collected after the <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> (influent), after the trickling filters (biofilter effluent), while it was leaving the aerobic basin activated sludge effluent) and as it was leaving the maturation ponds (final effluent). To determine bacterial quality a semi-quantitative ReadyCult® assay was performed on raw water samples (detects total coliforms and Escherichia coli). Bacterial levels were high for all influent samples, water from the biofilter, water from the aerobic digester (activated sludge) and the final effluent (most days). The first collection date, however, showed less than 1 cfu/mL of both E. coli and total coliforms for the final effluent. Raw water also underwent solid phase extraction, before the steroid concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Steroid levels were very high in the influent. Each treatment progressively reduced the steroid concentration. However, progesterone concentration increased during the biofilter treatment. The increase in progesterone was probably due to bacterial de-conjugation of hydrophilic-progesterone-conjugates. Nonetheless effluent steroid levels were significantly lower than the influent. Steroid reduction through the Stellenbosch STW was 96 %, 95 %, 55 %, 78 % and 87 % for testosterone, progesterone, estrone, estradiol and ethinyl estradiol respectively. Much variability in steroid concentrations was noted between sampling dates. The activated sludge treatment was the best at reducing steroid concentration. Nonetheless, the STW still discharged steroids into the environment. Finally, the humoral immune effects of Stellenbosch STW influent and effluent was determined by using hybridoma cells and assessing affects on antibody production. Antibody levels were then detected by ELISA. No adverse effects to antibody synthesis/secretion were noted as a result of exposure to either influent or effluent...|$|E

For example, the presence of dirt and grit in composite panel board feedstocks causes excessive equipment wear in the manufacturing plant {{as well as for}} the end users of panel board products. For the manufacturing plant, dirt and grit causes refiner plates in the size reduction equipment to wear down at a faster rate than normal. For the end-user, dirt and grit embedded in the panel board causes saw blades to dull more rapidly. Dirt and grit can also reduce the brightness of a panel board which may be a problem for end users who overlay the board with thin melamines or other coatings. Best Practice: This best practice recommends the use of chip washing equipment to remove persistent dirt and grit contaminants from recovered wood waste feedstocks for users of exceptionally clean supplies of wood waste. Mechanical screening for dirt and <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> is adequate. Chip Washer. A chip washer operates by mixing wood waste feedstocks with water. The mixing process needs to be fairly dynamic to remove dirt and grit. The energetic mixing can be accomplished through an enclosed ‘waterfall’, turbulent pumping, or other mechanisms. Once the dirt and grit is washed free fro...|$|E
40|$|The {{wastewater}} treatment plant of Porto Tolle (RO, Italy) was originally projected for 2200 person equivalent (p. e.) and {{it was made of}} a pumping station, an activated sludge oxidation tank (395 m 3), a settler (315 m 3), and two sludge drying beds. Other units were not yet in use in 2008 : a fine screen, a sand and <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> unit, a new settler (570 m 3), a disinfection tank and a sludge thickener. Effective hydraulic load was 245 % higher, organic load was 46 % lower and nitrogen load was 39 % higher than project values. Moreover, higher pollutant loads and more strict emission limits for nitrogen were expected. So the plant was upgraded: the old settler was divided into a sector of 180 m 3 that was converted into a predenitrification tank, and a sector of 100 m 3 that was converted into a hybrid MBBR tank filled with 50 % AnoxKaldnesTM K 3 carriers; the new settler was connected to the hybrid MBBR, and the other units were started. Biofilm growth was observed two months after plant restarting, its concentration reached 1. 1 gTS/m 2 (0. 26 kgTS/m 3), while activated sludge concentration was 2. 0 – 2. 8 kgTSS/m 3 in all the period of study. The upgraded plant treats 1587 m 3 /d wastewater with 57 kgCOD/d, 23 kgBOD/d and 13. 3 kgN/d, and has a significant residual capacity; the effluent respects all emission limits...|$|E

For {{the purposes of this}} Order, the City of Lodi is hereafter referred to as “Discharger ” and the White Slough Water Pollution Control Facility is hereafter referred to as “Facility. ” 2. The Discharger owns and operates two separate wastewater collection systems, a municipal wastewater line and an industrial wastewater line that collects primarily food processing wastewater from Pacific Coast Producers, a local cannery. The Facility’s wastewater treatment system consists of a head works with comminutors, mechanical <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> primary sedimentation, conventional activated sludge with nitrification and denitrification, secondary sedimentation, tertiary treatment using cloth media filtration, and ultraviolet light pathogen deactivation (UV Disinfection). 3. Order R 5 - 2007 - 0113 (NPDES No. CA 0079243), allows year-round discharges of tertiary treated, UV disinfected municipal wastewater to Dredger Cut, a water of the United States and part of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. However in general, the Facility only discharges to surface water during the months of September through June. Typically during the summer months (mid-April through early-September), undisinfected secondary treated municipal wastewater is pumped to the Facility’s 40 -acres of unlined storage ponds and is used to irrigate the Discharger’s agricultural fields. The Discharger’s agricultural fields cover approximately 790 acres adjacent to the Facility and are used for fodder, fiber, or feed crops that are not directly used for human consumption (hereinafter The Agricultural Fields).

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} is {{predicting}} the effluent COD of UASB reactors with flowing mathematical models. Materials and Methods: Weak industrial wastewater of the township, after passing screening unit, <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> chamber and equalization tank, entered UASB reactor with volume of 144 m 3 (Length and width: 6 m; useful depth: 4 m). Analyses of laboratory parameters were done in accordance with water and wastewater standards. Results: The reactor start-up started with hydraulic retention time of 14. 4 d and organic loading rate of 0. 04 Kg COD/m 3. d or 0. 02 Kg BOD 5 /m 3. d which in 200 days, hydraulic retention time reached to 0. 9 d and organic loading rate reached to 0. 85 Kg COD/m 3. d or 0. 45 Kg BOD 5 /m 3. d eventually, that the highest COD and BOD 5 removal efficiencies were observed up to 70 % and 64 %, respectively in the hydraulic retention time of 0. 9 d. In the kinetic evaluation, the equations for effluent COD concentration prediction were obtained after calculating kinetic coefficients of Y, K d, K, K S and μmax in the Monod model; β and μmax in the Contois model; α, β and K 2 (S) in the second-order Grau model and K B and U max in the modified Stover-Kincannon model.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} {{wastewater}} treatment technologies at Blantyre and Soche {{wastewater treatment works}} (WWTW) in Malawi with technologies of a similar case according to the ED-WAVE tool to determine if existing cases in the tool can be invoked and appropriately modified {{to arrive at a}} particular design alternative. The ED-WAVE tool is a shareware PC based package for imparting training on wastewater treatment technologies. The system consists of four modules viz. Reference Library, Process Builder, Case Study Manager, and Treatment Adviser. The paper also compares the reduction in the levels of BOD 5, COD, and TSS at the three respective treatment works. The study established that there is a similarity in the sequencing of treatment units of Municipal Case 6 in the ED-WAVE tool and the sequencing of treatment units at Blantyre and Soche WWTW, respectively. All the three plants incorporate screening, <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> aerobic biological treatment, and sedimentation. Soche and Blantyre WWTW use hand-raked inclined bar screens and constant velocity grit channels, where longitudinal flow velocity is hydraulically controlled. Rotary mechanically-raked bar screens and mechanically stirred grit chambers are used in the ED-WAVE tool. In addition, Municipal Case 6 uses oxidation ditches for aerobic biological treatment while Blantyre and Soche WWTW use trickling filters. BOD 5 removal efficiency at Soche WWTW at 95 % and 96 % for dry season and wet season, respectively, is comparable to the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6 (95 %). The dry season BOD 5 removal efficiency at Blantyre WWTW at 87 % is slightly lower than the removal efficiency at Municipal Case 6. TSS removal efficiency at Soche WWTW is at 80 % in the we...|$|E
