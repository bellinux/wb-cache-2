5|$|The {{need for}} both iron and blood soon became apparent. By 1862, when Bismarck made his speech, {{the idea of}} a German {{nation-state}} in the peaceful spirit of Pan-Germanism had shifted from the liberal and democratic character of 1848 to accommodate Bismarck's more conservative Realpolitik. Ever the pragmatist, Bismarck understood the possibilities, obstacles, and advantages of a unified state. He also understood the importance of linking that state to the Hohenzollern dynasty, which for some historians remains one of Bismarck's primary contributions {{to the creation of the}} German Empire in 1871. While the conditions of the treaties binding the various German states to one another prohibited Bismarck from taking unilateral action, the politician and diplomat in him realized the impracticality of such an action. In order to get the German states to unify, Bismarck needed a single, outside enemy that would declare war on one of the German states first, thus providing a casus belli to rally all Germans behind. This opportunity arose with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Historians have long debated Bismarck's role in the events leading up to the war. The traditional view, promulgated in large part by late 19th and early 20th century pro-Prussian historians, maintains that Bismarck's intent was always German unification. Post-1945 historians, however, see more short-term opportunism and cynicism in Bismarck's manipulation of the circumstances to create a war, rather than a <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> to unify a nation-state. Regardless, Bismarck was neither villain nor saint: by manipulating events of 1866 and 1870, he demonstrated the political and diplomatic skill that had caused Wilhelm to turn to him in 1862.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, {{plans were}} made for a bridge across the Otago Harbour between Port Chalmers and Portobello, but this <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> for an 1140-metre {{structure}} never eventuated.

25|$|The twelve niches {{created in}} Francesco Borromini's {{architecture}} were left vacant for decades. When in 1702 Pope Clement XI and Benedetto Cardinal Pamphili, archpriests of the archbasilica, announced their <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> for twelve larger-than-life sculptures of the Apostles {{to fill the}} niches, the commission was opened to all the premier sculptors of late Baroque Rome. Each statue was to be sponsored by an illustrious prince with the Pope himself sponsoring that of St. Peter and Cardinal Pamphili that of St. John the Evangelist.|$|E

25|$|He {{compiled}} an eight-volume Geographia covering {{what was}} known about the earth. The {{first part of the}} Geographia is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest, Ptolemy put all this information into a <b>grand</b> <b>scheme.</b> He assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the Canary Islands.|$|E
25|$|Hoveyda's plan {{to crack}} down on {{corruption}} became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and {{turned a blind eye to}} the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue in the <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> of modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon {{continued}} to entertain a <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> {{to establish a}} French presence in the Middle East {{in order to put}} pressure on Britain and Russia, and perhaps form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire. In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor Selim III finally recognized Napoleon as Emperor. He also opted for an alliance with France, calling France [...] "our sincere and natural ally". That decision brought the Ottoman Empire into a losing war against Russia and Britain. A Franco-Persian alliance was also formed between Napoleon and the Persian Empire of Fat′h-Ali Shah Qajar. It collapsed in 1807, when France and Russia themselves formed an unexpected alliance. In the end, Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East.|$|E

David McCreary of CCM Magazine felt that the song's [...] "softer cadence" [...] didn't diminish its [...] "hard-hitting message". Although describing it as [...] "poignant", Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today felt the song was too broad in scope.

40|$|The French policy called “politique de la ville” {{that was}} {{institutionalized}} in the 80 s, aimed to manage social contemporary problems of {{low cost housing}} built by {{the state in the}} 50 s and 60 s at the peripheries of cities following <b>grand</b> <b>schemes</b> (“grands ensembles”).

Since the 60 s, the criticism of these <b>grand</b> <b>schemes</b> of low cost housing carried on by slogans such as “living environment” and “urban self-management” determined an answer from public authorities. However, I argue that these responses used different terms but continued in fact on same track. An ideology of spatial determinism and an ideal of social mix span all French urban policies since the 50 s, while the idea of urban participation appears and then fades away. These ideologies were and continue being inherent in understanding the relations between space and society...|$|R
