5|$|The {{earliest}} cannon {{inscribed with}} a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> is a bronze cannon. It is dated to 1298 {{according to an}} inscription in the 'Phags-pa script. Outside of archaeological finds, appearances of the cannon in Chinese art may suggest that the cannon was invented {{as early as the}} 12th century. The oldest artistic representation of a cannon is a stone relief sculpture dated to 1128. The sculpture was discovered in 1985 carved in the walls of Cave 149 of the Dazu Rock Carvings in Dazu, Chongqing.|$|E
5|$|Flight 2801 was a {{chartered}} flight {{flown by}} Vnukovo Airlines {{on behalf of}} Arktikugol, which operated mines at the two company towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden in Svalbard.

2500|$|Further success came in late December 1943, when US Marines {{captured}} the airfield at Cape Gloucester {{on the north}} coast of New Britain, finding many wrecks and several nearly intact aircraft. TAIU officers logged the serial numbers of the aircraft, and engine configurations, serial numbers and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> They inspected cockpits for layout and control locations, and armour plate. They recovered armaments and noted their locations and mounts. Some reports provided considerable detail, including oil and fuel tank capacities, and special electronics installed.

40|$|Maintaining {{the safety}} and quality <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> food is an {{important}} concern for producers, government and consumers in Bangladesh. The nutritional value of food gradually reduces over time, until it finally becomes unsafe to consume and may cause harm to health. Then again, consumers throw out a large amount <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> food after the expiry date, believing it is not safe to consume. Thus, proper labelling of manufacturing and expiry <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> food on packet can protect both {{the safety and}} quality of food and save {{a large amount of}} food from being wasted. The legislators of Bangladesh do not prescribe any rules or regulations for food producers, which obliges manufacturers to use scientific methods for identifying expiry dates. Moreover, food producers, importers and suppliers use unspecific and confusing terms to indicate the manufacturing and expiry <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> food. This study finds that the <b>date</b> labelling <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> food issue in Bangladesh is inadequately regulated, triggering confusion among consumers, manufacturers, sales staff and regulatory authorities. Regulatory loopholes in date labelling contribute to food waste and threaten public health. These issues warrant the enacting of a comprehensive law establishing an effective regulatory body to oversee <b>date</b> labelling <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> and processed food...|$|R

25|$|Other {{evidence}} {{presented by the}} prosecution included {{a piece of a}} man's pyjama top supposedly from a pair Cora had given Crippen a year earlier. The pyjama bottoms were found in Crippen's bedroom, but not the top. The fragment included the manufacturer's label, Jones Bros. Curlers, with bleached hair consistent with Cora's were found with the remains. Testimony from a Jones Bros. representative, the store that the pyjama top fragment came from, stated that the product was not sold prior to 1908, thus placing the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> well within the time period of when the Crippens occupied the house and when Cora gave the garment to Hawley the year before in 1909.|$|E
25|$|The US National Yogurt Association gives a Live & Active Cultures Seal to {{refrigerated}} yogurt products {{which contain}} 100 million cultures per gram or frozen yogurt products containing 10 million cultures per gram {{at the time}} of manufacture. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization recommended that “the minimum viable numbers of each probiotic strain {{at the end of the}} shelf-life” be reported on labeling, but most companies that give a number report the viable cell count at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> a number probably much higher than existing at the moment of consumption.

25|$|In 2000, the Dallas City Council {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} mandating that no vehicle can be operated as a taxicab {{within the city}} limits once it reaches five years from the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> More recently, an effort spearheaded by Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert has begun to convert all taxicabs in Dallas to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). It has been alleged that the drive toward CNG taxis is consequence of a corrupt bargain among Dallas politicians and the large energy interests that dominate the business and civic circles of the city. To name one, Clean Energy, LP, the largest retail natural gas distributor in North Texas and majority-owned by T.

500|$|State regalia were {{increasingly}} passed from one king to the next. The first {{example of this}} was HenryVIII's Crown. Its <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> is unknown but it was probably created {{at the beginning of}} the Tudor dynasty. The gold crown was covered in pearls, rubies, sapphires and diamonds, and its rim was decorated with alternating crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis. The centre petals of the fleurs-de-lis had images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and child, StGeorge, and possibly Edmund the Martyr and Edward the Confessor. Although some English monarchs laid claim to the French throne, the fleurs-de-lis on their crowns had evolved from the trefoil introduced by King Canute and were purely decorative. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in law after the Union of the Crowns when JamesVI andI decreed in 1605: [...] "Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells [...] to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme".|$|E
5000|$|Other {{than the}} form and the duanwen of the qin, the qin player may marvel at the {{inscriptions}} {{at the back of}} the qin. These will be names, poems, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> seals and other artistic inscriptions. Of course, some qins have 'no name' on them, or are plain. Some think that there is no need to adorn the qin with written words, the sound should speak for itself. Most would just write the name and date inside the qin. However, carving inscriptions into the back of the qin is an art form in itself. It is a point of admiration to the qin, and collectors may add their own inscriptions on the qin, much like they would do to a piece of Chinese painting that they praise highly. Inscriptions can be used to date the qin as well, since most makers brush in their names and years <b>of</b> <b>manufacture,</b> mostly inside the soundhole, on the sound absorber or next to it. A calligrapher may be called in to compose a piece and that will be copied onto the qin.|$|R
