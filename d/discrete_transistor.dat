25|$|Charge flow in a BJT {{is due to}} {{diffusion}} of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base. A <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped {{compared to the other}} two layers, whereas the majority charge carrier concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charges injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where they are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.|$|E

50|$|The nuvistor {{is a type}} of {{vacuum tube}} {{announced}} by RCA in 1959. Most nuvistors are basically thimble-shaped, but somewhat smaller than a thimble, and much smaller than conventional tubes of the day, almost approaching the compactness of early <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> casings. Triodes and a few tetrodes were made. The tube is made entirely of metal and ceramic. Making nuvistors requires special equipment, since there is no intubation to pump gases out of the envelope. Instead, the entire structure is assembled, inserted into its metal envelope, sealed and processed in a large vacuum chamber with simple robotic devices.|$|E

50|$|Early CPUs were custom designs used {{as part of}} {{a larger}} and {{sometimes}} distinctive computer. However, this method of designing custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the development of multi-purpose processors produced in large quantities. This standardization began in the era of <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> mainframes and minicomputers and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of the integrated circuit (IC). The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order of nanometers. Both the miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the presence of digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern microprocessors appear in electronic devices ranging from automobiles to cellphones, and sometimes even in toys.|$|E

The typical device that uses the voltage-amplifier stage is the operational amplifier. Similar constructions can also be created {{on the basis of}} <b>discrete</b> <b>transistors.</b> From the circuit designerâ€™s point of view, the voltage-amplifier stage defines the crucial parameters of the whole unit - the amplification factor, dominant pole of its transfer function and the slew rate. In this paper the proposal on construction of the voltage-amplifier stage based on <b>discrete</b> <b>transistors</b> is described. When connected between the input differential amplifier and the output stage, it allows creating of cheap amplifier for HiFi applications with considerable performance...|$|R
50|$|IBM 7070 was a decimal {{architecture}} intermediate {{data processing}} system that was introduced by IBM in 1958.

It was the company's first transistorized stored-program computer.|$|R
5000|$|During this period, {{a method}} of {{manufacturing}} many interconnected transistors in a compact space was developed. The integrated circuit (IC) allowed {{a large number of}} transistors to be manufactured on a single semiconductor-based die, or [...] "chip". At first, only very basic non-specialized digital circuits such as NOR gates were miniaturized into ICs. CPUs based on these [...] "building block" [...] ICs are generally referred to as [...] "small-scale integration" [...] (SSI) devices. SSI ICs, such as the ones used in the Apollo guidance computer, usually contained up to a few dozen transistors. To build an entire CPU out of SSI ICs required thousands of individual chips, but still consumed much less space and power than earlier <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> designs.|$|E
50|$|The first {{scientific}} calculator that included {{all of the}} basic ideas above was the programmable Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A, released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron had some features later identified with {{scientific calculator}} designs. The HP-9100 series was built entirely from <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> logic with no integrated circuits, {{and was one of}} the first uses of the CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first calculator based on Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) entry. HP became closely identified with RPN calculators from then on, and even today some of their high-end calculators (particularly the long-lived HP-12C financial calculator and the HP-48 series of graphing calculators) still offer RPN as their default input mode due to having garnered a very large following.|$|E
50|$|Most {{versions}} of the Big Muff use four transistor stages. The first stage is a clean boost, which drives the next two clipping stages which create the distortion. The final stage is a tone recovery stage, which recovers volume loss as the tone stack in the Big Muff is passive and the pedal loses some volume because of this. For a short time in the late-1970s the Big Muff used op-amps, {{which at the time}} were not as highly regarded as the <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> versions. However, the op-amp (or IC) Big Muffs have lately seen a revival among collectors and players alike. The IC (op-amp) Big Muff has a slight variation in sound to the transistor version, it is not as scooped and seems to cut through more in a band situation, which is desirable among some.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} the Burroughs large systems was the B5000. Designed in 1961, it was a second-generation {{computer}} using <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> logic and magnetic core memory.

After a merger in which Burroughs acquired Sperry Corporation and {{changed its name to}} Unisys, the company continued to develop new machines based on the MCP CMOS ASIC. These machines were the Libra 100 through the Libra 500, With the Libra 590 being announced in 2005.

5000|$|Low-power versions, {{exempt from}} licence requirements, {{are also popular}} {{children}}'s toys such as the Fisher Price Walkie-Talkie for children illustrated in the top image on the right. Prior to the change of CB radio from licensed to [...] "permitted by part" [...] (FCC rules Part 95) status, the typical toy walkie-talkie available in North America was limited to 100 milliwatts of power on transmit and using one or two crystal-controlled channels in the 27 MHz citizens' band using amplitude modulation (AM) only. Later toy walkie-talkies operated in the 49 MHz band, some with frequency modulation (FM), shared with cordless phones and baby monitors. The lowest cost devices are very simple electronically (single-frequency, crystal-controlled, generally based on a simple <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> circuit where [...] "grown-up" [...] walkie-talkies use chips), may employ superregenerative receivers, and may lack even a volume control, but they may nevertheless be elaborately decorated, often superficially resembling more [...] "grown-up" [...] radios such as FRS or public safety gear. Unlike more costly units, low-cost toy walkie-talkies may not have separate microphones and speakers; the receiver's speaker sometimes doubles as a microphone while in transmit mode.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, IBM {{introduced}} its System/360 computer architecture {{that was used}} in a series of computers capable of running the same programs with different speed and performance. This was significant {{at a time when most}} electronic computers were incompatible with one another, even those made by the same manufacturer. To facilitate this improvement, IBM utilized the concept of a microprogram (often called [...] "microcode"), which still sees widespread usage in modern CPUs. The System/360 architecture was so popular that it dominated the mainframe computer market for decades and left a legacy that is still continued by similar modern computers like the IBM zSeries. In 1965, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) introduced another influential computer aimed at the scientific and research markets, the PDP-8.Transistor-based computers had several distinct advantages over their predecessors. Aside from facilitating increased reliability and lower power consumption, transistors also allowed CPUs to operate at much higher speeds because of the short switching time of a transistor in comparison to a tube or relay. The increased reliability and dramatically increased speed of the switching elements (which were almost exclusively transistors by this time), CPU clock rates in the tens of megahertz were easily obtained during this period. Additionally while <b>discrete</b> <b>transistor</b> and IC CPUs were in heavy usage, new high-performance designs like SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vector processors began to appear. These early experimental designs later gave rise to the era of specialized supercomputers like those made by Cray Inc and Fujitsu Ltd.|$|E
