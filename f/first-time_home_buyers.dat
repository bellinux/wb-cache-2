25|$|This {{was further}} amplified by public policy. In the US, home loans were {{guaranteed}} by the Federal government. Many national governments saw home ownership as a positive outcome and so introduced grants for <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> and other financial subsidies, such as the exemption of a primary residence from capital gains taxation. These further encouraged house purchases, leading to further price rises and further relaxation of lending standards.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue in}} Ybor City after World War II was {{the aging of}} the area’s housing stock. New {{construction}} had all but stopped during the Depression and the war, and thousands of homes built during the neighborhood's era of rapid growth around 1900 were still in use. These old wooden structures were becoming dilapidated and were thus not particularly attractive to <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> such as returning veterans, who tended to gravitate to West Tampa or the booming suburbs of Tampa.|$|E
500|$|Although Kemp coaxed Bush {{to support}} a $4billion housing program that {{encouraged}} public housing tenants to buy their own apartments, the Democratic Congress allocated only $361million to the plan. In addition to opposition in Congress, Kemp fought White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who opposed Kemp's pet project HOPE (Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere). The project involved selling public housing to its tenants. Darman also opposed Kemp's proposed welfare adjustment of government offsets. HOPE was first proposed to White House chief of staff John Sununu in June 1989 to create enterprise zones, increase subsidies for low-income renters, expand social services for the homeless and elderly, and enact tax changes to help <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> <b>buyers.</b> Sununu opposed it at first as {{did most of the}} Cabinet, but in August 1990 Sununu, at the urging of United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, encouraged President Bush to endorse Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force. [...] However, the Persian Gulf War and the budget negotiations overshadowed Kemp's new project. Darman battled Kemp and his allies such as Gingrich, James Pinkerton, and Vin Weber. The budget left him with $256million for his plan, which Kemp increased during some appropriations battles. Soon after Clayton Yeutter was appointed chief White House domestic policy advisor, Kemp's Economic Empowerment Task Force was abolished.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{expansion}} of the Irish economy in the 1990s, during the [...] "Celtic Tiger" [...] years, Drogheda became one of the main secondary locations for people who work in Dublin to buy a house, as property prices in the capital became prohibitive for many <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> <b>buyers.</b> This was aided by {{the expansion}} of transport infrastructure in the direction of Drogheda i.e. the Swords and Balbriggan bypasses, the Boyne River Bridge and the increased number of commuter trains serving the town. Partly as a result, the downtown area of Drogheda has redeveloped, and two large shopping centres have opened, while several national and international retailers have opened stores.

2500|$|Asked [...] "How {{will you}} help with the housing and {{foreclosure}} problems in the U.S.?", Romney responded {{that it would be}} best not to try and stop the foreclosure process, to let it run its course and hit the bottom, and that he might be open to some government action to encourage refinancing. He also referred to the Obama administration as having [...] "slow walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang", and that the credit that was given to <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> was inadequate to turn around the housing market. He nevertheless is open to some government intervention but demands that it make sense from a business standpoint. Should the foreclosure process run its course, Romney sees recovery for the market as investors are allowed to salvage property values and move people back into their homes as renters, with the possibility to buy when they are fiscally prepared.|$|E

The most {{prominent}} builders of {{houses in the}} village were David Weekley Homes and Village Builders. In 2000 Rick Raymor, {{a real estate agent}} with Heritage Texas Properties, said that the price ranges in the subdivision were between $70,000 to $115,000. Raymor stated that the range represents the [...] "smaller end of the spectrum, which makes it a really desirable <b>first-time</b> <b>home</b> for a <b>buyer</b> who wants to gain some good equity." [...] According to Raymor, patio homes on some streets, which ranged between 900 and 1500 sq ft in area, ranged in price between $70,000 to $85,000; other houses ranged in area between 1,400 and 2100 sq ft. In 2000 almost all of the houses in Northmead were built in the 1980s.

Even {{there is no}} doubt on the necessity of green housing development and its benefits for the home owners, developers as well as government, but green housing market still is not attractive for majority of <b>home</b> <b>buyers.</b> Higher price compared with conventional homes and lacks of government incentives for green <b>home</b> <b>buyers</b> are the main causes of the current situation in the green home market.
