5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him to start taking <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National Curriculum for primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E
5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

25|$|The {{scheme is}} said to be run by a mafia. Also, some fans can get into games by bribing stadium {{employees}} with an amount less than the ticket price, while the stadium can report the full seat price as an expense.

But the Sudanese Football Association, which employs these people, has failed to address <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unable to {{find any}} trace of her any other way, Dyson and the classmate became {{concerned}} that Alexander might have fallen victim to a crime at some point since then. In August 2014, Hernando County sheriff's office told them no missing persons report had been filed. (Dyson, a child at the time, disputes this, saying her parents did indeed make a report, but speculates that given Tammy's history of running away and returning, police may not have taken <b>it</b> <b>seriously).</b> They filed a new report.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1953, new {{documentation}} {{was published}} {{related to this}} issue, and some historians studied <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> In her bestselling 1974 biography of Jefferson, Fawn M. Brodie suggested Jefferson had been the father of Hemings' children. The book was widely discussed, and Jefferson historians began to lose control of the narrative. While mainstream historians criticized the biography for its psychological analysis, Brodie also published her conclusions about the liaison, as well as interviews with descendants of Jefferson's mixed-race children, in American Heritage magazine, reaching a wider audience.|$|E

Gordon describes Taylor as having been the one to motivate him into starting Ryukyu Underground and taking <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{authenticity}} of the discovery seems beyond doubt. But when the team discovers a seemingly insignificant anomaly, a Delta Force team that was secretly monitoring them attacks, kills Ming and Mangor while leaving Rachel, Tolland and Marlinson to perish on an ice floe. The three, however, are {{picked up by the}} Navy submarine USS Charlotte and manage to inform the president's adviser, Marjorie Tench and the NRO director, William Pickering about the incident. Tench hushes up their report while Pickering takes <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> and sends them an air transport.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} college, VanDerveer {{took a year}} off, with a plan {{to return}} to law school. When she ran out of money she returned home. When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the girls did not take <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E

25|$|While Locke {{had always}} wanted to be a writer, it was in the 1950s that she began to take <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> In 1949 she edited Gordon Watson, New Zealander, 1912–45: His Life and Writings, and in 1950 she wrote a {{political}} history of the Canterbury region, The Shepherd and the Scullery Maid, 1850–1950: Canterbury Without Laurels, both published by the Communist Party. In 1954 she self-published a book of her poetry, The Time of the Child: A Sequence of Poems. Writing became very important to Locke, who managed to keep a room to herself in their tiny house for more than 50 years.|$|E
25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease {{as if there were}} real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying quick fixes.|$|E
25|$|At work, Cindy {{searches}} through {{pictures of}} lighthouses before finding {{the one from}} the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson, and President Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.|$|E

25|$|Tuck played {{high school}} {{football}} in Alabama at Central Coosa County. He played for legendary coach Andrew Slome. Growing up, Tuck's favorite football teams were the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys, but his favorite sport was basketball. Although he began playing football in the seventh grade, Justin only began to take <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> in his freshman {{year of high school}} where he originally started out as a quarterback before changing positions to tight end and defensive end. His accolades include earning Alabama Class 4A Player of the Year as a senior in 2000, as well as lettering in football at both linebacker and tight end. For his career at Central-Coosa, Tuck recorded 492 tackles with 37 sacks, 26 forced fumbles, and 17 fumble recoveries. As a tight end, Tuck had 115 catches for 2,106 yards and 17 touchdowns. Subsequently, Tuck also won two state championships {{as a member of the}} high school basketball team.|$|E

Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.|$|E

I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour.
