5|$|The Royal Marines Division were {{earmarked}} for Hardboiled, trained in mountain warfare, and given cold weather equipment. Realistic invasion plans were drawn up and Norwegian currency was stockpiled. These preparations met with considerable {{resistance from the}} armed <b>forces,</b> <b>who</b> considered the operation to {{be a waste of}} effort.

5|$|The work {{opened to}} the public in Chicago on October 22, 1883, to {{critical}} acclaim. General John Gibbon, one of the commanders of the Union <b>forces</b> <b>who</b> repelled Pickett's Charge, was among the veterans of the battle who gave it favorable reviews. So realistic was the painting that many veterans of the war were reported to have wept upon seeing it.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed <b>forces</b> <b>who</b> adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|During a {{confrontation}} between rebels and British forces {{at the village}} of an-Nazla ash-Sharqiya in early December 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad was wounded, but managed to evade capture when the mukhtar (village headman) escorted him to safety in a nearby cave. Four of al-Hajj Muhammad's men died in the battle. After the British withdrew from the area, al-Hajj Muhammad was treated by local doctors until January 1938 when he received more advanced care in Damascus. He returned to Palestine later that month. By early 1938, the rebels consolidated control {{over much of the}} countryside and the rural roads. These areas became increasingly dangerous for British <b>forces,</b> <b>who</b> were mostly concentrated in the main towns.|$|E

5|$|In 1837, the Maine Temperance Society split {{over whether}} they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine <b>forces,</b> <b>who</b> formed their own organization, the Maine Temperance Union. That year James Appleton, a Whig {{representative}} in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully {{in favor of the}} effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated.|$|E
5|$|In January 1906 Tiku sent scouts to Sidareng and Sawitto, {{which the}} Dutch were invading, to observe {{their way of}} battle. When the scouts {{reported}} of the Dutch forces' overwhelming strength and seemingly magical powers used against the Bugis soldiers, he ordered his fortresses to increase readiness and begin stocking up on rice; that month, Luwu fell to Dutch <b>forces,</b> <b>who</b> then moved further inland. In February Tiku's men, sent to reinforce the southern kingdoms, reported {{that there was no}} longer coherent leadership and that both kingdoms were losing against the Europeans. This convinced Tiku to train more troops and form a nine-member military council, with himself as its leader.|$|E
5|$|In September, President Arthur carried Irish {{republicans}} Muriel MacSwiney, {{widow of}} the recently deceased Lord Mayor of Cork Terence MacSwiney, and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the Black and Tans, to New York.

In October, a Hoboken man, after securing a last-minute court order, was able to halt the deportation of his German niece on President Arthur; she was retrieved from the ship ten minutes before sailing time.|$|E

In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E
5|$|Luís Alves would {{normally}} have begun the fourth-year {{classes at the}} Royal Military Academy in March 1822.

Prince Dom Pedro, son and heir of King JoãoVI, had just embarked upon the struggle against Portugal {{that would lead to}} the independence of Brazil on 7 September 1822. The prince was later acclaimed Dom PedroI, the first Brazilian emperor, on 12 October.
