Implementing globally <b>distributed</b> web <b>sites</b> offers difficulties not present in local server clusters due to bandwidth and delay constraints in the Internet. With delayed load information, server selection methods based on choosing the least-loaded server will result in oscillations in network and server load. In this paper, methods that make effective use of delayed load information are described and evaluated. The new Pick-KX method is developed and shown to be better than existing methods.

Traditional EA provides a long-term view of an organization’s processes, technologies, and systems, which enables individual projects to build capabilities rather than just fulfil immediate needs (Ross et al. 2006). The effective use of EA standards can provide cost and efficiency advantages by standardizing the different platforms, technologies, and application architectures among <b>distributed</b> <b>sites</b> (Boh & Yellin 2006; Ross et al. 2006). This can potentially reduce the organizational operational complexity, minimize waste and replication of system components, enable reuse of system components, and control the number of skilled individuals (e.g., developers) required to maintain the systems (Boh & Yellin 2006). Moreover, using EA standards enables integrating applications and sharing data across <b>distributed</b> <b>sites.</b> This helps <b>distributed</b> <b>sites</b> to integrate their business processes, develop key applications faster, and make effective use of organizational data (Bass et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Memory {{consolidation}} {{is thought}} to involve the gradual transfer of transient hippocampal-dependent traces to <b>distributed</b> neocortical <b>sites</b> via the rhinal cortices. Recently, medial prefrontal (mPFC) neurons were shown to facilitate this process when their activity becomes synchronized. However, the mechanisms underlying this enhanced synchrony remain unclear. Because the hippocampus projects to the mPFC, we tested whether theta oscillations contribute to synchronize mPFC neurons during learning. Thus, we obtained field (LFP) and unit recordings from multiple mPFC sites during the acquisition of a trace-conditioning task, where a visual conditioned stimulus (CS) predicted reward delivery. In quiet waking, the activity of mPFC neurons was modulated by theta oscillations. During conditioning, CS presentation caused an increase in mPFC theta power that augmented as the CS gained predictive value for reward delivery. This increased theta power coincided with a transient theta phase locking at <b>distributed</b> mPFC <b>sites,</b> an effect that was also manifest in the timing of mPFC unit activity. Overall, these results show that theta oscillations contribute to synchronize neuronal activity at <b>distributed</b> mPFC <b>sites,</b> suggesting that the hippocampus, by generating a stronger theta source during learning, can synchronize mPFC activity, in turn facilitating rhinal transfer of its activity to the neocortex...|$|R
