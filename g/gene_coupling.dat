50|$|According to physicians, {{the tail}} Oram has {{is not a}} real tail, but a {{congenital}} malformation known as spina bifida, in this case of the rare meningocele category. It is possible for human embryos to develop a real tail, as the genes which cause it still exist in many people. However, the probability of this gene expressing is very low: it can happen because of rare recessive <b>gene</b> <b>coupling,</b> or some form of mutation that brings the gene back to a dominant place. That is why very few cases have been recorded {{in the history of}} medicine. The presence of these kind of vestigial structures is known as an atavism. When a human embryo develops a true tail, it is located as a prolongation of the coccyx, just like the tail of a dog or a monkey.|$|E
30|$|In {{preclinical}} imaging, {{taking advantage}} of the strengths each modality (e.g. MRI, optical and nuclear) has to offer, the use of multimodal multicistronic reporters is becoming increasingly popular [16]. For example, co-expression of PET and BLI reporters would enable rapid, affordable and sensitive BLI, alongside complementary tomographic and quantitative PET capabilities. Expression vectors are often composed of multiple genes (e.g. a therapeutic, a marker gene, a suicide gene and a reporter gene) some of which can be large surface proteins, which may tax the vector packaging capacity and transcriptional efficiency. Strategies which promote maximising vector space are therefore essential and may include gene and protein truncation [22, 32], efficient <b>gene</b> <b>coupling</b> approaches [33, 34] and the utility of dual purpose genes [22, 35, 36].|$|E
40|$|Modulating gene {{expression}} {{directly at the}} DNA level represents a novel approach to control cellular processes. In this respect, zinc finger protein DNA-binding domains can be engineered to target virtually any <b>gene.</b> <b>Coupling</b> of a transcription activation or repression domain to these zinc fingers permits regulating {{gene expression}} at will, providing a platform of unlimited therapeutic applications. In this review, steps involved in the engineering of zinc finger protein transcription factors are described. In addition, an overview of endogenous genes successfully targeted for modulating expression by engineered zinc finger protein transcription factors is given. So far, research has mainly focused on targeting genes involved in cancer and angiogenesis, with encouraging evaluation in vivo and progression into a clinical trial. Altogether, engineered zinc finger proteins offer a new and exciting direction {{in the field of}} medical research with promising prospects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAntisense RNAs (asRNAs) {{are known}} to {{regulate}} gene expression. However, a genome-wide mechanism of asRNA regulation is unclear, {{and there is no}} good explanation why partial asRNAs are not functional. To explore its regulatory role, we investigated asRNAs using an evolutionary approach, as genome-wide experimental data are limited. We found that the percentage of <b>genes</b> <b>coupling</b> with asRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is negatively associated with regulatory complexity and evolutionary age. Nevertheless, asRNAs evolve more slowly when their sense genes are under more complex regulation. Older <b>genes</b> <b>coupling</b> with asRNAs are more likely to demonstrate inverse expression, reflecting the role of these asRNAs as repressors. Our analyses provide novel evidence, suggesting a minor contribution of asRNAs in developing regulatory complexity. Although our results support the leaky hypothesis for asRNA transcription, our evidence also suggests that partial asRNAs may have evolved as repressors. Our study deepens the understanding of asRNA regulatory evolution...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDNA {{torsional}} stress {{is generated by}} virtually all biomolecular processes involving the double helix, in particular transcription where a significant level of stress propagates over several kilobases. If another promoter is located in this range, this stress may strongly modify its opening properties, and hence facilitate or hinder its transcription. This mechanism implies that transcribed genes distant of a few kilobases are not independent, but coupled by {{torsional stress}}, an effect for which we propose the first quantitative and systematic model. In contrast to previously proposed mechanisms of transcriptional interference, the suggested coupling is not mediated by the transcription machineries, but results from the universal mechanical features of the double-helix. The model shows that the effect likely affects prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes, but with different consequences owing to their different basal levels of torsion. It also depends crucially on the relative orientation of the genes, enhancing the expression of eukaryotic divergent pairs while reducing that of prokaryotic convergent ones. To test the in vivo influence of the torsional coupling, we analyze the expression of isolated gene pairs in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Their orientation and distance dependence is fully consistent with the model, suggesting that torsional <b>gene</b> <b>coupling</b> may constitute a widespread mechanism of (co) regulation in eukaryotes...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{amounts of}} anti-neutrophil {{cytoplasm}} antibody (ANCA) directed against proteinase 3 (PR 3) are a diagnostic and pathogenic hallmark of full-blown Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Aggregates of B lymphocytes proximal to PR 3 + cells {{as well as}} plasma cells {{have been described as}} substantial components of Wegener's granuloma and could participate in forming tertiary lymphoid structures, which might promote autoantibody formation. Our aim was a molecular analysis of single B cells in order to develop a methodological approach that allows examination of potential ANCA formation in the tissue. Single B cells from cryo-conserved endonasal biopsies of three WG patients were isolated, using laser-assisted microdissection. Subsequently, their immunoglobulin variable heavy (VH) and light (Vκ, Vλ) chain genes were analysed by single cell polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Sixteen immunoglobulin VH-Vκ or VH-Vλ chain <b>gene</b> <b>couples</b> were characterized. Twelve of these immunoglobulin <b>gene</b> <b>couples</b> resembled memory B cells.

40|$|Abstract: The {{nucleotide}} {{composition of}} the light (L-) and heavy (H-) strands of animal mitochondrial genomes is known to exhibit strand-biased compositional asymmetry (SCA). One of the possibilities is {{the existence of a}} replication-associated mutational pressure (RMP) that may introduce characteristic nucleotide changes among mitochondrial genomes of different animal lineages. Here, we discuss the influence of RMP on nucleotide and amino acid compositions as well as gene organization. Among animal mitochondrial genomes, RMP may represent the major force that compels the evolution of mitochondrial protein-coding <b>genes,</b> <b>coupled</b> with other process-based selective pressures, such as on components of translation machinery — tRNAs and their anticodons. Through comparative analyses of sequenced mitochondrial genomes among diverse animal lineages and literature reviews, we suggest a strong RMP effect, observed among invertebrate mitochondrial genes as compared to those of vertebrates, that is either a result of positive selection on the invertebrate or a relaxed selective pressure on the vertebrate mitochondrial genes...|$|R
