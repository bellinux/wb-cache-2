50|$|When the Protestant Reformation {{swept through}} Northern Germany, St Peter's cathedral {{belonged to the}} cathedral {{immunity}} district (Domfreiheit; cf. also Liberty), an <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>enclave</b> of the neighbouring Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In 1532, the cathedral chapter which was still Catholic at that time closed St Peter's after a mob consisting of Bremen's burghers had forcefully interrupted a Catholic Mass and prompted a pastor to hold a Lutheran service.|$|E
50|$|The {{cathedral of}} Ratzeburg {{dates from the}} {{beginning}} of the 12th century. It was restored, and additions were made to it in the 15th century. The cathedral and pertaining premises such as the chapter and further episcopal manors formed the cathedral immunity district, an <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>enclave</b> of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg within the city of Ratzeburg, else belonging to Saxe-Lauenburg. The diocese also contained a number of other beautiful churches at Mölln, Wismar, Büchen and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The Canton System was {{maintained}} until {{the outbreak of}} the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Guangzhou itself on 18 March 1841. The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months later. Following the Qing Empire's 1842 treaty with Great Britain, Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports were opened to more and more countries, usually including <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>enclaves.</b> Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Taiping Rebellion, the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 1867 in which 1 million people died.|$|R
50|$|When the Protestant Reformation {{swept through}} Northern Germany, Bremen's first Protestant prayer {{took place in}} one of the chapels of St. Ansgar's Church, Bremen on 9 November 1522. Since that year Bremen was a prevailingly Protestant city. St Peter's Cathedral then belonged to the cathedral {{immunity}} district (Domfreiheit; cf. also Liberty), an <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>enclave</b> of the neighbouring Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The then still Catholic cathedral chapter closed St Peter's in 1532, after a mob of Bremen's burghers forcefully interrupted the Catholic mass and prompted Jacob Probst, the pastor of the nearby Our Lady Church, to preach a Lutheran sermon.|$|E

50|$|Also Bremen's Lutheran congregation, owning {{and using}} the Bremen Cathedral, {{experienced}} Smidt's steady badgering. The cathedral district, a former immunity district, {{used to be an}} <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>enclave</b> of the neighboured state of Bremen-Verden until 1803, when it was incorporated into the Free Imperial City of Bremen. As burgomaster Smidt confiscated the considerable estates of the Lutheran congregation, arguing it would be a legal non-thing, null and void. The representatives of the Lutheran congregation, led by the cathedral preacher Johann David Nicolai, started to fight for its right to exist. The fight lasted until the congregation's official recognition in 1830, asserted by a majority of Bremen's senators (government members) against the expressed will of Smidt. Smidt abused his governmental power to suppress the Lutheran congregation by way of ordinances, confiscation and public discreditation.|$|E
50|$|In 1803 {{the cathedral}} {{immunity}} district with St Peter's, meanwhile an <b>extraterritorial</b> <b>enclave</b> of the Electorate of Hanover, which had gained the duchy of Bremen-Verden in, {{was incorporated into}} the Free Imperial City of Bremen. Its burgomaster Johann Smidt, a devout member of the Reformed (Calvinist) church, confiscated the considerable estates of the Lutheran congregation. The representatives of the Lutheran congregation, led by the cathedral preacher Johann David Nicolai, started to fight for its right to exist. In 1810, facing the annexion of Bremen by the French Empire, the city council agreed {{to the establishment of}} a Cathedral parish, this way preventing a French confiscation of the church's properties. But the new parish wouldn't gain full equality of right with the Calvinist parishes before 1830, asserted by a majority of Bremen's Calvinist senators (government members) against the expressed will of Smidt.|$|E
