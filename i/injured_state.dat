500|$|On {{the night}} of July 25, 1978 Carlos Soto Arriví and Arnaldo Darío Rosado, two {{independence}} activists of the Armed Revolutionary Movement (...) , along with undercover police officer Alejandro González Malavé posing as a fellow group member, took taxi driver Julio Ortiz Molina hostage and ordered him to drive them to Cerro Maravilla where several communication towers were located. Their original plan was to set fire and sabotage the towers to protest the imprisonment of Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of the 1950 assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. Truman and the 1954 shooting at the United States Capitol where five members of Congress were <b>injured.</b> <b>State</b> police officers were alerted of their plan prior to their arrival and the activists were ambushed and shot. The undercover agent received a minor bullet wound during the shooting, while the taxi driver was left relatively unharmed.|$|E

Scowl ran to help me, but his wound--for he was hurt--or his utter {{exhaustion}} took effect on him. Or perhaps it was excitement. At any rate, he fell down in a fit. I thought that all was over, when again I heard Umbelazi's voice, and felt Saduko's grip loosen at my throat, and sat up.|$|E
6000|$|And shall the Patriot who maintain'd your cause, From future ages only meet applause? Shall he, who timely rose t'his country's aid, By her own sons, her guardians, be betray'd? Did heathen virtues in your hearts reside, These wretches {{had been}} damn'd for parricide. [...] Should you behold, whilst dreadful armies threat The sure {{destruction}} of an <b>injured</b> <b>state,</b> Some hero, with superior virtue bless'd, Avert their rage, and succour the distress'd; Inspired with love of glorious liberty, Do wonders {{to preserve his}} country free; He like the guardian shepherd stands, and they Like lions spoil'd of their expected prey, Each urging in his rage the deadly dart, Resolved to pierce the generous hero's heart; Struck with the sight, your souls would swell with grief, And dare ten thousand deaths to his relief, But, if the people he preserved should cry, He went too far, and he deserved to--die, Would not your soul such treachery detest, And indignation boil within your breast, Would not you wish that wretched state preserved, To feel the tenfold ruin they deserved? [...] If, then, oppression has not quite subdued At once your prudence and your gratitude, If you yourselves conspire not your undoing, And don't deserve, and won't draw down your ruin, If yet to virtue you have some pretence, If yet ye are not lost to common sense, Assist your patriot in your own defence; That stupid cant, [...] "he went too far," [...] despise, And know that to be brave is to be wise: Think how he struggled for your liberty, And give him freedom, whilst yourselves are free.

40|$|This Article explores state {{responsibility}} {{to the international community}} as a whole and to <b>injured</b> <b>states</b> in particular for the damage occurring from the production and use of ozone depleting substances. This Article argues that pollution of the environment through the continued use and manufacture of ozone depleting substances is in violation of both treaty obligations and general obligations under customary international law. The author argues that pursuant to the international law principle of pacta sunt servanda, signatory states to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer are expected to comply with specific reductions set forth in those treaties. In addition, customary international law based upon the practice of states, judicial decisions and scholarly writings, requires the preservation and enhancement of the human environment. The result is that a state incurs responsibility for its failure to comply with the Montreal Protocol phase-out requirements and to cease production of ozone depleting substances. This Article further explores the remedies available to the international community and to individual <b>states</b> <b>injured</b> by ozone layer depletion. The Article describes international dispute resolution techniques that states may employ in the face of continued polluting activities by other states. This Article also explores remedies available to <b>injured</b> <b>states,</b> including required cessation of manufacture and use of ozone depleting substances and monetary compensation for damages...|$|R

50|$|Second, the {{articles}} create new rights for <b>injured</b> <b>states,</b> principally, {{the right to}} invoke responsibility (Articles 42 and 48) and a limited right to take countermeasures (Articles 49-53). These rights, however, are heavily state-centred and do not deal with how state responsibility is to be implemented if the {{holder of the right}} is an individual or an organisation. The principal element of progressive development in this area is Article 48, which provides that certain violations of international obligations can affect the international community as a whole such that state responsibility can be invoked by states on behalf of the larger community. This provision picks up on the ICJ's celebrated suggestion in Barcelona Traction that some obligations are owed erga omnes, toward the international community as a whole.|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} environmental law principle on transboundary liability {{plays an important}} role in transforming better living environment in urban region. The use of the {{international environmental}} law principle on transboundary liability in urban region for better living environment is largely in response to the inevitability of every individual to protect his/ her rights on living environment in urban region from being polluted. This article examines the use of the international environmental law principle on transboundary liability in transforming better living environment in urban region by identifying actions and cases which deal with human habitat and environmental protection in urban region. This article also identifies the relation between the international environmental law principle on transboundary liability and Rio Declaration as a means to transform better living environment in urban region. The opportunity to enhance the growth of this principle of transboundary liability in protecting human habitat and environment in urban region, through state practices, following the two-transboundary environmental disasters “Sandoz Spill” and “Chernobyl Explosion,” were lost due to the decision by the <b>injured</b> <b>states</b> not to take international legal actions for causing environmental pollution to their urban regions, even though the <b>injured</b> <b>states</b> have their right to do so. The support made by the statesaround the globe on the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses Law, 1994 and the Rio Declaration, 1992 clearly reflected the acceptance and the growth of this principle of transboundary liability in protecting human habitat and environment especially in urban region. Finally, the preliminary findings indicate that the influence of interest approach in the international environmental governance is an important aspect to promote and persuade states around the globe to participate in the Montreal Protocol for the purpose to protect global environment by taking into consideration the principle of transboundary liability in order to control world emissions of pollution especially in urban region. These actions are to ensure the transformation for better living environment in urban regio...|$|R

50|$|Mobley {{was called}} up to the England squad in late 1965 but injury {{problems}} meant he had to drop out and he never got another chance. That injury {{was the first of}} two that season, the other came in the FA Cup semi final against Chelsea, a match Wednesday won 2-0 at Villa Park to reach the final. Mobley was injured after just 30 minutes, at that time substitutes were not allowed and Mobley courageously played the entire match in his <b>injured</b> <b>state,</b> having a hand in Graham Pugh‘s clinching goal. The injury meant that he missed the final against Everton being replaced by a young Sam Ellis. An injury hit 1966-67 season was followed by two season where Mobley was ever present and injury free. He was transferred to Queens Park Rangers in October 1969 for a fee of £55,000 after playing 187 league games for Wednesday (210 including cup games) and scoring eight goals.|$|E

50|$|Game 6 {{was held}} on Tuesday, October 19 at Yankee Stadium. The {{starting}} pitchers were Curt Schilling of the Red Sox and Jon Lieber of the Yankees. Schilling pitched with a torn tendon sheath in his right ankle, which was sutured in place in an unprecedented procedure by Red Sox team doctors. The teams played the first few innings scoreless as cold, windy conditions, combined with a light drizzle, kept many hard hit balls {{in the field of}} play. Lieber, who had been brilliant in Game 2, {{was the first of the}} starters to falter, to the surprise of many given Lieber's Game 2 outing and Schilling's <b>injured</b> <b>state.</b> Lieber surrendered a two-out single to Jason Varitek, driving in Kevin Millar. Then Orlando Cabrera singled to left field and Mark Bellhorn, who had struggled the entire series, drove a line drive into the left field stands. The ball struck a fan in the hands in an attempted catch and dropped back onto the field, after which left field umpire Jim Joyce signaled the ball to be still in play, prompting Boston manager Terry Francona to run onto the field and argue the ruling. The officiating crew huddled and ultimately overruled the call. Bellhorn had a three-run home run and the Red Sox had a 4-0 lead.|$|E
5000|$|Sefuru is the {{youngest}} surviving Oni, probably no more than fourteen or fifteen years old. He is technically half and half, since {{his mother was a}} normal resident of Kyou. Sefuru is bitter and hates the people of Kyou because his mother abandoned him based on his appearance when he was just a small child. It was at this time that Akuram took him in and began to train him to use him for his own purpose. For this reason, despite his half blood, Sefuru has been accepted as an Oni {{by the rest of the}} clan. However, he has a deep rooted fear of being abandoned and alone again, which often drives him to desperate acts. At one point he befriends Shimon, thinking that he's an Oni in the same situation, though he becomes indignant when he thinks that Shimon has betrayed the Oni by joining up with people in the city and is even more perturbed when he discovers that Shimon is one of the Hachiyou. Despite his aggression, however, Shimon is sure that Sefuru is more hurt than anyone by the encounter, and refuses to bear him a grudge. In the end, Sefuru is shown with Ikutidaru, Seri and their new baby, indicating that his hatred is based in his loneliness, and all he really needed was a proper place to belong. In the manga, which is still ongoing, Sefuru is discarded by Akuram and taken in in his <b>injured</b> <b>state</b> by Inori's sister Seri on Ikutidaru's request.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Erga omnes {{norms are}} those that give {{third-party}} states, rather than just the victim, legal claims against states that violate them. This paper argues that ordinary two-party norms arise when states recognize that a norm violation <b>injures</b> only one <b>state</b> and that other states that seek to retaliate on that state’s behalf are likely using the violation as a pretext for predatory behavior. Erga omnes norms arise when states recognize that a norm violation <b>injures</b> multiple <b>states</b> and that states {{have an incentive to}} free ride rather than retaliate against the violator. Erga omnes norms reduce the incentive to free ride {{but at the same time}} reintroduce the risk that some states will use a norm violation as a pretext for engaging in predatory behavior...|$|R
