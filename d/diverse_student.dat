40|$|The {{achievement}} gap in education has existed {{in our society}} {{for as long as}} we have chosen to pay attention to it. Certain demographic groups have always performed better on federal and state assessments compared to others. This study will focus on culturally proficient teaching, specifically, teacher dispositions and attitudes that contribute towards the successful learning of <b>diverse</b> <b>students.</b> 	Teaching <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> is a challenging feat because of the fact that the majority of our educators come from different backgrounds, compared to the <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> they teach. These differences related to race, class, and socioeconomic status affect students’ education, as the tremendous gap we know continues to exist. The intent of this dissertation is to: (a) provide a basic understanding of culturally responsive teaching for <b>diverse</b> <b>students,</b> (b) explore why an understanding of culturally responsive teaching strategies by teachers is crucial in order for all teachers to help <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> to be successful, (c) explore how teacher perceptions; efficacy; and expectations of and towards students affect the learning of <b>diverse</b> <b>students,</b> (d) suggest ideas related to professional development and culturally responsive teaching that support teachers in successfully teaching <b>diverse</b> <b>students.</b> The literature presented here regarding culturally responsive teaching will focus on a number of methods with a specific concentration on social justice and the known barriers and solutions for successful use of culturally responsive teaching. Studies emphasize the importance of implementing culturally responsive teaching to help <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> to be successful throughout their educational careers (Anderson, 2012; Bales & Saffold, 2011; Bergeron, 2008; Bui & Fagan, 2013; Gay, 2002 & 2010; Hynds, Sleeter, Hindle, Savage, Penetito, & Meyer, 2011; Bennett, 2012; Santamaria, 2009; and Siwatu, 2011). For these reasons, it is crucial for all teachers to know that culturally responsive teaching strategies, along with their inherent dispositions and positive perceptions will help <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> the most to be academically successful. This is why this proposed study is so important to add to this body of research...|$|R

After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more <b>diverse</b> <b>student</b> body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students.

40|$|The underidentification of {{culturally}} diverse {{gifted and talented}} students is considered a problem by many scholars and educators in the field of gifted education. Some researchers have explored a number of approaches to identifying greater numbers of these students, including non-verbal intelligence testing and alternative assessments focusing on behavioral or performance evaluations of students. Some of this research has highlighted the importance of examining the effects of other demographic variables such as SES on the efficacy of these assessments in identifying culturally <b>diverse</b> <b>students.</b> In the state of Alabama, the issue of underidentification {{of culturally}} <b>diverse</b> gifted <b>students</b> {{came to the attention of}} the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), resulting in the development of a consent decree by the Alabama Department of Education and the OCR. This decree requires all districts to use a multiple-criteria identification matrix to identify more culturally <b>diverse</b> <b>students.</b> In this research, the Alabama gifted matrix database is used to explore whether the use of a matrix identification system has increased the number of culturally <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> identified as gifted and talented when other demographic variables such as gender and socio-economic status (SES) are also considered. The findings suggest that the combination of race and gender plays a role in which indicators of aptitude, behavior, and performance are used with students, and that SES as a district-level variable is relevant in the identification of culturally <b>diverse</b> <b>students</b> in proportion to their representation in the population. ...|$|R
