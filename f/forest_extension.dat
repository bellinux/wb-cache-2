The main goal of the JFNW 2009 was to discuss the role of forestry in adapting to and mitigating climate change {{from the viewpoint of}} forest science and other scientific disciplines, with a special focus on forest policy and forest management. Priorities for actions at the local, national and European levels were made, and regional differences within Europe were described. The group work was an important component of JFNW 2009. The objective of the group work was to improve participants expertise and knowledge on how forest policies, forest management, forest research and <b>forest</b> <b>extension</b> can be developed for better adaptation and mitigation to climate change. As a result of the group work the participants wrote a short report on how climate change and forest interaction should be considered in the formulation of forest policy, forest management, forest research and <b>forest</b> <b>extension.</b> JFNW 2009 was the first of what is planned to be an annual event. It was judged to be a great success and created a new research network to accelerate new research projects and activities in this field. Altogether 55 participants from 17 countries participated in the first event. JFNW 2009 was organized jointly by the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla), the European Forest Institute (EFI) and the University of Joensuu, Faculty of Forestry in co-operation with the COST Action: Expected Climate Change and Options for European Silviculture (ECHOES). Metla acted as the responsible host organization for the first JFNW 2009. The event was sponsored by the COST Office, the Federation of Finnish Learned Societies (TSV), the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the City of Joensuu, and the Regional Council of North Karelia.

40|$|International audienceTwo {{empirical}} biosphere models, the Osnabruck Biosphere Model (OBM) and {{a simple}} model based on evapotranspiration (AET model), were used to reconstruct the terrestrial carbon storage from pollen at 6000 yr sp in Europe. The pollen-based climatic reconstructions of Guiot et al. (1993) and the ecosystems reconstruction of Peng et al. (1994) provide the input data of the two models, i. e. annual temperature, annual precipitation, actual evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration and ecosystems with a spatial resolution of 0. 50 longitude/latitude. For the region considered, our results {{suggest that there are}} no significant variations in the terrestrial carbon storage between 6000 yr sp and present due to a compensation of the <b>forest</b> <b>extension</b> towards the north by the replacement of conifer forest (with higher carbon) by deciduous forests towards the east. This is consistent with the recent results of Foley (1994) based on climate and biosphere models. The comparison of the two model results with those obtained from the carbon densities of Olson er al.

40|$|Radiocarbon-dated macrofossils {{are used}} to {{document}} Holocene treeline history across northern Russia (including Siberia), Boreal forest development in this region commenced by 10, 000 yr B. P, Over most of Russia, forest advanced to or near the current arctic coastline between 9000 and 7000 yr B. P. and retreated to its present position by between 4000 and 3000 yr B. P. Forest establishment and retreat was roughly synchronous across most of northern Russia, Treeline advance on the Kola Peninsula, however, appears to have occurred later than in other regions. During the period of maximum <b>forest</b> <b>extension,</b> the mean July temperatures along the northern coastline of Russia may have been 2. 5 degrees to 7. 0 degrees C warmer than modern. The development of forest and expansion of treeline likely reflects a number of complimentary environmental conditions, including heightened summer insolation, the demise of Eurasian ice sheets, reduced sea-ice cover, greater continentality with eustatically lower sea level, and extreme Arctic penetration of warm North Atlantic waters.

40|$|Forests {{and trees}} outside of forests are {{integral}} components of agriculture systems and rural livelihoods. They contribute {{directly to the}} food and nutritional security of rural households as sources of food, and indirectly by providing firewood for cooking, income generating activities, and farm inputs (e. g., fertilizer, animal fodder and building materials.

40|$|The Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea are {{experiencing}} a severe shortage of firewood. Residual native forest and some plantation forestry are insufficient to supply this need. In response, in October 2014, the Papua New Guinea Forest Authority (PNG-FA) undertook a three-day training {{program in the}} township of Goroka. Farmers received training in nursery techniques including seed collection, preparing nursery beds, germinating seedlings and out-planting seedlings. Farmers were supplied with seed, shade-cloth and polybags {{to start their own}} home nurseries. Follow-up interviews found that nine of thirteen participants had raised seedlings. However, for those farmers living outside of the Goroka environs, problems have emerged. A severe shortage of seed has resulted in farmers using inappropriate Pinus species. In PNG, land is often community-owned but managed by individual farmers. Long-term tenure is therefore subject to negotiation between clan members. Technology sharing is also not common between clans. In the grasslands, fire is always a problem. These findings indicate a need for an approach to <b>forest</b> <b>extension</b> which accommodates a low rate of technology diffusion between clans and in which farmers in remote locations receive almost one-to-one follow-up extension assistance and access to seed, and guidance to inter-crop planting patterns which provide protection from fire...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies on}} {{tropical}} forest dynamics {{focus on the}} processes of deforestation and forest degradation and its associated ecological impacts; comparatively little attention {{is given to the}} emergence of forest transitions. This review gives an overview of forest transitions in the tropics as involving a structural reversal from a decreasing to expanding forest area as well as related changes in forest quality and forest landscape. After introducing the concept of forest transition it first summarizes the changing forest area in tropical countries. It then discusses how the identification of a forest transition greatly depends on how forests are defined. Three types of forests with contrasting forest composition are distinguished, i. e. natural forests, modified forests and transformed forests, and forest transitions are characterized as involving either forest conversion or forest restoration. Next, forest transitions are related to changes in forested landscapes and described as involving either <b>forest</b> <b>extension</b> at a retracting agricultural frontier or incorporation of forests in forested mosaic landscapes. These processes are driven by either macro-scale socio-ecological feedbacks or socio-economic changes or by location-specific development of rural forests as part of farming intensification. This paper concludes that forest transitions do not just involve a return of natural forests and/or extension of forest plantations on forest lands, but also a multidimensional co-evolution in social and ecological conditions involving an increasing incorporation of socialized forests in forested landscapes...|$|E
