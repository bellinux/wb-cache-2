So, we have established that the drugs and medical products discharged from the stock may be of great interest for consumers due to the medical property offer in low (optimal) costs. </p...|$|R
50|$|Companies in the {{convenience}} and retail industries use back-office software to manage inventory and identify opportunities to improve profit margins by <b>keeping</b> popular items <b>in</b> <b>stock,</b> preventing spoilage and shrink, {{as well as}} reducing overstock of unpopular items (by offering discounts and promotions, for example). Software allows back-office store operators to forecast inventory levels based on sales volumes and therefore optimize the store's turnover ratios (the ratio of how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a given period). Moreover, the measurement of inventory performance data allows store operators to benchmark their performance with published industry averages (e.g. from the National Association of Convenience Stores).|$|R
30|$|The {{first goal}} of this work is to develop an {{estimation}} formula for the CRD, which will prioritize the list of repairs, i.e., determine which units should be tackled first. The CRD assignment affects the timely delivery of the units {{and the number of}} repaired units <b>in</b> <b>stock.</b> Whenever a type of aircraft unit is required, it should be repaired immediately or there must exist a similar unit <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> to replace it. <b>Keeping</b> components <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> allows the aircrafts to be quickly returned to service. On the other hand, the limited space for stock and its associated cost should be taken into account. Therefore it is not desirable to have higher levels of stock or shorter CRDs than necessary. Stock levels should be minimized within a safety level that depends on the costs incurred due to delays on the delivery dates. When the stock of a unit falls below its safety level, an alarm is issued to the stock controller to obtain a new unit as soon as possible. Ideally, if the planning process is carried out more efficiently, i.e., the aircraft components are repaired faster and in a more systematic way, less components may be needed <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> while still providing the same desired low probability of an out-of-stock situation. The problem of determining the best inventory policy in the context of aircraft components was addressed in [1, 3, 7, 12].|$|R

40|$|Stochastic dynamic {{programming}} (SDP) {{is a useful}} tool for analyzing policy questions in fisheries management. In order to understand and reproduce solution procedures such as value function iteration, an analytic elaboration of the problem and model characteristics is required. Because of the increased use of numerical techniques, our aim is to improve the understanding of mathematical properties of the solution procedure and to give more insight into their practical implementation by means of a specific case that uses value function iteration. We provide an analytic description of model characteristics and analyze the solution procedure of a bi-level SDP model to study fisheries policies. At the first level, a policy maker decides on the fish quota to be imposed, <b>keeping</b> <b>in</b> mind fish <b>stock</b> dynamics, capital stock dynamics, long-term resource rents and anticipating fishermen behavior. At the second level, fishermen reveal short-term behavior by reacting on this quota and on current states of fish stock and capital stock by deciding on their investments and fishing effort. An analysis of the behavior of the model is given and a method is elaborated to obtain optimum strategies based on value function iteration. Bi-level decision making enables us to present the model in an understandable manner, and serves as a basis for extension to more complex settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the structural interrelationships among consumer characteristics, shopping attitude, and shopping intention based on Fishbein and Azjen 2 ̆ 7 s (1975) Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Study objectives were: (1) to identify characteristics of consumers who shop for cultural products on the Internet, (2) to propose theoretical models explaining consumers 2 ̆ 7 shopping for cultural products on the Internet, and (3) to empirically test the proposed models using {{a random sample of}} subjects who shop for cultural products on the Internet.;Findings from the present study indicated that consumer characteristics, the product, and the Website were all important factors to predict consumers 2 ̆ 7 intention to shop for cultural products on the Internet. Individuals with certain characteristics of Cultural Creatives (Ray 2 ̆ 6 Anderson, 2000) appear to be an important target market for selling cultural products on the Internet. While both product quality and Website attributes were important factors influencing a positive attitude toward shopping for cultural products on the Internet, only consumers 2 ̆ 7 positive beliefs about the Website significantly influenced their intention to shop on the Internet. Specifically, merchandising, such as <b>keeping</b> products <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> and offering competitive prices, appeared to be a critical factor in determining customers 2 ̆ 7 shopping intention.

40|$|Customer {{service has}} assumed {{strategic}} importance in most manufacturing environments. Corporate reputations often {{depend on how}} reliably promised lead times are met. A goal of filling orders within a service window of T time units is often encountered in practice. This goal ignores the differences among types of units, treating all customers as equally important. Keeping finished goods inventory of all items is only one, and often not the best, way to achieve this objective. High-demand items naturally have safety stock assigned to them, but in many organizations {{there are so many}} very-low-demand items that <b>keeping</b> any <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> these items is prohibitively expensive. Customer service can be maintained for these low-demand items by giving them higher production priority when a demand occurs.

40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale. International audienceIn {{the lumber}} industry, we can observe that {{commodity}} products prices fluctuate according to seasonal patterns. Nevertheless, {{it is believed}} by the industry {{that it is impossible}} to take advantage of this information for many reasons. Firstly, the fact that many different products are produced at the same time from the same material input (coproduction) makes it difficult to produce exactly and only what is needed. Secondly, equipment is already being used at 100 % capacity all year long, so there is no room to increase production when product selling price increases. Finally, the belief is that <b>keeping</b> finished products <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> till the moment for the right price arrives would increase inventory holding cost too much. For these reasons, the typical sawmill produces using a "push" strategy and sells its production, without much consideration of yearly price fluctuation. We have developed a mathematical model that allows planning the sales and operations of a network of sawmills at the tactical level. Using that model, we were able to show it is in fact possible to modulate production and inventory levels to increase sales revenue. We generated a single plan which, if it had been used for each of the last twelve years, would have increased the gross margin generated by an average of 1, 47 % of sales revenue...|$|R
40|$|Management {{of working}} capital refers to {{management}} of current assets and current liabilities. Firms {{may have an}} optimal level of working capital that maximizes their value. Prior evidence has determined the relationship between working capital and performance. Thus, {{this study examined the}} impact of working capital management on firms' performance by using audited financial statements of a sample of 11 metal manufacturing private limited companies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for the period of 2008 to 2012. The performance was measured in terms of profitability by return on total assets, and return on investment capital as dependent financial performance (profitability) variables. The working capital was determined by the Cash conversion period, Accounts receivable period, inventory conversion period and accounts payable period are used as independent working capital variables. Moreover, the traditional measures, current ratio are used as liquidity indicators, firm size as measured by logarithm of sales, firm growth rate as measured by change in annual sales and financial leverage as control variables. The data was analyzed using SPSS (version 20. 0), estimation equation by both correlation analysis and pooled panel data regression models of cross-sectional and time series data were used for analysis. Results indicate that longer accounts receivable and inventory holding periods are associated with lower profitability. The results also show that there exists significant negative relationship between cash conversion cycle and profitability measures of the sampled firms. No significant relationship between cash conversion cycle, account receivable period, inventory conversion period and account payable period with return on investment capital has been observed. On the other hand, findings show that a highly significant negative relationship between account receivable period, inventory conversion period and account payable period with return on asset. The results conclude that cash conversion cycle has significant negative relationship with return on asset. In general paying suppliers longer and collecting payments from customers earlier, and <b>keeping</b> product <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> less time, are all associated with an increase in the firms performance. Managers, therefore, can increase firms‟ profitability by improving the performance of management of working capital components. Jimma Universit...|$|R
