25|$|Robert Smithson’s Hypothetical Continent (Map {{of broken}} clear glass, Atlantis) was first {{created as a}} photographical project on Loveladies Island NJ in 1969, and then recreated as a gallery {{installation}} of broken glass.

500|$|In the 16th century, the {{antiquarian}} John Leland {{described the}} bridge {{in one of}} his Itineraries: [...] "From Monk's Gate the wall extends Westwards to the river Monnow. In the wall are four gates: Monk's Gate, East Gate and Wye Gate... and Monnow Gate which is above the bridge crossing the river Monnow." [...] A visual depiction of the bridge and gate is included in John Speed's work The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britain, published in 1611. His map of Monmouthshire includes an <b>inset</b> <b>map</b> of the town that shows the Monnow Bridge and Gate as well as a similar gatehouse on the Wye Bridge.|$|E

2500|$|In 1507 Martin Waldseemüller {{published}} a world map, Universalis Cosmographia, {{which was the}} first to show North and South America as separate from Asia and surrounded by water. A small <b>inset</b> <b>map</b> above the main map explicitly showed {{for the first time the}} Americas being east of Asia and separated from Asia by an ocean, as opposed to just placing the Americas on the left end of the map and Asia on the right end. In the accompanying book Cosmographiae Introductio, Waldseemüller noted that the earth is divided into four parts, Europe, Asia, Africa and the fourth part, which he named [...] "America" [...] after Amerigo Vespucci's first name. On the map, the word [...] "America" [...] was placed on part of South America.|$|E
6000|$|And as {{a second}} {{illustration}} {{of the way in}} which changing conditions are altering political questions, let the reader take his atlas and consider the case of that impregnable fastness, that great naval station, that Key to the Mediterranean, Gibraltar. British boys are brought up on Gibraltar and the Gibraltar idea. To the British imagination Gibraltar is almost as sacred a national symbol as the lions in Trafalgar Square. Now, in his atlas the reader will almost certainly find an <b>inset</b> <b>map</b> of this valuable possession, coloured bright red. The <b>inset</b> <b>map</b> will have attached to it a small scale of miles. From that he will be able to satisfy himself that there is not an inch of the rock anywhere that is not within five miles or less of Spanish land, and that there is rather more than a semicircle of hills round the rock within a range of seven or eight miles. That is much less than the range of a sixteen-inch gun. In other words, the Spaniards are in a position to knock Gibraltar to bits whenever they want to do so, or to smash and sink any ships in its harbour. They can hit it on every side. Consider, moreover, that there are long sweeps of coast north, south, and west of the Rock, from which torpedoes could be discharged at any ship that approached. Inquire further where on the Rock an aeroplane can land. And having ascertained these things, ask yourself what is the present value of Gibraltar? ...|$|E
