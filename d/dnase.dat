Moreover, from an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide advanced therapeutic ways for chronic infections caused by biofilms via genetically engineered invasive cheaters who can invade wild-types ‘cooperators’ of pathogenic bacteria until cooperator populations go to extinction or overall population ‘cooperators and cheaters ’ go to extinction.|$|E
40|$|The {{family of}} conserved colicin <b>DNases</b> E 2, E 7, E 8, and E 9 are {{microbial}} toxins that kill bacteria through random {{degradation of the}} chromosomal DNA. In the present work, we compare side by side the conformational stabilities of these four highly homologous colicin <b>DNases.</b> Our {{results indicate that the}} apo-forms of these colicins are at room temperature and neutral pH in a dynamic conformational equilibrium between at least two quite distinct conformers. We show that the thermal stabilities of the apo-proteins differ by up to 20 °C. The observed differences correlate with the observed conformational behavior, that is, the tendency of the protein to form either an open, less stable or closed, more stable conformation in solution, as deduced by both tryptophan accessibility studies and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Given these surprising structural differences, we next probed the catalytic activity of the four <b>DNases</b> and also observed a significant variation in relative activities. However, no unequivocal link between the activity of the protein and its thermal and structural stability could easily be made. The observed differences in conformational and functional properties of the four colicin <b>DNases</b> are surprising given that they are a closely related (≥ 65 % identity) family of enzymes containing a highly conserved (ββα-Me) active site motif. The different behavior of the apo-enzymes must therefore most likely depend on more subtle changes in amino acid sequences, most likely in the exosite region (residues 72 – 98) that is required for specific high-affinity binding of the cognate immunity protein...|$|R

Its structure, including that of the active site, {{is very similar to}} those of the corresponding domains of two DEDDh-group <b>DNases,</b> the ε subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III and E. coli exonuclease I, strongly suggesting that its catalytic mechanism is identical to that of the two <b>DNases.</b> However, ISG 20 also has distinctive residues, Met 14 and Arg 53, to accommodate hydrogen bonds with the 2 ′-OH group of the UMP ribose, and these residues may be responsible for the preference of ISG 20 for RNA substrates...|$|R
25|$|All transcriptomic methods require RNA {{to first}} be {{isolated}} from the experimental organism before transcripts can be recorded. Although biological systems are incredibly diverse, RNA extraction techniques are broadly similar and involve: mechanical disruption of cells or tissues, disruption of RNase with chaotropic salts, disruption of macromolecules and nucleotide complexes, separation of RNA from undesired biomolecules including DNA, and concentration of the RNA via precipitation from solution or elution from a solid matrix. Isolated RNA may additionally be treated with <b>DNase</b> to digest any traces of DNA. It is necessary to enrich messenger RNA as total RNA extracts are typically 98% ribosomal RNA. Enrichment for transcripts can be performed by poly-A affinity methods or by depletion of ribosomal RNA using sequence-specific probes. Degraded RNA may affect downstream results, for example, mRNA enrichment from degraded samples {{will result in the}} depletion of 5’ mRNA ends and uneven signal across the length of a transcript. Snap-freezing of tissue prior to RNA isolation is typical, and care is taken to reduce exposure to RNase enzymes once isolation is complete.|$|E

DNA degradation {{problems caused by}} extracellular <b>DNases</b> were overcome by fixation of cells with formaldehyde prior to isolation. A rapid (4 -h) in situ DNA isolation method was also assessed and gave indistinguishable results. Genomic DNA from 21 strains of various geographical and temporal origins was digested with 15 rare-cutting restriction enzymes. Of these, ApaI, MluI, NruI, SmaI, and XhoI gave the most revealing PFGE patterns, enabling strain differentiation. Twenty strains yielded PFGE patterns containing 13 pulsotypes. From summation of MluI, SmaI, and XhoI restriction fragments, the genome size of C. botulinum group II {{was estimated to be}} 3. 6 to 4. 1 Mb (mean ± standard deviation = 3, 890 ± 170 kb).

The poly G tails form intermolecular tetrads that result in high molecular weight aggregates. [...] These aggregates are responsible for the increased activity the poly G sequence impart; not the sequence itself. Numerous sequences have been shown to stimulate TLR9 with variations in the number and location of CpG dimers, as well as the precise base sequences flanking the CpG dimers. This {{led to the creation of}} five unofficial classes or categories of CpG ODN based on their sequence, secondary structures, and effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The five classes are Class A (Type D), Class B (Type K), Class C, Class P, and Class S. It is important to note that during the discovery process, the [...] "Classes" [...] were not defined until much later when it became evident that ODN with certain characteristics elicited specific responses. [...] Because of this, most ODN referred to in the literature use numbers (i.e., ODN 2006, ODN 2007, ODN 2216, ODN D35, ODN K3, etc.). The numbers are arbitrary and come from testing large numbers of ODN with slight variations in attempts to find the optimal sequence.

40|$|Most {{bacteria}} of {{the genus}} Streptococcus are opportunistic pathogens, {{and some of them}} produce extracellular <b>DNases,</b> which may be important for virulence. Genome analyses of Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) neonate isolate NEM 316 revealed the presence of seven genes putatively encoding secreted <b>DNases,</b> although their functions, if any, are unknown. In this study, we observed that respiration growth of GBS led to the extracellular accumulation of a putative nuclease, identified as being encoded by the gbs 0661 gene. When overproduced in Lactococcus lactis, the protein was found to be a divalent cation-requiring, pH-stable and heat-stable nuclease that we named Nuclease A (NucA). Substitution of the histidine(148) by alanine reduced nuclease activity of the GBS wild-type strain, indicating that NucA is the major nuclease ex vivo. We determined that GBS is able to degrade the DNA matrix comprising the neutrophil extracellular trap (NET). The nucA(H 148 A) mutant was impaired for this function, implicating NucA in the virulence of GBS. In vivo infection studies confirmed that NucA is required for full infection, as the mutant strain allowed increased bacterial clearance from lung tissue and decreased mortality in infected mice.

40|$|Epigenetic {{modification}} of genomic DNA by methylation {{is important for}} defining the epigenome and the transcriptome in eukaryotes {{as well as in}} prokaryotes. In prokaryotes, the DNA methyltransferase genes often vary, are mobile, and are paired with the gene for a restriction enzyme. Decrease in a certain epigenetic methylation may lead to chromosome cleavage by the partner restriction enzyme, leading to eventual cell death. Thus, the pairing of a DNA methyltransferase and a restriction enzyme forces an epigenetic state to be maintained within the genome. Although restriction enzymes were originally discovered for their ability to attack invading DNAs, it may be understood because such DNAs show deviation from this epigenetic status. DNAs with epigenetic methylation, by a methyltransferase linked or unlinked with a restriction enzyme, can also be the target of <b>DNases,</b> such as McrBC of Escherichia coli, which was discovered because of its methyl-specific restriction. McrBC responds to specific genome methylation systems by killing the host bacterial cell through chromosome cleavage.
