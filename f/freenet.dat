25|$|Distributed {{hash tables}} use a more {{structured}} key-based routing {{in order to}} attain both the decentralization of <b>Freenet</b> and gnutella, and the efficiency and guaranteed results of Napster. One drawback is that, like <b>Freenet,</b> DHTs only directly support exact-match search, rather than keyword search, although Freenet's routing algorithm can be generalized to any key type where a closeness operation can be defined.|$|E
25|$|<b>Freenet</b> {{is fully}} distributed, but employs a {{heuristic}} key-based routing {{in which each}} file {{is associated with a}} key, and files with similar keys tend to cluster on a similar set of nodes. Queries are likely to be routed through the network to such a cluster without needing to visit many peers. However, <b>Freenet</b> does not guarantee that data will be found.|$|E
25|$|DHT {{research}} was originally motivated, in part, by peer-to-peer {{systems such as}} <b>Freenet,</b> gnutella, BitTorrent and Napster, which took advantage of resources distributed across the Internet to provide a single useful application. In particular, they took advantage of increased bandwidth and hard disk capacity to provide a file-sharing service.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, Love {{publicly}} {{advocated for}} {{reform of the}} record industry in a personal letter published by Salon. In the letter, Love said: [...] "It's not piracy when kids swap music over the Internet using Napster or Gnutella or <b>Freenet</b> or iMesh or beaming their CDs into a My.MP3.com or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads {{so that they can}} be 'the labels' friend', and not the artists". In a subsequent interview with Carrie Fisher, Love said that she was interested in starting a union for recording artists, and also discussed race relations in the music industry, advocating for record companies to [...] "put money back into the black community [...] white people have been stealing from for years." [...] She also cited Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst as an example of [...] "a white guy [...] to express a black man's rage with all the privileges of [...] a white guy".|$|E
50|$|While {{users can}} insert data into the network, {{there is no}} way to delete data. Due to <b>Freenet's</b> {{anonymous}} nature the original publishing node or owner of any piece of data is unknown. The only way data can be removed is if users don't request it.|$|R
25|$|Free ISPs are Internet service {{providers}} that provide service free of charge.

In response, the board considered whether to cease expansion plans or move to a new funding model. They considered all options, including voluntary contributions, corporate sponsorships, government or foundation sponsorship, advertising, selling products, and membership fees. The last option was noted [...] "Some other <b>Freenets</b> do charge a small membership fee. To date, the NCF Board has opposed having any fees. However, given a choicebetween continuing to operate with a fee or not continuing to operate, we may want to change our minds." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the School of Computer Studies as an {{electronic}} community, using {{the objectives of}} local electronic communities as defined {{in the context of}} <b>FreeNets.</b> We discuss the benefits and problems of electronic communication within the school, showing that the specified objectives are largely met. The most effective support of community goals appears to be the local News system, reflecting a divergence from the global trend away from News as the World Wide Web becomes the dominant medium. 1 Introduction According to Minard and Greer [8] three core ideas define the concept of a community; it is a shared place (for people and institutions) which results in social interaction and communal problems. While human contacts help to build a sense of identity and shared culture, problems push them towards common perspectives and create a sense of commitment and interdependence. These factors characterise a local community. Minard and Greer also present an alternative view of co [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Community informatics, a {{comparatively}} new discipline, {{is the study}} of information and communication technology (ICT) in community development work. Michael Gurstein (2000, p. 1) defines community informatics as “a technology strategy or discipline which links economic and social development at the community level with emerging opportunities ” {{in a wide variety of}} information and communication technology applications. At the same time, Loader, Hague, and Eagle (2000) from the United Kingdom were describing community informatics as an approach that enables the connection of cyberspace to community places, a field of investigation regarding the ways in which ICT can be geographically embedded and developed by community groups to support new and existing networks. Earlier, Schuler (1996) had described the social movement termed community networking, tracing the history of <b>freenets,</b> computer-supported community work, and community networks tying the community-based social networks of physical relationships to a computer-based technology that permitted enhancement of these networks. This issue of COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT: Journal of the Community Development Society furthers the exploration of community informatics and community development b...|$|R
50|$|Entropy was {{designed}} to be compatible with the similar <b>Freenet</b> system. As such, any <b>Freenet</b> client could be configured to run on the Entropy network. However, Entropy and <b>Freenet</b> data stores are not compatible with each other and therefore do not share data.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Freenet</b> Messaging System (FMS): FMS was {{designed}} to address problems with Frost such as denial of service attacks and spam. Users publish trust lists, and each user downloads messages only from identities they trust and identities trusted by identities they trust. FMS is developed anonymously and can be downloaded from the FMS freesite within <b>Freenet.</b> It {{does not have an}} official site on the normal Internet. It features random post delay, support for many identities, and a distinction between trusting a user's posts and trusting their trust list. It is written in C++ and is a separate application from <b>Freenet</b> which uses the <b>Freenet</b> Client Protocol (FCP) to interface with <b>Freenet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another Internet network, {{initiated}} by the UNDP, including support from USAID, was started in Armenia in 1997 and is also called <b>Freenet.</b> , users of <b>Freenet</b> in Armenia cannot access web pages on servers outside of Armenia. Apart from this restriction on website access, the degree of censorship on <b>Freenet</b> in Armenia is unknown.|$|E
50|$|While <b>Freenet</b> {{provides}} an HTTP interface for browsing freesites, {{it is not}} a proxy for the World Wide Web; <b>Freenet</b> can be used to access only the content that has been previously inserted into the <b>Freenet</b> network. In this way, it is more similar to Tor's hidden services than to anonymous proxy software like Tor's proxy.|$|E
5000|$|Frost: Frost {{includes}} {{support for}} convenient file sharing, but its design is inherently vulnerable to spam and {{denial of service}} attacks. Frost can be downloaded from the Frost home page on Sourceforge, or from the Frost freesite within <b>Freenet.</b> It is not endorsed by the <b>Freenet</b> developers. Frost is written in Java and is a separate application from <b>Freenet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{network is}} said to be {{scalable}} if its performance does not deteriorate even if the network is very large. The scalability of <b>Freenet</b> is being evaluated, but similar architectures have been shown to scale logarithmically. This work indicates that <b>Freenet</b> can find data in [...] hops on a small-world network (which includes both opennet and darknet style <b>Freenet</b> networks), when ignoring the caching which could improve the scalability for popular content. However, this scalability is difficult to test without a very large network. Furthermore, the security features inherent to <b>Freenet</b> make detailed performance analysis (including things as simple as determining the size of the network) difficult to do accurately. As of now, the scalability of <b>Freenet</b> has yet to be tested.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{relatively}} high prices for <b>Freenet</b> devices have kept away domestic users from the service. Oftentimes, modified amateur radio transceivers are used, violating the restrictions for the <b>Freenet</b> service.|$|E
5000|$|As of version 0.7, <b>Freenet</b> {{supports}} both [...] "darknet" [...] and [...] "opennet" [...] connections. Opennet {{connections are}} made automatically by nodes with opennet enabled, while darknet connections are manually established between users that know and trust each other. <b>Freenet</b> developers describe the trust needed as “will not crack their <b>Freenet</b> node”. [...] Opennet connections {{are easy to}} use, but darknet connections are more secure against attackers on the network, and can {{make it difficult for}} an attacker (such as an oppressive government) to even determine that a user is running <b>Freenet</b> in the first place.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freenet</b> AG (formerly freenet.de AG) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{independent}} German telecommunications and web content providers. The company was formerly a subsidiary of Mobilcom. In 2004, its EBITDA was 471.5 million euro. In 2007, Freenet.de merged with Mobilcom, a deal which took around two years to complete, and the resulting company changed its name to <b>Freenet</b> AG. In July 2008 <b>Freenet</b> AG acquired debitel AG, another German telecommunications company.|$|E
50|$|Reports of Freenet's use in authoritarian {{nations is}} {{difficult}} to track due to {{the very nature of}} Freenet's goals. One group, <b>Freenet</b> China, used to introduce the <b>Freenet</b> software to Chinese users starting from 2001 and distribute it within China through e-mails and on disks after the group's website was blocked by the Chinese authorities on the mainland. It was reported that in 2002 <b>Freenet</b> China had several thousand dedicated users.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freenet</b> {{has always}} been free software, but until 2011 it {{required}} users to install Java. This problem was solved by making <b>Freenet</b> compatible with OpenJDK, a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform.|$|E
5000|$|FCPLib: FCPLib (<b>Freenet</b> Client Protocol Library) aims to be a {{cross-platform}} natively compiled set of C++-based {{functions for}} storing and retrieving information {{to and from}} <b>Freenet.</b> FCPLib supports Windows NT/2K/XP, Debian, BSD, Solaris, and macOS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Freenet</b> is a {{national}} radio allocation that is used in Germany only. Foreign regulatory bodies usually do not permit use of <b>Freenet</b> devices since the frequencies are often already allocated for different radio services. Instead, PMR446 has been harmonised on a European level.Due to possible interference with Swiss military networks, it is not permitted to use the <b>Freenet</b> frequencies in the Black Forest and on the Swabian Alb at elevations of 600 metres or above.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Freenet</b> {{file sharing}} network stores {{documents}} and {{allows them to}} be retrieved later by an associated key, as is now possible with protocols such as HTTP. The network {{is designed to be}} highly survivable. The system has no central servers and is not subject to the control of any one individual or organization, including the designers of <b>Freenet.</b> Information stored on <b>Freenet</b> is distributed around the network and stored on several different nodes. Encryption of data and relaying of requests makes it difficult to determine who inserted content into <b>Freenet,</b> who requested that content, or where the content was stored. This protects the anonymity of participants, and also makes it very difficult to censor specific content. Content is stored encrypted, making it difficult for even the operator of a node to determine what is stored on that node. This provides plausible deniability, and in combination with the request relaying means that safe harbor laws that protect service providers may also protect <b>Freenet</b> node operators. When asked about the topic, <b>Freenet</b> developers defer to the EFF discussion which says that not being able to filter anything is a safe choice.|$|E
50|$|The {{distributed}} {{data store}} of <b>Freenet</b> {{is used by}} many third-party programs and plugins to provide microblogging and media sharing, anonymous and decentralised version tracking, blogging, a generic web of trust for decentralized spam resistance, Shoeshop for using <b>Freenet</b> over Sneakernet, and many more.|$|E
