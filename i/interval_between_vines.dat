40|$|This study {{investigated}} how spatial <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> successive visual flashes {{are influenced by}} the temporal <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> auditory pure tones presented concurrently with the flashes. Three successive visual flashes defined two spatial intervals with different extents as well as two equal temporal intervals. The onsets of the first and third tones were temporally aligned with those of the first and third flashes, while the onset of the second tone was temporally offset to that of the second visual flash, resulting in shorter or longer temporal <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> pairs of tones. Observers judged which of the first or second spatial <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> flashes was shorter. The results showed that the shorter temporal <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> tones caused underestimation of the spatial <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> flashes. On the other hand, stimuli without the first and third tones did not result in underestimation of spatial <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> flashes.

50|$|Transpositionally {{symmetrical}} sets either {{divide the}} octave evenly, {{or can be}} written as the union of equally sized sets that themselves divide the octave evenly. Inversionally symmetrical chords are invariant under reflections in pitch class space. This means that the chords can be ordered cyclically so that the series of <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> successive notes is the same read forward or backward. For instance, in the cyclical ordering (0, 1, 2, 7), the <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> {{the first and second}} note is 1, the <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> the second and third note is 1, the <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> the third and fourth note is 5, and the <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> the fourth note and the first note is 5.|$|R

2500|$|Viticulture in Spain has {{developed}} in {{adaptation to the}} varied and extreme climate of the region. The dry weather {{in many parts of}} Spain reduces the threat of common viticultural hazards like downy mildew and powdery mildew as well as the development of Botrytis cinerea. In these parts, the threat of drought and the poor fertility of the land has encouraged Spanish vineyard owners to plant their vines with widely spaced rows so that there is less competition <b>between</b> <b>vines</b> for resources. One widely adopted system is known as marco real and involves having [...] of space <b>between</b> <b>vines</b> in all directions. These areas, mostly in the south and central regions, have some of the lowest vine density in the worldoften ranging <b>between</b> 375-650 <b>vines</b> per acre (900-1600 vines per hectare). This is less than 1/8 of the vine density commonly found in other wine regions such as Bordeaux and Burgundy. Many Spanish vineyards are several decades old, with the old vines producing even lower yields of fruit. In the Jumilla region of Murcia, for example, yields are often less than 1.1 ton per acre (20 hl/ha).|$|R

This paper presents a model developed to establish the optimal time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections for a two-unit cold standby system with component repair and subject to periodic inspection, considering reliability and costs. A Markov chain is used to define possible states, their transition probabilities and the mean time to system failure, {{as a function of}} the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections. Given the mean time to system failure, the steady state availability is determined. Finally, the costs related to the system maintenance are established and a cost function is developed and optimized for the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections. Numerical examples are presented and results for different system parameters are compared. Besides optimizing the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> inspections, the analyses also reveal the effect of repair time on system availability and mean time to system failure...|$|R

The discrete Lyapunov function is a discretization of a continuous Lyapunov function assumed to be known for the idealized system. With this framework, we determine the maximum time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> mea-surements of each state variable to guarantee the non-increasing property for the discrete Lyapunov function. ...|$|R

40|$|Deep inspirations (DIs) have a dilatory {{effect on}} airway smooth muscle (ASM) {{that helps to}} prevent or reduce more severe bronchoconstriction in healthy individuals. However, this {{bronchodilation}} appears to fail in some asthmatic patients or under certain conditions, {{and the reason is}} unclear. Additionally, quantitative effects of the frequency and magnitude of DIs on bronchodilation are not well understood. In the present study, we used a computational model of bronchoconstriction to study the effects of DI volumes, time <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> intermittent DIs, relative speed of ASM constriction, and ASM activation on bronchoconstriction and the emergence of ventilation defects (VDefs). Our results showed a synergistic effect between the volume of DIs and the time <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> them on bronchoconstriction and VDefs. There was a domain of conditions with sufficiently large volumes of DIs and short time <b>intervals</b> <b>between</b> them to prevent VDefs. Among conditions without VDefs, larger volumes of DIs resulted in greater airway dilation. Similarly, the time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> DIs, during which the activated ASM re-constricts, affected the amplitude of periodic changes in airway radii. Both the relative speed of ASM constriction and ASM activation affected what volume of DIs and what time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> them could prevent the emergence of VDefs. In conclusion, quantitative characteristics of DIs, such as their volume and time <b>interval</b> <b>between</b> them, affect bronchoconstriction and may contribute to difficulties in asthma.
