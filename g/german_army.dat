5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen {{was supposed to have}} been captured on the first day of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive were in the midst of destroying the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> Group Centre. In France, the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of the <b>German</b> <b>Army,</b> including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.|$|E

Unknown to the Soviet forces, the <b>German</b> <b>army</b> was regrouping in the center of operations for the offensive around Kharkov. On 10 May, Paulus submitted his final draft of Operation Fredericus and feared a Soviet attack. By then, the <b>German</b> <b>army</b> opposite Timoshenko was ready for the operation towards the Caucasus.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} West German state organisations were {{responsible}} for policing {{the western side of}} the border. These included the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS, Federal Border Protection), the Bayerische Grenzpolizei (Bavarian Border Police) and the Bundeszollverwaltung (Federal Customs Administration).

5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the occupiers through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the <b>German</b> <b>army.</b>|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, the SS had consolidated into its final form, which comprised three main organizations: the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände, and the Waffen-SS, {{which was founded in}} 1934 as the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) and renamed in 1940. The Waffen-SS evolved into a second <b>German</b> <b>army</b> alongside the Wehrmacht and operated in tandem with them, especially with the Heer (<b>German</b> <b>Army).</b> Although SS ranks generally had equivalents in the other services, the SS rank system did not copy the terms and ranks used by the Wehrmacht's branches. Instead it used the ranks established by the post-World War I Freikorps and the SA. This was primarily done to emphasize the SS as being independent from the Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used as a weapon on April 22, 1915, at Ypres by the <b>German</b> <b>Army.</b> The effect on the allies was devastating because the {{existing}} gas masks were difficult to deploy and had not been broadly distributed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the Belgian civilian population along their route of advance. These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against the <b>German</b> <b>army.</b> Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as The Rape of Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by the <b>German</b> <b>army</b> between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable sympathy for the Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The sympathy for the plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In the south, the Second Panzer Army {{initially}} advanced towards Tula {{with relative}} ease because the Mozhaisk defense line {{did not extend}} that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance. However bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed the <b>German</b> <b>army,</b> and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October. The German plan initially called for the rapid capture of Tula, followed by a pincer move around Moscow. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on 29 October, after a fight {{within sight of the}} city. On 31 October, the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> high command ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the rasputitsa subsided.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that out of 39,000 Jews in the country only 9,000 survived; the rest were either killed or deported to Germany, both by the local authorities and the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> itself. Croatian and Serbian sources disagree on the exact figures.|$|E
5|$|Launched on 10 May 1940, {{the revised}} version of Unternehmen Gelb (Operation Yellow), {{also known as the}} Manstein Plan, succeeded. Unfortunately for the Germans, the British Army escaped during the Battle of Dunkirk. Nevertheless, the Belgian Army, Dutch Army and most of the elite French forces were {{destroyed}} in the encirclement. This left just second rate French units to combat the entire <b>German</b> <b>Army.</b> The Luftwaffe had played an integral part in disrupting Allied operations in this early phase. The Luftwaffe's participation was particularly crucial during the Battle of Sedan which enabled the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> to carry out Operation Yellow. By early June the Dunkirk siege was over, and on 3 June, the Germans began preparations for the conquest of the rest of France under the codename Fall Rot (Case Red). For this to be as successful, air superiority would be required first, as it had been during Operation Yellow.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} German veterans, Göring was {{a proponent of}} the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the {{civilian}} leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Mölders {{was born}} on 18 March 1913 in Gelsenkirchen, the son of teacher Viktor Mölders and his wife Annemarie Mölders. He was the third of four children.

5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium {{under the}} {{operational}} plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). The Allied armies attempted {{to halt the}} <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> in Belgium, believing {{it to be the}} main German thrust. After the French had fully committed the best of the Allied armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a break-through, or sickle cut, through the Ardennes, and advanced toward the English Channel. The <b>German</b> <b>Army</b> (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied armies. The Germans gradually reduced the pocket of Allied forces, forcing them back to the sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle.|$|E

500|$|Initially, the Soviet forces {{conducted}} a strategic defence of the Moscow Oblast by constructing three defensive belts, deploying newly raised reserve armies, and bringing {{troops from the}} Siberian and Far Eastern Military Districts.

The decisive Battle of Sedan was fought less than a month later.|$|R
