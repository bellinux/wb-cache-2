25|$|While 1985 {{was to be}} {{the last}} year of the second <b>generation</b> <b>model,</b> delays in {{production}} of the third <b>generation</b> <b>model</b> led to a surplus of second generation Supras. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. P-types were the only model available in 1986.|$|E
