5|$|Curse of Enchantia {{was officially}} {{revealed}} under this title at the European Computer Trade Show (ECTS) in April 1992. The game was originally {{planned to be}} released in September 1992, but got delayed two months to November 1992. It was the first adventure game by Core Design as well {{as one of the first}} CD-ROM adventure games. Virgin Games bundled it with many of the earliest PC CD-ROM <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> 1993. It was also re-released on CD as part of Encore Multipack, together with Heimdall and Thunderhawk. The game's original release was accompanied by a promotional campaign with valuable prizes (computers and money) in some magazines such as France's Joystick. Owners of computers with newer PC operating systems need to run it using DOSBox.|$|E
5|$|He {{funded the}} {{formation}} of a Young Men's Christian Association in Kokomo where he and his son became active. Haynes taught swimming classes and regularly took underprivileged young boys to movies and bought them dinners. After several years of active membership at the local level, he was elected president of the national YMCA in 1919 and served two one-year terms. His primary focus during his tenure was the launching of several successful membership <b>drives.</b> <b>In</b> 1920, he was appointed to the Indiana State Board of Education by Governor James P. Goodrich where he advocated increased state funding for vocational education.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota drove 71 {{yards on}} its first possession, scored the game's first points on a 27-yard field goal by Adam Bailey and led 3–0 after one quarter. After the opening drive, Michigan's defense shut down the Golden Gophers, {{allowing}} only 33 yards of total offense {{in the remainder of}} the game. Minnesota was held to 10 yards of total offense in the entire second half, as Michigan extended its fourth-quarter shutout to 8 games. Michigan also held its opponent without a touchdown for the fifth time in 8 games and shut down Minnesota so effectively that Michigan started four <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> Minnesota territory in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Some Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood <b>drives.</b> <b>In</b> the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were held accountable. Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{advance in}} this region {{developed}} into three <b>drives.</b> <b>In</b> the west, forces advanced north from Sattelberg following its capture, while in the east, an advance was made from North Hill on the coast, north of Scarlet Beach, where the Australians had landed earlier in the campaign. A smaller drive {{was made in the}} centre from Nongora, which lay in between the two, although this was limited and subsequently linked up with the coastal drive. Although possessing significant forces, the Australian advance proved slow. Heavy rain and harsh terrain slowed the Australian resupply efforts and reduced the mobility of their manoeuvre elements. Disease and fatigue also heavily depleted their infantry, with more casualties being suffered from illnesses than combat.|$|E
5|$|At Denver, Manning again led three scoring <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> {{the fourth}} quarter in a 34–31 shootout win. He {{completed}} 32-of-39 passes for 345 yards and three touchdowns. Following a second straight season with a win at New England, then a home win against Buffalo, the Colts were the NFL's last unbeaten team at 9–0. Their first loss would come in Dallas. Plagued by a run defense that would allow over 100 yards in every game, the Colts were 11–4 heading into their final game. Against Miami, Manning threw for 282 yards, two touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown. The Colts won 27–22, were AFC South division champions, and clinched the third seed in the AFC playoffs. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He ended the regular season with 4,397 passing yards and a league-leading 31 touchdown passes. His passer rating (101.0) was {{the highest in the}} league for the third year in a row. Manning helped the offense set an NFL record for third down conversion rate in a season (56.1%).|$|E

5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> an era when batsmen played this shot very well.|$|E
5|$|In Week 10, the Colts {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh, {{who had the}} league's highest ranked defense. They trailed 17–7 {{in the second quarter}} before Manning found tight end Dallas Clark for a two-yard touchdown to end the half 17–14. Down 20–17 in the 4th quarter, Manning found running back Dominic Rhodes uncovered for a 17-yard touchdown pass that would put the Colts up 24–20 {{for the rest of the}} game. It was Manning's fourth game-winning drive (35th of his career) of the season. He completed 21 of 40 for 240 yards and three touchdowns (the 50th game of his career with 3+ touchdown passes). It was the first time the Colts have won in Pittsburgh since 1968 (12 straight losses before this win). Against Houston, Manning passed for 320 yards and two touchdowns while leading five consecutive scoring <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> a 33–27 victory, the third in a row for the Colts. Manning won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second time this season (18th time, career).|$|E
5|$|Razer {{made its}} debut in the fourth heat of series two of Robot Wars, which was viewed by almost six million people on BBC Two. It had been {{finished}} late {{the night before the}} recording. Radio interference caused Razer to be hard to control in the Gauntlet stage of the competition, but it successfully navigated the obstacle course and progressed to the Trial. This phase was a robotic football match, wherein Razer scored the first goal to reach the heat semi-final. Its opponent for this one-on-one battle was Inquisitor, a box-shaped robot equipped with a rotating flail. Whilst Razer made the stronger start, crumpling Inquisitor's flail support, the cush <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> its motors sheared after an impact on the arena floor. This rendered Razer immobile and ended a promising run.|$|E

5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E
40|$|Context: Authorizing {{powered two-wheeler}} drivers to <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> lanes {{reserved}} to buses {{is a measure}} that is sometimes mentioned to improve mobility conditions for these users. But what effect would this measure have on {{the safety of the}}se users and on the safety of the other users with whom they share the traffic space? Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} contribute elements to help answer this question. More precisely, the objective is to estimate the risk of having an accident per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes and to compare this risk with that of powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> general traffic lanes. Method: Using the bodily injury accidents recorded by the police over two years on thirteen roads in the city of Marseille and a campaign of periodical observations of powered two-wheeler traffic, we estimated the risk per kilometer driven by powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes and compared it with that of drivers who do not <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> them. Results: The results show that the risk for powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes of being involved in a bodily injury accident is significantly higher than the risk run by drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> general traffic lanes. For the thirteen roads studied, it is on average 3, 25 times higher (95 % CI: 2, 03; 5, 21). Conclusion: In the current situation, powered two-wheeler drivers who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> bus lanes are less safe than those who <b>drive</b> <b>in</b> general traffic lanes. The analysis of police reports suggests that part of this increased risk comes from collisions between automobile drivers turning right and powered two-wheelers driving in the bus lane who continue straight ahead...|$|R

5|$|There {{is still}} a huge demand for Villeneuve memorabilia at the race-track shops and several books {{have been written about}} him. The number 27, the number of his Ferrari in 1981 and 1982, is still closely {{associated}} with him by fans. Jean Alesi, whose aggression and speed in the wet were compared to Villeneuve's, also used the number at Ferrari. Villeneuve's son, Jacques, drove the #27 during his IndyCar and Indianapolis 500 winning season with Team Green, and has also used the number for occasional <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> NASCAR and the Speedcar Series. Canadian driver Andrew Ranger used number 27 in the 2005 and 2006 Champ Car seasons, and continued using the number at NASCAR Canadian Tire Series since 2007. Canadian driver and 2011 IndyCar Rookie of the Year James Hinchcliffe adopted the number 27 for the 2012 season when he joined Andretti Autosport (former Andretti Green Racing).|$|E
5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in {{the preseason}} opener on August 11, Kafka {{replaced}} Young at quarterback during the second quarter and played into the fourth quarter. He went 13-of-19 for 132yards with one interception thrown to Ravens safety Bernard Pollard in the game. In {{the second week of}} the preseason on August 18 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Kafka entered the game in the fourth quarter and led the Eagles to two scoring <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> a 24–14 loss. With less than four minutes remaining in the game, he threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Gerald Jones, and with only 19 seconds left on the following drive, threw a second touchdown pass to Jones for sevenyards. He finished the game going 14-for-19 for 160yards along with the two scores. Kafka played in garbage time in the next preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, handing the ball off twice and kneeling down twice. Against the New York Jets {{in the preseason}} finale, he filled in for the injured Young, who started the game, to start the third quarter. Kafka had the wind knocked out of him on a sack, but was able to play the rest of the game despite a rib contusion. He finished the game 7-for-11 for 76yards and one interception. He went 34-for-49 for 369yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the preseason overall.|$|E
5|$|The Bears visited Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis to {{play the}} Rams, again without Jay Cutler. However, the Rams were also without {{starting}} quarterback Sam Bradford, and instead had Kellen Clemens as backup. The Bears had won four consecutive games against the Rams. Two rookie players the Bears' defense had to contain were running back Zac Stacy, who recorded an average of 107.7 {{yards and three touchdowns}} in the previous three games, along with ranking second among rookie running backs with 537 rushing yards; and receiver Tavon Austin, who recorded 314 yards against the Indianapolis Colts in the previous week. Additionally, the Rams' offense was ranked fourth in the NFL with 54.6 percent of yardage occurring after the catch. For the Bears' offense, Jeff Joniak wrote they needed to avoid attempting to score in the red zone; in the previous three games, the Bears had 12 <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> the red zone, but managed to score only four touchdowns, while also allowing a turnover, and was ranked 13th after scoring 55 percent. Meanwhile, the Rams had forced quarterbacks to record only a 45.8 passer rating when in the red zone, along with the second lowest completion percentage, and the third fewest completions recorded. Also, St. Louis led the league in red zone interceptions with six. Finally, the Rams led the league in overall sack percentage with 9.4, while defensive end Robert Quinn had the most knockdowns and hurries in the NFL, and was second in sacks with 12. An advantage Chicago had, however, was the second-most passing touchdowns in the NFL with 15, while Josh McCown's average gain per pass is higher than Cutler's, with a 7.47 to 7.20. The Rams also did not have the capable secondary to cover the trio of Martellus Bennett, Alshon Jeffery and Brandon Marshall.|$|E

5|$|To free up US {{troops for}} {{service in the}} Philippines, the Australians took over from the US {{garrison}} on Bougainville, and the 3rd Division arrived around Torokina, on Bougainville, in November 1944. Prior to their arrival, the US garrison had maintained a defensive posture, but the Australians launched a limited-scale offensive on the island which evolved into three main <b>drives</b> <b>in</b> the north, south and in {{the centre of the}} island. The 15th Battalion embarked on the transport Cape Victory at Pinkenba on 23 November, and arrived on Bougainville on four days later. Along {{with the rest of the}} 29th Brigade, it relieved the US 182 Infantry Regiment, and was assigned to the southern drive towards Buin, where the main Japanese force was based. Its first involvement with the campaign came in December, when the 15th Battalion departed the Jaba River and led the 29th Brigade's advance along the western coast towards the Tavera River. Upon reaching the river, in order to skirt around the thick jungle, a company was sent up the Adele River on a barge, while the rest of the battalion advanced inland along the Mendai Road. By January 1945, the 15th was joined by the 29th Brigade's other two battalions and together they fought through to Mawaraka, before being relieved by the 15th Battalion's old formation, the 7th Brigade. They were subsequently sent back to Torokina for rest, remaining there until early July 1945.|$|E
