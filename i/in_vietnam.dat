5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} deaths <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> Many {{fishermen and}} sailors were caught at sea {{in the path}} of the storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, the death toll <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam</b> was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464. Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, and a total of 3,513 people were rescued after the storm.

30|$|The {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam’s</b> medicines {{imports from}} the EU would be 9.8  % lower in scenario 2 than in scenario 1.

However, the reduction of 9.8  % implies that the deeper integration of Vietnam with two other groups would not result in a big decrease <b>in</b> <b>Vietnam’s</b> imports from the EU. Therefore, the EU would still be leading pharmaceutical market of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>in</b> the coming years.|$|R
