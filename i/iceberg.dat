5|$|That same month, Unicorn was {{transferred}} to the newly formed BPF. She left Durban on 1 January 1945 and arrived at Colombo, Ceylon where she conducted deck-landing practice for pilots new to the BPF. The ship loaded 82 aircraft and 120 engines later in the month for transport to Australia, emptying the available stocks of the Eastern Fleet, and departed for Sydney on 29 January. Unicorn arrived on 12 February and disembarked her stored aircraft. She sailed for Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 February to support the BPF's training before the opening stages of Operation <b>Iceberg.</b> The ship arrived at San Pedro Bay, Philippines on 27 March which was to serve as the BPF's intermediate replenishment base while it supported Operation <b>Iceberg.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Icebergs</b> are an {{important}} part of the fresh-water cycle and, until now, have not been explicitly represented in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) class coupled global circulation models (CGCMs) of the climate system. In this study we examine the impact of introducing interactive <b>icebergs</b> in a next-generation CGCM designed for 21 st Century climate predictions. The frozen fresh-water discharge from land is used as calving to create <b>icebergs</b> in the coupled system which are then free to evolve and interact with the sea-ice and ocean components. <b>Icebergs</b> are fully prognostic, represented as point particles and evolve according to momentum and mass balance equations. About 100, 000 individual particles are present at any time in the simulations but represent many more <b>icebergs</b> through a clustering approach. The various finite sizes of <b>icebergs,</b> which are prescribed by a statistical distribution at the calving points, lead to a finite life-time of <b>icebergs</b> ranging from weeks, for the smallest <b>icebergs</b> (60 m length), up to years for the largest (2. 2 km length). The resulting melt water distribution seen by the ocean enhances deep-water formation, in particular on the continental shelves, relative to the model without <b>icebergs.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered <b>Iceberg</b> Alley.

5|$|On 14 April 1912, George Washington {{passed a}} {{particularly}} large <b>iceberg</b> {{south of the}} Grand Banks of Newfoundland and radioed a warning to all ships in the area, including White Star Line ocean liner , which sank near the same location.

50|$|Approximately 40,000 {{medium to}} large <b>icebergs</b> {{annually}} calve from Greenland glaciers, {{and depending on}} wind, and air and water temperature, between 400 and 800 of these go {{as far south as}} 48° north latitude (St. John's). <b>Icebergs</b> are most commonly seen in the waters off Newfoundland in the spring and early summer.Despite their size, the <b>icebergs</b> of Newfoundland move an average of 17 km a day. The average mass of <b>icebergs</b> in the Grand Banks area is between one and two hundred thousand tonnes. These <b>icebergs</b> represent a significant threat to shipping and off-shore oil platforms and the hazard is aggravated by dense fog in this area.|$|R
40|$|Red Ice – White Ice’ is {{a series}} of three large format {{photographic}} nocturnal images by Wainwright showing <b>icebergs</b> from Disko Bay, Greenland that are lit to give the impression of heat {{against the backdrop of the}} Arctic night.

However, they start floating as <b>icebergs</b> when their size is small enough to drift to the sea. These <b>icebergs</b> are seen in two shades: milky white and bright blue, which depends on the air trapped within the ice and is an interplay of light and ice crystals.|$|R

5|$|Western Europe and North America {{were the}} {{original}} major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer {{different types of}} lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially <b>iceberg,</b> lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} <b>iceberg</b> lettuce, 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production. Stem lettuce was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 90% of <b>icebergs</b> in the North Atlantic {{come from}} about 100 iceberg-producing glaciers on the Greenland coast. Once {{detached}} from the glaciers, <b>icebergs</b> are transported southward through the Davis Strait by the Labrador Current.|$|R
60|$|Then rose a {{very clever}} guess. They {{must have been}} carried by <b>icebergs,</b> as much silt and stones (we know) has been carried, and have dropped, like them, to the bottom, when the <b>icebergs</b> melted.|$|R
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the <b>iceberg</b> with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an <b>iceberg</b> floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is <b>iceberg</b> watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E
2500|$|Jakobshavn Glacier drains 6.5% of the Greenland {{ice sheet}} and {{produces}} around 10% of all Greenland <b>icebergs.</b> Some 35 billion tonnes of <b>icebergs</b> calve off and pass {{out of the}} fjord every year.

5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant <b>iceberg</b> that would float back to the surface. However, the wreck is far too fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E
5|$|Another failed product, {{this time}} under Grand Metropolitan's {{successor}} Diageo, was the BK Back Porch Grillers line of burgers that featured a spiced and flavored patty {{served on a}} bakery-style roll.

40|$|<b>Icebergs</b> {{represent}} hazards to {{maritime traffic}} and offshore operations. Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is very valuable for {{the observation of}} polar regions and extensive work was already carried out on detection and tracking of large <b>icebergs.</b> However, the identification of small <b>icebergs</b> is still challenging especially when these are embedded in sea ice. In this work, a new detector is proposed based on incoherent dual-polarization SAR images. The algorithm considers the limited extension of small <b>icebergs,</b> which {{are supposed to have}} a stronger cross polarization and higher cross- over co-polarization ratio compared to the surrounding sea or sea ice background. The new detector is tested with two satellite systems. Firstly, RADARSAT- 2 quad-polarimetric images are analyzed to evaluate the effects of high resolution data. Subsequently a more exhaustive analysis is carried out using dual-polarization ground detected Sentinel- 1 a Extra Wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test areas are on the East Coast of Greenland, where several <b>icebergs</b> have been observed. A quantitative analysis and a comparison with a detector using only the cross polarization channel is carried out exploiting grounded <b>icebergs</b> as test targets. The proposed methodology improves the contrast between <b>icebergs</b> and sea ice clutter by up to 75 times. This returns an improved probability of detection...|$|R
40|$|<b>Icebergs,</b> at present, {{are living}} a second life on screens. While {{they are one}} of the natural world’s most {{photogenic}} objects, <b>icebergs</b> are also subject to modes of representation through parametric modeling applications. The purpose of this digital life on screens is largely confined to determining how, and under what conditions, <b>icebergs</b> can be made a source of potable water for the planet. Yet <b>icebergs</b> have a story to tell about the epistemological and economic production of northern natural resources. Distinct institutional actors, from oceanographers and military engineers to Saudi royalty and software design companies, have sought to control and come to know <b>icebergs</b> through specific practices of modeling. I argue that the representation of <b>icebergs</b> is a contingent practice that has often been bound up with processes of commodification. To come to know <b>icebergs</b> we have to come to know how these quintessentially polar phenomena have been represented and commodified, across the twentieth century and at a significant remove from the highest latitudes of the planet. The increasing pace of northern development, with natural resources at the vanguard of corporate and governmental incursions, signals the emergence of “media environments” that are extending the representation of (and control over) natural phenomena through a series of media technologies, from 3 D modeling applications and collections of satellite data to virtual reality environments and predictive algorithms...|$|R
