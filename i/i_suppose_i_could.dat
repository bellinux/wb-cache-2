Beat him again, and put him back in until he was burnt alive. I did nothing to stop it. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have brandished my weapon or shot in the air, but I was not {{inclined}} to do so. Does that make me an accomplice to murder?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} girl; [...] "in a way it's worse than that. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go--somewhere--but there's Mrs. Marvin and Elsie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to send}} {{a message}} south," [...] said Mr. Oliver, writing {{something}} on a form. [...] "It's a code address. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get an answer in an hour or so?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> My {{words had}} evidently {{completely}} upset Mr. Stillwell.|$|R
60|$|I said (glancing at Joe, {{who stood}} looking on, motionless), that <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come directly.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. You {{never asked}} yourself, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do without YOU.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shouldn't {{like to be}} flogged, but as you say the convicts don't {{think much}} of it, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear it. They used to flog in our army and navy till quite lately." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} {{that you would like}} me to go to London for you, and search through your uncle's effects?" [...] Deane asked quietly. [...] "If you gave me a letter, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'll go {{and make}} love {{at once to}} Clara Van Siever. There's enough of pluck left in me {{to ask her to}} marry me, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage to go through the {{ceremony}} if she accepted me." ...|$|E
6000|$|He saw, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} {{smiling at the}} {{simplicity}} of this reply; and added, with a smile upon his own ingenuous face: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true, but it doesn't excuse me. I {{ought to}} be a power in the firm, and <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even keep one of its books properly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Irene {{threw her}} arms round her. [...] "Oh, it was a SPLENDID call! <b>I</b> didn't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make it go off so well. We talked nearly the whole time about you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our little joke!" [...] {{retorted}} his wife. [...] "I wish we {{were going}} to stay longer in Vienna. They say you have to make bargains for everything in Italy, and here <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> shop just as at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so sorry, because I {{particularly}} {{wished to}} speak to you,--most particularly. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{see you in the}} morning? But, no; it would not do. I could not get you alone without making such a fuss of the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have a feeling," [...] he said, {{advancing}} {{to the table and}} laying his hand upon the green cloth, [...] "that I should like to join ye in this reception of our illustrious visitor. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk with the rest?" ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{live to be}} {{nine hundred}} and ninety-nine years old <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever forget that walk. I, remember, it about as keenly as the chagrin I {{suffered}} on another occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I think so. From {{what we have}} heard, Mrs. Arabin must {{be either}} there or at Venice, and <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn from any one at Paris at which town she is staying at this moment." ...|$|R
60|$|If you {{detect any}} awkwardness in my {{movements}} and infelicities in my conduct I will offer the explanation that I never presided {{at a meeting}} of any kind before in my life, and that I do find it out of my line. <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do anything anybody else <b>could,</b> but <b>I</b> recognize that experience helps, and I do feel the lack of that experience. I don't feel as graceful and easy as I ought to be in order to impress an audience. I shall not pretend that I know how to umpire a meeting like this, and I shall just take the humble place of the Essex band.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A likely story! What, {{you came}} to ask the apple-trees?' and James scornfully laughed. 'There was no back-door, <b>I</b> <b>suppose!</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forgive you {{anything}} but such a barefaced falsehood, when {{you know it was}} your own intolerable carelessness that was the only cause of the accident!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't {{understand}} why you've set your mind on me," [...] March said. [...] "I haven't had, any magazine experience, you know that; and I haven't seriously {{attempted to do}} anything in literature since I was married. I gave up smoking and the Muse together. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still manage a cigar, but I don't believe I could--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, let me think. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{go to the}} university, too, {{and learn}} a little about food and babies and {{building}} houses and government. I {{need to go to}} school a lot more than you do. Besides auction and the piano--which I play very badly--and clothes and how to get hold of tickets for successful plays, I don't know one single thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it is no}} trouble. I {{have nothing}} to do. I never have {{anything}} to do. <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it if I had. I should be delighted to come with you, sir, if I can be of any use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{question}} you wished to ask me," [...] Captain Bayley said, [...] "was, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{give you any}} clue as to who was the woman you took in, and whose child you adopted? She was my daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|He smiled. [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> could," [...] he said; [...] "and <b>I</b> also <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{pull her}} out of the water the first time she hooked a big fish. It would be like resting a boat on a pivot to put her into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Festing {{told him}} he looked thoughtful. [...] "I didn't know things were quite as bad! Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get another cheque, but don't want to put too much strain on Sadie's generosity. She might imagine I'd got on a jag! There are {{drawbacks}} to having a character like mine; it's easier lived up to than got rid of. However, what do you suggest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Mr. Perkins politely. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily {{find out}} by opening it. But {{it is very}} impolite to open other people's letters. I think I have a better plan. Since you refuse to tell me who wrote it, open it yourself, take this chalk, and copy the {{contents}} on the blackboard that we may all enjoy them. And sign the writer's name at the bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forget," [...] she said, [...] "but {{it would}} be very {{difficult}} for either of us to behave as though it had never happened. Besides, it really was an impossible situation, you know," [...] she went on, looking down into the tea-caddy. [...] "It is much better for me to be here with Annie. You can come and see me now and then and we can still be very good friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't, I tell you,' said Lance, hastily {{throwing}} {{himself back}} on the bed, and shutting his eyes. 'It isn't that I won't, but I can't. I couldn't walk straight down the street for giddiness; and if <b>I</b> did, <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> talk sense.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{must pay}} it somehow, <b>I</b> <b>supposed,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear to}} hand over two {{shilling}} pieces into Lucretia's outstretched palm. It was desecration, it was sheer sacrilege. But Lucretia took the half-dollar with the utmost calmness, {{and went out to}} order the sleigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a {{good start}} toward world-fellowship, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>I</b> wish we <b>could</b> do---- Return your lunch or---- Mr. Daggett! Do you read books? I mean----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely. But how? I'm all for {{spreading}} {{sweetness and}} light, and cheering up the jolly old pater's sorrowful existence, but I haven't a bean. And, what is more, things {{have come to}} such a pass that I scan the horizon without seeing a single soul I can touch. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get into Reggie van Tuyl's ribs for a bit, but--I don't know--touching poor old Reggie always seems to me rather like potting a pitting bird." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "of course, I might die, and then, I remember, {{it would}} go back again. Still, that only makes what I {{want to do more}} necessary. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make over to my husband all the money there is in the English bank and {{anything}} else that really belongs to me? That is, I could put it into his account here? You see, I don't want him to know--anything about it for a little while." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{uncertain}} to me, and is to this day, {{who it was}} that danced with me the Wednesday before, when the ball was my own; but that the king was at this assembly was out of question with me, by circumstances that, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be deceived in, and particularly that there were five persons who were not masked; {{three of them had}} blue garters, and they appeared not to me till I came out to dance.|$|E
60|$|The dog 'owled {{a bit at}} fust, but he quieted down arter a bit. He was a nice-looking animal, but one dog is {{much the}} same as another to me, and if I 'ad one ten years <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pick it out from two or three others.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Young enough; {{but it was}} thought, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> light a pipe. We {{were seven}} when we left Naples, all picked men; but I {{was the only one}} who was in Paraguay with M. de Sidonia, and that was nearly the end of our travels, which lasted five years.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Turn into a baby, eh? If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do that, {{and know}} what was {{happening}} to me for but one hour, I should know everything then, and be at rest. But I can't; I can't be a little child again; and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> it would be no use, because then I should then know nothing about what was happening to me. Ah, you lucky little dog!" [...] said the poor old giant.|$|R
