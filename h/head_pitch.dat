50|$|A {{recent study}} by Gottschall and Nichols studied the hindlimb of a decerebrate cat during walking (a CPG {{controlled}} function) in response to changes in <b>head</b> <b>pitch.</b> This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill, downhill and on level surfaces. Proprioceptive (Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles) and exteroreceptive (optic, vestibular and cutaneous) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback. The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors (giving information about the relative location {{of the head and}} body) and vestibular receptors (giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity). Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level, tilted up or tilted down. Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head tilted down. This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal. This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders.|$|E

Method: To test this, we used a head-mounted device (Human-Interfaced Personal Observation platform- HIPOP) on people moving through three different environments; a botanical garden (‘green ’ space), a reef (‘blue ’ space), and a featureless corridor, to examine if head movement in the vertical axis differed between environments.

40|$|Trunk {{and head}} {{movements}} were characterized {{over a wide}} range of walking speeds to determine the relationship between stride length, stepping frequency, vertical head translation, pitch rotation of the head, and pitch trunk rotation as a function of gait velocity. Subjects (26 - 44 years old) walked on a linear treadmill at velocities of 0. 6 - 2. 2 m/s. The head and trunk were modeled as rigid bodies, and rotation and translation were determined using a video-based motion analysis system. At walking speeds up to 1. 2 m/s there was little <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> movement in space, and the <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> relative to the trunk was compensatory for trunk pitch. As walking velocity increased, trunk pitch remained approximately invariant, but a significant head translation developed. This head translation induced compensatory <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> in space, which tended to point the head at a fixed point in front of the subject that remained approximately invariant with regard to walking speed. The predominant frequency of head translation and rotation was restricted to a narrow range from 1. 4 Hz at 0. 6 m/s to 2. 5 Hz at 2. 2 m/s. Within the range of 0. 8 - 1. 8 m/s, subjects tended to increase their stride length rather than step frequency to walk faster, maintaining the predominant frequency of head movement at close to 2. 0 Hz. At walking speeds above 1. 2 m/s, <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> in space was highly coherent with, and compensatory for, vertical head translation. In the range 1. 2 - 1. 8 m/s, the power spectrum of vertical head translation was the most highly tuned, and the relationship between walking speed and head and trunk movements was the most linear. We define this as an optimal range of walking velocity with regard to head-trunk coordination. The coordination of head and trunk movement was less coherent at walking velocities below 1. 2 m/s and above 1. 8 m/s. These results suggest that two mechanisms are utilized to maintain a stable head fixation distance over the optimal range of walking velocities. The relative contribution of each mechanism to head orientation depends on the frequency of head movement and consequently on walking velocity. From consideration of the frequency characteristics of the compensatory <b>head</b> <b>pitch,</b> we infer that compensatory <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> movements may be produced predominantly by the angular vestibulocollic reflex (aVCR) at low walking speeds and by the linear vestibulocollic reflex (1 VCR) at the higher speeds...|$|E
40|$|Astronauts {{returning}} from spaceflight experience neurovestibular disturbances during head movements {{and attempt to}} mitigate them by limiting head motion. Analyses to date of the head movements made during walking have concentrated on amplitude and variability measures extracted from ensemble averages of individual gait cycles. Phase shifts within each gait cycle can be determined by functional data analysis through the computation of time-warping functions. Large, localized variations in the timing of peaks in head kinematics may indicate changes in coordination. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine timing changes in <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> acceleration of astronauts during treadmill walking before and after flight. Six astronauts (5 M/ 1 F; age = 43. 5 +/- 6. 4 yr) participated in the study. Subjects walked at 1. 8 m/sec (4 mph) on a motorized treadmill while reading optotypes displayed on a computer screen 4 m in front of their eyes. Three-dimensional motion of the subject s head was recorded with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) device. Data were recorded twice before flight and four times after landing. The <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> acceleration was calculated by taking the time derivative of the pitch velocity data from the IMU. Data for each session with each subject were time-normalized into gait cycles, then registered to align significant features and create a mean curve. The mean curves of each postflight session for each subject were re-registered based on their preflight mean curve to create time-warping functions. The root mean squares (RMS) of these warping functions were calculated to assess the deviation of <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> acceleration mean curves in each postflight session from the preflight mean curve. After landing, most crewmembers exhibited localized shifts within their <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> acceleration regimes, with the greatest deviations in RMS occurring on landing day or 1 day after landing.

40|$|Understanding the way humans inform {{themselves}} about their environment is pivotal in helping explain our susceptibility to stimuli {{and how this}} modulates behaviour and movement patterns. We present a new device, the Human Interfaced Personal Observation Platform (HIPOP), which is a head-mounted (typically on a hat) unit that logs magnetometry and accelerometry data at high rates and, following appropriate calibration, {{can be used to}} determine the heading and pitch of the wearer’s head. We used this device on participants visiting a botanical garden and noted that although <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> ranged between − 80 ° and 60 °, 25 % confidence limits were restricted to an arc of about 25 ° with a tendency for the head to be pitched down (mean <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> ranged between − 43 ° and 0 °). Mean rates of change of <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> varied between − 0. 00187 °/ 0. 1 s and 0. 00187 °/ 0. 1 s, markedly slower than rates of change of head heading which varied between − 0. 3141 °/ 0. 1 s and 0. 01263 °/ 0. 1 s although frequency distributions of both parameters showed them to be symmetrical and monomodal. Overall, there was considerable variation in both <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> and head heading, which highlighted the role that head orientation might play in exposing people to certain features of the environment. Thus, when used in tandem with accurate position-determining systems, the HIPOP can be used to determine how the head is orientated relative to gravity and geographic North and in relation to geographic position, presenting data on how the environment is being ‘framed’ by people in relation to environmental content...|$|E
40|$|During locomotion, {{there is}} a {{translation}} and compensatory rotation of the head in both the vertical and horizontal planes. During moderate to fast walking (100 m/min), vertical head translation occurs at the frequency of stepping (2 Hz) and generates peak linear acceleration of 0. 37 g. Lateral head translation occurs at the stride frequency (1 Hz) and generates peak linear acceleration of 0. 1 g. Peak <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> and yaw angular velocities are approximately 17 degrees/s. The frequency and magnitude of these head movements are within the operational range of both the linear and angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (IVOR and aVOR). Vertical eye movements undergo a phase reversal from near to far targets. When viewing a far (> 1 m) target, vertical eye velocity is typical of an aVOR response; that is, it is compensatory for <b>head</b> <b>pitch.</b> At close viewing distances (< 1 m), vertical eye velocity is in phase with <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> and is compensatory for vertical head translation, suggesting that the IVOR predominantly generates the eye movement response. Horizontal head movements during locomotion occur at the stride frequency of 1 Hz, where the IVOR gain is low.

This paper reports on a field study that combined an observatory technique with short survey. 203 pedestrians in two sites (signalised and unsignalised crosswalks) were video recorded while crossing the road.

40|$|The {{vestibular}} organs {{can feed}} perceptual processes that build {{a picture of}} our route as we move about in the world. However, raw vestibular signals do not define the path taken because, during travel, the head can undergo accelerations unrelated to the route and also be orientated in any direction to vary the signal. This study investigated the computational {{process by which the}} brain transforms raw vestibular signals for the purpose of route reconstruction. We electrically stimulated the vestibular nerves of human subjects to evoke a virtual head rotation fixed in skull co-ordinates and measure its perceptual effect. The virtual head rotation caused subjects to perceive an illusory whole-body rotation that was a cyclic function of head-pitch angle. They perceived whole-body yaw rotation in one direction with the <b>head</b> <b>pitched</b> forwards, the opposite direction with the <b>head</b> <b>pitched</b> backwards, and no rotation with the head in an intermediate position. A model based on vector operations and the anatomy and firing properties of semicircular canals precisely predicted these perceptions. In effect, a neural process computes the vector dot product between the craniocentric vestibular vector of head rotation and the gravitational unit vector. This computation yields the signal of body rotation in the horizontal plane that feeds our perception of the route travelled...|$|R

40|$|Gaze {{stabilization}} was quantified {{in subjects}} (n= 11) {{as they walked}} on a motorized treadmill (1. 8 m/s) and viewed visual targets at two viewing distances. A "far" target was positioned at 4 m (FAR) {{in front of the}} subject and the "near" target was placed at a distance of 0. 5 m (NEAR). A direct measure of visual acuity was used to assess the overall effectiveness of the gaze stabilization system. The contributions of nonocular mechanisms to the gaze goal were also quantified using a measure of the distance between the subject and point in space where fixation of the visual target would require the least eye movement amplitude (i. e. the head fixation distance (HFD)). Kinematic variables mirrored those of previous investigations with the vertical trunk translation and <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> signals, and the lateral translation and head yaw signals maintaining what appear as antiphase relationships. However, an investigation of the temporal relationships between the maxima and minima of the vertical translation and <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> signals show that while the maximum in vertical translation occurs at the point of the minimum <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> signal, the inverse is not true. The maximum in the <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> signal lags the vertical translation minimum by an average of greater than 12 percent of the step cycle time. Three HFD measures, one each for data in the sagittal and transverse planes, and one that combined the movements from both planes, all revealed changes between the FAR and NEAR target viewing conditions. This reorganization of the nonocular degrees of freedom while walking was consistent with a strategy to reduce the magnitude of the eye movements required when viewing the NEAR target. Despite this reorganization, acuity measures show that image stabilization is not occurring while walking and viewing the NEAR target. Group means indicate that visual acuity is not affected while walking in the FAR condition, but a decrement of 0. 15 logMAR (i. e. 1. 5 eye chart lines) exists between the standing and walking acuity measures when viewing the NEAR target...|$|E

Asymmetry was found in both upright and side-down position indicating that the origin of the vertical response asymmetry is from semicircular canals and the otolithic input does not suppress it. Interestingly, in the frontal plane the electromyographic response was much more symmetric. We suggest that the activation of both anterior and or inhibition of both posterior semicircular canals during downward <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> causes greater phase lead in the electromyographic responses than that observed during upward <b>head</b> <b>pitch.</b> Conversely, the combined stimulation of both anterior and posterior canals (roll stimulation) gives rise to more symmetric responses...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{head and}} eye {{coordination}} was studied {{as a function}} of viewing distance during locomotion. Vertical head translation and pitch movements were measured using a video motion analysis system (Optotrak 3020). Vertical eye movements were recorded using a video-based pupil tracker (Iscan). Subjects (five) walked on a linear treadmill at a speed of 1. 67 m/s (6 km/h) while viewing a target screen placed at distances ranging from 0. 25 to 2. 0 m at 0. 25 -m intervals. The predominant frequency of vertical head movement was 2 Hz. In accordance with previous studies, there was a small <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> rotation, which was compensatory for vertical head translation. The magnitude of the vertical head movements and the phase relationship between head translation and pitch were little affected by viewing distance, and tended to orient the naso-occipital axis of the head at a point approximately 1 m in front of the subject (the head fixation distance or HFD). In contrast, eye velocity was significantly affected by viewing distance. When viewing a far (2 -m) target, vertical eye velocity was 180 degrees out of phase with <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> velocity, with a gain of 0. 8. This indicated that the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) was generating the eye movement response. The major finding was that, at a close viewing distance (0. 25 m), eye velocity was in phase with <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> and compensatory for vertical head translation, suggesting that activation of the linear vestibulo-ocular reflex (lVOR) was contributing to the eye movement response. There was also a threefold increase in the magnitude of eye velocity when viewing near targets, which was consistent with the goal of maintaining gaze on target. The required vertical lVOR sensitivity to cancel an unmodified aVOR response and generate the observed eye velocity magnitude for near targets was almost 3 times that previously measured. Supplementary experiments were performed utilizing body-fixed active <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> rotations at 1 and 2 Hz while viewing a head-fixed target. Results indicated that the interaction of smooth pursuit and the aVOR during visual suppression could modify both the gain and phase characteristics of the aVOR at frequencies encountered during locomotion. When walking, targets located closer than the HFD (1. 0 m) would appear to move {{in the same direction as}} the <b>head</b> <b>pitch,</b> resulting in suppression of the aVOR. The results of the head-fixed target experiment suggest that phase modification of the aVOR during visual suppression could play a role in generating eye movements consistent with the goal of maintaining gaze on targets closer than the HFD, which would augment the lVOR response...|$|E

There were four visual cues conditions (no visual cues, target-nonspecific-cues, target-specific-close cues, and target-specific-far cues). Accuracy was decreased by visual obstruction; this decrease was not mediated by visual cues. However, visual cues modified the swing kinematics and foot placement variability. Therefore, visual cues modified how the task was accomplished, but did not affect the outcome achieved.

40|$|Desert ants are a {{model system}} for animal navigation, using visual memory to follow long routes across both sparse and {{cluttered}} environments. Most accounts of this behaviour assume retinotopic image matching, e. g. recovering heading direction by finding a minimum {{in the image}} difference function as the viewpoint rotates. But most models neglect the potential image distortion that could result from unstable head motion.

The effect of pitch variation can be ameliorated by a memory bank of densely sampled along a route so that an image sufficiently similar in pitch and location is available for comparison.

Nine subjects performed two gaze stabilization tasks while walking at 6. 4 km/hr on a motorized treadmill: 1) focusing on a central point target; 2) reading numeral characters; both presented at 2 m in front at the level of their eyes. While subjects performed the tasks we measured: temporal parameters of gait, full body sagittal plane segmental kinematics of the head, trunk, thigh, shank and foot, accelerations along the vertical axis at the head and the shank, and the vertical forces acting on the support surface. We tested the hypothesis that with the increased demands placed on visual acuity during the number recognition task, subjects would modify full-body segmental kinematics in order to reduce perturbations to the head in order to successfully perform the task. We found that while reading numeral characters as - compared to the central point target: 1) compensatory <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> movement was on average 22 % greater despite the fact that the trunk pitch and trunk vertical translation movement control were not significantly changed; 2) coordination patterns between head and trunk as reflected by the peak cross correlation between the <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> and trunk pitch motion as well as the peak cross correlation between the <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> and vertical trunk translation motion were not significantly changed; 3) knee joint total movement was on average 11 % greater during the period from the heel strike event to the peak knee flexion event in stance phase of the gait cycle; 4) peak acceleration measured at the head was significantly reduced by an average of 13 % in four of the six subjects. This was so even when the peak acceleration at the shank and the transmissibility of the shock wave at heel strike (measured by the peak acceleration ratio of the head/shank) remained unchanged. Taken together these results provide further evidence that the full body contributes to gaze stabilization during locomotion, and that its different functional elements can be modified online to contribute to gaze stabilization for different visual task constraints...|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{established}} that vestibular and oculomotor behaviors can have two adapted states (e. g., gain) simultaneously, {{and that a}} context cue (e. g., vertical eye position) can switch between the two states. The present study examined this phenomenon of context-specific adaptation for the oculomotor response to interaural translation (which we term "linear vestibulo-ocular reflex" or LVOR {{even though it may}} have extravestibular components). Subjects sat upright on a linear sled and were translated at 0. 7 Hz and 0. 3 gpeak acceleration while a visual-vestibular mismatch paradigm was used to adaptively increase (x 2) or decrease (x 0) the gain of the LVOR. In each experimental session, gain increase was asked for in one context, and gain decrease in another context.

Two different contexts were used: <b>head</b> <b>pitch</b> (26 degrees forward and backward) and head roll (26 degrees or 45 degrees, right and left).

The compass accuracy is 0.5 ° root mean square (RMS) while level, 1 ° RMS[*]<[*]± 30 ° tilt, and 1.5 ° RMS[*]<[*]± 60 ° tilt. Although the compass is accurate enough to provide the location path information, {{the goal of this}} research is to utilize the solely RFID and BIM integration data to estimate the tracking information. However, some data, e.g., cardinal direction, from the compass will be used to supplement the RFID-BIM integration data.|$|R
