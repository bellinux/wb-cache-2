5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk,</b> interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk.</b> Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E
40|$|Diversification and day-of-the-week {{effects on}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks</b> {{have been well}} {{documented}} in the literature, but separately. This paper studies empirically the interaction of diversification and day-of-the-week effects on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks.</b> The results show that different days have great impact on diversification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks,</b> particularly on skewness and kurtosis. With {{an increase in the}} portfolio size, the average skewness increases on Monday, Thursday and Friday but decreases on Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. The average kurtosis decreases with an increase in the portfolio size on Wednesday and Thursday. On the other days, however, the average kurtosis decreases first, and then increases. The results suggest that unsystematic skewness and kurtosis change signs across days of the week. An analysis of consistency over time shows that the portfolio effect on standard deviation is highly stable while the effect on kurtosis is relatively less stable. However, the portfolio effect on skewness is highly unstable over time. Investors {{should be aware of the}} day-of-the-week effect on diversification in the foreign exchange markets if they want to maximize their returns and minimize their risks.

500|$|The {{following}} equation represents covered {{interest rate}} parity, a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to {{foreign exchange risk}} (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) {{with the use of}} a forward contract [...] the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> is effectively covered. Under this condition, a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency at the spot exchange rate, investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate, and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency at the negotiated forward exchange rate. Investors will be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate. The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E

Our results show that with an increase in the investment horizon, the correlations between currency returns increase in general, causing the benefits of diversification to decrease.

50|$|Foreign {{exchange}} risk (also {{known as}} FX risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> or currency risk) is a financial risk that exists when a financial transaction is denominated in a currency {{other than that}} of the base currency of the company. Foreign exchange risk also exists when the foreign subsidiary of a firm maintains financial statements in a currency other than the reporting currency of the consolidated entity. The risk is that there may be an adverse movement in the exchange rate of the denomination currency in relation to the base currency before the date when the transaction is completed. Investors and businesses exporting or importing goods and services or making foreign investments have an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> which can have severe financial consequences; but steps can be taken to manage (i.e., reduce) the risk.|$|E
50|$|Financial risk is most {{commonly}} {{measured in terms}} of the variance or standard deviation of a variable such as percentage returns or rates of change. In foreign exchange, a relevant factor would be the rate of change of the spot exchange rate between currencies. Variance represents <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> by the spread of exchange rates, whereas standard deviation represents <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> by the amount exchange rates deviate, on average, from the mean exchange rate in a probability distribution. A higher standard deviation would signal a greater currency risk. Economists have criticized the accuracy of standard deviation as a risk indicator for its uniform treatment of deviations, be they positive or negative, and for automatically squaring deviation values. Alternatives such as average absolute deviation and semivariance have been advanced for measuring financial risk.|$|E
