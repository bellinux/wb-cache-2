6000|$|All these {{tiresome}} {{things we}} had to attend to constantly. Streams of dirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad wooden troughs to the ravine. One would not suppose that atoms of gold and silver would float on top of six inches of water, but they did; {{and in order to}} catch them, coarse blankets were laid in the troughs, and little obstructing [...] "riffles" [...] charged with quicksilver were placed here and there across the troughs also. These riffles had to be cleaned and the blankets washed out every evening, to get their precious accumulations--and after all this eternity of trouble one third of the silver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way {{to the end of the}} troughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day.

[...] Every now and then, during the day, {{we had to}} scoop some pulp out of the pans, and tediously [...] "wash" [...] it in a horn spoon--wash it little by little over the edge till at last nothing was left but some little dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom. If they were soft and yielding, the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of copper or some other chemical rubbish to assist digestion; if they were crisp to the touch and would retain a dint, they were freighted with all the silver and gold they could seize and hold, and consequently the pan needed a fresh charge of quicksilver. When there was nothing else to do, one could always [...] "screen tailings." [...] That is to say, he could shovel up the <b>dried</b> <b>sand</b> that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs and dash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbles and prepare it for working over.|$|E

Termite movement and wood consumption in a three–chambered apparatus were compared between treatments with dry soil in the center container and treatments where the soil in the center container was moist. When a wood block was located in the release container, termites fed significantly more on that block, regardless of treatment or soil type. In the treatment with dry clay, none of the termites tunneled through the dry clay barrier to reach the distal container. When termites had to tunnel through a barrier of <b>dry</b> <b>sand,</b> topsoil, or clay to reach the sole wood block, there was no effect on wood consumption for the sand treatment, but there was significantly less feeding on wood in the treatments with dry topsoil or clay.

Low amplitude sound with frequency {{similar to that of}} 'booming' during spontaneous avalanches was produced in a small inclined chute and rotating flask. Shearing of <b>dried</b> <b>sand</b> with a stylus, and pouring from buckets or shaking in a jar produced loud sound in 200 - 500 Hz range. Dryness of the sand and flowrate have significant effect on the produced sound. A model based on kinetic theory is proposed to explain the production of oscillations in avalanching flows. The avalanching layer behaves like a breathing mode with infinite wavelength, and perturbations in volume fraction allow oscillatory behaviour to be sustained in the inclined shear flow. Finally, a phase transition model is used to explain the presence, and characteristics, of oscillations observed in numerical simulations of inclined flows near their stopping angle...|$|E

Specific attention is directed towards developing an understanding of pile-soil behavior to torsional loads and dissipation of torsional stresses with depth. Another important aspect of this study is the formulation of criteria for describing the torsional pile-soil interaction in sand by families of curves from the standpoint of utilization of basic non-linear soil shear stress-strain relationships. The above objectives were accomplished by studying the interaction of a 1. 9 -inch diameter circular pile and a square pile of 2 -inch outside dimensions. These piles were embedded in air <b>dried</b> <b>sand,</b> in loose and dense environments and deposited under controlled density conditions. Instrumentation was provided on the piles to measure the torque distribution along the pile shaft. Based on the measured torque distributions, torsional interaction curves were developed and correlated with the measured soil properties. From the correlations criteria for describing the torsional interaction curves were formulated. The interaction curves generated using the proposed criteria are used to predict analytically the response of the test piles to ascertain the validity of the criteria...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by American Geophysical Union {{and can be}} found at: [URL] tensions of high-salinity solutions are significantly different from those of pure water. Our objective was to develop and test a methodology to determine whether these surface tension effects predictably alter imbibition into dry and moist porous media. Static and dynamic experiments were performed using four grades of quartz sand {{to determine the effects of}} solution salinity on imbibition. Results were quantified as apparent contact angles between the sand and three solutions (pure water, 5 molal NaNO₃, and n-hexane). Contact angles determined using a static method in initially air <b>dried</b> <b>sand</b> ranged from 23 ° to 31 °, with the same values found for both water and the NaNO 3 solution. Effective contact angles determined for the air-dried sand using a dynamic method based on a modified version of the Green and Ampt model were about twice those found using the static method, averaging 45 ° and 62 ° for water and the NaNO₃ solution, respectively. In prewetted sands, the dynamic imbibition data yielded apparent contact angles of 2 ° and 21 ° for water and the NaNO₃ solution, respectively, with the latter value comparing well to a predicted value of 25 ° for the NaNO₃ solution solely on the basis of surface tension contrast. The results of this study indicate that on the Darcy scale, saline solutions appear to follow the relationship of nonzero contact angles with other miscible fluids of different surface tensions used to prewet the sand grains, in agreement with the macroscale infiltration results of Weisbrod et al.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{various factors}} controlling algal nitrogen fixation and nitrogen release in temperate agricultural soils. New apparatus for investigating nitrogenase activity on uniform soil grown algal crusts {{and for the}} in situ estimation of nitrogen fixation {{in the field is}} described. The effects of oxygen concentration and temperature on acetylene reduction by soil grown cultures of Nostoc ellipsosporum in the light and in the dark suggest that ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation contributes to fixation even in the light. The oxygen concentration giving optimum nitrogenase activity depends on the intensity of illumination, largely because of the continuing contribution from dark fixation. The oxygen dependant acetylene reduction continued throughout the night in the field at 20 % of the midday rate. This proportion is dependant on daytime light intensity and day/night temperature drop. The release of nitrogenous compounds by soil and sand grown cultures of N. ellipsosporum was investigated in the laboratory. Algal cultures growing on sand released only 2 % of the total nitrogen compared with 10 % released by liquid cultures. Freezing to below - 3 °C, drying to less than 4 % moisture or pathogenic infection all cause extensive cellular lysis with a concomitant loss of nitrogenase activity, followed, after several days, by a surge in ammonia concentration. The recovery of nitrogenase activity after re-wetting was investigated in the field after a period of dry weather. All samples achieved a steady rate of nitrogenase activity after 400 minutes irrespective of the magnitude of recovery. Nitrogenase activity in the field was monitored at weekly intervals using an in situ technique over a two year period on Broadbalk, one of the Rothamsted classic plots sown to winter wheat. The seasonal fixation rates varied from 1. 4 to 28 Kg/ha depending on the fertilizer and herbicide treatment. The greatest seasonal fixation was given bynon-herbicide plots receiving 48 Kg N/ha of applied nitrogen. The effect of various species of algal inoculum was investigated on 60 plots sown to winter wheat with and without irrigation and added nitrogen. A significant increase in fixation was produced and the most effective treatment was a liquid application of N. ellipsosporum. Both the N. punctiforme and Anabaena cylindrica were more effective when applied as <b>dried</b> <b>sand</b> cultures.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the lateral motion of rigid, soil-engaging {{implements}} hitched to a tractor with a one-point or a three-point hitch, {{as well as}} the vertical motion of seed drill coulters for use in tilled seedbeds are investigated. The motion of most tractor-hitched soil-engaging implements is heavily overdamped, it was therefore described by a first order model, based on a quantitative description of the lateral properties of the implement and a functional description of the hitch. For each hitch-implement combination an effective hitch-point, towards which the implement tends to move, was defined and a method to calculate the effective hitch length was developed. The return of a laterally disturbed implement was shown to be exponential. The disturbance is reduced to 10 % of its initial value when the implement moves forward a distance of 2. 3 times the effective hitch length. The tractional hitch point and the directional hitch point coincide for one-point hitches but not for three-point hitches. This gives the three-point hitches unique properties: The angular {{as well as the}} lateral deflection of a three-point hitched implement will normally be smaller compared to those of a one-point hitched version of the same implement. This is true both when it is used on a hillside and when it is used with an asymmetric load. The three-point hitch is also shown to be versatile enough to enable the construction of a laterally movable and, for both directional and non-directional implements, self-centring front mounted three-point hitch. The horizontal and vertical soil forces on coulters with different rake angles (70 - 135 °) were measured under both pseudostatic (no vertical velocity and no accelerations) and fully dynamic conditions. Most of the measurements were made in a soil bin with <b>dried</b> <b>sand,</b> but some of the pseudostatic measurements were made in a clay field. Empirical models were developed for the soil forces acting on the coulter under both pseudostatic and dynamic conditions. These models were used to simulate coulter equilibrium depth and coulter penetration. The simulations led to the following conclusions: Coulters with a large rake angle (≥ 1 l 0 °) have several advantages when compared to coulters with smaller rake angles; their equilibrium depth is less sensitive both to speed and to soil parameters and their penetration is faster, better damped and less sensitive to suspension parameters (pivot arm length and pivot axis height) and to suspension type (single armed or parallel armed). The coulter penetration was found to improve with decreasing speed, decreasing moment of inertia and increasing depth of operation. No reasons were found for complicating the coulter suspension by using a parallel arm suspension or by using separate pivot axes for front and rear row coulters. The above conclusions apply to well tilled seedbeds without stones or clods. If there are frequent stones or clods in the seedbed the present recommendation of using coulters with rake angles around 90 ° seems valid...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study sand filtration as a treatment technology for drinking water sources in Newfoundland and Labrador to reduce the arsenic (As) concentration to the level of 7 micrograms (µg) per litre without using chemicals. The effect that various ions present in groundwater have on As removal efficiency using sand filters was also investigated. Water sampling locations were narrowed down based on the composition of groundwater provided by the Department of Environment and Conservation. Two different water samples were collected from the town of the Wabana on Bell Island. One with high As and iron (Fe) concentrations and the other the normal Wabana water supply. Water samples were also collected from the Town of Freshwater in Carbonear. The composition of the water samples (arsenic, iron and other element concentrations) was determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) from the Department of Earth Sciences at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. The Fe to As ratio is the most important parameter in successfully removing arsenic from groundwater to the level below an acceptable concentration. Capital Ready Mix supplied the washed sand required for this project. The sand had a finesse modulus (FM) of 2. 9. The sand for all the experiments was first washed with 60 ˚C hot distilled water to dissolve all the impurities. The water was then drained to collect the washed sand. The sand was dried in the oven at 105 ˚C for 24 hours to remove all the moisture. Batch Column tests were conducted for treating the arsenic contaminated water. The test equipment, two columns, was manufactured by Technical Services in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The columns were partially filled with the washed and <b>dried</b> <b>sand.</b> In order to uniformly distribute the water along the whole cross section and to control the flow of solution into the column, either a Ceramic disk or the cloth was used. Similarly, {{at the bottom of the}} column, either the ceramic disk or cloth was used. The purpose of using either the ceramic disc or the cloth at the bottom of the column was to allow the flow of the solution out of the column and to retain the sand. 1000 mL of distilled water was passed through the column prior to commencing the batch tests to remove all the very fine particles which results in turbidity. Once the clear water was collected at the bottom of the column, only then the tests were initiated. It was concluded that hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) can play a very vital role in mitigating the arsenic concern in the groundwater of the Newfoundland and Labrador. The higher the iron content, the greater will be the arsenic removal but the sand filter replacement frequency may decrease. It is therefore suggested to use sand filtration in combination with aeration and dilution to deal with the growing arsenic concern in the province of the Newfoundland and Labrador...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{improvement}} methods available for modifying soils. Cement stabilisation {{has been one}} of the popular improvement methods for cohesionless soils. Over the past three decades, many studies have been done to investigate the effects of adding synthetic and natural fibres to soil as the reinforcing material alone or with cement. Utilisation of the fibres from waste materials such as used tyres and carpets, which are available in large quantities worldwide, can be beneficial. Though significant research has been conducted on studying the behaviour of cement-stabilised soil, the effectiveness of using waste tyre fibres (TF) with cement has received very limited attention. Therefore, the present work focuses on investigating the characteristics of local Perth sandy soil after inclusion of waste TF and cement. These wastes can be utilised in ground improvement in large quantities and could provide a cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy that avoids tyre disposal problems. A series of laboratory tests including compaction, unconfined compression and triaxial tests were conducted to investigate the effects of adding TF and cement on the engineering behaviour of Perth sandy soil. Two types of TF namely tyre fibres A (TFA) whose particles were smaller in length and diameter than the other type called tyre fibres B (TFB) were used. The contents were varied from 0 to 3 % of <b>dried</b> <b>sand</b> by weight both for cement and TF. The cemented specimens were cured in a humid room for 7 days. For the triaxial tests, the confining stresses were 50, 100 and 200 kPa. The compaction test results indicate that the maximum dry unit weight is generally increased by adding cement and decreased by TF inclusion, while adding cement and TF results in a lower optimum water content. The results of unconfined compression tests show that the cement addition increases the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the sand and sand-TF mixtures. Furthermore, the inclusion of TF in the sand increases its UCS, whereas UCS of the sand-cement mixtures decreases with an increase in tyre fibre content, except for a slight increase at low cement contents. The highest improvement occurred when 1 % TFB was added to sand + 1 % cement with an increase of UCS from about 314 kPa to 338 kPa. Moreover, while adding the cement increases the modulus of elasticity (E), the inclusion of TFs reduces E, and the greatest reduction was observed when 3 % TFB was added to sand with 3 % cement (E decreased from about 4186 kPa to 1537 kPa). The triaxial results indicate that adding TF to sand leads to a slightly higher effective angle of friction with a reduced effective cohesion. However, overall, a marginal difference is observed in the stress-strain characteristics of unreinforced and TF-reinforced soil. Generally, it was observed that the use of TFB was slightly more efficient compared to TFA in both cemented and uncemented sand mixtures due to higher aspect ratios of TBF and accordingly, greater reinforcement effect. Overall, TF-reinforced sand, with or without cement, is a lighter material with improved strength, which can be used in some civil applications such as slope stabilisation, backfills or embankments...|$|E
