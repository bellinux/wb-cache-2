5|$|Another {{genre of}} history writing {{produced}} during the Era of the Princes was the terse Ethiopian annal known as ya'alam tarik. These works attempted to list major world events <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the biblical Genesis until their present {{time in a}} universal history. For instance, the translated work of John of Nikiû explaining human history until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 642 became a canonical text in Ethiopian historiography.

5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.

5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also {{makes it clear that}} the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|Brunel and Gooch both {{gave their}} {{locomotives}} names to identify them, but the standard-gauge companies {{that became a}} part of the GWR used numbers. Until 1864 the GWR therefore had named broad-gauge locomotives and numbered standard-gauge ones. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Armstrong's arrival all new locomotives– both broad and standard– were given numbers, including broad-gauge ones that had previously carried names when they were acquired from other railways. Dean introduced a policy in 1895 of giving passenger tender locomotives both numbers and names. Each batch was given names with a distinctive theme, for example kings for the 6000 class and castles for the 4073 class.|$|E

5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in direct contact with the Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
5|$|Continuing southwards, {{the river}} passes the gallops which {{are part of}} Coombelands Racing Stables, {{situated}} on the eastern bank, and Park Mount, a motte and bailey dating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the Norman conquest. It {{is one of the}} best-preserved monuments of this type in south east England. The river is crossed by Stopham Bridge, a fine medieval stone bridge built in 1422-23. The centre arch was raised as part of the improvements made to the navigation in 1822. It is a Grade I listed structure, and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was damaged by army lorries in the Second World War, but has been repaired, and the heavy traffic on the A283 road was diverted onto a new bridge just upstream of it in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd century AD Irish {{influence}} {{was at work}} in the region and by the 6th century the kingdom of Dál Riata was established. Unlike the P-Celtic speaking Brythons, these Gaels spoke a form of Gaelic that still survives in the Hebrides. Through the efforts of Saint Ninian and others Christianity slowly supplanted Druidism. Dál Riata flourished <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Fergus Mór in the late fifth century until the Viking incursions that commenced in the late eighth century. Islands close to the shores of modern Ayrshire would have remained part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde during this period, whilst the main islands became part of the emerging Kingdom of Alba founded by Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín).|$|E

5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became {{prosector}} for the Zoological Society of London and remained there for twelve years. When he left the London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, primatologist Jane Goodall studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees.

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore {{took care to}} cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant.

Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives {{not only in the}} New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
