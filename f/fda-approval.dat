50|$|There {{has been}} a {{constant}} growth in the field of melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists since the 1980s.

40|$|<b>FDA-approval</b> {{times have}} {{declined}} significantly since {{the enactment of}} the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) in 1992. As a result, present value expected returns to pharmaceutical R&D have likely increased. In the current paper we employ a unique survey dataset, which includes for the first time data on firm-level pharmaceutical R&D. We estimate the effects that <b>FDA-approval</b> times have on R&D investments. Controlling for other factors such as pharmaceutical profitability and cash flows, we find that a 10 percent decrease (increase) in <b>FDA-approval</b> times results in a 1. 7 percent in increase (decrease) in R&D spending. Combining this estimate with previous research and publicly available data on industry-level pharmaceutical spending between 1992 and 2001, we conclude PDUFA, and its subsequent renewals, stimulated an additional $ 13. 5 billion in pharmaceutical R&D (2005 $U. S.), and has presumably continued to do so since 2001. Recent economic research has shown the social rate of return on pharmaceutical R&D is remarkably high; thus, the social benefits of PDUFA (over and above the benefits of more rapid consumer access) are likely to be substantial. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Currently, {{tamoxifen}} and raloxifene are {{the only}} FDA-approved and USPSTF recommended pharmacologic treatments for breast cancer chemoprevention in high-risk postmenopausal women. Despite their widely recognized efficacy at reducing the incidence of breast cancer, the risk of potentially significant adverse effects may limit patient allocation. Consequently, research on the efficacy of third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) as breast cancer preventives has emerged, especially since their value as adjuvant and combination therapy for breast cancer is well-established. The safety profile of anastrozole and exemestane potentially provide an appealing alternative to postmenopausal patients with {{a higher risk of}} developing breast cancer. Studies have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of AIs at reducing the incidence breast cancer, and further research will help to validate the <b>FDA-approval</b> of AIs for this indication. Methods: An exhaustive search of medical literature included MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials using the key words: aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, and chemoprevention. Relevant articles were critically appraised and GRADE was used for qualitative assessment. Results: An extensive literary search rendered 262 relevant articles from January 2000 to February 2014. After screening several articles, two randomized control trials met inclusion criteria. The NIH clinical trials site yielded 36 results, and one trial met inclusion criteria. The LIBER trial, listed under NCT 00673335, is in Phase III with a predicted completion date of February 2017. Conclusion: Third generation AIs, such as anastrozole and exemestane, are very effective at reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, and certain tumors in high-risk postmenopausal women. Although both AIs demonstrate adverse effects, their overall safety profiles may be more favorable than other pharmacologic chemoprevention alternatives. More research, larger scale studies, and a longer follow-up after concluding treatment will be valuable to the prospective <b>FDA-approval</b> of AIs in breast cancer prevention.

40|$|SummaryAcute {{exacerbations}} {{of chronic}} bronchitis (AECB) and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{are associated with}} significant healthcare costs and contribute to the progress of the disease. Although a number of factors may trigger these episodes, between 40 % and 60 % are bacterial in nature. Antimicrobial therapy can be effective in treating exacerbations, leading to improved peak expiratory flow rates, fewer hospitalizations, lower relapse rates, and greater clinical success. Evidence suggests that short-course antimicrobial therapy can be as effective as standard duration therapy (> 7 days) in treating exacerbations. Randomized trials have shown that clinical and bacteriological success rates are comparable with both 5 -day and standard antibiotic courses. Furthermore, 5 -day fluoroquinolone therapy is associated with faster recovery, fewer relapses, prolonged duration between episodes, and less hospitalization when compared with standard therapy. Both moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin have received <b>FDA-approval</b> for 5 -day therapy in AECB...|$|E
40|$|First-line therapies in the {{treatment}} of patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis are sulfasalazine or one of the mesalamine derivatives. Mesalamine is popular given its safety profile and reasonable efficacy in many patients. However, compliance is poor with regimens demanding large number of pills dosed multiple times a day and non-compliance has been correlated with disease relapse. Mesalamine requires direct contact with the inflamed colonic mucosa. To avoid proximal absorption, a variety of delivery systems has been utilized to time the release of active mesalamine to the areas affected by colitis. The most common mesalamine release mechanisms include azo-bond prodrug carriers, pH-dependent dissolution, and moisture-sensitive product dispersion. Novel technology has resulted in the development and <b>FDA-approval</b> of a multi-matrix release (MMX) mesalamine. Pharmacodynamic studies suggest a reliable drug delivery system with homogenous release throughout the entire colon. By incorporating the largest amount of mesalamine (1. 2 g) per pill, this new product dramatically decreases the number of pills needed to attain a therapeutic daily dosage, and is the first agent approved at once-daily dosing. These factors are expected to increase patient compliance with prescribed mesalamine dosing, and in turn decrease relapse rates of active ulcerative colitis...|$|E
40|$|Despite recent advancements in the {{treatment}} of late-stage mutant BRAF V 600 E/K melanomas, a major hurdle continues to be acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors such as Vemurafenib. The mechanisms for resistance have proven to be heterogeneous, emphasizing the need to utilize broad therapeutic approachs. The present study, “Stat 3 targeted therapies overcome the acquired resistance to vemurafenib in melanomas ” by Liu et al., proposes that STAT 3 -PAX 3 signaling may be a mechanism that is utilized by melanomas to resist RAF inhibitors. Mutations in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF are found in 45 – 50 % of melanomas. The development of clinical inhibitors to steps in the BRAF-MEK-ERK 1 / 2 pathway have led to <b>FDA-approval</b> of the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib in late-stage mutant BRAF V 600 E/K melanomas. However, the initial clinical responses to vemurafenib are heterogeneous, with median progression-free survival of only 6 – 7 months. Almost all patients who experience an initial response ultimately acquire resistance that allows disease progression, emphasizing the need to identify and target mechanisms of resistance both to vemurafenib and to other RAF inhibitors. Several mechanisms employed by mutant BRAF melanoma cells to overcome RAF inhibition have been described previously (Aplin et al., 2011). Most of thes...|$|E
40|$|Background: There are {{no drugs}} {{presently}} available to treat {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI). A variety of single drugs have failed clinical trials suggesting a role for drug combinations. Drug combinations acting synergistically often provide the greatest combination of potency and safety. The drugs examined (minocycline (MINO), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), simvastatin, cyclosporine A, and progesterone) had <b>FDA-approval</b> for uses other than TBI and limited brain injury in experimental TBI models. Methodology/Principal Findings: Drugs were dosed one hour after injury using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI model in adult rats. One week later, drugs were tested for efficacy and drug combinations tested for synergy on a hierarchy of behavioral tests that included active place avoidance testing. As monotherapy, only MINO improved acquisition of the massed version of active place avoidance that required memory lasting less than two hours. MINO-treated animals, however, were impaired during the spaced {{version of the same}} avoidance task that required 24 -hour memory retention. Coadministration of NAC with MINO synergistically improved spaced learning. Examination of brain histology 2 weeks after injury suggested that MINO plus NAC preserved white, but not grey matter, since lesion volume was unaffected, yet myelin loss was attenuated. When dosed 3 hours before injury, MINO plus NAC as single drugs had no effect on interleukin- 1 formation; together they synergistically lowered interleukin- 1 levels. This effect on interleukin- 1 was not observed when th...|$|E
40|$|Gardasil® – {{the vaccine}} was first {{thought to be}} a medical {{breakthrough}} in the fight against cancer, but it quickly became plagued with controversy. Despite wide media coverage, little {{attention has been paid to}} today’s health care professionals who are ultimately responsible for prescribing the vaccine, and who may be the most knowledgeable about it. The present study seeks to expand on previous literature by investigating health care providers’ current beliefs and practices with the human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization. It is essential that more recent research be performed in order to encompass current views of the vaccine, post <b>FDA-approval.</b> Data was collected through open-ended interviews with nine health care providers, including MDs and APRNs, and family practice, obstetrics-gynecology, and pediatrics. The interview guide included major topics such as demographics, personal practices and opinions, perceptions of patients and guardians, and opinions on important controversial issues. Major themes and ideas were then found among their responses through qualitative analysis. Results from the data show that providers’ attitudes and behaviors are relatively uniform. Every provider currently administers and strongly supports the vaccine. Although many expressed that beginning immunization at age nine seemed young, none opposed administering it at that age. It was completely dependent upon the patients’ sexual history and the overall demographics of their patient population. Some providers even expressed a desire to vaccinate outside of the FDA recommendations, to include boys and older females. Evidence-based research and experience with treating cervical cancer were cited as the main reasons for supporting the vaccine. When asked about the controversial topics, no providers felt that motives of pharmaceutical profit were relevant, and none believed that the vaccine would promote sexual activity. Mandates were the only topic to receive varying opinions...|$|E
40|$|Comparing {{the safety}} of {{prescription}} drugs over time is difficult due to the paucity of reliable quantitative measures of drug safety. Both the academic literature and popular press have focused on drug withdrawals {{as a proxy for}} breakdowns in the drug safety system. This metric, however, is problematic because withdrawals are rare events, and they may be influenced by factors beyond a drug's safety profile. In the current paper, we propose a new measure: the incidence and timing of Black Box Warnings (BBWs). BBWs are warnings placed on prescription drug labels when a drug is determined to carry a significant risk of a serious or life-threatening adverse event. Using a unique data set, one that includes all new molecular entities (NMEs) submitted to the FDA between May 1981 and February 2006, and subsequently approved and marketed, we analyze the timing and incidence of BBWs. Our analyses also use data on several drug characteristics likely to affect the probability a new drug will receive a BBW. We draw several conclusions from our analyses. For example, drugs receiving priority FDA review {{are more likely to have}} BBWs at the time of approval than NMEs receiving standard review. We also find that early prescription volume and orphan drug status are associated with an increased likelihood of receiving a BBW. We do not, however, find a significant difference in the rate of BBWs across time cohorts. A comparison of NMEs approved before and after the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which authorized the payment of user fees from drug manufacturers to the FDA in an effort to expedite new drug application (NDAs) review times, did not reveal a statistically significant difference in the rate of BBWs. Critics of PDUFA maintain that reduced <b>FDA-approval</b> times under PDUFA have compromised drug safety. We do not find empirical support for this contention. ...|$|E
30|$|Human {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} have started {{to find their way}} into the clinical setting and we have witnessed rapid progress in this field during recent years. The first FDA-approved clinical trial initiated by Geron ([URL] in 2009 using their cell therapy product GRNOPC 1, a population of living cells containing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC), targeted spinal cord injury. Although this study was halted for financial reasons in 2011, the patients that already had received the cellular transplants will be monitored for a period of 15  years according to the original study protocol using public state funding. Two other studies initiated by Advanced Cell Technology ([URL] have received <b>FDA-approval</b> for transplantation of their cell therapy product, MA 09 -hRPE, to patients with Advanced Dry Age Related Macular Degeneration or Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy. MA 09 -hRPE is a population of hESC-derived retinal pigment epithelium cells and the hope {{is to be able to}} slow or halt the process of blindness associated with these degenerative diseases. Initial safety data have been published and appear promising[4]. In parallel, the Japanese authorities have given their approval to the first clinical study using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cells. This investigation, led by researchers at the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology ([URL] Kobe, Japan, is targeting patients suffering from exudative (wet-type) Advanced Macular Degeneration. The study will take advantage of a clinically compliant protocol involving the establishment of autologous hiPSCs from each of the study subjects and a differentiation method to generate retinal pigment epithelium cells for subsequent transplantation back to the patients. Although these recent developments are exciting and could represent the beginning of a new era in regenerative medicine, concerns have been raised, and it has been argued that some safety issues require additional investigations in order to better assess the risks involved when transplanting hPSC-derived cells to humans[5]. Indeed, for the whole field of hPSC-based cell therapy it is a lot at stake, and failure of the initial clinical trials due to safety reasons will have substantial negative impact on any future developments in this space. One can expect that these pioneering clinical studies will be monitored closely by the regulatory agencies, scientists, investors/financers, as well as patient groups and the general public.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND One {{cross-linked}} polyethylene (XLPE) liner is manufactured using a lower dose of radiation, 5 Mrad, which {{may result in}} less cross-linking. The reported in vivo wear rate of this XLPE liner in patients undergoing THA has varied, and has included some patients in each reported cohort who had greater than 0. 1 mm/year of wear, which is an historical threshold for osteolysis. Previous studies have measured wear on plain radiographs, an approach that has limited sensitivity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore measured the amount and direction of wear at 6 years using Radiostereometric analysis (RSA) in patients who had THAs that included a {{cross-linked polyethylene}} liner manufactured using 5 Mrad radiation. METHODS We prospectively reviewed wear in 30 patients who underwent primary THAs with the same design of cross-linked acetabular liner and a 28 -mm articulation. Tantalum markers were inserted during surgery and all patients had RSA radiographic examinations at 1 week, 6 months, 1, 2, and 6 years postoperatively. RESULTS The mean proximal, two-dimensional (2 -D) and three-dimensional (3 -D) wear rates calculated between 1 year and 6 years were 0. 014, 0. 014, and 0. 018 mm/per year, respectively. The direction of the head penetration recorded between 1 week and 6 years was in a proximal direction for all patients, proximolateral for 16 of 24 patients, and proximomedial for eight of 24 patients. CONCLUSIONS The proximal, 2 -D and 3 -D wear of a XLPE liner produced using 5 Mrad of radiation was low but measurable by RSA after 6 years. No patients had proximal 2 -D or 3 -D wear rates exceeding 0. 1 mm/year. Further followup is needed to evaluate the effect of XLPE wear particles {{on the development of}} long-term osteolysis.

40|$|Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key {{mediators}} of {{gene expression}} and, thus, major regulators of cell function. As such, HDACs {{play a role}} in orchestrating tumor biology, and the use of small inhibitors targeting theses proteins is attractive for the field of cancer therapy. Indeed, several HDAC inhibitors have received <b>FDA-approval</b> for the treatment of malignancies, while a myriad of these compounds continue to be evaluated in clinical trials. Besides their direct impact on tumor growth, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to increase immunogenicity of cancer cells, facilitating generation of a productive immune response against tumors. Immunotherapeutic approaches take advantage of the intrinsic ability of the immune system to manifest an anti-tumor response. Mechanisms of immune escape are often developed by cancer cells, neutralizing activity of the immune system. For example, upregulation of the PD 1 ligands PDL 1 and PDL 2 by tumor cells negatively regulates the anti-tumor functions of PD 1 -expressing infiltrating T-cells. Importantly, strategies targeting this inhibitory axis have shown outstanding clinical benefit for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. The mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors modulate tumor and immune cells biology were explored herein. Initially, treatment of melanoma cells with pan- and class I-selective HDAC inhibitors resulted in upregulation of PDL 1 and PDL 2 molecules. These effects were observed in mouse and human cell lines, as well as in tumor cells resected from metastatic melanoma patients. This upregulation was robust and sustained, lasting at least 96 hours in vitro, and validated in vivo using a B 16 F 10 syngeneic mouse model. Enhanced expression of PDL 1 mediated by HDAC inhibitors was found to result from enhanced histone acetylation at the PDL 1 gene promoter region. Combination therapy of HDAC inhibition and PD 1 blockade was explored in the tumor setting, leading to synergistic effects in terms of reducing melanoma progression and increasing survival of B 16 F 10 melanoma-bearing mice. These data provide a clinical rationale for combination therapy of epigenetic modifiers (e. g. HDAC inhibitors) and PD 1 blockade as means to augment cancer immunotherapy, improving patient outcomes. As a second pillar of this research, the impacts of HDAC-selective inhibition were explored on immune cell biology, since the broad nature of pan-HDAC inhibitors was shown to be detrimental to T-cells in vitro and in vivo. Based on screening assay results, novel implications of treating melanoma patient T-cells ex vivo with the HDAC 6 -selective inhibitor ACY 1215 were investigated. Treatment with this compound was unique among pan- and isotype-selective HDAC inhibitors in modulating T-cell cytokine production and showing minimal impact of T-cell viability. ACY 1215 tempered Th 2 cytokine production (i. e. IL- 4, IL- 6 and IL- 10), and maintained Th 1 effector cytokines (e. g. IFNγ and IL- 2). Furthermore, ACY 1215 increased expression of surface markers, including CD 69 activation marker and ICOS co-stimulatory molecule. In addition, ACY 1215 treatment enhanced accumulation of central memory T-cells during ex vivo expansion of tumor infiltrating T-cells harvested from resected tumors of metastatic melanoma patients. Importantly, ACY 1215 -mediated inhibition improved tumor-killing capacity of T-cells. These results highlight an unexplored ability of selective HDAC inhibitor ACY 1215 to augment T-cell expansion during protocols of adoptive cell therapy. While the discoveries presented here warrant further investigation of cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with ACY 1215 -treated T-cells, the clinic implications are clear and rapidly translatable...|$|E
40|$|HIV Testing Algorithms: A Status Report {{outlines}} a menu {{of testing}} algorithms, for both laboratory and point-of-contact laboratory settings based on the testing technology and data available in 2009. Since its publication, {{there have been several}} developments in the field of HIV diagnostics including the <b>FDA-approval</b> of antigen/antibody combination assays and the evaluation of new data. The Status Report was a great step forward in the process of updating the algorithm, and it remains an important source of historical information regarding the rationale for diagnostic strategies. The approval of antigen/antibody combination (fourth generation) immunoassay technology and the proceedings of the 2010 HIV Diagnostics Conference led to significant progress in the development of HIV testing strategies, and the release of updated recommendations for laboratory HIV testing superseded those in the Status Report. In 1989 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) released recommendations for a sequential, two-test algorithm for serodiagnosis of HIV- 1 infection. In this algorithm, screening is conducted with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Specimens repeatedly reactive by EIA are subjected to a more specific supplemental test, either a Western blot (WB) or an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Over the past two decades, many advances in HIV diagnostics have been achieved: less complex rapid tests have been FDA-approved for screening at the point of contact (POC) with the patient, more sensitive and specific laboratory-based tests are available, and more complex rapid tests can detect HIV- 2. The 'HIV Testing Algorithms: Status Report' describes {{a menu of}} HIV testing algorithms that have the potential to augment and provide alternatives to the algorithm currently used to diagnose HIV infection. APHL and CDC convened two working groups of HIV diagnostic subject matter experts to develop these new algorithms. This report describes algorithms to use in POC and laboratory settings, as well as supporting evidence, limitations, and additional data needed to substantiate the algorithms as of April 2009. This document does not contain recommendations from either CDC or APHL. Date on cover: April 2009. Update: March 2010. Since HIV Testing Algorithms: A Status Report was published in April, 2009, several developments have occurred that necessitated an update to the report. At several points in the laboratory algorithms section of the report (pp. 25 - 31, 32, 39, 41), the April 2009 version stated that a plasma specimen is required to conduct HIV nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). The qualitative RNA NAAT that is FDAapproved as a supplemental test can now be used with serum specimens as well as plasma. Several instances in the Status Report (pp. 25, 29, 38, 39) also state that {{it may be necessary to}} repeat a positive NAAT for confirmation.
