The subsequent changes in intracellular phosphate-containing species {{were observed in}} situ by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy by using the NMR cultivator we developed. For the alkalinization experiments, changes in catabolite secretion were also measured in parallel experiments. Additionally, a range of potential neutralization capacity was investigated: a dilute culture and concentrated cultures with low or <b>high</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> content. The concentrated cultures displayed increased cytosolic pH and rapid polyphosphate degradation to small chains. The pH changes and extent of polyphosphate degradation depended inversely on initial polyphosphate content. The dilute culture restored extracellular pH rapidly and secreted acetate. The concentrated culture with low polyphosphate reserves also secreted acetate. In contrast to the alkalinization-induced polyphosphate dynamics, anaerobiosis resulted in the complete hydrolysis of polyphosphate to P(i), as opposed to small chains, and reduced cytosolic pH. The results and calculations suggest {{that the bulk of}} NMR-observable polyphosphate (vacuolar) degradation to short polymers conceivably contributes to neutralizing added alkalinity.

Members of the genus Acinetobacter have been considered {{to play a role}} in these processes, although their importance has been questioned. Indeed, the ability of Acinetobacter to alternately accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates under anaerobic conditions and polyphosphate under aerobic conditions has not been demonstrated.

In contrast to earlier studies which use ultrafiltration (UF) to recover only the high molecular weight DOM, ED/RO is capable of isolating both low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) DOM. Samples were collected from {{a broad range of}} marine environments: along a transect incorporating coastal and offshore waters off the Southeastern United States, in Effingham Inlet, a Pacific fjord located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia and in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. Results from phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P NMR) analysis reveals a similar abundance of P compound classes between samples, phosphate esters (80 - 85 %), phosphonates (5 - 10 %) and polyphosphates (8 - 13 %). These samples contain significantly <b>higher</b> proportions of <b>polyphosphate</b> P and P esters and lower proportions of phosphonates than measured in previous studies using the UF method. The much <b>higher</b> levels of <b>polyphosphate</b> detected in our samples suggests that polyphosphate is present mainly in the LMW DOM fraction. Polyphosphates in DOM may be present as (or derived from) dissolved nucleotides or organismal polyphosphate bodies, or both. Low molecular weight P esters are likely composed of phosphoamino acids and small carbohydrates, like simple sugar phosphates and/or dissolved nucleotides. Phosphonates in DOM are more prevalent as HMW phosphonate compounds, which suggests that LMW phosphonates are more readily utilized in marine ecosystems. Overall, the investigation of DOM across a size spectrum that includes both the HMW and the LMW fractions reveals a new picture of phosphorus distribution, cycling and bioavailability. M. S.

Binding to all these membranes display high as well as low affinity binding sites, with differing affinities.

40|$|SummaryThe {{hepatotoxin}} cylindrospermopsin (CYN) {{produced by}} certain cyanobacteria, including Aphanizomenon ovalisporum (hereafter Aphanizomenon) [1], seriously affects lake water quality [2], but its biological role is not known. Strong correlation between Aphanizomenon abundance in Lake Kinneret, Israel, and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity suggests that inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation induces the PHO regulon and APase secretion [3]. Staining lake samples with DAPI [4] revealed a <b>high</b> level of <b>polyphosphate</b> bodies (PPB) in Aphanizomenon. Application of enzyme-labeled fluorescence (ELF-APase) [5] showed APase in various organisms, {{but not in}} Aphanizomenon. ELF-APase signals and extracellular APase activity in Aphanizomenon were detected only after exploiting PPB under prolonged Pi deprivation in cultures or {{toward the end of}} its autumn bloom. Pi deprivation of Aphanizomenon induces CYN production, high-affinity Pi uptake, and an internal, not external, APase. Addition of Aphanizomenon spent media or CYN to various phytoplanktons, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, induced genes typically upregulated under Pi limitation and a rise in extracellular APase activity, despite ample surrounding Pi. Coculturing Aphanizomenon with Chlamydomonas or with Debarya sp. showed positive ELF-APase signals, but not in Aphanizomenon. CYN producers promote Pi supply by inducing APase secretion by other phytoplanktons, possibly explaining their increased abundance despite reduced Pi supply from watersheds...|$|R
40|$|Magnesium ion {{enhances the}} maximum amount of {{polyphosphate}} that resting phosphate-starved cells of Saccharomyces mellis can store by increasing the length of time the cells will continue assimilating phosphate. The divalent cation has no effect on the rate of formation of polymer. As much as 12 times more polyphosphate is formed in cells incubated in reaction mixtures containing 0. 3 M MgCl 2 than in the absence of Mg 2 +. Potassium ion also has an influence on the amount of polyphosphate that phosphate-starved cells can accumulate but the degree of stimulation is not very large. Mg 2 + and K+ have no effect on polyphosphate formation or storage in phosphate-satiated cells. Apparently, then, there are two systems for polyphosphate accumulation in S. mellis. Each system is stable in nondividing cells. The one present in phosphate-starved cells seems to be repressible by growth of the organism in media containing orthophosphate. The shift from the derepressed state to the repressed state, or vice versa, occurs only in exponentially dividing cells in appropriate media with 100 % of the cells in the new physiological state by the time the cell mass has doubled.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO) {{are not fully}} established yet under conditions that differ from the classical anaerobic/aerobic conditions. Recently, some {{research in the field}} of biological phosphorus removal has been focused on studying systems where the electron donor (substrate) and the electron acceptor (nitrate or oxygen) are present simultaneously.

An enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) system was enriched in a sequencing batch reactor working under alternating anaerobic/aerobic conditions and the percentage of “Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis” (the PAO in this study) was 45 %. Three different batch experiments were performed to obtain a better insight of this process: one under standard anaerobic–aerobic conditions and two experiments under strictly aerobic conditions. One of the aerobic experiments was developed with the EBPR biomass withdrawn at the end of the anaerobic period and the other one with biomass withdrawn at the end of the aerobic period of the standard process.

40|$|In tundra, {{phosphorus}} (P) is {{an important}} macronutrient for plants and microorganisms. A major fraction of P exists as organic compounds in the topsoil which can be mineralized to bioavailable inorganic P. Since mineralization is positively related to temperature, climate warming {{is likely to increase}} P bioavailability but the extend of these changes may also depend on vegetation cover and soil properties. I assessed organic and inorganic P concentrations across an elevation and vegetation gradient in northern Sweden using one dimensional (1 D) solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. I hypothesized that concentration of labile soil P will decrease with increasing elevation (decreasing temperature) and that soils with meadow vegetation will contain higher concentrations of labile P than heath soils. Concentration of labile P in the form of Resin-P and polyphosphates decreased with elevation whereas less labile orthophosphate monoesters increased. Across vegetation types, polyphosphates were more abundant in heath and meadow contained higher concentrations of monoesters. The inverse response of Resin-P and monoesters to elevation may be best explained by lowered organic P mineralization in colder climate. <b>High</b> concentrations of <b>polyphosphates</b> at the lowest elevation may indicate an increased presence of fungal communities associated with mountain birch forest. Heath seemed to be more dominated by fungal communities than meadow and higher concentration of monoesters in meadow indicated a higher soil sorption capacity.

40|$|The {{family of}} {{phosphorylated}} inositol compounds consists of soluble cytosolic inositol phosphates and insoluble inositol phospholipids, localized in cellular membranes {{and the nuclear}} matrix. Although inositol phospholipids only account for 5 - 10 % of total plasma membrane lipids, these compounds and their inositol phosphate derivatives {{play an important role}} in a broad range of cellular processes including intracellular Ca 2 + signalling, ion channel regulation, vesicle trafficking, both exo- and endocytosis, cell growth and apoptosis. Stimulation of plasma membrane receptors with neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors evokes the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, principally phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (Ptdlns(4, 5) P 2) and hence generation of a series of inositol polyphosphates. Among them, inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3), as a Ca 2 + mobilizing second messenger, is the best-characterized. However, much less is known about the biochemical pathways and intracellular signaling of other inositol polyphosphates in mammalian cells. One important finding has been novel roles for inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6) in pancreatic betacells, particularly in the regulation of voltage-gated Ltype Ca channels, exo- and endocytosis. However, the influence of InsP 6 on L-type Ca 2 + channels is not limited to beta-cells. In this thesis it was shown that in hippocampal neurons, InsP 6 also increases L-type Ca 2 + channel activity by activation of the adenylyl cyclase (Apolipoprotein kinase A (PKA) cascade. InsP 6 stimulates AC without influencing cAMP phosphodiesterase, resulting in activation of PKA and thereby selective enhancement of L-type Ca 2 + channel activity. These data suggest that InsP 6 increases L-type Ca 2 + channel activity by facilitation of the phosphorylation of PKA phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, InsP 6 Concentration is elevated in activated hippocampal neurons, suggesting a relevant physiological role. We have also shown that <b>higher</b> inositol <b>polyphosphates</b> can act as a source for important second messengers, independent of the hydrolysis of Ptdlns(4, 5) P 2. Thus, Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 can be derived from dephosphorylation of Ins(1, 3, 4, 5, 6) P 5 and InsP 6 by cytosolic multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (cyt-MIPP), a truncated cytosolic form of the largely ER-confined MIPP. Cyt-MIPP was expressed in a poorly-responsive beta-cell line (HIT M 2. 2. 2) with an abnormally low basal [Ca 2 +]i. The low basal [Ca 2 +]i of these cells was raised to normal levels in cyt-MIPP expressing HIT M 2. 2. 2 cells (35 nM to 115 nM). Cyt-MIPP expression also led to a markedly enhanced glucoseinduced C 2 +-response, indicating that basal [Ca 2 +]i is an important modulator of Ca 2 +signalling in the pancreatic beta-cell. Expression of cyt-MIPP in HIT M 2. 2. 2 cells also led to a significant decrease in cell growth and increased cell volume. In vitro and in intact cells, cyt-MIPP attacks not only its known inositol polyphosphate substrates but also phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PtdIns (3, 4, 5) P 3), a mitogenic signal. Thus cyt-MIPP shares some properties with PTEN, a tumor suppressor and PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 phosphatase, suggesting that the reduced PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 concentration contributes to growth-inhibition by cyt-MIPP. In contrast, full length MIPP increases cell growth, suggesting divergent phenotypes dependent on the cellular localization of this enzyme. A detailed study of Ptdlns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and other PI 3 -kinase products in normal HIT T 15 cells revealed that 1. the high level of PtdIns(3, 4, 5) P 3 in beta-cells in a previous study was an artifact, 2. phosphatidyl-inositol 3, 5 -bisphosphate (Ptdlns(3, 5) P 2) is present in beta-cells and together with Ptdlns(3, 4, 5) P 3 and Ptdlns(3, 4) P 2 increase in response to glucose stimulation alone, 3. the glucosestimulated rise in 3 -phosphorylated lipids was secondary to insulin secretion. Our data suggest that the effect of glucose on 3 -phosphorylated inositol lipids is through an insulindependent positive feedback loop.

An efficient EBPR was obtained and mass balances over the anaerobic reactor showed a production of 1. 45 g poly-b-hydroxyalcanoic acids (PHA), measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD), per g of acetic acid (as COD) taken up. Furthermore, phosphate was released in the anaerobic reactor in a ratio of 0. 33 g phosphorus (P) per g PHA (COD) formed and 0. 64 g of glycogen (COD) was consumed per g of acetic acid (COD) taken up. Microscopic investigations revealed a <b>high</b> amount of <b>polyphosphate</b> accumulating organisms (PAO) in the sludge. Isolation and characterisation of bacteria indicated Acinetobacter spp. to be abundant in the sludge, while sequencing of clones obtained in a 16 S rDNA clone library showed {{a large part of the}} bacteria to be related to the high mole % G+C Gram-positive bacteria and only a minor fraction to be related to the gamma-subclass of proteobacteria to which Acinetobacter belongs. Operation of a similar anaerobic/aerobic laboratory system with ethanol as sole carbon source showed that a high EBPR can be achieved with this compound as carbon source. However, a prolonged detention time in the anaerobic reactor was required. PHA were produced in the anaerobic reactor in an amount of 1. 24 g COD per g of soluble COD taken up, phosphate was released in an amount of 0. 4 - 0. 6 g P per g PHA (COD) produced and 0. 46 g glycogen (COD) was consumed per g of soluble COD taken up. Studies of the EBPR in the UCT process at the sewage treatment plant in Helsingborg, Sweden, showed the amount of volatile fatty acids (VFA) available to the PAO in the anaerobic stage to be limiting phosphorous removal. Operating the primary clarifier to obtain an enhanced hydrolysis and fermentation of primary sludge was shown to generate extra VFA and improve EBPR. VFA were shown to be transformed to PHA in the anaerobic stage of the plant, giving a PHA production of 1. 5 g COD per g VFA (COD). Phosphate-P was released in an amount of 0. 31 g per g PHA (COD) produced. Nitrate was used as an electron acceptor for oxidation of stored PHA in the anoxic stage of the plant during simultaneous P-uptake.
