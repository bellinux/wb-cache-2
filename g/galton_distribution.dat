2500|$|In {{probability}} theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) {{distribution is}} a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable [...] is log-normally distributed, then [...] has a normal distribution. Likewise, if [...] has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of , , has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values. The distribution is occasionally {{referred to as}} the <b>Galton</b> <b>distribution</b> or Galton's distribution, after Francis Galton. The log-normal distribution also has been associated with other names, such as McAlister, Gibrat and Cobbâ€“Douglas.|$|E
