500|$|Asked at {{the hearing}} by Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{attorney}} Roger Robb whether he was planning [...] "to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States", Teller replied that:I {{do not want to}} suggest anything of the kind. I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States. I believe this, and I shall believe <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> see very conclusive proof to the opposite.He was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a [...] "security risk", to which he testified: ...|$|E
500|$|Before each segment, {{there are}} {{trailers}} advertising fake films, {{as well as}} vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. [...] "I didn't even know about <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> {{read it in the}} trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'" [...] Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, [...] "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'" [...] Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

2500|$|Hunter's next album, Overnight Angels (1977), was {{produced}} by Roy Thomas Baker and featured a heavier guitar sound courtesy of former Bowie sideman Earl Slick. Hunter's record label in America, Columbia Records, refused to release the album in the US due to issues concerning Hunter's management: [...] "Overnight Angels was not released in the US because I fired my manager, Fred Heller, during the English promotional tour – just before {{it was to be}} released in America. Columbia said they didn't want to release <b>it</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> had new management and that dragged on until it became too late." ...|$|E
