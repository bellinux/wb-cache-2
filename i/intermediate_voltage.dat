2500|$|In flash memory, each {{memory cell}} resembles a {{standard}} MOSFET, {{except that the}} transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this there is a floating gate (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, electrons placed on it are trapped until they are removed by another application of electric field (e.g. Applied voltage or UV as in EPROM). Counter-intuitively, placing electrons on the FG sets the transistor to the logical [...] "0" [...] state. Once the FG is charged, the electrons in it screen (partially cancel) the electric field from the CG, thus, increasing the threshold voltage (VT1) of the cell. This means that now a higher voltage(VT2) must {{be applied to the}} CG to make the channel conductive. In order to read a value from the transistor, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage</b> between the threshold voltages (VT1 & VT2) is applied to the CG. If the channel conducts at this <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage,</b> the FG must be uncharged (if it was charged, we would not get conduction because the <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage</b> is less than VT2), and hence, a logical [...] "1" [...] is stored in the gate. If the channel does not conduct at the <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage,</b> it indicates that the FG is charged, and hence, a logical [...] "0" [...] is stored in the gate. The presence of a logical [...] "0" [...] or [...] "1" [...] is sensed by determining whether there is current flowing through the transistor when the <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage</b> is asserted on the CG. In a multi-level cell device, which stores more than one bit per cell, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), in order to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.|$|E

Similar to the common combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles requires power and control systems to operate the 12 Vdc auxiliaries, such as lights, indicators and wipers. Traditional technology results in a large number of wires in the wiring harness. To reduce the number of wires, an alternative method is to use a pair of control lines and a universal power connection around the vehicle. This power and control system is named the "Power Distribution Network" and it is implemented by using multiple power converters and a differential control system. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and test results of the Power Distribution Network for the MR 2. The 300 Vdc nominal battery voltage is converted to an <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage</b> of 48 V. This configuration is considered more efficient than the usual 12 V distribution system since smaller and lighter wires can be used to carry same amount of power. The Power Distribution Network operates off the 48 V <b>intermediate</b> <b>voltage,</b> and provides 12 V output power to drive all the auxiliaries in the vehicle. The Power Distribution Network also has the ability of detect faults from the auxiliary loads as well as turn on and off these loads.
