5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte <b>Grappa</b> with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back {{into the top of}} the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, by way of the climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E

25|$|Italian Stravecchio {{has been}} {{produced}} since the 1700s in the North of Italy, especially in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, using grapes popular in winemaking such as Sangiovese and Grignolino. Colour, texture and finish are most resembling {{those of their}} French and Spanish counterparts. Most popular brands are Vecchia Romagna, Stravecchio Branca and Stock 84. Northern Italy is also noted since the Middle Ages for another type of wine spirit, <b>Grappa,</b> which is generally colourless but has some top-shelf varieties called barrique which are aged in oak casks and achieve the same caramel colour as regular brandies. There is a vast production of Stravecchios and Grappas in Italy, with more than 600 large, medium or small distilleries in operation. Ticino is also allowed to produce pomace brandy {{under the name of}} <b>Grappa.</b>|$|E

She was still living alone in her home on her 115th birthday. In 2016 she credited her long life to her diet of raw eggs and cookies, and to staying single.|$|E
25|$|The {{action was}} fought {{during the second}} relief of the Siege of Mantua. The Austrians left Davidovich's corps in the upper Adige valley while {{transferring}} two divisions to Bassano del <b>Grappa</b> by marching east, then south down the Brenta River valley. The Austrian army commander Dagobert von Würmser planned to march south-west from Bassano to Mantua, completing the clockwise manoeuvre. Meanwhile, Davidovich would threaten a descent from the north to distract the French.|$|E
25|$|On 16 August {{after the}} Castglione campaign, Schübirz {{was ordered to}} march two battalions of the Deutschmeister Infantry Regiment Nr. 4 and two squadrons of the Erdödy Hussar Regiment Nr. 11 to hold Pontebba, a {{strategic}} point in northeastern Italy. The trek took two weeks {{but as soon as}} he arrived there, he was recalled to Bassano del <b>Grappa.</b> This march took an additional two weeks, but by this time the Battle of Bassano was fought on 8 September.|$|E
25|$|The Italian 2nd Army {{commander}} Luigi Capello was commanding while bedridden with fever. Realizing {{that his}} forces were ill-prepared for this attack and were being routed, Capello requested permission to withdraw {{back to the}} Tagliamento. He was overruled by Cadorna who believed that the Italian force could regroup and hold out. Finally, on 30 October 1917, Cadorna ordered {{the majority of the}} Italian force to retreat {{to the other side of}} the Tagliamento. It took the Italians four full days to cross the river, and by this time the German and Austro-Hungarian armies were on their heels. By 2 November, a German division had established a bridgehead on the Tagliamento. About this time, however, the rapid success of the attack caught up with them. The German and Austro-Hungarian supply lines were stretched to breaking point and consequently they were unable to launch another attack to isolate a part of the Italian army against the Adriatic. Cadorna was able to retreat further and by 10 November had established a position on the Piave River and Monte <b>Grappa,</b> where the last push of the German and Austro-Hungarian forces was met and defeated by Italian forces at the First Battle of Monte <b>Grappa.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{consists of}} the square base, on top {{of which is a}} terrace with the arch in the middle and an altar located {{at the center of the}} arch. The base's sides are each 80 meters long, and two 35-meter staircases lead up to the terrace. The Roman arch is quadrifrons, meaning four-faced with four arches. With its hilltop location and a height of 47 meters, the arch is visible from throughout the Asiago plateau. This arch, along with the memorials of Pasubio, Cimone, and Monte <b>Grappa,</b> has become a symbol of the province of Vicenza. On the parapet of the terrace are arrows indicating the names of surrounding mountains and important battle sites. Around the entire memorial are original cannons that have been restored.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Ettlingen, Mészáros went to Italy, where Wurmser had {{replaced}} Johann Beaulieu as commander-in-chief. During the first relief of the Siege of Mantua, the army commander assigned Mészáros to lead IV Column. This force {{moved down the}} Brenta River valley to Bassano del <b>Grappa</b> {{at the end of}} July. From there, he approached Mantua from the northeast via Vicenza. Unfortunately, this left the IV Column remote from the action during a critical phase of operations. When Mészáros' troops finally arrived near Mantua, Wurmser ordered him to observe the French division that had just raised the siege of that fortress. But Pascal Fiorella's division got off to an early start on 5 August and Mészáros was unable to intercept it. Fiorella's attack against the left rear of the Austrian army helped Bonaparte win the Battle of Castiglione.|$|E

500|$|Considerable {{variations}} {{exist in}} the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas [...] "Chilean pisco is mass-produced", the Peruvian version [...] "is made in small batches." [...] Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that [...] "n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it {{is very similar to}} <b>grappa.</b> In Chile, pisco is made in a column still and aged in wood; it is similar to a very light cognac." [...] Chilean oenologist Patricio Tapia adds that while Chilean pisco producers usually mix vine stocks, Peruvian producers have specific pisco types that use the aromatic qualities of vines such as Yellow Muscat and Italia. Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their vintage year and the Chilean versions do not.|$|E
500|$|Five stages {{ended with}} climbs, with most {{coming in the}} race's last week. The first was stage 8 to Monte Terminillo, a [...] long climb gaining [...] of {{vertical}} elevation for an average gradient of 7.3 percent, {{one of the most}} difficult climbs in the Apennine Mountains in the region of Abruzzo. The next was Monte Zoncolan in the Carnic Alps, which at [...] in length was shorter than some of the other climbs in the race, but with [...] of vertical gain in that time, its 20 percent maximum gradient made it {{one of the most difficult}}. The Stage 16 individual time trial went to Plan de Corones, on a course identical to the one used in the 2008 Giro d'Italia. In , this stage gained over [...] and featured a section with 24 percent gradients in the final kilometer. The Giro's last two road race stages were especially climbing-intensive, including the Passo del Mortirolo, rising [...] in [...] for an average gradient of 10 percent, and the Passo di Gavia, known for being climbed during the 1988 Giro d'Italia in the middle of a driving blizzard. The Gavia was also the Cima Coppi, the race's highest point, and Stage 20, in which it featured, was considered the queen stage. Other climbs during the race included the Passo del Bratello, Monte <b>Grappa,</b> the Passo delle Palade, the Passo di Santa Cristina, the Forcola di Livigno, and the last climb of the race, the Passo del Tonale. Most of these climbs also featured difficult descents.|$|E

2500|$|... (No1576/89) {{provides}} for a double system of protection of spirit descriptions. Spirits are divided into 21 categories, which each have rules for fabrication and minimum strength. Within these categories, certain names are reserved for drinks from particular countries, for example ouzo, which is aniseed-flavoured spirit drink which must have been produced exclusively in Greece or Cyprus, or <b>grappa,</b> which is a grape marc spirit produced in Italy, or pálinka, which is a purely fruit based spirit produced in Hungary. The Regulation also defines a number of geographical designations, which are reserved for drinks which [...] "acquired their character and definitive qualities" [...] in the area denominated. The exact delimitation of the areas and any other regulations are left to the Member States concerned. By way of derogation, the designations Königsberger Bärenfang and Ostpreußischer Bärenfang are permitted for certain German drinks even though they refer to Königsberg (Kaliningrad) and East Prussia which are no longer part of Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Scarponi led a team at a Grand Tour for {{the first}} time, leading the [...] team. After rarely {{featuring}} {{in the first half}} of the race, Scarponi steadily worked his way up the general classification as the race hit the high mountains. He finished third on successive days, on stage 14 to Monte <b>Grappa,</b> and stage 15 to Monte Zoncolan; on the latter stage, he had been in the lead group until he was distanced by Cadel Evans and Ivan Basso. He remained eighth overall until he took a prestigious victory on stage 19, where he went clear of the field on the Mortirolo Pass with [...] teammates, Nibali and Basso. Basso was attempting to take the overall lead, so Nibali and him made most of the work during the dangerous descent and subsequent uphill ride to Aprica, leaving Scarponi fresh enough to out sprint the pair. Scarponi moved up to fourth overall as a result; he moved to within a second of the overall podium the following day at the Tonale Pass, but ultimately finished thirteen seconds shy in fourth place, after the final stage individual time trial in Verona. He also finished fourth in the points classification and fifth in the mountains classification. With the exception of the Brixia Tour and the Vuelta a Burgos, Scarponi contested single-day races for the remainder of the season; he took three podium placings in the autumn, with a third-place finish at the Giro dell'Emilia, and runner-up finishes at the Gran Premio Industria e Commercio di Prato, and also at World Ranking level − in his final ride for [...] − in the Giro di Lombardia.|$|E
