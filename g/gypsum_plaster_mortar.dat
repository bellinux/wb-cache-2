40|$|International audienceSulphate {{neoformation}} is a {{major factor}} of degradation of stone monuments. Boron, sulphur and oxygen isotope signatures were investigated for five French historical monuments (Bourges, Chartres and Marseille cathedrals, Chenonceau castle, and Versailles garden statues) to investigate the role of intrinsic sulphate sources (<b>gypsum</b> <b>plasters</b> and <b>mortars)</b> in stone degradation, compared to the influence of extrinsic sources such as atmospheric pollution. <b>Gypsum</b> <b>plasters</b> and gypsum-containing <b>mortars</b> fall systematically in the δ 34 S and δ 18 O range of Paris Basin Eocene evaporites indicating the origin of the raw materials (so-called "Paris plaster"). Black crusts show the typical S and O isotope signatures observed elsewhere in Europe that can be attributed to atmospheric pollution, together with a marine component for Marseille. Boron isotopes for black crusts indicate coal combustion as principal boron source. Mortar isotope compositions discriminate three types, one similar to <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasters,</b> one strongly depleted in 34 S, attributed to pyrite oxidation, and a third one close to atmospheric sulphates. The isotopic composition of sulphates and boron of most degraded building stones of the different monuments is well explained by the identified sulphate sources. In several cases (in particular for Chenonceau and Bourges, to some extent for Chartres), the impact of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> as building and restoration material on the degradation of the stones in its vicinity was clearly demonstrated. The study illustrates the usefulness of multi-isotope studies to investigate stone degradation factors, as the combination of several isotope systematics increases the discriminatory power of isotope studies with respect to contaminant sources...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} produce an {{economic}} and ecological building material respecting the quality and safety common standards. Large wealth of gypsum even naturally in the careers or through phosphate industry has got in Morocco. After dehydration of gypsum, we obtain the plaster. This material is broadly used in the construction industry. The plaster is characterized by its good fire resistance, soundproofing and insulation and its decorative virtues. However, the principal limit of this substance is its water –keeping behavior. In order to resolve this problem, this study {{is focused on the}} conception of a new binder containing plaster and sulfoaluminate clinker.

40|$|Lime and <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasters</b> and <b>mortars</b> are an {{important}} class of architectural materials that were first developed in the Near East some 11, 000 years ago. This study examines changes in the technology of production and use of these materials at Petra and Udruh, south Jordan. It aims to understand the technological developments during a sequence of time periods and to explain the use of certain mixes for specific applications. It concentrates upon the Nabataean/ Roman/ Byzantine transitions in order to define the technological styles of their production in each period and to examine the technological exchanges of knowledge in both directions that occurred through imperial conquest. This study has developed an independent chronology by radiocarbon dating of the samples' lime-binder and organic inclusions. Stepped-dissolution techniques were developed to overcome the problem posed {{by the addition of}} unburnt limestone aggregate to burnt lime plasters, and the method was tested successfully on samples of known age at Petra. The technology of <b>plaster</b> and <b>mortar</b> production was studied by X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence, and optical petrography, supplemented by measurements of porosity, aggregate/binder ratios and grain size distributions. I found that the Romans made changes to the Nabatean recipes used for binding and for coating with multiple layers, but they made no changes to the plaster recipes used to line cisterns and canals. The Byzantines produced plasters by combining Nabatean and Roman recipes to produce coating plaster of lower quality. Ayyubid and Ottoman samples at Udruh are of low quality (soft, very porous, and rich in organic inclusions). In summary, Results support the claim that Petra was not abandoned during the Byzantine period. It found that the Nabateans used a diversity of recipes and the Romans used lime-plaster only, crushed ceramics were used from early Hellenistic to late Byzantine times, and it is unwise to use only color to differentiate between Nabatean and Roman mortar...|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} in nomenclature between stucco, <b>plaster,</b> and <b>mortar</b> is {{based more on}} use than composition. Until {{the latter part of}} the nineteenth century, it was common that plaster, which was used inside a building, and stucco, which was used outside, would consist of the same primary materials: lime and sand (which are also used in mortar). Animal or plant fibers were often added for additional strength. In the latter nineteenth century, Portland cement was added with increasing frequency in an attempt to improve the durability of stucco. At the same time, traditional lime plasters were being replaced by <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster.</b>|$|R

Normal commercial <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> building components wich are made from -hemihydrate binders habe porosities between 0, 45 and 0, 55. The corresponding property values can be improved by a factor of more than 3 by halving the porosity. However, practical implementation of these results requires different production processes which will allow the water/plaster ratio to be lowered to values around 0, 3. Water/plaster ratios of < 0, 25 have already been achieved on an experimental basis. For the same porosity <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> products made from a- and -hemihydrate have practically the same mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As a new self-Insulation wall material, the {{autoclaved}} {{aerated concrete}} block has many advantages such as lightweight, thermal insulation, waste recycling, low energy consumption, friendly to environment, etc. It is gaining favors in the construction market day by day, and has been more and more widely used in construction engineering program. However, aerated concrete block faces disadvantages, e. g. large volume deformation coefficient, high water absorption, low strength, brittle character, etc. When aerated concrete block is used in combination with plain mortar, many problems may appear due to the incompatibility between them, for example crevices on the wall, large cracking, hollowing and exfoliation on the plaster layer, which become more serious on the north-facing wall in the cold region. These problems greatly hinder the wide application of aerated concrete block. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} develop a special <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar</b> that is compatible with the aerated concrete block. This paper concentrates on the chemical admixtures such as polymer and fiber, and studies their influences on the performance of the special <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar.</b> The experimental results show that polymer powder can significantly improve the properties of <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar</b> such as bonding strength, absorption performance and cohesive quality. Also, it prevents the bleeding and segregation of the paste, prevents the hollowing and exfoliation of <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar</b> layer on aerated concrete block wall. Polypropylene fiber has been revealed to increase the fracture toughness and cracking resistance of <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar,</b> thus preventing the cracking of <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar</b> layer on aerated concrete block wall. Additionally, this paper presents the microstructure of <b>plaster</b> <b>mortar</b> and discusses the working mechanism of admixtures in the mortar...|$|R

The assessment of <b>plastering</b> <b>mortars</b> with Phase Change Materials (PCMs) is experimentally investigated in this paper, aiming to assess the effectiveness of the PCM into the mortar, here termed as single PCM <b>plastering</b> <b>mortar</b> (SPCMM). In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the PCM mortar concept, two experiments have been performed. Two small-scale cubic test cells have been constructed, with outer edge of 26 cm and inner edge of 20 cm. In regard to the outer lining of these two cells, the following applies: one of them was externally lined with conventional mortar (here termed as REFM); and another lined with single PCM <b>plastering</b> <b>mortar.</b> The cells were closed, placed inside climatic chambers and subjected to realistic temperature scenarios in South European countries, whereas the inner temperature was continuously recorded. It was shown that a smoother indoor temperature profile is obtained when PCMs are implemented. An improvement in human comfort can thus be anticipated.
