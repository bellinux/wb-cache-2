5|$|Wiggins {{was born}} in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Karla Wiggins, raised him as a single parent. He played {{baseball}} with his friends at a park across from the Rose Bowl. As a child, Wiggins was {{a fan of the}} Los Angeles Dodgers, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Maury Wills, a Dodgers player known for stealing bases. Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California; the school was also the alma mater of baseball star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins was , taller than a typical infielder. He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet.|$|E

25|$|Not long afterward, {{during the}} heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and bowed to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.|$|E

The {{following}} day Short and the five others were escorted to the train depot and given their choice of east or west-bound trains. Short went east to Kansas City, Missouri, where <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> Charles E. Bassett at the Marble Hall Saloon.

Bassett had served as the first sheriff of Ford County, as well as city marshal of Dodge City. Both Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson had served under Bassett as deputies.|$|E
25|$|While a {{conductor}} at the Augsburg palace, Wendelin married Rosalie Scholle from Leipzig on 10 January 1865. They were married for 45 years but produced no children. Rosalie survived her husband, dying {{at the age}} of 79 on 25 September 1920 in Darmstadt. From Augsburg, Weißheimer went to the Kroll Opera in Berlin, then to the theater in Düsseldorf. From 1866 to 1868 he was in Würzburg. From here he tried once again a world premiere of his patriotic opera Theodor Körner. For this reason <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Wagner in Munich. Wagner was living with Hans and Cosima von Bülow in a house on Arcisstraße, donated to him by the king and where Cosima was a housewife who took care of Wagner's correspondence. Wagner soon became interested in Mrs. Bülow. His relationship with Weißheimer began to wane, and Weißheimer drew closer to Peter Cornelius at the premiere of the latter's 1865 opera Der Cid.|$|E
500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; he was very good at one thing and made no apologies for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E

500|$|Hearing {{that his}} friend and former minor league {{teammate}} Greg Montalbano had died of testicular cancer {{at the age of}} 31 late on August 21, Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend's memory. After inscribing [...] "GM" [...] in marker on his cap, he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees, while driving in six runs. Both times as he crossed home plate, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said. [...] "There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You ... feel like there's somebody out there somewhere pushing balls out for you, and doing great things." ...|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|At Wills' invitation, {{his cousin}} H. C. A. Harrison took up {{football}} in 1859, and {{quickly became a}} leading player and captain. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to Wills, terming him [...] "the beau-ideal of an athlete"—high praise given that Harrison was the champion runner of Victoria. Their presence in Geelong fuelled a local craze for football and ensured the Geelong Football Club's supremacy in the early 1860s. In an era when players moved freely among clubs, Wills still represented Melbourne, and in 1860, was the first captain and secretary of the Richmond Football Club (no connection with the AFL club). The code underwent revisions around this time, principally {{in response to the}} on-field actions of dominant players. [...] "And there were none more dominant than Wills and Harrison", writes Coventry.|$|E

500|$|In September 1833, after {{traveling}} to the French village of Besançon to find cheap paper for a publishing enterprise, Balzac crossed into Switzerland and registered at the Hôtel du Faucon under the name Marquis d'Entragues. He sent word to Hańska that he would visit the garden of the Maison Andrié, {{where she and her}} family were staying. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and saw her face at the window, then– as he described it later– he [...] "lost all bodily sensation". They met later that day (September 25) at a spot overlooking Lake Neuchâtel; according to legend, he noticed a woman reading one of his books. He was overwhelmed with her beauty, and she wrote soon afterwards to her brother, describing Balzac as [...] "cheerful and lovable just like you".|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} years of his {{political}} career Davis was on good terms with Daniel Webster, who was highly influential in party politics both at the state and national levels, and to whom <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b> [...] However, in the late 1830s Davis and other Massachusetts Whigs (notably Abbott Lawrence) came to believe that Webster lacked broad-based national support to successfully contend with Henry Clay and William Henry Harrison after his weak showing in the 1836 Whig convention. [...] This introduced a rift between Webster and Davis that deepened in 1838 when the two split on western land policies. [...] The split between Davis and Webster became permanent after Webster harshly criticized Lawrence in an 1842 speech celebrating his successful negotiation of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty with Great Britain, which resolved (among other matters) the northeast boundary.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [...] did, and when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E

500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood {{for a minute or two}} before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|According to Chen, Cloud was {{designed}} to [...] "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke." [...] Chen had the first idea for the game; while walking to school one day <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at the sky, noticing {{the difference between the}} fluffy clouds there and the [...] "polluted and gray" [...] clouds of Shanghai where he was born, and thought about making a game about clouds. It was given a story to [...] "create the premise and help player to be emotionally invested"; however, the team avoided making the story too strong, as it would [...] "distract the player from the core experience" [...] of flying freely and shaping clouds. In the early stages of development, the game had an involved backstory about an alien who attempts to clean up the environment, but this was cut down to [...] "a simple 'poetic' introduction to the cloud child trapped in a hospital bed." [...] The team intended Cloud to [...] "communicate a feeling of youthfulness, freedom, and the wonder of imagination." [...] It was built on a modified version of a game engine developed by several team members for their previous game, Dyadin. At the 2006 Game Developers Conference student showcase, Chen and Santiago pitched Cloud to Sony representative John Hight as the first game in the [...] "Zen" [...] genre. Hight was interested, but Sony declined to publish the game.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{starts with}} Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announcing to her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that she needs}} to go to Chicago for jury duty because she is still {{registered}} to vote there. Jack gives Liz a powerful sedative for the trip. Later, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) walks in on a meeting between Jack and the American silver medalist in tetherball, Tyler Brody (Remy Auberjonois). Tyler is angry at Jack for not selecting him as the gold medalist, and is threatening to go public with the revelation that there was no Olympic tetherball competition during the 2008 Summer Olympics, as it was staged to boost NBC's ratings. To keep him quiet, Jack tells him that he can [...] "be the voice of Knight Rider" [...] in a film adaptation, which Tyler considers. Afterwards, Kenneth tells Jack that he [...] "lost two heroes today", as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to both Jack and Tyler. As a result, Jack wants to be in Kenneth's good side, but wants to break his moral absolutism, after Kenneth did not hesitate to attempt to kill himself when he believed the air in a stalled elevator was about to run out. Jack finally succeeds when he supplies Kenneth with a big screen television, but no cable hookup. Kenneth steals cable and later confesses to Jack, asking if SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "is supposed to be terrifying".|$|E
