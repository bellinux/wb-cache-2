40|$|Abstract. In {{the history}} of <b>document</b> <b>circulation,</b> many {{participants}} may annotate and sign on the document so as to produce a final authentic <b>document.</b> This <b>circulation</b> process requires that a later participant can know the <b>document</b> <b>circulation</b> history, verify all the previous annotations, but can not modify them. To be applicable to devices of limited resources, the document processing approach should be efficient in terms of computational cost and network overhead. This paper extends an aggregate signature scheme so as to combine many signatures into one no matter which kind of circulating route (sequential, parallel, or hybrid) is. Since the proposal enables to manage the documents easily, it is useful and practical in office automation applications. ...|$|R
40|$|Document {{management}} {{underlies the}} activities of almost every organization. Correctly managed correspondence and organized <b>document</b> <b>circulation</b> characterize successful performance particularly {{in the public sector}} organizations. Even though production of documents itself is not the main task of governmental institutions, document creation and processing are crucial processes for the provision of basic functions in public sector. In the 21 st century it gets more important to use the new possibilities offered by modern technologies, including electronic document management. Public sector itself is a heavy bureaucratic apparatus in the need of elasticity and ability to change its working processes and habits in order to gradually switch to the digital environment. Western European countries have already turned to electronic document management whilst most of the Eastern European countries, including Latvia, have just recently started a gradual electronization of <b>document</b> <b>circulation.</b> When implementing electronic document management systems in the public sector organizations, it often comes to resistance of the staff and unwillingness to change the accustomed methods of work – paper format <b>document</b> <b>circulation.</b> Both lower level staff and higher level managers put obstacles to electronic document management. In this article author inspects cases of successful practice and analyses possible action mechanisms that could convince public sector personnel of advantages of electronic <b>document</b> <b>circulation</b> and prepare them to switch to work with digital documents...|$|R
