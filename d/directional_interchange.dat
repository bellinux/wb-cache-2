The freeway rounds Lake Shamrock north of downtown and intersections the joint northern end of two business loops. There is a welcome center in the median of US127/US10 before the two highways separate north of the city.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop in Clare. The northern half of {{the route of the}} highway is shared with Bus. US10, running concurrently through downtown. The southern end is at a <b>directional</b> <b>interchange</b> with US127 south of Clare in Isabella County. This interchange provides access to northbound Bus. US127 from northbound US127 only, and traffic from the southbound business loop must enter the southbound freeway only. The business loop runs northwesterly away from the freeway to a roundabout intersection with Mission Road. Bus. US127 turns northward on Mission Road, crossing into Clare County and following McEwan Street through residential areas {{on the south side of}} Clare. At the intersection with 5th Street in downtown, Bus. US10 merges in from the east and M-115 terminates from the west. Bus. US127/Bus. US10 passes through a residential area on the north side of the city and crosses the South Branch of the Tobacco River.

5|$|From here, I-695 heads {{northeast}} as {{an eight}} lane road and enters Pikesville, where it intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at a single-point urban interchange. A short distance later, the road {{comes to a}} partial interchange with MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue), with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. I-695 heads east to another partial interchange with Stevenson Road, which has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. The Baltimore Beltway passes through heavily forested land as it encounters Greenspring Avenue. Past this interchange, I-695 continues northeast through woodland before coming to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The interchange includes connections to MD 25 (Falls Road), which heads into the open countryside north of Baltimore. Within this interchange, I-83 forms a concurrency with I-695 and the roadway widens to ten lanes, with six for the Beltway and four for I-83. After running concurrently, I-83 splits from I-695 by heading north on the Harrisburg Expressway at a <b>directional</b> <b>interchange.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ground {{was broken}} for the highway project in April 2006, with major {{construction}} beginning in May. Caltrans estimated completion in late 2009 for {{the completion of}} the four-lane expressway, including a new <b>directional</b> <b>interchange</b> at each end, at which State Route 70 and State Route 99 will exit and enter {{to the right of the}} main Oroville-Chico movement. Most access was closed, with Shippee Road providing the sole at-grade crossing of the expressway, and an overcrossing near State Route 70 giving access to local property. Shippee Road was relocated to the southeast, allowing for the future construction of an interchange. In addition, State Route 70 was relocated to the west between SR 149 and State Route 191, and local access on State Route 99 between SR 149 and the Durham Dayton Highway interchange was replaced by frontage roads. The entire project was completed in November 2008, at a cost of $125 million.|$|E
5|$|I-695 turns south past MD 43 and {{interchanges}} with US 1 (Belair Road) {{south of}} White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F.

This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully <b>directional</b> <b>interchange</b> where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|E

5|$|M-85 {{starts a}} <b>directional</b> <b>interchange</b> with I-75 in near Rockwood; traffic {{to or from}} {{southbound}} I-75 must use Gibraltar Road instead. M-85 runs north from this interchange to Gibraltar Road as a full freeway; north of that intersection the highway becomes a boulevard. There are many businesses directly adjacent to Fort Street in the Downriver area with residential subdivisions {{on either side of}} them. The trunkline parallels lines of the Norfolk Southern and Canadian National railways. In this area, M-85 is also running parallel to, but inland from, {{the southern part of the}} Detroit River. The highway runs northeasterly through Gibraltar to Trenton, where it turns due north. Fort Street forms the boundary between Riverview and Trenton in the area near the Riverview Landing Shopping Center between King and Silbey Roads; north of here, Riverview extends along both sides of the road. At Pennsylvania Road, Fort Street crosses into the city of Southgate and curves to the northeast near the Southgate Tower office building. The highway returns to a due northerly course near Memorial Park and continues along the Southgate–Wyandotte city line. This area is mainly residential neighborhoods that extend in street grids on either side of the Fort Street boulevard.|$|E
25|$|After the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, I-278 {{continues}} into Brooklyn on the Gowanus Expressway. Immediately {{after the}} bridge, the freeway {{comes to an}} eastbound exit and westbound entrance for the Belt Parkway. After this, a full interchange serves 92nd Street at which point I-278 becomes a single-level six-lane freeway. Soon after, one of the eastbound lanes becomes as a high-occupancy vehicle lane. The Gowanus Expressway continues northeast into urban residential neighborhoods and reaches an eastbound interchange at Fort Hamilton Parkway and a westbound interchange at 86th Street. Turning more to the north, I-278 comes to a partial interchange at 65th Street, with an exit eastbound and entrance eastbound.
