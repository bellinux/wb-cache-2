50|$|Tightening {{environmental}} regulations resulted in increased costs {{of hazardous waste}} disposal in industrialised countries in the 1980s, causing ships to be exported to lower income nations, chiefly South Asia. This, in turn, created a far worse environmental problem, subsequently leading to the Basel Convention. In 2004 a Basel Convention decision officially classified old ships as “toxic waste”, preventing them from leaving a country without {{the permission of the}} <b>importing</b> <b>state.</b> This has led to a resurgence of recycling in environmentally-compliant locations in developed countries, especially in former ship building yards.|$|E
50|$|Appendix I, about 1200 species, are {{species that}} are {{threatened}} with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII). The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population. Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the <b>importing</b> <b>state</b> is able {{to care for the}} specimen adequately. Notable animal species listed in Appendix I include the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), the chimpanzee species (Pan spp.), tigers (Panthera tigris subspecies), Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), leopards (Panthera pardus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), some populations of African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the dugong and manatees (Sirenia), and all rhinoceros species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).|$|E
40|$|This text is an only {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the Herbert Krüger Memorial Lecture that I held upon invitation of the Arbeitskreis Überseeische Verfassungsvergleichung on 4 July 2014 at Bucerius Law School in Hamburg. My point of departure is the observation that even though the economic exploitation of natural resources triggers a multitude of distribution conflicts, international and transnational law treat these conflicts inadequately. While the New International Economic Order had as one of its objectives distributional justice between resource exporting poor states (former colonies) and resource <b>importing</b> high income <b>states</b> (mostly former imperial powers) its demands were never fully realized. Instead a transnational economic law emerged which can be interpreted as itself establishing a distribution order [...] albeit a distribution order that is not oriented towards distributional justice, but rather posits the market as the best distribution device. This distribution order has depoliticized and deterritorialized distribution conflicts between resource exporting and resource <b>importing</b> <b>states</b> and has secured – through the promotion of privatizations, protection of foreign investments and dismantling of trade barriers – access to resources for the resource <b>importing</b> <b>states.</b> At the same time it has freed <b>importing</b> <b>states</b> from responsibility for the harms that accrue from resource exploitation to the resource exporting states and their populations. I call in this text for a repoliticization of distribution conflicts at the international as well as the (trans) national level, a repoliticization that may be achieved not only through the reform of political, but also economic institutions...|$|R

40|$|In the {{negotiations}} on {{agriculture in the}} World Trade Organization, it was asserted that an <b>importing</b> <b>state</b> trading enterprise affects the domestic market but not the international market. This claim is investigated through specifying a model of intermediaries in international trade. There {{are two kinds of}} intermediaries: first, a state trading enterprise; and second, an n-firm Cournot oligopsony/oligopoly that acts as the counterfactual. Using Japanese market price and quantity data for rice, and elasticity parameters drawn from the literature, the equations of the model are calibrated to these data and parameters. The resulting equations then permit the calculation of the tariff equivalence of the state trading enterprise under different assumptions about market structure, as well as the welfare effects associated with them. The equations are re-specified to model the existing import regime for rice, which is a tariff quota. The conclusions are: first, that, compared with the counterfactual, an <b>importing</b> <b>state</b> trading enterprise acts like a tariff by restricting imports; and second, the current import regime of a tariff quota causes a welfare loss compared with the counterfactual...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the height}} of the Cold War, the {{policies}} of major democratic arms suppliers have stated that human rights violations in the <b>importing</b> <b>state</b> affect their decision to export. After the Cold War, the focus on the importer's human rights record increase in exporter policies. We examine the arms transfer patterns of the four major democratic suppliers between 1976 and 2009 to determine empirically whether the patterns of transfers match policy. We argue that if practice matches policy, then democratic suppliers should not transfer weapons to states violating human rights. However, as global interests of these suppliers have shifted over time we condition our arguments by stating that if practice matches policy, then there still may be transfers of major weapon systems, but of types that are not as useful for violating human rights. We build on existing arms transfer literature by disaggregating exports based on weapons type. The ordered logits we run for each major democratic supplier from 1976 - 2009 show that the major democratic suppliers generally do not account for human rights violations in the <b>importing</b> <b>state,</b> with the one exception being the United States transfer of land weapon systems...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} have emerged that seek to {{understand}} the nature, scope, and significance of arms transfers in the post-Cold War period. A common theme throughout this literature is the assertion that {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union gave birth to a globalized, commercialized US arms industry dependent upon exports to the developing world in order to survive. Using pooled time-series data, this study tests this assertion via Prais- Winsten panel-corrected standard errors regression. The relationship between such transfers and stability in the developing world is also explored. Using a nonrecursive simultaneous equation model, a new measure of stability is constructed accounting for political, economic and social indicators of stability. The study concludes that the global arms trade has been commercialized and that US producers are increasingly targeting countries in the developing world. Arms transfers are also seen to have a negative relationship to stability, as well as lead to lower levels of democracy in the <b>importing</b> <b>state.</b> These results are discussed with reference to US national security and the stated goals of American foreign policy...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{why some}} states consistently secure food imports at prices {{higher than the}} world market price, thereby exacerbating food insecurity domestically. I challenge the idea that free market economics alone can explain these trade behaviors, and instead argue that states take into account political considerations when engaging in food trade that results in inefficient trade. In particular, states that are dependent on imports of staple food products, like cereals, are wary of the potential strategic value of these goods to exporters. I argue that this consideration, combined with the importing state’s ability to mitigate that risk through its own forms of political or economic leverage, will shape {{the behavior of the}} <b>importing</b> <b>state</b> and contribute to its potential for food security. In addition to cross-national analyses, I use case studies of the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Jordan to demonstrate how the political tools available to these importers affect their food security. The results of my analyses suggest that when import dependent states have access to forms of political leverage, {{they are more likely to}} trade efficiently, thereby increasing their potential for food security...|$|E

Article XIV 1. of the Convention provides the right for any Party to adopt stricter domestic measures for trade than are established by the Convention. [Almost certainly the drafters of the Convention meant that a range State was entitled to afford species within its country greater legal protection than that provided by the appendices of CITES. However, this provision has been used more by importing countries to restrict trade than it has by range States for protection purposes. ] 2. Resolution Conf. 2. 6 a) recommends that if a Party deems that an Appendix-II or-III species is being traded in a manner detrimental {{to the survival of}} that species, it should consult directly with the Management Authorities of the countries involved and/or make use of the options to take stricter domestic measures. [This is mildly prejudicial. Consulting with the Management Authority is an obvious first step. But if the species is being exploited unsustainably it is unlikely that stricter domestic measures imposed by an importing country will correct the problem. If the Scientific and Management Authorities in an <b>importing</b> <b>State</b> are better able to determine that a species is being exploited unsustainably in a range State than its own Scientific and Management Authorities then they have a moral responsibility to assist the exporting Party with a management programme for the species. ...|$|E
40|$|Regional trading {{agreements}} are treaties entered into by states. States enter into regional trading agreements {{for different reasons}} {{some of which are}} economic, political and security reasons. Regional trading agreements (herein after RTAs) have been successful in achieving trade liberalization at a much faster speed than the World Trade Organization (herein after WTO). The most notable example of RTAs is the European Communities that has been successful to liberalize both trade in goods and services. Members of those Regional Trading Agreements create rules of origin. Rules of origin are important in allocating the appropriate duty for imported goods. They tell the customs officer where those goods come from. If they come from a country which has a trading agreement with the <b>importing</b> <b>state</b> then the product will receive preferential treatment. The problem at the moment is that there are over four hundred Regional Trading Agreements in the world today. This proliferation of Regional Trading Agreements resulted into a lot of crisscrossing and very complicated rule of origin. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the different possible solutions for the proliferation of Regional Trading Agreements and to propose the most realistic solution to the problem. To perform this task the paper will be divided into three parts. The paper relied both on direct and indirect research methodologies to answer the questions posed by the research paper. The first part deals with the legal and historical background of RTAs. It answers question of why states enter into RTAs and what is the legal basis for the formation of RTAs. The second part deals with proliferation of RTAs. It answers question like are RTAs stumbling blocks or building blocks to the multilateral trading system. It also describes the causes of proliferation of RTAs and the possible solutions. The third part deals with the conclusions and recommendations.
