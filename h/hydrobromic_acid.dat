5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. <b>Hydrobromic</b> <b>acid</b> forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid</b> cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid</b> which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid</b> to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
25|$|The main use for {{phosphorus}} tribromide is for conversion of primary or secondary alcohols to alkyl bromides, as described above. PBr3 usually gives higher yields than <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid,</b> and it avoids problems of carbocation rearrangement- for example even neopentyl bromide {{can be made}} from the alcohol in 60% yield.|$|E

5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric <b>acid,</b> <b>hydrobromic</b> or hydrofluoric <b>acid</b> solutions.|$|R
25|$|The {{strength}} of an acid refers to its ability or tendency {{to lose a}} proton (H+). A strong acid is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent). In water, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves yielding one mole of H+ (as hydronium ion H3O+) and one mole of the conjugate base, A−. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid</b> (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%.|$|E
25|$|Thorium tetrabromide (ThBr4, white, m.p.679°C) can be {{produced}} either by reacting thorium(IV) hydroxide with <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid</b> (which has the disadvantage of often resulting in products contaminated with oxybromides) or by directly reacting bromine or hydrogen bromide with thorium metal or compounds. The product can then be purified by sublimation at 600°C in a vacuum. The melting and boiling points are 679°C and 857°C. Like the tetrachloride, both an α and a β form exist and both are isotypic to the tetrachloride forms, though the phase transition here occurs at 426°C. There is also a low-temperature form. Incomplete reports of the lower bromides ThBr3, ThBr2, and ThBr are known (the last only known as a gas-phase molecular species): ThBr3 and ThBr2 {{are known to be}} very reactive and at high temperatures disproportionate.|$|E
500|$|Bromination {{of metals}} with Br2 tends to yield lower {{oxidation}} states than chlorination with Cl2 when {{a variety of}} oxidation states is available. Bromides {{can be made by}} reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acid,</b> and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas. These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, carbon tetrabromide, or an organic bromide. For example, niobium(V) oxide reacts with carbon tetrabromide at 370°C to form niobium(V) bromide.

40|$|Dihydropyran, a {{versatile}} vinyl ether, reacts with alcohols under mild acid catalysis 1 (p-toluenesulfonic acid or, more effectively, boron trifluoride etherate 2) to form tetrahydropyranyl ethers which are extremely useful protecting groups for alcohols. Hydrochloric and <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acids</b> {{add to the}} highly reactive double bond of dihydropyran to form the corresponding 2 -halotetrahydropyrans which, because of their ease of dehydrohalogenation, are used in situ to prepare 2 -substituted tetrahydropyrans. For example, they react with silver cyanide to form 2 -cyanotetrahydropyran 12 and with Grignard reagents to produce the corresponding 2 -alkyltetrahydropyrans. Chlorine and bromine also add to the double bond to yield the 2, 3 dichloro-and 2, 3 -dibromotetrahydropyrans The halogen in the 2 -position is more reactive, making possible the synthesis of 3 -halo- 2 -substituted tetrahydropyrans. Other Halogenation Reactions: These ethers are stable to alkali, organolithium and Grignard reagents, Red-Al ®, lithium aluminum hydride, acetic anhydride, and chromium trioxide oxidations, yet are easily cleaved by dilute acid to regenerate the alcohol.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to: define the chemical and physical processes leading to stratospheric ozone change that involve polar stratospheric clouds (PSCS) and the reactions occurring on the surfaces of PSC particles; study the formation processes, and the {{physical and chemical properties}} of PSCS, that are relevant to atmospheric chemistry and to the interpretation of field measurements taken during polar stratosphere missions; develop quantitative models describing PSC microphysics and heterogeneous chemical processes; assimilate laboratory and field data into these models; and calculate the extent of chemical processing on PSCs and the impact of specific microphysical processes on polar composition and ozone depletion. During the course of the project, a new coupled microphysics/physical-chemistry/ photochemistry model for stratospheric sulfate aerosols and nitric acid and ice PSCs was developed and applied to analyze data collected during NASA's Arctic Airborne Stratospheric Expedition-II (AASE-II) and other missions. In this model, detailed treatments of multicomponent sulfate aerosol physical chemistry, sulfate aerosol microphysics, polar stratospheric cloud microphysics, PSC ice surface chemistry, as well as homogeneous gas-phase chemistry were included for the first time. In recent studies focusing on AASE measurements, the PSC model was used to analyze specific measurements from an aircraft deployment of an aerosol impactor, FSSP, and NO(y) detector. The calculated results are in excellent agreement with observations for particle volumes as well as NO(y) concentrations, thus confirming the importance of supercooled sulfate/nitrate droplets in PSC formation. The same model has been applied to perform a statistical study of PSC properties in the Northern Hemisphere using several hundred high-latitude air parcel trajectories obtained from Goddard. The rates of ozone depletion along trajectories with different meteorological histories are presently being systematically evaluated to identify the principal relationships between ozone loss and aerosol state. Under this project, we formulated a detailed quantitative model that predicts the multicomponent composition of sulfate aerosols under stratospheric conditions, including sulfuric, nitric, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and <b>hydrobromic</b> <b>acids.</b> This work defined {{for the first time the}} behavior of liquid ternary-system type- 1 b PSCS. The model also allows the compositions and reactivities of sulfate aerosols to be calculated over the entire range of environmental conditions encountered in the stratosphere (and has been incorporated into a trajectory/microphysics model-see above). Important conclusions that derived from this work over the last few years include the following: the HNO 3 content of liquid-state aerosols dominate PSCs below about 195 K; the freezing of nitric acid ice from sulfate aerosol solutions is likely to occur within a few degrees K of the water vapor frost point; the uptake and reactions of HCl in liquid aerosols is a critical component of PSC heterogeneous chemistry. In a related application of this work, the inefficiency of chlorine injection into the stratosphere during major volcanic eruptions was explained on the basis of nucleation of sulfuric acid aerosols in rising volcanic plumes leading to the formation of supercooled water droplets on these aerosols, which efficiently scavenges HCl via precipitation...|$|R
