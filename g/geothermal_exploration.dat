25|$|Several {{hot springs}} on Cayley's southwestern flank {{indicates}} that magmatic heat is still present, providing {{further evidence of}} continuous volcanic activity. The long history of volcanism in the area, coupled with continued subduction off the British Columbia Coast, indicates that volcanism has not yet concluded in the area. Because of this magmatic heat, Mount Cayley has been a target for <b>geothermal</b> <b>exploration.</b> Bottom hole temperatures of 50°C and thermal gradients of less than 100°C have been measured in shallow boreholes on Cayley's southwest flank.|$|E

Others include Meager Creek and Pebble Creek near Pemberton, Lakelse Hot Springs near Terrace, Mount Edziza on the Tahltan Highland and the Lillooet Fault Zone between Harrison Lake and the community of Lillooet. Temperatures of [...] to more than [...] have been measured in shallow boreholes on the southwestern flank of Mount Cayley. However, its severe terrain makes it challenging to develop a proposed 100megawatt power station in the area.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hot springs}} {{associated}} with Meager and Cayley have made these two volcanoes targets for geothermal explorations.

30|$|In {{the recent}} paper by Abraham et al.

Consequently, they obtained CPD results ranging between 11.48 and 21.91 km. However, {{bearing in mind}} the extent of deep-seated magnetic investigations such as CPD, the utilization of such a small window width may be a fundamental error {{in the application of}} spectral methods for aeromagnetic interpretation for <b>geothermal</b> <b>explorations.</b> The authors themselves admitted that the spectrum of a magnetic map only contains depth information to a depth of length (L)/ 2 π, and if the source bodies have bases deeper than L/ 2 π, they cannot be resolved by spectral analysis (Shuey et al.
