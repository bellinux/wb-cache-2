5|$|At {{the end of}} his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam {{expressed}} his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007 presidential election. However, two days later, he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed mandate.|$|E
5|$|In November 1984, Larson {{learned about}} a local radio show {{promotion}} promising a $30,000 prize for matching a $1bill's serial number with a random number read {{out on the}} air. Over several days, he withdrew his remaining winnings in $1bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money. Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. The case remains unsolved to this day.|$|E
5|$|Most of Tender Mercies {{was filmed}} in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas. Beresford largely avoided the Victorian {{architecture}} and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas.

Foote said when he wrote the script <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E

5|$|After {{putting an}} end to the {{internal}} strife, Basil II launched a counter-campaign against the Arabs in 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. Basil won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south. Although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> force to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire — including the larger city of Antioch which was the seat of its eponymous Patriarch.|$|E
5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, {{and that he was}} not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Potts was poorly {{received}} by critics. Etty's admirers were angered by his apparent abandonment of history painting for the then poorly regarded field of portrait painting, while Etty's critics {{felt he had}} demonstrated that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> technical skills to produce high quality portraits, and was simply trying to use his name {{to make money in}} the more lucrative field of portraiture. History paintings were generally sold at exhibition for no less than the asking price, and as a consequence often remained unsold. Portraits were commissioned by the subject or their family, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist. History painting was much more highly regarded as an art form; portrait painting was seen as reflecting nature whereas history painting involved more creativity and also gave the artist the opportunity to tell moral lessons.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah {{originally}} wanted actor Jack Palance to {{play the}} role of Rudy Butler but could not afford his salary. Impressed by his performance in The Panic in Needle Park (1971), Hill recommended Richard Bright. Bright had worked with McQueen fourteen years before, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> threatening physique that McQueen pictured for Butler because the two men were the same height. Due to his friendship with Bright, Peckinpah cast him as the con man. Al Lettieri was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer Albert S. Ruddy, who was working with the actor on The Godfather (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker, which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez Saá's brother Alberto Rodríguez Saá {{became the}} new {{governor}} of San Luis in 2003. Together with Carlos Menem, {{they attempted to}} create an alternative political group against Kirchner within the PJ. Adolfo Rodríguez Saá was elected Senator for San Luis representing this group at the 2005 election. He was reelected in 2011, with a term of office up to 2017. He tried {{to run for governor}} of Buenos Aires Province in 2011, but the local judiciary did not allow him, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> required time living in the province. The mayor Sergio Massa organized the coalition United for a New Alternative to run for the 2015 presidential election and invited Rodríguez Saá to join, but he refused to join and ran with his own party, Federal Commitment. With 1.64% of the vote, it was the least voted party in the national elections.|$|E

5|$|The two Roman forces met on {{the banks}} of the Euphrates near Melitene, amidst scenes of mutual grief; while Corbulo lamented the undoing of his achievements, Paetus tried to {{convince}} him to attempt to reverse the situation by invading Armenia. Corbulo however refused, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to do so, and that either way the army was too worn out to be able to campaign effectively. In the end, Paetus retired to Cappadocia and Corbulo to Syria, where he received envoys from Vologases, who demanded that he evacuate his bridgehead over the Euphrates. In turn, Corbulo demanded the Parthian evacuation of Armenia. Vologases agreed to this, and both sides withdrew their forces, leaving Armenia once again masterless but de facto under Parthian control, until a Parthian delegation could travel to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Tintin investigates when a fetish {{created by}} the Arumbaya tribe of South America is stolen from Brussels' Museum of Ethnography, only to be {{returned}} the following day. Tintin realises that the replacement is a fake, and draws a connection to a local sculptor Jacob Balthazar, who has recently been murdered. Balthazar's parrot—a witness to the murder—is obtained by two Hispanic men, Alonso Pérez and Ramón Bada, who try to kill Tintin when he begins to investigate their connection to the crime. From the parrot, Alonso and Ramón discover that Balthazar was murdered by Rodrígo Tortilla, and they follow him aboard a ship bound for South America. There, they murder Tortilla, but find that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> original fetish. Tintin arranges their arrest when the ship docks at Los Dopicos, capital of San Theodoros.|$|E
5|$|At Villa Imperial, one of {{the richest}} cities of Upper Peru, an open cabildo called on Goyeneche to {{withdraw}} from their territory. He obeyed, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> military strength to prevail. The Bishop of La Paz, Remigio La Santa y Ortega, fled with him. Castelli was received in Potosí and requesting that the locals swear allegiance to the Junta. He also requested that the royalist generals Francisco de Paula Sanz and José de Córdoba y Rojas submit to him. He made arrangements that the operation to capture Vicente Nieto should be carried out exclusively by the surviving members of the Regiment of Patricians from the mines of Potosi, who had been incorporated with honors into the Army of the North. Sanz, Nieto, and Córdoba were executed at the Plaza of Potosí. Nieto claimed that he died happy, because it was under the Spanish flag. Goyeneche and Ortega, on the other hand, were safe on royalist land. Bernardo Monteagudo, inmate at the Jail of the Court of Chuquisaca for his participation in the revolution of 1809, escaped to join the ranks of the army. Castelli, who already knew Monteagudo's background, appointed him his secretary.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over approximately 10 weeks on a $20 million budget. Filming began in China in December 2010 in locations including the city of Shanghai and Hengdian World Studios, and continued until March 2011. Corey Yuen was the film's action choreographer. To compensate for time lost to filming issues, some scenes were filmed in a single take. Approximately 6 weeks into filming, RZA began pushing the crew to work faster to remain on schedule. His assistant director eventually informed RZA {{that because of the}} push, some stunt workers were injured and being sent to hospital. After this, RZA abandoned some of his intended shots and replaced them with Computer Generated Images (CGI). Roth also directed some shots for RZA. Crowe and Le were originally scripted to fight each other, but because of Crowe's limited shooting schedule, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> time to rehearse the fight, and instead Le was scripted to fight Liu.|$|E
5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; he decided that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, the subject in Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between {{freedom of the press}} and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference.

Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he was not surprised when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E

5|$|When the Sasanians reached Chalcedon in 615, {{it was at}} this point, {{according}} to Sebeos, that Heraclius had agreed to stand down and was about ready to become a client of the Sasanian emperor Khosrow II, allowing the Roman Empire to become a Persian client state, as well as even allow Khosrow II to choose the emperor. Things began to look even more grim for the Byzantines when Chalcedon fell in 617 to Shahin, making the Persians visible from Constantinople. Shahin courteously received a peace delegation but claimed that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> authority to engage in peace talks, directing Heraclius to Khosrow, who rejected the peace offer. Still, the Persian forces soon withdrew, probably to focus on their invasion of Egypt. Yet the Persians retained their advantage, capturing Ancyra, an important military base in central Anatolia, in 620 or 622. Rhodes and several other islands in the eastern Aegean fell in 622/3, threatening a naval assault on Constantinople. Such was the despair in Constantinople that Heraclius considered moving the government to Carthage in Africa.|$|E
5|$|With the {{appointment}} of Zinsou as a civilian leader of the country, Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga tried {{to return to the}} country but were informed that their plane would be shot down if they entered Dahomey airspace; they instead flew to neighboring Togo. Zinsou, who had a history of advocacy against the policies of the military, quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host of policies without consultation with them. In addition, to control continued deficits, Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population. The result was that on 10 December 1969, Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near Natitingou. Following the coup, Kouandété found that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> support to rule throughout the entire military, and so instead Paul-Emile de Souza (the director of military affairs for Zinsou's government) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate (with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît Sinzogan holding the other seats). The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections, thus allowing Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga to run.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
