40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of the {{long-term}} ocular exposure to cumulative levels of infrared radiation (IR) in glassblowing and foundries have been recognized since the late 19 th century. These effects include cataracts, keratitis, and chronic dry eye problems. Therefore, infrared radiation measurements are critical {{and need to be}} assessed regularly in the industries and workplaces where there are high temperature furnaces, such as in the glass industries and foundries. However, IR measurement is not very simple, especially when the range of interest is one in which radiometers are not available, as for the IR-B and IR-C ranges, and commonly available radiometers have a limited sensitivity range. The present article deduce a calculation method for evaluating of IR irradiance based on Planck's radiation law for black body radiation and using an IR detector sensitive in the spectral range 750 - 1150 nm. Based on this method, workers exposure was assessed to all <b>harmful</b> <b>wavelength</b> ranges of IR radiation in three foundries (two aluminums and one cast-iron). The results suggested that IR-A and IR-B radiation (wavelength from 770 nm to 3000 nm) in the mentioned foundries were more than TLVs (threshold limit values) given by ACGIH. There were significant risks of health hazards due to IR radiation exposure...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} plants {{to respond to}} {{environmental}} cues is crucial {{for the success of}} the organism. Light is an important source of energy for the plant as well as providing information for plant growth and development. Plant responses to the electromagnetic spectrum are controlled by a number of different photoreceptors. Phytochromes respond to red and far-red light and are responsible for controlling photomorphogenesis in seedlings (Chen and Chory, 2011). The recently identified UVR 8 responds to UV-B light and prevents damage to the plant from these <b>harmful</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (Rizzini et al., 2011). Responses to UVA/blue light are controlled by three different photoreceptors: the cryptochromes that are involved in the circadian clock as well as regulating a number of aspects of photomorphogenesis (Chaves et al., 2011); the Zeitlupe family which control the circadian clock and flowering responses (Demarsy and Fankhauser, 2009) and finally the phototropins which regulate the light-dependent processes that increase photosynthetic efficiency of plants (Christie, 2007, Christie and Murphy, 2013). Within Arabidopsis there are two phototropins, phototropin 1 (phot 1) and phototropin 2 (phot 2), which share approximately 60...|$|R

As both the wavelength and intensity of the LED source can be selected, this also limits the exposure of the pieces under investigation to both <b>harmful</b> UV <b>wavelengths</b> and levels of radiation.

40|$|The {{determination}} of aerosol properties, especially the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength region, {{is of great}} importance for understanding the climatological variability of UV radiation. However, operational retrievals of AOD at the biologically most <b>harmful</b> <b>wavelengths</b> in the UVB are currently only made at very few places. This paper reports on the UVPFR (UV precision filter radiometer) sunphotometer, a stable and robust instrument {{that can be used}} for AOD retrievals at four UV wavelengths. Instrument characteristics and results of Langley calibrations at a high-altitude site were presented. It was shown that due to the relatively wide spectral response functions of the UVPFR, the calibration constants (V 0) derived from Langley plot calibrations underestimate the true extraterrestrial signals. Accordingly, correction factors were introduced. In addition, the instrument's spectral response functions also result in an apparent air-mass-dependent decrease in ozone optical depth used in the AOD determinations. An adjusted formula for the calculation of AOD, with a correction term dependent on total column ozone amount and ozone air mass, was therefore introduced. Langley calibrations performed 13 – 14  months apart resulted in sensitivity changes of ≤  1. 1  %, indicating good instrument stability. Comparison with a high-accuracy standard precision filter radiometer, measuring AOD at 368 – 862  nm wavelengths, showed consistent results. Also, very good agreement was achieved by comparing the UVPFR with AOD at UVB wavelengths derived with a Brewer spectrophotometer, which was calibrated against the UVPFR at an earlier date. Mainly due to non-instrumental uncertainties connected with ozone optical depth, the total uncertainty of AOD in the UVB is higher than that reported from AOD instruments measuring in UVA and visible ranges. However, the precision can be high among instruments using harmonized algorithms for ozone and Rayleigh optical depth as well as for air mass terms. For 4 months of comparison measurements with the UVPFR and a Brewer, the root mean squared AOD differences were found <  0. 01 at all the 306 – 320  nm Brewer wavelengths...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{types of}} filters have been {{developed}} to combat UV interaction with artifacts on display, and many of them can be used in conjunction with each other to reach the optimal setting for a particular collection. Among the first employed were heavy drapes; a simple solution to apply only if an institution can provide employees to open and close the drapes at the appropriate times based on viewer access. [...] Many filtration devices rely on materials that absorb the UV, such as acrylic films or painted wash walls, but in doing this the materials themselves decay and the filters must be replaced. A better solution is interference filters, which can be customized for the setting of intended use to reflect light at such an angle that it cancels out <b>harmful</b> incoming <b>wavelengths.</b> If an interference filter is selected as the appropriate form of filtration, UV is eliminated completely and efficiently.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this research}} is to explore two separate approaches for improving the growth of microalgae that can be potentially used for producing fuels and chemicals. One approach was to use optical light filters, which selectivity filter natural light allowing certain wavelengths into the culture systems. The other study is to use an algal growth system with different bio-renewable materials being used as attachment materials. Both studies demonstrated increased biomass productivity {{and the ability to}} scale-up. In {{the first part of the}} study, the research involving the use of optical light filters for microalgal growth in different cultivation systems included flask culture systems, flat panel photobioreactors, and rotating algal biofilm (RAB) systems. The optical light filters allow a specific range of wavelengths to pass through, while reflecting <b>harmful</b> <b>wavelengths</b> such as UV and IR. Two thin film light filters were fabricated for this research. One light filter allows both red and blue wavelengths to penetrate through (termed as blue filter) while the other allows the penetration of wavelengths in the red spectrum (termed as red-filter). Both filters resulted in increased biomass productivities when microalgae were grown in the flat panel photobioreactors and the RAB systems. When the blue filter was used for the culture, the biomass productivity increased 31. 9 % in flat panel photobioreactors and 99. 8 % in RAB systems; while the red filter resulted in an increase of 34. 1 % in the continuous operation of the flat panel photobioreactor. These results provide evidence that the use of these filters have the ability to enhance algal yield. The second part of this study used different bio-renewable materials as an attachment substrate for algal growth. An initial test was performed to screen the material that can result in the highest amount of attached biomass. It was found that the soy protein based sheet showed the greatest amount of algal attachment. Compared to the suspended cell growth of the control, the biomass productivity from the soy protein based sheets increased by 294 %. However, significant deterioration was observed from the soy protein based sheet after 20 days. To alleviate the dissolving of materials and enhance the integrity, poly-lactic acid was integrated into the soy protein based sheet. After this integration the attachment material displayed a significant amount of rigidity allowing for a longer duration of experimentation. However, the productivity from the PLA integrated soy protein based sheet displayed a certain degree of decreasing biomass yield compared to the 100 % soy protein based sheet. Collectively, the PLA integrated sheet still demonstrated adequate performance in terms of cell growth improvement and material longevity. In summary, this study shows that the use of the optical light filters and bio-renewable based sheets for attached algal growth are two viable approaches for enhancing algal growth performance. However, these two approaches need to be further optimized in order to be implemented at a large scale...|$|R
40|$|Solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) {{radiation}} is deleterious to plant-dwelling mites. Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) is a predominant predator of agriculturally important pest species of spider mite. However, phytoseiid mites {{are more vulnerable}} to UVB radiation than spider mites. Thus, the UVB radiation may influence decision making in foraging phytoseiid mites whether disperse or not. We tested the difference in impact and behavioral response among wavelengths of monochromatic UV radiation using a spectroscopic light source in N. californicus in the laboratory. We also examined whether the behavioral responses of N. californicus females to UV radiation varied based {{on the presence of}} prey (Tetranychus urticae Koch) eggs and residues (webs and excreta of T. urticae: foraging cue). The impact of UV radiation on the N. californicus egg hatchability varied drastically between wavelengths of ≤ 300 nm (0 %) and ≥ 310 nm (100 %). The N. californicus females escaped from UV radiation more quickly when they were irradiated with UV at shorter wavelength. Presence of T. urticae eggs had no effects arresting the escape of phytoseiid mites. In contrast, prey residues (including eggs) markedly detained N. californicus females from escaping under UV irradiation at ≥ 310 nm. However, N. californicus females quickly escaped when irradiated with UV at <b>harmful</b> 300 nm <b>wavelength,</b> regardless of prey cues. This indicates that the eyeless phytoseiid mite is capable of perceiving UV radiation, and whether escape or not is determined on the basis of harmful/harmless UV wavelength and presence/absence of foraging cues...|$|R
40|$|Summary of {{the thesis}} “Harvesting the weak angular {{reflections}} from the fundus {{of the human}} eye” by Jan van de Kraats University Medical Centre Utrecht. Defended October 16, 2007. This thesis is on the modeling of the optical reflection of the human fovea, and on the three instruments build for retrieving the data. Instrument one, the densitometer, measured reflected light from a small spot on the retina at 14 wavelengths. Not only in a state with the visual pigments bleached, {{but even in the}} dark adapted state. An optical model was derived to explain the data in terms of absorbers (lens, macular pigment, blood and melanin) and reflectors in the eye (mainly cones and choroid). Important messages were that the origin of the directional reflection was at the cone discs, and that the layers posterior to the receptors show inherent non-directionality. A second instrument was developed, the Profile Spectrometer. This for speeding up the measurement time, important in working with patients. A spot of white light illuminated the retina. Reflected light fills the whole pupil of the eye, but only the light passing through a (virtual) slit from an imaging spectrometer was used. In one second a two dimensional image from a CCD detector could be gathered, incorporating both the detailed spectral and directional reflection information from the retina. A new model explaining simultaneously the directional and the non-directional part of the foveal reflection was developed. In this model the reflection from the cones shows a one over wavelength squared behavior. A new insight was that light losses by scattering were not lost for the reflection from the layers posterior to the receptors. Macular pigment is present in the central region of the retina. It benefits visual performance, and keeps the retina healthy by scavenging free radicals. To measure its optical density, a third instrument, the Macular Pigment Spectrometer was built. In order to keep it low cost, an external fiber optic spectrometer was applied. Thanks to the small illumination and detection pupil of the instrument, it made measurements in eyes with undilated pupil possible. In order to gain knowledge of the optical transmission spectra of the eye media as a function of age, an extensive literature investigation was performed. Five spectral templates were derived that proved sufficient and necessary to describe all literature data in great detail. One formula was derived to calculate the transmission of the mean human media for every wavelength, at any age. With these new data the optimal spectral shape of the filter in intraocular lenses (implanted after cataract surgery) was derived. Such spectral filtering prevents the <b>harmful</b> short <b>wavelengths</b> from reaching the retina. At the same time, the perception of this violet and blue light asks for minimal attenuation. We measured several types of existing intraocular lenses and calculated the protection and perception values. It appeared that most older types of lenses, and even one claimed as a modern type, transmitted more dangerous UV radiation than a young human lens. With the new concept of 'virtual age' for the filter characteristics, selection of lenses should become much easier...|$|R
