500|$|Writing in 1862, Benjamin Clarje {{considered}} {{the park to}} exhibit [...] "perhaps a richer display of varied landscape than any spot of similar size in the kingdom". He notes that the surface in the upper area of the park is [...] "diversified by gentle undulations and has been planted with great judgment and taste" [...] and that the River Towy flows in the vicinity. The Wildlife Trust West Wales acquired the nearby woodland in 1979. The BBC's Peter Crawford wrote of it in his book, The Living Isles: [...] "The woodland is primarily oak and wych elm," [...] he writes. [...] "The shrubs and ground cover are outstanding with cherry, holly, spindle, <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> and the parasitic toothwort. Lichen communities are of importance and include the rare lungwort. Overlooked by the romantic Castle of Dinefwr the fine old parkland has a herd of fallow deer. The mature trees attract woodpecker, redstarts and pied flycatchers. In winter, the water meadows draw large numbers of ducks".|$|E
60|$|X. VIOLA CANINA. <b>Dog</b> <b>Violet.</b> I {{have taken}} it for {{analysis}} in my two plates, because its grace of form is too much despised, and we owe much more of the beauty of spring to it, in English mountain ground, than to the Regina.|$|E
50|$|There are wild garlic, common bluebells, sweet cicely, broom and <b>dog</b> <b>violets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The genus {{includes}} <b>dog</b> <b>violets,</b> a {{group of}} scentless species which {{are the most common}} Viola in many areas, sweet violet (Viola odorata) (named from its sweet scent), and many other species whose common name includes the word [...] "violet". Several species are known as pansies, including the yellow pansy (Viola pedunculata) of the Pacific coast.|$|R
5000|$|Over half {{this site}} is managed as farmland, {{and the rest}} is ancient oak {{woodland}} also has coppiced sweet chestnut and hornbeam, with an understorey of ash, elder and hazel. Invertebrates include damselflies, dragonflies, glow-worms and wood ants. Common blooms found on the reserve in the summer include Bluebells, Bugles, Cuckoo Flowers, Wood Anemones, Primroses, <b>Dog</b> <b>Violets,</b> and Wood Sorrels.|$|R
6000|$|To {{illustrate}} these definitions we {{will take}} two common English birds, the rook (Corvus frugilegus) and the crow (Corvus corone). These are distinct species, because, in the first place, they always differ {{from each other in}} certain slight peculiarities of structure, form, and habits, and, in the second place, because rooks always produce rooks, and crows produce crows, and they do not interbreed. It was therefore concluded that all the rooks in the world had descended from a single pair of rooks, and the crows in like manner from a single pair of crows, while it was considered impossible that crows could have descended from rooks or vice versâ. The [...] "origin" [...] of the first pair of each kind was a mystery. Similar remarks may be applied to our two common plants, the sweet violet (Viola odorata) and the <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> (Viola canina). These also produce their like and never produce each other or intermingle, and they were therefore each supposed to have sprung from a single individual whose [...] "origin" [...] was unknown. But besides the crow and the rook there are about thirty other kinds of birds {{in various parts of the}} world, all so much like our species that they receive the common name of crows; and some of them differ less from each other than does our crow from our rook. These are all species of the genus Corvus, and were therefore believed to have been always as distinct as they are now, neither more nor less, and to have each descended from one pair of ancestral crows of the same identical species, which themselves had an unknown [...] "origin." [...] Of violets there are more than a hundred different kinds in various parts of the world, all differing very slightly from each other and forming distinct species of the genus Viola. But, as these also each produce their like and do not intermingle, it was believed that every one of them had always been as distinct from all the others as it is now, that all the individuals of each kind had descended from one ancestor, but that the [...] "origin" [...] of these hundred slightly differing ancestors was unknown. In the words of Sir John Herschel, quoted by Mr. Darwin, the origin of such species was [...] "the mystery of mysteries." ...|$|E
50|$|Viola labradorica, {{commonly}} known as Alpine <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> Alpine violet, American <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> and Labrador violet, is a perennial native to eastern Canada, Greenland, and the United States. The plant sold as Viola labradorica by nurseries is Viola riviniana.|$|E
5000|$|Viola riviniana: {{a species}} of violet; its popular name is the common <b>dog</b> <b>violet.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the UK and Canada {{this species}} uses {{several species of}} violet as its food plant. In drier areas, <b>dog</b> <b>violets</b> are used whilst in wetter areas the food plant is bog violet (Viola palustris) or marsh violet growing amongst purple moor-grass or tufted hair-grass. They prefer the damper areas more often. They also occur amongst bracken, where this is shading the {{appropriate}} violet species.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>dogs,</b> the <b>violet</b> or supracaudal gland {{is found}} {{approximately}} above the 9th caudal vertebra, but depending on breed {{it may be}} vestigial or entirely absent. The violet gland secretes protein and hydrophobic lipids, has wide excretory ducts, is connected with coarse hairs, devoid of cysts, and has no sexual dimorphism. In the dog and cat fancy it {{is often referred to}} as [...] "stud tail", despite the fact that it occurs in all sexes, not just breeding males. However, for reasons still unknown the hair at a <b>dog's</b> <b>violet</b> gland tends to fall out when androgen levels are high over a prolonged time. In short-haired breeds the usually inconspicuous gland may thus appear as a noticeably sparsely haired patch, and it is this condition of the gland area that is most frequent in stud dogs.|$|R
5000|$|Most turloughs have a springy, short-cropped turf of grasses, sedges, and herbs. In the Burren, the {{high-water mark}} is often {{shown by the}} shrubby {{cinquefoil}} (...) with its attractive yellow flowers, and meadow rue. Just below the high-water mark, <b>dog</b> <b>violets</b> are abundant and in some turloughs {{there may be a}} dense sward of the rare sky-blue turlough violet about one metre further down. Other characteristic plants of turlough sides include marsh orchids and speedwell. About halfway down the sides, and across the bottom of shallow turloughs, silverweed (...) may blanket almost all other plants.|$|R

50|$|Much of Gillies Hill {{has been}} {{classified}} as a Semi-natural Ancient Woodland by Woodland Trust aerial Inventories. This means that its understory of plant species has been more or less continuous for hundreds of years. Plants such as wood sorrel, common <b>dog</b> <b>violets,</b> and English bluebells most likely existed on the hill {{at the time of}} Robert the Bruce, and perhaps as far back as Iron Age Scotland. Areas of the hill which have been re-planted or coppiced (pruned to supply long thin sprouts) or harvested for timber, may still have relatively undisturbed underlying vegetation containing species which take years to become established residents of the forest.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>violet</b> is {{the common}} name for various species of the plant genus Viola with unscented flowers. The term arose to {{differentiate}} them from the scented sweet violet. Species so named include: ...|$|E
50|$|Viola adunca is {{a species}} of violet known by the common names hookedspur violet, early blue violet, sand violet, and western <b>dog</b> <b>violet.</b> It is native to meadows and forests of western North America, Canada, and the {{northern}} contiguous United States.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{noted for its}} {{flowering}} of lily-of-the-valley {{on the slopes of}} the ridge. Uncommon species include angular Solomon's-seal, herb paris and bird's-nest orchid. There are large areas of bluebell, wood anemone, <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> primrose, yellow archangel, ramsons, sanicle and early purple orchid.|$|E

50|$|Erythronium tuolumnense is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Liliaceae, known by the common name Tuolumne fawn lily or Tuolumne <b>dog's</b> tooth <b>violet.</b> However, it is neither a true lily nor a violet. It is endemic to the Sierra Nevada of Tuolumne County, California; from 600 m along Italian Bar Road up to 1000 m altitude at the headwaters of Deer Creek.|$|R
50|$|A TV special {{based on}} the toyline was {{released}} in October 1985 by Hanna-Barbera. It ran in syndication, paired with Star Fairies. In the special, a female <b>dog</b> named <b>Violet</b> Vanderfeller is dognapped and ends up at the city pound. The pound puppies attempt to and end up succeeding in reuniting Violet with her family. The special was released in 1986 on VHS by Family Home Entertainment and is also available on DVD. The DVD comes with certain Pound Puppies toys.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{woodland}} site {{next to the}} River Mel, {{with trees}} such as ash, hawthorn, sycamore, beech and silver birch. Ground flora include <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> and cow parsley, while traveller's joy provides food for moths. Tawny owls and pipistrelle bats roost on ivy.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{species of}} orchid thrive in Garston Wood, [...] along with lesser celandine, butcher's broom, wood anemone, <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> primrose, wild garlic, the rare toothwort and bluebells.

50|$|Viola riviniana, {{the common}} dog-violet, is {{a species of}} the genus Viola native to Eurasia and Africa. It is also called wood violet and <b>dog</b> <b>violet.</b> It is a {{perennial}} herb of woodland edges, grassland and shady hedge banks. It is found in all soils except acid or very wet.|$|E
50|$|In the apse of {{the church}} at Murano, near Venice, it is {{similarly}} employed. In the 12th and 13th centuries it was further elaborated with carving, losing therefore its primitive form, but constituting a most beautiful decorative feature. In Elgin Cathedral the dogtooth ornament in the archivolt becomes a four-lobed leaf, and in Stone church, Kent, a much more enriched type of flower. The term has been supposed to originate in a resemblance to the <b>dog</b> tooth <b>violet,</b> but the original idea of a projecting tooth is a sufficient explanation.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{daffodil}} flowering is over (usually about March), {{the site}} remains {{of interest for}} its hedgerows and meadow flora. Species recorded include cowslip, hoary plantain, common dog-violet and meadow vetchling, which are meadow varieties. Hedgerow varieties include hop, sweet <b>violet,</b> <b>dog's</b> mercury, barren strawberry, hedge bedstraw and greater stitchwort.|$|R
5000|$|Sports {{columnist}} Bill Simmons {{commented that}} the Awards were [...] "the most secretly captivating telecasts on TV" [...] alongside the National Spelling Bee and Westminster Kennel Club <b>Dog</b> Show. <b>Violet</b> Blue, the sex writer, describes the Awards as [...] "big backslapping event where the same companies and same names win year after year... To think of the 'porn Oscars' as a true representation of porn's very best is like {{having sex with a}} Jenna Jameson love doll and telling your friends you had sex with the porn star". Even Tyla Winn, an award winner, had trouble remembering one of her sex scenes that was nominated.|$|R
50|$|The pale <b>dog</b> <b>violet</b> (Viola lactea) is {{particularly}} {{dependent on the}} heathland whilst the pillwort, slender centaury and chamomile thrive on winter-wet disturbed ground near and on paths and tracks. Floating water plants need areas of open water at least ankle-deep in summer and without too much organic matter. Natural Resources Wales attempts to encourage these conditions.|$|E
50|$|Woodland plants include wood sorrel, blackthorn, bird's nest orchid, wood anemone, bluebell, wood avens, bugle, ramsons, self-heal, <b>dog</b> <b>violet,</b> honeysuckle, holly, lords and ladies, {{herb robert}} and woody nightshade. Woods {{dominated}} by oak and birch, with lesser amounts of rowan, holly, hazel, yew and aspen are called western oakwoods and occur principally in the uplands of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are temperate rainforests.|$|E
50|$|Hazel and {{hawthorn}} scrub {{is widespread}} on relatively dry sites with bramble, false brome, wood sedge, violet, bluebell, wild hyacinth and primrose. Where such communities occur on a rocky shore crab apple often grows with roses and <b>dog</b> <b>violet.</b> The scrub grades into woodland {{in several places}} on the southern shore and here ash and oak occur with holly. The bird community in such sites include treecreeper, long-tailed tit, chiffchaff, willow warbler and locally blackcap, woodpigeon, sparrowhawk, jay, pheasant and woodcock are also found.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} shapes of dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled and cork-screw. In some breeds, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries (especially for hunting dogs). It can happen that some puppies are born with a short tail or no tail in some breeds. <b>Dogs</b> have a <b>violet</b> gland or supracaudal gland on the dorsal (upper) surface of their tails.|$|R

"Violets--sweet Violets, and Pansies, or Heartsease, {{represent}} a small family, with {{the structure of}} which you should be familiar; more, however, {{for the sake of}} its singularity than for its extent or importance, for the family is a very small one, and there are but few species belonging to it in which much interest is taken.
