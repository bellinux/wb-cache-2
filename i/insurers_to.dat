His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for <b>insurers</b> <b>to</b> drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E

In the literature, the <b>insurer</b> is assumed <b>to</b> be the victim of moral hazard. We suggest that where an applicant expects the <b>insurer</b> <b>to</b> manage their cyber risk exposure, the presence of gaps in coverage can lead the <b>insurer</b> <b>to</b> select security controls which expose the insured party to risks not covered by the policy. Such a case is an example of moral hazard in which the insured party is the victim and the insurer is the “guilty” party.|$|R
