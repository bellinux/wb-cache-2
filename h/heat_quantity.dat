40|$|It {{was clear}} that the ground {{condition}} had a large effect on the underground temperatureat 1 m depth. Then, the effect was divided into external factor and internal factor and eachfactor was discussed {{on the basis of the}} data obtained in the Matsunoyama landslide area in NiigataPrefecture in summer and in the Miyagami landslide area in Hyogo Prefecture in spring 1974. As aresult of the discussion, the followings were obtained. There were large differences between shelter ratios of solar radiation of several grounds ofdifferent surface conditions as external factor. It was largest on forest (82 %), 60 % on grassfield, 38 % on rice field and smallest on blad land (0 %). Therefore, the ground surface of blad landcould receive the largest <b>heat</b> <b>quantity.</b> On the other hand, as internal factor, the differences of heat character and soil compositionin shallow layer were discussed in each ground. The <b>heat</b> <b>quantity</b> that was necessary for risingthe temperature of soil column in the invariable layer by 1 °C was 25. 5 cal cm- 2 deg- 1 in the baldland, 27. 0 cal cm- 2 deg- 1 in the grass field, 18. 9 cal cm- 2 deg- 1 in the rice field and 12. 9 cal cm- 2 deg- 1 in the forest. Therefore, the <b>heat</b> <b>quantity</b> was smallest in the forest. Adding up the two factors, the soil column in the forest showed the highest temperature incase of the same <b>heat</b> <b>quantity,</b> but the soil column in the blad land showed the highest temperatureand in the forest showed the lowest temperature, considering the shelter ratios in each ground. Accordingly in summer season, the effect of ground condition on ground temperature was determinedmainly by the shelter ratios of solar radiation. As the <b>heat</b> <b>quantity</b> reaching to the ground surfacewas largest in the blad land and smallest in the forest, the <b>heat</b> <b>quantity</b> per day stored in the soilcolumn at each ground was largest in the blad land and smallest in the forest.
