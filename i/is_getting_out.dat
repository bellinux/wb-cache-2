500|$|In {{the years}} before Payá's death, his {{influence}} {{was said to be}} waning, and attention shifted to younger activists such as blogger Yoani Sanchez. In 2010, WikiLeaks released U.S. State Department cables from Jonathan D. Farrar, head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, describing Payá and other older dissidents as [...] "hopelessly out of touch", writing, [...] "They have little contact with younger Cubans and, to the extent they have a message that <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out,</b> it does not appeal to that segment of society." [...] However, many of the younger generation of dissidents cited him as a role model and expressed grief at his death.|$|E
500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before. At one performance in London's Hippodrome coinciding with American Independence Day, Divine rose up from the floor on a hydraulic lift, draped in the American flag, and declared: [...] "I'm here representing Freedom, Liberty, Family Values, and the fucking American Way of Life." [...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E

While working at an airport, she meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) who hires her as a bodyguard for his trip to Australia. One night, Ana Lucia and a drunk Christian go to a home, where Christian demands to see his daughter from a blonde woman (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick). After seeing that the argument <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of control, Ana intervenes and pulls Christian back into the car. Ana Lucia eventually gets tired of Christian's antics and leaves him at a bar, where they briefly encounter Sawyer when Christian opens his car door. Ana goes to the airport and calls her mother, apologizing and telling her that she wishes to make things right. Teresa says she will be waiting for Ana Lucia in Los Angeles.|$|E

So long as we go on each of us trying {{to get as much}} as we can individually out of the world, instead of asking what the world <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of us, in return, there will be no revolution and no millennium. We must make sure that we're doing some good ourselves, instead of sponging upon the people perpetually to feed us for nothing. What's the first gospel given to man at the creation in your popular cosmogonies? Why, that in the sweat of his face shall he eat bread, and till the ground from which he was taken. That's the native gospel of the toiling many, always; your doctrines of fair exchange, and honest livelihoods, and free contract, and all the rest of it, are only the artificial gospel of the political economists, and of the bourgeoisie and the aristocrats into whose hands they play--the rascals!' ...|$|E
