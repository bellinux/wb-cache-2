25|$|Scientists {{have for}} a long time been {{interested}} in the relationship between testosterone and aggressive behavior. In most species, males are more aggressive than females. Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on aggressive behavior in males. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. The <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> usually rises in the early teens to mid teens which happen {{at the same time as}} testosterone levels rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a lumbar puncture which is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the crime}} family's {{activities}} have become unknown since the Las Vegas indictments. Law enforcement has moved its attention towards other gangs like the Russians and Triads who are [...] "more sinister and far more prevalent and widespread". Until his death, Peter Milano was still {{believed to be the}} official Boss of the Los Angeles crime family. However, since the 1990s, his <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> along with other members had become greatly reduced. Some members, like Rocco Zangari and Russell Massetia, moved out of the state and left the family altogether. Other members, like Carmen Milano and Jimmy Caci died of old age with no younger people having to replace them. Los Angeles doesn't have a high concentration of Italians like the East Coast to support them, so recruiting new members is challenging. With Southern California's many racial groups, the Cosa Nostra faced an uphill battle to challenge the many street gangs in the area over criminal rackets. Law enforcement also considers East Coast Mafia members moving to California as a threat. The L.A. family is now rumored to be a West Coast crew for the Gambino family in New York.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} incapacitation on prisoners’ {{offending}} behavior is a neglected area of research. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the extent and nature of prisoners’ <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> community-based <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the U. K. Participants were selected from nine prisons in the UK and consisted of 360 prisoners, 81 females and 279 males. Offenders were interviewed to assess levels and forms of <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> community-based <b>crime</b> and perceptions of other prisoners’ involvement. Levels of prisonization and institutional and demographic characteristics were used to identify vulnerability to <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> community-based <b>crime.</b> Twenty-five percent of the sample admitted personal involvement and 63 % reported other prisoners’ <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> a diverse range of crimes. Analyses revealed prisoners involved <b>in</b> community-based <b>crime</b> are likely to be young, male recidivists who hold prisonized attitudes. Prisoners who are white, prisonized and recidivist reported highest levels of other prisoners’ <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> community-based <b>crime.</b> No age or gender differences delineated prisoners’ reports of others’ involvement. The results show that incarcerating offenders may not prevent their <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> community-based offending. Discussion centres on the characteristics of involved prisoners and considers the implications of the results for rehabilitation and penal policy...|$|R
5000|$|Feminist criminologists {{understand}} childhood victimization as {{a structured}} theme throughout {{the lives of}} incarcerated women. The long-term effects of childhood victimization are essential to understanding how women become incarcerated. For some women, childhood victimization directly relates to their <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime.</b> In these situations, children may be [...] "missocialized" [...] by caregivers who offer them drugs, force them to steal, or exploit them as prostitutes.|$|E
50|$|Feminist {{scholars}} have strongly discouraged researchers from portraying female offenders and victims as mutually exclusive groups. Instead, critics argue {{the line between}} them should be blurred because women's <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> is so often linked to their subordinate social positions, which make them vulnerable to victimization. Critics hold that women can only be understood as criminals if they are also understood as victims, necessitating fluidity between offenders and victims.|$|E

50|$|Victimization has {{profound}} psychological {{consequences and}} impacts the social {{development of an}} individual. There is considerable evidence that victimization is a precursor to <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime.</b> While victimization is {{a risk factor for}} both men and women's criminal behavior, it is a stronger predictor for women. Although both men and women may experience victimization in their lifetime, women experience and respond to victimization differently than men due to gender inequalities. Incarcerated women experience higher rates of victimization than both incarcerated men and the general female population.|$|E
50|$|While his 1955 book, And Kill Once More, is a whodunit in {{the classic}} style, Salaway's 1957 and 1958 novels {{have more to do}} with the common man's <b>involvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>crime</b> and the moral {{dilemmas}} that arise as he confronts his own behavior and that of others. In this way, Salaway's fiction may reflect the same zeitgeist that produced many of the most cerebral television scripts of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as those of Rod Serling (The Twilight Zone, etc.) and Gene Roddenberry (Have Gun, Will Travel, etc.).|$|E
