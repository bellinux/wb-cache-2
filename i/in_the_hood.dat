25|$|Because of {{the wide}} variety of hijab worn in the Muslim world, it can be {{difficult}} to definitively distinguish between one type of face veil and another. The terms niqab and burqa are often incorrectly used interchangeably; a niqab covers the face (but not the eyes) while a burqa covers the whole body from the top of the head to the ground, with a cloth grille <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> to allow the wearer to see in front of her.|$|E
25|$|Multnomah County police {{consistently}} suspected {{foul play}} in the Martins' disappearance, {{based on the evidence}} of the tire tracks that indicated the family's vehicle was deliberately pushed from the cliff. Also troubling were the reported sightings of the family at dusk on the north bank of the river in Washington state, while the tire tracks placed them {{on the south side of}} the river in Oregon; this would suggest that their car would have fallen over the cliff after nightfall. The arrest of the two ex-convicts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hood</b> River area the day after the family's disappearance, for car theft, was also noted, though police were unable to determine if the incidents were related.|$|E

500|$|After revisions, {{the show}} was divided into four sections: City, Subway, Forest, Monster Ball and {{concluded}} with an encore. It began with a projected video onto a curtain—which contained images of Gaga smoking a cigarette—while a club remix of [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] played. Surrounded by violet light, her silhouette appeared on the curtain while she performed [...] "Dance in the Dark". Once the curtain was removed and the chorus reached, the New York cityscape and neon lights were revealed. Gaga gyrated on the set dressed in a [...] "futuristic, angular, glitter ball suit". After descending from her fire escape, she poked around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> of a dilapidated green Rolls Royce while performing [...] "Glitter and Grease".

500|$|On [...] "Daughters", Nas is bewildered at the {{responsibilities}} of fatherhood, as he addresses his daughter's social networking activity and worries about his past undermining his parental authority. Killian Fox of The Observer writes that Nas' observations on his ex-wife's [...] "hefty childcare payments" [...] and his 18-year-old daughter [...] "dating unsuitable men" [...] are resonated by his [...] "recollections of his early years as a Queensbridge hustler – {{just the kind of}} unsuitable young man he's warning his daughter about these days". [...] "Reach Out" [...] features Mary J. Blige and incorporates the piano loop from Isaac Hayes' 1970 song [...] "Ike's Mood". Its lyrics address Nas' feeling displaced [...] "when you're too hood to be in the Hollywood circles, you're too rich to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> that birthed you". [...] "You Wouldn't Understand" [...] addresses life struggles and features a mellow production and neo soul influences. [...] "Back When" [...] has flickering production and mytholigizing lyrics by Nas: [...] "check out the oracle bred by city housing".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good. His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how you came up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> and how {{you had to make}} it out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite so much about the marriage or the divorce", Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's VIP lounge, appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him. When writing the album, Nas also reflected on aging and maturation, fatherhood, and his 20-year experience in hip hop music. Nas discussed the album's personal subject matter in an interview for Billboard: ...|$|E

2500|$|The first-ever {{production}} Corvette coupe, {{a futuristic}} fastback, sported an unusual styling element for its time period – a divided rear window. The rear window's basic shape had been originally conceived by Bob McLean for the Q-model. The {{rest of the}} Sting Ray design was equally stunning. Quad headlamps were retained but newly hidden – the first American car so equipped since the 1942 DeSoto. The lamps were mounted in rotating sections that matched the sharp-edged front end with the [...] "eyes" [...] closed. The Corvette continued to use hidden headlamps until the C6 model debuted in 2005. Coupe doors were cut into the roof, which made entry/exit easier in such a low-slung closed car.

The assessment of the capture velocity with <b>the</b> existing fume <b>hood</b> confirmed maximum 23 to 30 % difference as compared to the root mean square (RMS).
