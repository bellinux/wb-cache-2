5|$|Additional {{reinforcements}} poured in. The {{rest of the}} 27th Infantry moved in, as well as {{a battalion}} from the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division. These were able to push North Korean infiltrators out of Yongsan and back to their firmly held positions at Cloverleaf Hill. On August 14, following an artillery barrage, Task Force Hill launched a direct assault on these positions. Fighting continued the entire day in a fierce series of attacks and counterattacks in which both sides, already at far reduced strength, inflicted large numbers of casualties. However, Task Force Hill's second attack was just as unsuccessful as its first. Casualties among officers was high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> and the disorganization that followed meant most of the units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight</b> could not communicate to coordinate any large actions. It became a battle of attrition by August 15 as neither 4th North Korean Division nor Task Force Hill were able to get the upper hand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fight,</b> which in several cases erupted in desperate hand-to-hand combat. Casualties mounted and a frustrated Walker ordered the 5,000-man 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area to turn the tide.

5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government.
