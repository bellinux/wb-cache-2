40|$|We {{tested the}} ability of several GnRH analogues to {{suppress}} pituitary=n- and potentially musth in free-ranging African elephants (Loxodonta africana). In Study 1, adult bulls were given 4 or 12 mg GnRH antagonist (<b>Detirelix)</b> or saline i. m. on day 0 (n = 3 bulls per treatment). Animals were then recaptured on day 2 (about 48 h later) and given 300 =m GnRH i. v. to assess {{the ability of}} the antagonist to block pituitary activity. <b>Detirelix</b> reduced(P < 0. 05) basal concentrations of serum LH and testosterone on day 2 compared with day 0, with no effect of dose. Similarly, LH and testosterone release induced by GnRH were also reduced (P < 0. 05) in the Detirelix-treated bulls (50 =n- 0...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{blockade}} of androgen {{action by the}} antiandrogens flutamide and Casodex on serum and pituitary concentrations of LH and FSH, serum and testicular androgen levels, reproductive organ weights, and on spermatogenesis were compared in the adult rat. Animals were treated for 3 and 8 weeks with vehicle, Casodex (20 mg. kg- 1. (day) - 1, flutamide (20 mg. kg- 1. (day) - 1) and GnRH antagonist (150 micrograms/day, <b>Detirelix).</b> Treatment with GnRH antagonist suppressed gonadotropin and testosterone production, reduced the weights of testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles, and inhibited germ cell development. Flutamide administration markedly elevated serum and pituitary levels of gonadotropins as well as serum and testicular androgen concentrations. Casodex-induced elevation of gonadotropin concentrations was less pronounced and serum and testicular levels of androgens did not change significantly. The reduction of seminal vesicle weights was similar after Casodex and GnRH antagonist treatment, whereas flutamide was less effective. Testicular weight and spermatogenesis (assessed by light microscopical and flow-cytometric analysis) remained unaffected by Casodex and flutamide. It is concluded, that 1. Casodex, in contrast to flutamide, is a peripherally selective antiandrogen, and 2. Casodex influences release of gonadotropins into circulation less than flutamide. Therefore this antiandrogen might be useful clinically for selectively blocking androgen actions in the accessory sex glands...|$|E
