5|$|The Harrier's {{design was}} derived from the <b>Hawker</b> P.1127. Prior to {{developing}} the P.1127 <b>Hawker</b> Aircraft had been working on a replacement for the <b>Hawker</b> Hunter, the <b>Hawker</b> P.1121. The P.1121 was cancelled after the release of the British Government's 1957 Defence White Paper, which advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. This policy resulted in the termination of the majority of aircraft development projects then underway for the British military. <b>Hawker</b> sought to quickly move on to a new project and became interested in Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) aircraft, which did not need runways. According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine this interest may have been stimulated by the presence of Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force.|$|E

5|$|As the P.1127 {{had been}} {{developed}} {{at a time of}} deep UK defense cuts, <b>Hawker</b> had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research assistance was also provided by U.S.; including a series of wind tunnel tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. <b>Hawker</b> test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (<b>Hawker</b> Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E

50|$|According to the Hong Kong <b>Hawkers</b> Association, {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 70,000 or more street <b>hawkers</b> in Hong Kong in 1949. At that time, while hawking provided employment opportunities, {{the large numbers of}} <b>hawkers</b> also led to noise pollution and congestion. In addition, it was stated that street hawking discouraged market development, since <b>hawkers</b> paid lower licence fees (HK$1,000-HK$3,000) than shop and stall tenants who also had to pay rents.|$|R
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by <b>Hawker,</b> as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, <b>Hawker</b> was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, <b>Hawker</b> believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959, <b>Hawker</b> had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} design work and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing design work to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to <b>Hawker.</b> On 23 July 1959, <b>Hawker</b> authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hawker</b> Siddeley Harrier, {{developed}} in the 1960s, {{was the first of}} the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft. It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the <b>Hawker</b> Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced supersonic aircraft, the <b>Hawker</b> Siddeley P.1154. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the US Marine Corps (USMC), in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The Hunter saw combat {{service in}} a range of {{conflicts}} with several operators, including the Suez Crisis, the Aden Emergency, the Sino-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Rhodesian Bush War, the Second Congo War, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War, and the 2007 Lebanon conflict. Overall, 1,972 Hunters were manufactured by <b>Hawker</b> Aircraft and its successor, <b>Hawker</b> Siddeley, as well as being produced under licence overseas. In British service, the Hunter was replaced in its principal roles by the Lightning, the <b>Hawker</b> Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, <b>Hawker</b> had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the <b>Hawker</b> Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, <b>Hawker</b> found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. <b>Hawker</b> Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the <b>Hawker</b> P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the <b>Hawker</b> Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E

5|$|From 1933 {{to the end}} of 1938 Furious carried 801 Squadron which {{initially}} flew {{a mixture}} of six <b>Hawker</b> Nimrod and three Flycatcher fighters. <b>Hawker</b> Osprey fighters replaced the Flycatchers in early 1934 and the Nimrods were withdrawn in October 1936. 811 and 822 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-shipping missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as the Fairey IIIF, the Fairey Seal and the Blackburn Shark reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, a study {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} <b>Hawker</b> Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept, which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, <b>Hawker</b> approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.|$|E

5|$|Normally, Furious {{could carry}} only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this {{commonly}} meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart). In 1935 {{there was one}} squadron of fighters with <b>Hawker</b> Nimrods and <b>Hawker</b> Ospreys, one squadron of Blackburn Baffin torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.|$|E

5|$|Seeking better {{performance}} and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the <b>Hawker</b> P.1052, which {{was essentially a}} Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree swept wing. Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft. As a private venture, <b>Hawker</b> proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the <b>Hawker</b> P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19June1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine's reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.|$|E

5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at <b>Hawker</b> promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the <b>Hawker</b> Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by <b>Hawker,</b> while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
