5|$|Serpens Caput {{contains}} many RR Lyrae variables, although most are too faint {{to be seen}} without professional photography. The brightest is VY Serpentis, only of 10th magnitude. This star's period has been increasing by approximately 1.2 seconds per century. A variable star {{of a different kind}} is Tau4 Serpentis, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This star has been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile, where cold infalling gas on to the star creates redshifted <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> lines next to the normal emission lines.|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} {{frequencies}} (far-ultraviolet and X-ray) interstellar hydrogen gas becomes a significant absorber. In particular, a photon with a wavelength {{of less than}} 91 nanometers is energetic enough to completely ionize neutral hydrogen and is absorbed with almost 100% probability even through relatively thin gas clouds. (At much shorter wavelengths the probability of absorption begins to drop again, which is why X-ray afterglows are still detectable.) As a result, observed spectra of very high-redshift GRBs often drop to zero at wavelengths {{less than that of}} where this hydrogen ionization threshold (known as the Lyman break) would be in the GRB host's reference frame. Other, less dramatic <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> features are also commonly seen in high-z GRBs, such as the Lyman alpha forest.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption,</b> and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a gas generator. Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{ratio of}} {{deuterium}} to hydrogen in the Jovian atmosphere has been calculated {{using a new}} approach. D/C is obtained from weak lines of HD and CH 4 in the visible region of the spectrum while C/H is derived from stronger methane and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorptions</b> near 1 micron. This technique permits minimization of the varying effects on line formation caused by scattering in the Jovian atmosphere while relying on absorption bands whose strengths have been measured in the laboratory.

500|$|What {{is known}} {{specifically}} about the IPK {{is that it}} exhibits a short-term instability of about 30µg {{over a period of}} about a month in its after-cleaned mass. over periods of time of the order of a month ..." [...] (...) [...] The precise reason for this short-term instability is not understood but is thought to entail surface effects: microscopic differences between the prototypes' polished surfaces, possibly aggravated by <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> due to catalysis of the volatile organic compounds that slowly deposit onto the prototypes as well as the hydrocarbon-based solvents used to clean them.|$|E
500|$|Fritz Zwicky defined {{additional}} supernovae types, although {{based on}} a very few examples that did not cleanly fit the parameters for a Type I or Type II supernova. [...] SN 1961i in NGC 4303 was the prototype and {{only member of the}} Type III supernova class, noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen Balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum. [...] SN 1961f in NGC 3003 was the prototype and only member of the Type IV class, with a light curve similar to a Type II-P supernova, with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> lines but weak hydrogen emission lines. [...] The Type V class was coined for SN 1961V in NGC 1058, an unusual faint supernova or supernova impostor with a slow rise to brightness, a maximum lasting many months, and an unusual emission spectrum. [...] The similarity of SN 1961V to the Eta Carinae Great Outburst was noted. [...] Supernovae in M101 (1909) and M83 (1923 and 1957) were also suggested as possible Type IV or Type V supernovae.|$|E
2500|$|Second, {{there are}} now several {{observed}} cases where a supernova has immediately followed a gamma-ray burst. While most GRBs occur too far away for current instruments to have any chance of detecting the relatively faint emission from a supernova at that distance, for lower-redshift systems there are several well-documented cases where a GRB was followed {{within a few days}} by the appearance of a supernova. These supernovae that have been successfully classified are type Ib/c, a rare class of supernova caused by core collapse. Type Ib and Ic supernovae lack <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> lines, consistent with the theoretical prediction of stars that have lost their hydrogen envelope. The GRBs with the most obvious supernova signatures include GRB 060218 (SN 2006aj), GRB 030329 (SN 2003dh), and GRB 980425 (SN 1998bw), and a handful of more distant GRBs show supernova [...] "bumps" [...] in their afterglow light curves at late times.|$|E

50|$|Another way astronomers {{search for}} dark galaxies {{is to look}} for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> lines in the spectra of {{background}} quasars.

50|$|In addition, {{spectral}} measurements {{can be used}} {{to determine}} the accuracy of theoretical predictions. For example, the Lamb shift measured in the <b>hydrogen</b> atomic <b>absorption</b> spectrum was not expected to exist {{at the time it was}} measured.

50|$|In hydride forming metals like titanium, {{zirconium}} and vanadium, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>absorption</b> causes severe embrittlement. At low {{concentrations of}} hydrogen, below the solid solubility limit, stress-assisted hydride formation causes the embrittlement which {{is enhanced by}} slow straining. At hydrogen concentrations above the solubility limit, brittle hydrides are precipitated on slip planes and cause severe embrittlement. This latter kind of embrittlement is encouraged by increased strain-rates, decreased temperature and {{by the presence of}} notches in the material.|$|E
