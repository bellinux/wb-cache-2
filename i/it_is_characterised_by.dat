5|$|Folk metal is {{a fusion}} genre of heavy metal music and {{traditional}} folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterised</b> <b>by</b> {{the widespread use}} of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech).

5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterised</b> <b>by</b> a very solemn {{character and the}} attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>characterised</b> <b>by</b> hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a thin strip. The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E
