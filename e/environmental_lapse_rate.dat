In the first stage a data set of non-standard weather observations was assembled and quality controlled The data set possessed approximately 58000 observations, including dry-bulb temperature, wind, visibility and cloud cover, from {{the spring and summer}} seasons of the years 1974 [...] 1993. Up to 10 % of the data were unusable due to erroneous station information. The second part of the project consisted of a principal components analysis (PCA) of daily temperature data in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). The PCA (1) demonstrated how the timing and extent of synoptic events could be tracked, (2) identified the major regional controls of temperature in the CAA, and (3) showed that the non-standard data exhibited general coherency with regional patterns yet were able to reveal zones of coherency at the meso-scale in temperature patterns. In the third stage of the project a model to estimate surface air temperature at the meso-scale was constructed, It was based on a 1 km resolution digital elevation model of the CAA. The effects on temperature due to site elevation and coastal proximity were selected for parameterization. The change in temperature with elevation was implemented in the model using derived <b>environmental</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rates.</b> Advection effects were handled using resultant winds combined with air temperature above the ocean. <b>Lapse</b> <b>rates</b> and resultant wind estimates were obtained from upper air ascents.

50|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> (ELR), is {{the rate}} of {{decrease}} of temperature with altitude in the stationary atmosphere {{at a given time}} and location. As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 K/km (3.56 °F or 1.98 °C/1,000 ft) from sea level to 11 km (36,090 ft or 6.8 mi). From 11 km up to 20 km (65,620 ft or 12.4 mi), the constant temperature is −56.5 °C (−69.7 °F), which is the lowest assumed temperature in the ISA. The standard atmosphere contains no moisture.

50|$|Note {{that the}} {{presence}} of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5 °C per kilometre or 3 °F per 1000 feet). The actual lapse rate, called the <b>environmental</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate,</b> is not constant (it can fluctuate throughout the day or seasonally and also regionally), but a normal lapse rate is 5.5 °C per 1,000 m (3.57 °F per 1,000 ft). Therefore, moving up 100 m on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometres (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors, such as proximity to oceans, can drastically modify the climate. As the altitude increases, the main form of precipitation becomes snow and the winds increase. The temperature continues to drop until the tropopause, at 11000 m, where it does not decrease further. However, this is higher than the highest summit.|$|E

50|$|There {{are a few}} general archetypes of {{atmospheric}} instability {{that are used to}} explain convection (or lack thereof). A necessary (but not sufficient) condition for convection is that the <b>environmental</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> (the rate of decrease of temperature with height) is steeper than the lapse rate experienced by a rising parcel of air. When this condition is met, upward-displaced air parcels can become buoyant and thus experience a further upward force. Buoyant convection begins at the level of free convection (LFC), above which an air parcel may ascend through the free convective layer (FCL) with positive buoyancy. Its buoyancy turns negative at the equilibrium level (EL), but the parcel's vertical momentum may carry it to the maximum parcel level (MPL) where the negative buoyancy decelerates the parcel to a stop. Integrating the buoyancy force over the parcel's vertical displacement yields Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), the Joules of energy available per kilogram of potentially buoyant air. CAPE is an upper limit for an ideal undilute parcel, and the square root of twice the CAPE is sometimes called a thermodynamic speed limit for updrafts, based on the simple kinetic energy equation.|$|E

Landscape controls over minimum temperatures were associated with finescale patterns of soil moisture content, and maximum temperatures were associated with finescale insolation differences caused by topographic exposure and vegetation cover. By linking the sensor array data to 10 regional weather stations and topographic variables describing site radiation load and moisture content, multilevel spatial models of 30 -m resolution were constructed to map daily temperatures across the 2090 -km 2 park, validated with an independent 50 -sensor network.

Site elevation and latitude were found to correlate most strongly. Roughness also exerted positive influences, as well as precipitation when coupled with certain terrain factors. The second objective explored the distribution of treeline carbon at site scales by analyzing field data gathered in August 2009 in Glacier National Park, Montana. This confirmed the expected relationship of upright trees containing the highest biomass density, tundra the lowest, and krummholz in the middle. A high degree of dead organic matter was discovered, which may have important implications for treeline as a carbon source or sink when considering treeline 2 ̆ 7 s slow decomposition rates, and how these will change under climate warming.

Inlow-elevation regions of the United States, the index is derived from a lapse rate value using 950 - to 850 -mb temperature differences and a temperature-dew-point spread at 850 mb. At mid-elevations, the index uses 850 - to 700 -mb temperature differences and the 850 -mb temperature-dew-point spread. In the high-elevation western regions, a similar calculation uses a 700 - to 500 -mb lapse rate value and the temperature-dew-point spread at 700 mb. A preliminary comparison of the low-elevation variant of the index with climatology showed that only 5 % of all fire-season days fell into the high-index class. A similar comparison for the high-elevation region showed 6 % of all fire-seasoll days in the high-index class, but 45 % of days with large {Indlor erratic wildfire in that class. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the growth {{characteristics}} of the convective instability (CI) in the dry troposphere by relaxing the adiabatic compressibility condition of Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) approach. We derive a new non-adiabatic-Boussinesq (NAB) expression for the modified Brunt-Vaisala frequency (ω_b), without considering the adiabatic compressibility condition of OB approach. This NAB expression reduces to the known Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) expression under adiabatic compressibility condition. The NAB expression of ω_b {{is found to be}} modified from its OB counterpart such that the stabilizing adiabatic lapse rate in OB expression is replaced by a modified non-adiabatic lapse rate given as (η - 1) times the auto-convective lapse rate. Here η is the ratio of hydrostatic density to the total density. We perform numerical experiments of CI for the conditionally stable troposphere i. e for the troposphere that has the <b>environmental</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> negative but smaller than the adiabatic lapse rate. A novel feature of the present study is that the CI grows under proposed NAB approach in spite the conditionally stable condition and remains suppressed under OB approach. The present study, thus, proposes an alternative NAB approach for the positive growth of the CI in the dry troposphere for which the CI is conditionally stable under OB approach...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to Sherwood’s comments {{and in an}} attempt to restore proper usage of terminology associated with moist instability, the early history of moist instability is reviewed. This review shows that many of Sherwood’s concerns about the terminology were understood {{at the time of their}} origination. Definitions of conditional instability include both the lapse-rate definition (i. e., the <b>environmental</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> lies between the dry- and the moist-adiabatic lapse rates) and the available-energy definition (i. e., a parcel possesses positive buoyant energy; also called latent instability), neither of which can be considered an instability in the classic sense. Furthermore, the lapse-rate definition is really a statement of uncertainty about instability. The uncertainty can be resolved by including the effects of moisture through a consideration of the available-energy definition (i. e., convective available potential energy) or potential instability. It is shown that such misunderstandings about conditional instability were likely due to the simplifications resulting from the substitution of lapse rates for buoyancy in the vertical acceleration equation. Despite these valid concerns about the value of the lapse-rate definition of conditional instability, consideration of the lapse rate and moisture separately can be useful in some contexts (e. g., the ingredients-based methodology for forecasting deep, moist convection). It is argued that the release of potential (or convective) instability through layer lifting may occur in association with fronts, rathe...|$|E
40|$|Probability {{distribution}} {{functions of}} shallow cumulus cloud core entrainment and detrainment rates are calculated using 4362 individual cumulus clouds isolated from LES (large eddy simulation) using a cloud tracking algorithm. Calculation of the mutual information between fractional entrainment/detrainment {{and a variety}} of mean cloud core properties suggests that fractional entrainment rate is best predicted by the mean cloud buoyancy B and the <b>environmental</b> buoyancy <b>lapse</b> <b>rate</b> d θ ρ /d z at that level, while fractional detrainment is best predicted by the mean vertical velocity w and the critical mixing fraction χ c. Fractional entrainment and detrainment rates are relatively insensitive to cloud core horizontal area, and the perimeter of horizontal cloud core sections display an a 0. 73 dependence. This implies that cloud core mass entrainment flux E is proportional to cloud core cross-sectional area instead of cloud core surface area, as is generally assumed. Empirical best-fit relations for ε(B, d θ ρ /d z and δ(w, χ c) are found for both individual shallow cumulus clouds and cloud ensembles. It is found that clouds with high buoyancy in strong stratification experience low entrainment rates, while clouds with high vertical velocities and critical mixing fractions experience low detrainment rates...|$|R
