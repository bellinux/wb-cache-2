5|$|On August 6, 1981 President Reagan {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a neutron bomb. While contentious, this had the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> of bringing the Soviets to the bargaining table, and negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe started on November 30.|$|E

5|$|The {{complaint}} to Turkey had a <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> locally, with an apology from the country's {{government and a}} commitment to breaking diplomatic ties to Germany if required. However, it failed to elicit a response from Germany. The Allies' request to the Spanish government was relayed to the Germans, but identified almost immediately as deception and misdirection.|$|E
5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the <b>desired</b> <b>effect.</b> They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The <b>desired</b> <b>effects</b> arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the <b>desired</b> <b>effects</b> of a moderate dose usually subside after {{about three or four}} hours.|$|R
5|$|Kanō {{believed}} {{this to be}} unacceptable. He refused to play such a subservient role when teaching his students. To Kanō, a teacher must command respect. At the same time, he employed the latest European and American pedagogical methods. The theories of the American educator John Dewey especially influenced him. Kanō's manner had the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> upon the students, but the administration was slower to warm to his methods {{and it was not}} until the arrival of a new principal that Kanō's ideas found acceptance.|$|E

5|$|Allison {{resigned}} in 1947, {{a year after}} professional football resumed, and his position {{was taken over by}} Tom Whittaker, the club's first-team trainer. Intent on playing an expansive style of football, he purchased Don Roper and converted Ian McPherson's position from defender to winger. The changes had the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> as Arsenal won the 1947–48 First Division championship. Whittaker won the club's third FA Cup in 1950 and repeated early league success in 1952–53. The club's success began to wane after this, which in turn commenced a stressful period for Whittaker. In October 1956 he died of a heart attack, aged 58. Jack Crayston presided over first-team affairs as caretaker, before he was named permanent manager at the end of 1956. His time was brief compared to his predecessors and left the club in May 1958, achieving a twelfth-place finish in the league.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the <b>desired</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the <b>desired</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} Gulf War in 1990 and 91, USAF Lt Colonel (now Retired Lt General) Dave Deptula argued against the {{dominant}} view of targeting for destruction, instead opting for alternate and unconventional {{means to achieve}} <b>desired</b> <b>effects.</b> [...] For example, as chief air power planner, he chose to target the Iraqi air defenses first, removing opposition that would have kept subsequent missions from creating effective precision attacks. This allowed him to achieve <b>desired</b> <b>effects</b> with far fewer munitions, reserving those critical assets for future missions.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this Note is to use global themes and perspectives to aid in reframing the bioprospecting debate. The current state of this debate, its problems, and proposed solutions are reviewed. In looking at the impact of local responses to globalization on bioprospecting themes, I propose that more internationally competitive laws could allow an escape {{from some of the}} undesired effects of bioprospecting, while promoting more <b>desired</b> <b>effects.</b> I also suggest, independently, that undesired effects could be avoided and <b>desired</b> <b>effects</b> promoted through methods that seek to recognize the global identity of concerned citizens...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} episodes, the scenes which {{featured}} multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked-off cameras {{rather than the}} time-consuming Technodolly camera set-up. The episode featured the longest continuous shot filmed in Orphan Black, where a scene between Felix, Tony and Sarah was filmed in one take. It took almost three days to film the 15-second sequence of Scott drilling into Kira's tooth, involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to achieve the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> when drilled into. The scene in which Cosima and Delphine use a vaporiser to get high was mostly improvised by Maslany and Brochu; instead of inhaling actual helium, the pitch of their voices was altered in post-production. A stunt double {{was used for the}} second-to-last scene, wherein Cosima falls to the ground after vomiting blood.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{were drawn}} against Dukla Prague of Czechoslovakia in the quarter-finals. The first leg {{finished}} 1–1 in the Netherlands, but Ajax lost the second leg 2–1 at the Stadion Juliska in Prague. Thus, {{they lost the}} tie 3–2 on aggregate. Following the match, Michels decided to reshape his team. He moved defender Ton Pronk into midfield and sold his captain Frits Soetekouw, who had scored an own goal in the second leg, to rivals PSV Eindhoven, signing Velibor Vasović from Partizan Belgrade as his replacement. The changes had the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> as Ajax won the Eredivisie four times between 1966 and 1970. They also reached {{the final of the}} 1968–69 European Cup, but lost 4–1 to Italian team Milan. The team's style, known as Total Football, would come to fruition in the 1970s as Ajax won three consecutive European Cups from 1971 to 1973. Total Football was also implemented by the Netherlands national football team, who reached the final of the FIFA World Cup in 1974 and 1978, losing on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|Also at {{dawn the}} first {{attack by the}} Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion to the south began, when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars. Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion's positions, and was unsuccessful. However, their next assault, later in the morning, succeeded in {{capturing}} Johnny II, {{the second of the}} small hills. Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, immediately counterattacked, but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties. At 09:00 a forward observation officer attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British cruiser HMS Newfoundland, which then used its 6-inch guns to target the Fallschirmjäger positions. The naval gunfire had the <b>desired</b> <b>effect,</b> causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover. From then on, German resistance from the south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire. A grass fire they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I, and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III.|$|E

Military planners are moving to Effects-Based Operations (EBO) [1] to achieve these <b>desired</b> <b>effects</b> for a combination of Diplomatic, Informational, Military, and Economic (DIME) actions. As military planners move from pure military operations to Effects-Based Operations (EBO) [1], they will need tools to enhance their understanding how the desired Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, Information (PMESII) effects can be achieved {{through a combination of}} Diplomatic, Informational, Military, and Economic (DIME) actions...|$|R
40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is given}} in this paper to obtain a near-optimal strategy (i. e., specification of courses of action over time), which is also robust to environmental perturbations (unexpected events and/or parameter uncertainties), to achieve the <b>desired</b> <b>effects.</b> A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) -based stochastic mission model is employed to represent the dynamic and uncertain nature of the environment. Genetic algorithms are applied {{to search for a}} near-optimal strategy with DBN serving as a fitness evaluator. The probability of achieving the <b>desired</b> <b>effects</b> (namely, the probability of success) at a specified terminal time is a random variable due to uncertainties in the environment. Consequently, we focus on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a measure of mean and variance of the probability of success, to gauge the goodness of a strategy. The resulting strategy will not only have a relatively high probability of inducing the <b>desired</b> <b>effects,</b> but also be robust to environmental uncertainties.

5|$|During a {{match against}} Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1996, Wenger presided over Rice's {{caretaker}} duties at Arsenal, {{and ordered the}} team to switch from their preferred 3–5–2 formation to 4–4–2. The tactical change did not have its <b>desired</b> <b>effect,</b> as Arsenal lost the game having led before Wenger's half-time instruction. For much of the 1996–97 season, Arsenal continued to play 3–5–2 {{as it was the}} only formation the defenders were comfortable with, as well as injuries unsettling the side. In Wenger's second season at the club, he reinstated 4–4–2 and focused on strengthening the front six, by signing wingers Overmars and Luís Boa Morte and partnering Vieira with Petit. According to Jonathan Wilson, the system was similar to 4–3–3, as Overmars often pushed higher up the field and Parlour played alongside Vieira and Petit to solidify the midfield. Needing to compensate deficiencies in attack the following season, Wenger relied on his experienced defence to direct games, which conceded 17 goals in 38 league matches. From then on, Wenger deployed an unconventional 4–4–2 with a greater emphasis on attack and movement; his teams between 2001 and 2004 were dominant on the left flank.|$|E
5|$|During the Abbasid Revolution, however, he {{was forced}} to submit to the Abbasid armies under Abu Muslim. As one of Abu Muslim's vassals, he {{supported}} the latter in his quarrel with the Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775). After the Caliph had Abu Muslim murdered in 755, Khurshid supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of Sunbadh, who entrusted part of Abu Muslim's treasure to Khurshid's keeping. When Sunbadh's revolt was defeated, Sunbadh fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid's cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure. Al-Mansur sent his son and heir, al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), to recover the treasure of Abu Muslim. Khurshid denied having it, and al-Mansur tried to unseat Khurshid by crowning one of his cousins as ispahbadh. This did not have the <b>desired</b> <b>effect</b> of challenging the loyalty of Khurshid's subjects, but Khurshid was eventually forced to accommodate the Abbasids by accepting an increase in the annual tribute, which brought it to the level paid to the Sassanids.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the <b>desired</b> <b>effect.</b> Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
