40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to characterize three distilled drinks commercially available on the market (Courvoisier cognac, Vinars Miorita and alcoholic drink Alexandrion). In this purpose it was determined the alcoholic concentration, the total acidity, the extract content and other specific parameters. The concentrations of esters, aldehydes and superior alcohols have been determined by simple analytical methods based on spectrometric UV-VIS method, respectively titrimetric method (Schoorl) for saccharose. Furfural compound was identified by reaction with fresh aniline. The analytical characterization was offered a promising approach for the classification of these three drinks by the content in distilled wines. This study shows that the Vinars Miorita (old <b>distilled</b> <b>wine)</b> and Courvoisier cognac (young <b>distilled</b> <b>wine)</b> can be discriminated from the alcoholic drink Alexandrion (a mixture obtained from a <b>distilled</b> <b>wine</b> with ethylic alcohol, water, sugar, aroma and dyestuff) using the differences between the obtained results for these distilled drinks. Moreover, the lack of furfural in alcoholic drink Alexandrion goes {{to the conclusion that the}} rate of <b>distilled</b> <b>wine</b> used to obtain this drink is very low...|$|E

40|$|The freshly <b>distilled</b> <b>wine</b> spirit {{has a high}} {{concentration}} of ethanol and many volatile compounds, but is devoid of phenolic compounds other than volatile phenols. Therefore, an ageing period in the wooden barrel is required to attain sensory fullness and high quality. During this process, several phenomena take place, namely the release of low molecular weight phenolic compounds and tannins from the wood into the wine spirit. Research conducted over the last decades shows that they play a decisive role on the physicochemical characteristics and relevant sensory properties of the beverage. Their contribution to the antioxidant activity has also been emphasized. Besides, some studies show the modulating effect of the ageing technology, involving different factors such as the barrel features (including the wood botanical species, those imparted by the cooperage technology, and the barrel size), the cellar conditions, and the operations performed, on the phenolic composition and related properties of the aged wine spirit. This review aims to summarize the main findings on this topic, taking into account two featured barrel characteristics—the botanical species of the wood and the toasting level...|$|E

50|$|The {{purpose of}} KWV from its {{inception}} was to create unity amongst the wine farmers of South Africa and to ensure continuous improvement {{in the quality of}} South African wines and brandies.

The organisation also invested a great deal in the promotion of South African wine and brandy both locally and abroad. KWV’s legal hand over the industry was lifted with the end of Apartheid in 1990 and subsequent change in government, and in 1997 converted from a co-operative to a company structure.|$|R
