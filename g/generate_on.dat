Death may be tragic but it is commonplace, the eternal Truth. Let's not trumpet it, but place it simply before the public and let them make up their own minds.

In the same interview, Doyle described the key to their success: [...] "This band is going somewhere... it's {{not the same thing}} every night, unlike many bands, the arrangements change." [...] Reviewers were enthusiastic about the band's performances; according to Gardiner, [...] "The impression they now <b>generate</b> <b>on</b> stage is one of total energy... energy which sets them apart." [...] Juke Magazine called them [...] "a band that could reward its audiences with (the) sheer exhilaration of seeing real master musicians... taking their audiences to virgin territory that other explorers had only dreamed about." ...|$|E

[...] After the poor results from the test audience, Comedy Central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order additional episodes after [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". However, when buzz began to <b>generate</b> <b>on</b> the Internet about the two original shorts, the network commissioned Parker and Stone to write one more episode without committing to a full series until they had seen the script. While working on the 1997 film Orgazmo, Parker and Stone wrote the script for what would later become the episode [...] "Weight Gain 4000". The duo sought to give Comedy Central executives an idea of how the series would be and how each episode could differ from the others. The network liked the script, and when Parker and Stone refused to write another script before signing off on at least six episodes, the executives agreed to commit to a series.|$|E

Moreover, Oliver Giles, a man of seventeen, one of the dancers, who was enamoured of his partner, a fair girl of thirty-three rolling years, had recklessly handed a new crown-piece to the musicians, as a bribe to keep going {{as long as they}} had muscle and wind. Mrs. Fennel, seeing the steam begin to <b>generate</b> <b>on</b> the countenances of her guests, crossed over and touched the fiddler's elbow and put her hand on the serpent's mouth. But they took no notice, and fearing she might lose her character of genial hostess if she were to interfere too markedly, she retired and sat down helpless.
