50|$|Hobbing is {{a method}} by which a hob is used to cut teeth into a blank. The cutter and <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> are rotated {{at the same time}} to {{transfer}} the profile of the hob onto the <b>gear</b> <b>blank.</b> The hob must make one revolution to create each tooth of the gear. Used very often for all sizes of production runs, but works best for medium to high.|$|E
5000|$|Completion of Cutting Operation: The {{indexing}} and reciprocating motions {{continue until}} the required {{number of teeth}} to the required depth are cut all along {{the periphery of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>blank.</b>|$|E
50|$|The old {{method of}} gear cutting is {{mounting}} a <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> in a shaper {{and using a}} tool shaped in {{the profile of the}} tooth to be cut. This method also works for cutting internal splines.|$|E
50|$|Faceplate: A faceplate, drive dog, and mandrel {{may be used}} to turn {{workpieces}} such as <b>gear</b> <b>blanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} {{ways in which}} <b>gear</b> <b>blanks</b> can be shaped through the cutting and finishing processes.|$|R

50|$|By 1896 Fellows had fully {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} gear cutting. Previously, gears had been milled, using cutters that were formed to the shape of the individual teeth. Upon the completion of each gear tooth, the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> was indexed to a new position to mill the next tooth, which could lead to problems in accurate spacing of gear teeth and the shaping of the individual teeth. Fellows conceived a method whereby the gear cutter, which was itself a gear with hardened cutting edges, and <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> revolved together as if they were a pair of gears. This process required no intermediate template or other type of mechanical guide for shaping the gear. Hobbing has become the preferred approach to manufacturing spur gears and helical gears.|$|E
50|$|Gear hobbing is a {{machining}} {{process in which}} gear teeth are progressively generated {{by a series of}} cuts with a helical cutting tool. All motions in hobbing are rotary, and the hob and <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> rotate continuously as in two gears meshing until all teeth are cut.|$|E
50|$|Another is a pinion-shaped cutter {{that is used}} in a {{gear shaper}} machine. It is {{basically}} when a cutter that looks similar to a gear cuts a <b>gear</b> <b>blank.</b> The cutter and the blank must have a rotating axis parallel to each other. This process works well for low and high production runs.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} application devised in the 1920s {{was the use}} of phenolic laminate fabric for gears; cut {{on conventional}} hobbing machines, the gears were tough and quiet, which was important for automotive timing gears. By 1932, Formica Insulation Company was producing 6,000 <b>gear</b> <b>blanks</b> per day for Chevrolet and other car makers.|$|R
50|$|This {{method is}} usually used to cast parts {{in which the}} {{diameter}} exceeds the length. Vertical casting can produce both cylindrical and non-cylindrical castings. These non-cylindrical castings include ball valve balls, <b>gear</b> <b>blanks,</b> and conical shaped parts. Unlike the horizontal method, no slip occurs between the metal and mold due to the constant resultant force applied during rotation.|$|R
50|$|In form milling, {{the cutter}} called a form cutter travels axially {{along the length}} of the gear tooth at the {{appropriate}} depth to produce the gear tooth. After each tooth is cut, the cutter is withdrawn, the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> is rotated, and the cutter proceeds to cut another tooth. The process continues until all teeth are cut.|$|E
5000|$|Indexing Motion: Slow speed {{continuous}} {{rotation of}} the cutter spindle and work spindle to provide circular feed, the two speeds being regulated through the change gears such that against each {{rotation of the}} cutter the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> revolves through n/N revolution, where [...] "n" [...] {{is the number of}} teeth of the cutter, and [...] "N" [...] is the number of teeth to be cut on the blank.|$|E
50|$|Gear {{manufacturing}} {{refers to}} the making of gears. Gears can be manufactured {{by a variety of}} processes, including casting, forging, extrusion, powder metallurgy, and blanking. As a general rule, however, machining is applied to achieve the final dimensions, shape and surface finish in the gear. The initial operations that produce a semifinishing part ready for gear machining as referred to as blanking operations; the starting product in gear machining is called a <b>gear</b> <b>blank.</b>|$|E

40|$|I {{tried to}} {{manufacture}} mechamical element {{parts in the}} rolling method instead of the injection molding way. 1) As the result of cold rolling the free drive, the manufacturing was found possible 0. 1 M～ 0. 6 M.

Out of <b>gear</b> <b>blanks</b> got from logs rather than from blanks, a better result can be obtainable without any difference of strength caused by the directions of blanks. 3) As the rolled plastic has less mounding character than metals, <b>gear</b> <b>blanks</b> outside diamter coincides with addendum circle diameter of the finished gear. 4) Among the rolling conditions, the rolling speed is better when the rotating speed is low while the pressing speed of the die-rollers is great...|$|R
50|$|The machine {{used for}} gear shaping {{generally}} {{consists of a}} base, column spindle, and an arbor. The gear cutter is mounted on the spindle, and the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> is mounted on the arbor. The cutter reciprocates up and down while the workpiece is gradually fed into the cutter. At {{the end of each}} cutting rotation, the spindle is retracted slightly to discourage any more cutting into the new cut teeth of the gear.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical {{results for the}} quench of a <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> in agitated and stagnant oil. Heat transfer within the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> is analyzed with a whole domain-optimizer technique inverse solution method, to calculate the time history at every point in the <b>gear</b> <b>blank.</b> The development of this procedure represents the first stage in an overall analysis of the quench process that will later include material phase transformations and deformation. The paper presents ten variations in setting up the inverse problem, to analyze which combination of independent variables and decision variables results in the best match between experimental and numerical results. The results indicate that dividing the boundary of the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> into four zones and assigning a fixed heat transfer coefficient or heat flux to each zone yields an average RMS error (average difference between experimental and numerical results) {{of the order of}} 40 K. This error can be reduced by either increasing the number of zones, by reducing the number of thermocouples being matched, or by allowing the heat transfer or heat flux to vary within the zones. Of these possibilities, variation of heat transfer within the zones gives the best improvement in the quality of the match for the amount of extra effort required to run the problem...|$|E

40|$|A {{development}} program {{to establish the}} feasibility and applicability of high energy rate forging procedures to tool steel spur gears was performed.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, two {{modeling}} methods, {{the forming}} method and the generating method, for hypoid gears with {{two kinds of}} transmission ratio are discussed by simulating the actual machining process. In the generating modeling method, the tooth profile of the gear is generated by boolean algorithm step by step after creating the models of the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> and the cutter and then rotating around their own axis by certain degrees until the cutter is outside the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> completely. In contrast with the generating modeling method, the tooth profile is formed by carrying out the boolean algorithm for one time after creating the models of the <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> and cutter seperately in the forming modeling method. Then using feature instance, all the teeth are created both in the generating modeling method and in the forming modeling method. Using the two modeling methods given in this paper, the modeling process can be shortened and the modeling precision can be improved. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Helical gears are {{commonly}} used in industry as they have advantages of higher power density, quieter operation etc., compared to spur gears. Conventional gear design is based on various design criteria, including durability and bending strength load rating. In recent times, fracture failure modes are gaining importance in addition to conventional failure modes. Stresses due to operating fatigue loads and internal residual stresses can cause fatigue fracture failure on the surface, sub-surface of gear flanks or at tooth root of gears. During gear design, various parameters are optimized, and one such parameter is the helix angle that is optimized for power density and gear noise. However, effect of possible defects (voids and inclusions) in the gear tooth is not usually considered in these calculations. This paper is a study on severity of defects in a <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> relative to power density increment. Three different gear geometries (spur and helical gears with two different helix angles) each with similar defects are considered. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to analyze Tooth Interior Fracture (TIF), and study variation of Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) with crack size and helix angle. It is seen that power density increment of a common <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> through helix angle increment poses {{a higher risk of}} crack severity, as the same <b>gear</b> <b>blank</b> is exposed to higher operating loads. Index Terms—gear, tooth interior fracture, linear elastic fracture mechanics, finite element analysis, power density, helix angle, voids, inclusions. I...|$|E

The {{displacement}} {{profile in}} a shank and dedendum-addendum circle of helical gear made of through-hardened S 45 C carbon steel and carburized-hardened SCr 420 H {{low alloy steel}} by gas carburizing was measured and predicted using a finite element method of DEFORM-HT. Both gears were quenched into same oil quenchant.

Transformation plasticity was included and excluded to predict the tendency of distortion. Simulation results were analyzed and compared to the experimental results to validate the influence of transformation plasticity on the prediction of distortion during the martensitic and bainitic/pearlitic transformation. However, more accurate distortion profiles require detailed HTC by taking thermal history {{on the surface of}} the tooth...|$|E

40|$|Green {{machining}} {{of powder}} metallurgy (P/M) components appears as an interesting procedure {{to solve the}} eternal {{problems associated with the}} poor machining behaviour of porous metallic samples. With the increasing usage of sinter-hardenable powders for high performance applications, green machining is an attractive method to lower production costs and compete against other shaping processes. Green machining is not a straightforward procedure. There is quite more to control in green machining than the cutting parameters. Several variables must be optimized to obtain adequate results in terms of surface finish, geometrical conformance and productivity. Other considerations such as density gradients in green compacts also influence the final outcome of this process. This study presents a new technique, based on cutting force measurements during green turning, to quickly and precisely characterize density gradients in powder metallurgy components. This new technique also allows the characterization of green machinability. Moreover, this study shows that timing sprockets can be produced by green machining of <b>gear</b> <b>blanks.</b> Timing sprockets produced by this process show a surface finish comparable to that of powder metallurgy components machined after sintering.
