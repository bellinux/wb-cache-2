5|$|Helen infiltrates the base, {{discovering}} Syndrome's {{intentions to}} send the Omnidroid to Metroville in a rocket. Distraught by Syndrome's callousness when <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> threatened, Mirage releases Bob and tells him his family is alive. Helen arrives and races off with Bob to find their children. Dash and Violet are spotted and chased {{by a number of}} Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents; however, Syndrome captures them, leaving them imprisoned on Nomanisan while he follows the rocket to Metroville.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother never}} regained her {{strength}} after Thomas's birth, {{and for the}} remainder of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> a semi-invalid. Ima accompanied her to several health spas during their years in Austin. In 1895, Sarah was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and on the recommendation of her doctor, she and Ima moved to Colorado, where they lived with Jim Hogg's elder sister, Martha Francis Davis. Sarah Hogg died in Colorado on September 25, 1895.|$|E

5|$|Szent István {{was based}} at Pola (Pula) for the {{duration}} of her career. In fact she rarely left port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fažana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single, two-day, trip to Pag Island. Only 5.7% of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> spent at sea; {{for the rest of the}} time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. She was never even drydocked to get her bottom cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Lebrón {{was hospitalized}} {{multiple}} times, the first being {{due to a}} fall that fractured her hip and an arm, requiring surgery. On September 18, 2009, she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory affection. Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release in appreciation for the public's support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón's death, praising her activism. <b>Her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> eulogized even in European papers.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, {{the couple}} famously spent a summer with Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and Claire Clairmont near Geneva, Switzerland, where Mary {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} her novel Frankenstein. The Shelleys left Britain in 1818 for Italy, where their second and third children died before Mary Shelley {{gave birth to her}} last and only surviving child, Percy Florence Shelley. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm near Viareggio. A year later, Mary Shelley returned to England and from then on devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> dogged by illness, probably caused by the brain tumour that was to kill her at the age of 53.|$|E

5|$|Jane Williams (née Jane Cleveland; 21 January 1798 8 November 1884) was a British woman {{best known}} for her {{association}} with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Jane was raised in England and India, before marrying a naval officer and settling in London. She soon left him for another military officer, Edward Ellerker Williams. After Edward and she left England for Italy, they became acquainted with Percy and Mary Shelley. Though she never had a romantic relationship with Shelley, {{near the end of his}} life he became deeply infatuated with her and addressed several of his poems to her. After Shelley and Edward Williams perished in a boating accident, she lived with Thomas Jefferson Hogg, also a close friend of Shelley, and had two children with him. The rest of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> spent as a housewife in London.|$|E
5|$|Most ancient {{historians and}} modern {{scholars}} agree that Zenobia was displayed in Aurelian's 274 triumph; Zosimus {{was the only}} source {{to say that the}} queen died before reaching Rome, making his account questionable. A public humiliation (as recounted by Malalas) is a plausible scenario, since Aurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the Palmyrene rebellion. Only Malalas, however, describes Zenobia's beheading; according to the other historians, <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> spared after Aurelian's triumph. The Augustan History recorded that Aurelian gave Zenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrian's Villa, where she lived with her children. Zonaras wrote that Zenobia married a nobleman, and Syncellus that she married a Roman senator. The house she reportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.|$|E
5|$|She {{had a short}} {{marriage}} {{characterized by}} abuse and control. A child was born to the couple, but died 11 months later. Before the child's birth, Paine had left her husband and obtained a divorce. To support herself, she taught school for a period {{and then began to}} work as a portraitist. She traveled throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine accepting commissions for portraits of individuals or families from 1826 through 1862. Because she lived a mobile lifestyle, she had few long-lasting relationships. The closest personal relationship of <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> with her mother. She raised a girl, however, for three years and taught her how to paint. Once she became a professional portraitist she had periods of financial security, but that and her physical health vacillated over the course of her career.|$|E

5|$|She {{left home}} in 1990 {{at the age}} of 16, and moved to Melbourne, where she {{qualified}} as a hairdresser and beauty therapist. By 1994 she was running a hair dressing store and managing seven employees. <b>Her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> changed that year by a fall from a building in Melbourne in which fractured her third and fourth thoracic vertebrae, rendering her an incomplete paraplegic. She lay there for forty minutes before someone found her. She spent the next four weeks in the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, and then another {{two and a half months}} in the Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre in Kew. She was forced to move back in with her parents, where she lived for the next five years, but within a year of her accident, she was managing five hairdressing stores.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{refused to}} allow his slaves to be sold without their permission. This policy was {{economically}} inefficient, resulting in an unnecessarily large work force. In his will, he provided that his slaves should be freed {{after the death of}} his wife. However, Martha chose to free them at the end of 1800, fearing that <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> not safe in their hands because her death would make them free. Most of the former slaves were unable to find suitable work after being freed and lived in poverty. Part of this was due to Virginia passing laws against educating blacks and restricting the rights of free blacks.|$|E
5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E

5000|$|Iza Calzado portrays Rosela Atilado, the {{beautiful}} yet illiterate fish vendor. Many {{people say that}} <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> like a teledrama, but for Rosela, <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> like a fairy tale. Just like Cinderella, she doesn't know who her real parents are and lived almost all <b>her</b> <b>life</b> enduring the cruelties of her ruthless stepmother, Belinda and stepsister, Gemma. She believes in happy ending, that is why despite all <b>her</b> difficulties in <b>life,</b> <b>her</b> optimism never wavered. All she wants is to reunite with her biological mother and to meet her [...] "prince charming".|$|R
5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that <b>her</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> threatened and although the prosecutors requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, the prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that there was no reason to show any leniency to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. The prosecutors also claim that it was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what they said to be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E
