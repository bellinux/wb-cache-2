500|$|The {{radar system}} for which Alvarez {{is best known}} and which has {{played a major role}} in aviation, most {{particularly}} in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Using Alvarez's dipole antenna to achieve a very high angular resolution, GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s. Alvarez was awarded the National Aeronautic Association's Collier Trophy in 1945 [...] "for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the <b>Ground</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>system</b> for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions".|$|E
50|$|To improve {{air traffic}} control, {{which would be}} {{critical}} {{as the number of}} flights grew, the newly developed <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> radar <b>system</b> (GCA) was flown to Europe for installation at Tempelhof, with a second set installed at Fassberg in the British Zone in West Germany. With the installation of GCA, all-weather airlift operations were assured.|$|R
50|$|A radically {{different}} type of antenna for X-band systems was invented by Luis W. Alvarez and used in three new systems: an airborne mapping radar called Eagle, a blind-landing <b>Ground</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA) <b>system,</b> and a ground-based Microwave Early-Warning (MEW) system. The latter two were highly successful and carried over into post-war applications. Eagle eventually was converted to a very effective mapping radar called H2X or Mickey and used by the U. S. Air Corps and Navy {{as well as the}} British RAF.|$|R
50|$|Navy {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} perform duties similar to civilian {{air traffic controllers}} and {{play a key role}} in the effective use of naval airpower throughout the world in operational and training environments. Navy ACs are responsible for safely and effectively directing aircraft operating from airfields or the decks of aircraft carriers. They also control the movement of aircraft and vehicles on airfield taxiways and issue flight instructions to pilots by radio. Air traffic controllers provide air traffic control services in air traffic control towers, radar air traffic control facilities, fleet area control and surveillance facilities, and air operations offices ashore and afloat. They also operate radio communication systems and light signals, direct aircraft under visual flight rules and instrument flight rules conditions, and operate surveillance radar, precision radar, data link <b>approach</b> <b>systems</b> and secondary surveillance radar (IFF) equipment. Other tasks include operation of <b>ground</b> and shipboard <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> <b>systems,</b> response to emergency air traffic situations, maintenance of current flight planning information and reference material, assistance of pilots in preparation and processing flight plans and clearances. Standards for entry into the AC field are high, but once accepted into the field, Navy ACs enjoy a demanding and highly rewarding career. This is a five-year enlistment program.|$|R

50|$|The Alvarez antenna {{was also}} used in {{developing}} the <b>Ground</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA), a combined S-Band and X-Band blind-landing system for bomber bases; this system was particularly used in assisting planes returning from missions in poor weather.|$|R
50|$|The {{visibility}} suddenly reduced {{but due to}} {{the close}} proximity of the aircraft to each other {{it was not possible}} to complete <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approaches.</b> In the following confusion and with only 10 minutes of fuel remaining, only two aircraft landed successfully.|$|R
50|$|Two lesser-known key {{systems were}} used at {{airports}} for {{air traffic control}} communications, the 102 and 302 key systems. These were uniquely designed for communications between the air traffic control tower and radar <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> (RAPCON) or <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA), and included radio line connections.|$|R
5|$|Alvarez made {{numerous}} professional {{contributions to}} aviation. During World War II {{he led the}} development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA) {{for which he was}} awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar transponder, for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.|$|R

50|$|Shortly after V-J Day, September 1945, Magruder {{became the}} {{commanding}} officer of Marine Aircraft Group 53 (a fully integrated Night Fighter Command) at Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas. The group consisted of seven tactical squadrons, one service and support squadron, one headquarters squadron, one <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> radar squadron and one <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> radar unit. This totalled nearly 2400 officers and men with 146 aircraft. At the time this was the largest aircraft group in Marine Aviation. In February 1946, MAG-53 moved operations back to MCAS Cherry Point. In August 1946 Magruder assumed command of Marine Aircraft Group 31.|$|R
50|$|During the Korean War, {{he served}} as a <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA) {{operator}} and was selected as the controller to direct the landing of General (and President-Elect) Dwight D. Eisenhower's plane when he made his famous visit to Korea. It is said that during the Korean War he was responsible for a radar interception unit and from the way some Migs were manoeuvering he identified some of the Russian pilots as his former wingmen in Spain. He used to refer to them, laughingly, as 'My Boys'.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the heavy}} rain and {{visibility}} reduced to 500 ft, XA897 was on a <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA) and was informed by Heathrow's air traffic controller that they were above the glide slope (GS) and needed to lose altitude. However, the crew reduced their height too much, with their air speed close to the minimum drag point for a gear down configuration. As a result, the Vulcan was 1030 yd short of the runway and the initial contact with the ground removed the aircraft's undercarriage.|$|R

5000|$|This group soon {{was joined}} by 3rd Battalion 9th Marines {{who served as the}} {{security}} element. Marine Air Traffic Control Unit 62 (MATCU 62) handled the airport traffic control operations including the airport tower and GCA radar (<b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach).</b> The force occupying [...] "The Rose Garden" [...] was designated Task Force Delta. The base was made up of marines, sailors (medical and construction staff), air force (mostly cargo handing), a six-man United States Army contingent from the 11th Signal Brigade (United States) (providing specialized communications security to the command from June to December 1972), and Thai military elements. The base was in existence until September 1973 when all the units returned to their home bases.|$|R
50|$|Flight 411 {{took off}} from Amsterdam Schiphol International Airport. On board were 15 {{passengers}} and five crew members. 90 minutes after departure flight 411 was cleared for approach into Manchester Airport. In low cloud and following a <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> the flight crew lowered the landing gear and turned into their final <b>approach</b> under visual <b>control.</b> One mile short of the runway eyewitnesses saw the aircraft turn into a shallow right descending turn with a steep bank angle. The Viscount's right wing hit {{the ground and the}} rest of the plane broke up bursting into flames and crashing into a house 85 yards beyond the impact point further on. All 20 passengers and crew on the aircraft died in the crash and two occupants of the house also died.|$|R
5000|$|AN/MPN-14 Mobile Ground <b>Approach</b> <b>System</b> can be {{configured}} as {{a complete}} Radar <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (RAPCON) or <b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach</b> (GCA) facility. The radar unit is used by air traffic controllers to identify, sequence, and separate participating aircraft, provide final approach guidance through air defense corridors and zones, and coordinate ID and intent with local air defense units at assigned airports and air bases. These services can be provided in all types of weather. It is capable of identifying aircraft using secondary radar up to a 200-nautical-mile (370 km) radius and primary radar coverage to 60 nautical miles (110 km). The PAR provides both azimuth and elevation information from 15 nmi km to touchdown. Both the PAR and ASR {{can be used as}} final approach aids. The unit has three ASR display indicators and one PAR indicator located in the operations shelter, and one each ASR and PAR indicator located in the maintenance shelter. Complete operations are conducted from the operations trailer. The system is limited to a single runway but has the capability of providing opposite direction runway operations {{with the aid of a}} transportable turntable.|$|R
2500|$|... 23 June 1953: Shortly after a <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approached</b> (GCA) radar {{monitored}} takeoff from Ashiya Air Base, Japan, a U.S. Air Force C-119 Flying Boxcar (AF Ser. No. 49-0161) {{turned to}} a heading 005 degrees magnetic (dm) and began a normal climb through the overcast. The pilot then reported that the C-119 may have scraped the tail skid on takeoff; additionally all the left seat (pilot side) gyroscopic instruments (Gyros) were not operational. A few seconds later, the pilot requested immediate GCA vector to Ashiya AB, stating that co-pilot would have to fly the GCA approach from the right seat. The GCA was continuously tracking them and reported its location as 12miles north of Ashiya AB, instructing co-pilot to turn right to a heading of 210 degrees. Then 49-161 disappeared from radar. All on board were lost ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAir traffic {{management}} (ATM) is an endless source of challenging optimization problems. Before discussing applications of metaheuristics to these problems, let us describe an ATM {{system in a}} few words, so that readers who {{are not familiar with}} such systems can understand the problems being addressed in this chapter. Between the moment passengers board an aircraft and the moment they arrive at their destination, a flight goes through several phases: push back at the gate, taxiing between the gate and the runway threshold, takeoff and initial climb following a Standard instrument departure (SID) procedure, cruise, final descent following standard terminal arrival route (STAR), landing on the runway, and taxiing to the gate. During each phase, the flight is handled by several air traffic <b>control</b> organizations: airport <b>ground</b> <b>control,</b> <b>approach</b> and terminal <b>control,</b> en-route control. These control organizations provide services that ensure safe and efficient conduct of flights, from departure to arrival...|$|R
50|$|The {{court of}} inquiry convened to review the crash {{determined}} that XA897s approach was affected by poor visibility due to heavy rain (three Russian TU-104 aircraft carrying the Bolshoi Ballet had already been diverted away from Heathrow to RAF Manston that morning) and that the aircraft was not equipped to use the instrument landing system (ILS) installed at Heathrow. The approach was undertaken using a <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approach</b> (GCA) (the first time Howard had done this). Howard attempted to abort the landing at Runway 01 Left, believing he was at 150 ft he applied power but his aircraft collided with the ground which removed his undercarriage and severely damaged the Vulcans control surfaces. The aircrafts port wing was almost vertical and with no prospect of recovery he and Broadhurst ejected. The low level {{made it impossible for}} Squadron Leader Stroud, Squadron Leader Eames, Squadron Leader Gamble, and Mr. Bassett to exit the aircraft and they were killed.|$|R

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of <b>ground</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>approaches</b> and describes an investigation into possible defects zn the system which might lead to accidents. Two such accidents are described and {{in both of these}} the aircraft built up long period expanding oscillations about the glide path. This motion is then investigated by simulation techniques and its causes determined. The trouble is found to be inherent in the technique of using the throttle to control height and the elevator to control speed. This is demonstrated by systematic use of the throttle in response to height errors according to various logical schemes. It ia found that, in certain circumstances, entirely logical use of the throttle results in an oscillation of increasing amplitude no matter bon successfully the pilot controls speed with the elevators. It 1 s concluded that accidents have sometimes resulted from use of the throttle to control height. Finally, a simple device is described, which led to a different flying technique giving much improved control of an aircraft making a blind approach. It consisted of an auxiliary spring;loaded throttle control. Flight tests of this device are strongly recommended. Replaces A. R. C. 24 545 - 2...|$|R
50|$|The Provost was {{developed}} to provide training better suited to the increasingly complicated operational aircraft that were then being brought into service. To suit the training mission, the two seats in the cockpit were side-by-side so that the instructor could be alongside the student for close observation and to demonstrate flight procedures; a third seat had been specified for an observer but this was later omitted following little use. The three-piece canopy was designed for good crash-worthiness and to facilitate instrument flying training in daylight, via extendible amber screens and blue-tinted goggles to prevent the pupil seeing outside the cockpit, while the instructor (wearing no goggles) {{could see through the}} amber panels. The Provost was also equipped with modern VHF radio aids for landing through cloud (<b>Ground</b> <b>Controlled</b> <b>Approach)</b> and to train the pilot to fly in cloud and navigate at night. The complexity of the cockpit was deliberate; contrary to earlier trainer aircraft which were simplified so students would find them easy to fly, the Provost was designed so that beginners were exposed to an advanced environment more akin to the varied tasks of aircraft operations.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, the Navy reopened the {{airfield}} as NALF Brown Field, a naval auxiliary landing field, {{due to increased}} military activity stemming from the Korean War and the Cold War. In 1954, Brown Field was again commissioned and redesignated as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station, with facilities to support regular operations of Fleet aircraft, assigned missile programs, and field carrier landing practice. In 1955, NAAS Brown Field was home to one utility squadron (VU), two air antisubmarine warfare squadrons (VS), a fleet aircraft service squadron (FASRON), and a Regulus air missile unit. The following year, the base was home to two utility squadrons, VU-3 and VU-7, the headquarters for Commander, Utility Wing Pacific (COMUTWINGPAC), a FASRON 4 detachment, and a <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> <b>approach</b> unit. Aircraft that operated at NAAS Brown Field included the F6F Hellcat, F9F Cougar, SNB, R4D Skytrain, JD-1 Invader, P2V Neptune, and FJ Fury. On November 2, 1954, the Convair XFY-1 Pogo made a transitional flight from vertical takeoff to horizontal flight, then back to a vertical landing at NAAS Brown Field. In 1957, NAAS Brown Field was selected as a site {{for one of the}} Vanguard Earth Satellite Tracking Stations.|$|R

50|$|Training Squadron 86 {{is known}} by several names: TRARON EIGHT SIX, VT-86, or the Sabrehawks, a name derived from its history of flying the T-39D/G/N Sabreliner and the TA-4J Skyhawk II. The {{squadron}} was established on the 5th of June 1972, under the operational control of Commander, Training Air Wing EIGHT (TRAWING 8) at Naval Air Station Glynco, Georgia. The {{mission of the}} new squadron was to conduct advanced Naval Flight Officer (NFO) training for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, which had previously been overseen by Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Glynco. The training was in four areas: Radar Intercept Officer, Basic Jet Navigation, Airborne Electronic Warfare and Airborne Tactical Data Systems. Training was conducted in aircraft previously assigned to and supported by NATTC Glynco until February 1973, when the squadron accepted 24 T-39 Sabreliners, 20 A-4C Skyhawks, 2 EC-121K Warning Stars, 12 TS-2A Tracker aircraft, and approximately 350 enlisted maintenance and support personnel from NATTC and NAS Glynco.

However, we can, to some extent, anticipate technological developments by observing what's going on in science and engineering. But the problem there is predicting when things will happen, even though one can be quite certain that they will.
