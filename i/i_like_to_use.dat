Naughty Dog's Jak & Daxter series and the Ratchet & Clank series are in similar genres; each game in both series' has been released at a similar time and both contain references to each other. Ryan Schneider, an employee of Insomniac, said, [...] "The analogy that <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> is that at Insomniac we {{like to look at}} it as how Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant act {{when it comes to their}} professions.

"I only keep two {{servants}}, {{because in}} a flat there isn't really room for more, and I put out the wash and get in cleaning-women when it's needed. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> my servants well, because it pays, and I hate to see anybody imposed upon. Some people put in a double-decker, as they call it--a bedstead with two tiers, like the berths on a ship; but I think that's a shame, and I give them two regular beds, {{even if it does}} crowd them a little more and the beds have to be rather narrow. This room has outside air, from the court, and, though it's always dark, it's very pleasant, as you see." [...] I did not say that I did not see, and this sufficed Mrs. Makely.|$|E
6000|$|Pitching a Tent.--It {{is quite}} an art, so to pitch a tent as {{to let in}} or exclude the air, to take {{advantage}} of sun and shade, etc. etc. Every available cloth or sheet may be pressed into service, to make awnings and screens, as we see among the gipsies. There {{is a great deal of}} character shown in each different person's encampment. A tent should never be pitched in a slovenly way: it is so far more roomy, secure and pretty, when tightly stretched out, that no pains should be spared in drilling the men to do it well. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a piece of string, marked with knots, by which I can measure the exact places in which the tent-pegs should be struck, for the eye is a deceitful guide in estimating squareness. (See [...] "Squaring.") It is wonderful how men will bungle with a tent, when they are not properly drilled to pitch it.|$|E

50|$|Baker uses {{a variety}} of textures in her works. “When I can, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> textures from the actual {{materials}} portrayed, such as bark, feathers, cracked paint, earth, knitted wool and rusty tin… so that their natural textures {{become an integral part}} of the work.” Baker’s collages illustrate her picture books, but also stand individually as works of art.

5000|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Thorne's {{novels are}} set in, [...] "made-up burgs" [...] {{on the edge}} of Los Angeles, but Californians see the town in Bad Things as {{sounding}} a lot like Redlands, California, where Hollywood stars used to live. Moonfall closely resembles Oak Glen, and the [...] "scary high desert retreat" [...] in Thunder Road is drawn from Calico Ghost Town.

I need large pots of paint with brushes in each one. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> mixed media because it affords new {{possibilities}} and surprises of texture and effect. The whites are a mixture of enamel and acrylic paint. I might, for example, have three cans of white paint of varying degrees of thickness.

50|$|Taylor {{has said}} of public art {{in general and}} his {{sculpture}} specifically: One of my favorite aspects of a public piece is that it sometimes sparks observations between strangers who wouldn't have conversed otherwise. Singing Sky, was created with the theme of diversity as its central message. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> abstract shapes as a language to help convey the meaning in my work. This opens a broad number of interpretations to be found by those who look for the message. Visually, I hope that it brings a sense of wonder and whimsy to those driving or walking by the park, and {{that the spirit of}} the sculpture creates a sense of being uplifted.|$|E

5000|$|Roughly speaking, my {{experience}} has proved {{that you need}} at least one hour of rehearsal for every minute of music. Less than that, and you cannot {{do justice to the}} piece. You also need good players—ideally, I prefer musicians who have worked together, and who have worked with me before. I have a very short fuse when I have to waste time on elementary things. And if possible, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> my own marked scores and parts.
