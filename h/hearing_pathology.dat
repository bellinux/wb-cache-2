40|$|Visando dar subsídios à análise do trabalho do fonoaudiólogo na Atenção Básica, mais especificamente nos Núcleos de Apoio à Saúde da Família (NASF), este artigo realizou revisão da {{literatura}} sobre o tema abordado usando ferramentas de busca do Medline, SciELO e o LILACS, por intermédio da pesquisa avançada simultânea de base de dados da Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), da Bireme. Procurou-se resgatar um pouco da história da Fonoaudiologia no SUS e dar ênfase à importância da Estratégia de Saúde da Família relacionada ao serviço de Fonoaudiologia nos NASFs. A pesquisa realizada aponta que a atuação da Fonoaudiologia dentro do sistema de saúde é bastante extensa, perpassando diferentes níveis de assistência, o que requer o desenvolvimento de distintas tecnologias de trabalho em saúde. As ações desenvolvidas pelos NASFs exigem, necessariamente, a atuação de equipes interdisciplinares, implicadas em processos de trabalho transdisciplinar e na criação/invenção de dispositivos terapêuticos. A análise das experiências de atuação da Fonoaudiologia na Atenção Básica, na Saúde da Família e, mais recentemente, nos NASFs, merece ser acompanhada e avaliada de perto para que se possa avançar na produção e sistematização de práticas de cuidado à saúde que respondam às necessidades da população e que sejam capazes de enfrentar os graves efeitos dos distúrbios de linguagem, voz, motricidade oral e audição. Desta forma conclui-se que se faz necessário o monitoramento e sistematização dos limites e potencialidades deste modelo, visando seu aprimoramento e apropriação do mesmo, como estratégia de atenção integral, de inserção da Fonoaudiologia no SUS.

The study briefly recovered the history of Speech-Language and <b>Hearing</b> <b>Pathology</b> on the Brazilian's national health system (Unified Health System - SUS), and emphasized the importance of the Family Health Strategy related to Speech-Language and <b>Hearing</b> <b>Pathology</b> services in the NASFs. The literature review indicates that the performance of Speech-Language and <b>Hearing</b> <b>Pathology</b> within the health system is quite extensive, spanning different levels of assistance, which requires the development of different technologies of health work.

To facilitate future improvements in screening protocols, this study investigated the results of tympanometry and transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) testing {{for a group of}} children with Down syndrome. Assessments were not conducted in the artificial context of a clinic or laboratory, but within the school environment. Outcomes are reported for 27 subjects {{with a mean age of}} 10 years 5 months (SD = 4; 11).

Materials and Methods: Three fresh human explanted temporal bones were trimmed, chemically decalcified with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and mechanically drilled under visual control using OCT in order to reveal the remaining bone shell. After confirming decalcification with a computed tomography (CT) scan, the samples were scanned with OCT in different views. The oval window, round window, and remnant part of internal auditory canal and cochlear turn were investigated. Results: Preparation of the labyrinthine bone and visualization under OCT guidance was successfully performed to a remaining bony layer of 300 μm thickness.

40|$|Hearing {{impairment}} is {{a serious}} disease with increasing prevalence. It is defined based on increased audiometric thresholds but increased thresholds are only {{partly responsible for the}} greater difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments experienced by some older listeners or by hearing-impaired listeners. Identifying the additional factors and mechanisms that impair intelligibility is fundamental to understanding hearing impairment but these factors remain uncertain. Traditionally, these additional factors have been sought in the way the speech spectrum is encoded in the pattern of impaired mechanical cochlear responses. Recent studies, however, are steering the focus toward impaired encoding of the speech waveform in the auditory nerve. In our recent work, we gave evidence that a significant factor might be the loss of afferent auditory nerve fibers, a pathology that comes with aging or noise overexposure. Our approach was based on a signal-processing analogy whereby the auditory nerve may be regarded as a stochastic sampler of the sound waveform and deafferentation may be described in terms of waveform undersampling. We showed that stochastic undersampling simultaneously degrades the encoding of soft and rapid waveform features, and that this degrades speech intelligibility in noise more than in quiet without significant increases in audiometric thresholds. Here, we review our recent work in a broader context and argue that the stochastic undersampling analogy may be extended to study the perceptual consequences of various different <b>hearing</b> <b>pathologies</b> and their treatment...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of schooling and age on the results from the Montreal Toulouse (Modified MT Beta- 86) language assessment test among individuals without linguistic disorders. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study carried out between March 2006 and August 2007 in the Speech, Language and <b>Hearing</b> <b>Pathology</b> Department of Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Eighty volunteers were selected. Schooling was stratified into three bands: A (1 - 4 years), B (5 - 8 years) and C (nine years and over). The age range was from 17 to 80 years. All the subjects underwent the Montreal Toulouse (Modified MT Beta- 86) language assessment protocol. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found in relation to schooling levels, in the tasks of oral comprehension, reading, graphical comprehension, naming, lexical availability, dictation, graphical naming of actions and number reading. Statistically significant age-related differences in dictation and lexical availability tasks were observed.

40|$|The endbulbs of Held {{are formed}} by the {{ascending}} branches of myelinated auditory nerve fibers and represent {{one of the largest}} synaptic endings in the brain. Normally, these endings are highly branched and each can form up to 1000 dome-shaped synapses. The deaf white cat is a model of congenital deafness involving a type of cochleosaccular degeneration that mimics the Scheibe deformity in humans. Endbulbs of mature deaf white cats exhibit reduced branching, hypertrophy of postsynaptic densities (PSDs), and changes in synaptic vesicle density. Because cats are essentially deaf at birth, we sought to determine if the progression of brain abnormalities was linked in time to the failure of normal hearing development. The rationale was that the lack of sound-evoked activity would trigger pathologic change in deaf kittens. The cochleae of deaf cats did not exhibit abnormal morphology at birth. After the first postnatal week, however, the presence of a collapsed scala media signaled the difference between deaf and hearing cats. By working backwards in age, endbulbs of deaf cats expressed flattened and elongated PSDs and increased synaptic vesicle density as compared to normal endbulbs. These differences are present at birth in some white kittens, presaging deafness despite their normal cochlear histology. We speculate that <b>hearing</b> <b>pathology</b> is signaled by a perinatal loss of spontaneous bursting activity in auditory nerve fibers or perhaps by some factor released by hair cell synapses before obliteration of the organ of Corti...|$|E

The methodology we designed was presented in a previous work [1] in which we also showed the results of a pilot test to confirm our original hypothesis that the comprehension of conversational speech decreases passing from bimodal transmission to uni-modal transmission. In order to further investigate the contribution of visual information to the process of speech comprehension, we run a new series of comprehension tests, that consisted of the following three phases: 1. submission of the multi-modal speech signal (auditory + visual); 2. submission of the sample only in the auditory modality (i. e. without the integration of visual cues); 3. submission of the sample only in the visual modality (without the integration of auditory cues).

Given {{the changes in the}} digital world over the last decades, students of the current generation expect technology to be used in advancing their learning requiring a need to change traditional passive learning methodologies to an active multisensory experimental learning methodology. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare a computer game-based learning method with a traditional learning method, regarding learning gains and knowledge retention, as means of teaching head and neck Anatomy and Physiology to Speech-Language and <b>Hearing</b> <b>pathology</b> undergraduate students. Methods Students were randomized to participate to one of the learning methods and the data analyst was blinded to which method of learning the students had received. Students’ prior knowledge (i. e. before undergoing the learning method), short-term knowledge retention and long-term knowledge retention (i. e. six months after undergoing the learning method) were assessed with a multiple choice questionnaire. Students’ performance was compared considering the three moments of assessment for both for the mean total score and for separated mean scores for Anatomy questions and for Physiology questions. Results Students that received the game-based method performed better in the pos-test assessment only when considering the Anatomy questions section. Students that received the traditional lecture performed better in both post-test and long-term post-test when considering the Anatomy and Physiology questions.

40|$|Age related {{hearing loss}} (ARHL) affects {{one in three}} humans aged over 65 years of age. The most common {{complaint}} in ARHL is difficulty understanding speech in noise. Olivocochlear (OC) efferents project from the brain to the cochlea and represent {{the final stage of}} the descending auditory pathway. OC efferents are involved in listening in loud environments and protect the cochlea from noise damage. We used anatomical methods to investigate OC efferent cell morphology and top-down patterns of descending input from the inferior colliculus (IC) to determine if deterioration of the descending auditory pathway accompanies peripheral auditory pathology in the mouse. Brightfield, fluorescent, and electron microscopy were used to identify OCs and their synaptic inputs in 1 -, 3 -, and 6 -month old mice with normal hearing (CBA/CaH), progressive high frequency hearing loss (DBA/ 2), and congenital deafness (homozygous Shaker 2). Electrophysiologically directed injections in the IC were used to elucidate the tonotopic nature of descending input to the medial OC (MOC) efferent population. In normal hearing mice, the IC provides excitatory synaptic input to MOCs in a tonotopic manner. Higher frequencies project to medially located cells, whereas lower frequencies project to laterally located cells. Synaptic input was retained in hearing loss and congenital deafness, however, the spatial distribution of terminals and MOC somata were significantly altered. Together, these data indicate that the nature and time course of peripheral <b>hearing</b> <b>pathology</b> is correlated with loss of MOC efferent cells and a systematic deviation of descending input from the IC in a frequency dependent manner. Therefore, changes to the descending central auditory pathway may help to explain the difficulty extracting signals from background noise characteristic of ARHL. In the course of investigating OC efferents, we consistently identified a population of cells in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus that appeared to project to the cochlea. Using immunohistochemical, neuronal tract tracing, and electron microscopic methods, we characterized these ‘dorsal efferents’ with respect to the existing OC populations and provide evidence for their inclusion as a new class of auditory efferents in mouse...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how outer hair cell loss interacts with noise-induced and age-related {{auditory}} nerve degradation (i. e., cochlear synaptopathy) to affect auditory brainstem response (ABR) wave characteristics. Given that listeners with impaired audiograms likely suffer from mixtures of these hearing deficits and that ABR amplitudes have successfully been used to isolate synaptopathy in listeners with normal audiograms, an improved understanding of how different <b>hearing</b> <b>pathologies</b> affect the ABR source generators will improve their sensitivity in hearing diagnostics. We employed a functional model for human ABRs in which different combinations of hearing deficits were simulated and show that high-frequency cochlear gain loss steepens {{the slope of the}} ABR Wave-V latency versus intensity and amplitude versus intensity curves. We propose that grouping listeners according to a ratio of these slope metrics (i. e., the ABR growth ratio) might offer a way to factor out the outer hair cell loss deficit and maximally relate individual differences for constant ratios to other peripheral hearing deficits such as cochlear synaptopathy. We compared the model predictions to recorded click-ABRs from 30 participants with normal or high-frequency sloping audiograms and confirm the predicted relationship between the ABR latency growth curve and audiogram slope. Experimental ABR amplitude growth showed large individual differences and was compared with the Wave-I amplitude, Wave-V/I ratio, or the interwaveI–W latency in the same listeners. The model simulations along with the ABR recordings suggest that a hearing loss profile depicting the ABR growth ratio versus the Wave-I amplitude or Wave-V/I ratio might be able to differentiate outer hair cell deficits from cochlear synaptopathy in listeners with mixed pathologies...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the feasibility and practicalities of testing children in special school settings using transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and tympanometry. Children studying in special schools, particularly those with intellectual impairment, may be highly susceptible to <b>hearing</b> <b>pathologies</b> and {{can be difficult to}} assess using traditional test batteries. Researchers have recently suggested the possible applicability of TEOAE testing, in lieu of conventional behavioral methods, as a hearing screening device for persons with intellectual impairment. However, to date, few publications have detailed the particulars and results of such testing. Methods: A total of 489 children, {{with a mean age of}} 9. 6 years, were tested in 15 special schools. Case information was obtained regarding birth history, medical history and type/degree of impairment, for later comparison with screening results. TEOAEs were collected using Quickscreen mode of the ILO 292 Otodynamics Analyzer, whilst tympanometry was performed utilizing a Madsen Zodiac 901 Middle Ear Analyzer. Results: In total, 80 % of students were able to be tested using TEOAEs. Average test time per ear was 2 min. However, a large proportion (40 % of those able to be tested) failed TEOAE testing in at least one ear. No significant effects were found between could-not-test (CNT) cases and case history factors. A significant difference in TEOAE failure rates was found across history of neonatal special care nursery residency and history of parental concern regarding possible hearing impairment. Failure rates were higher for those who indicated positive histories. A total of 74 % of subjects could be tested using tympanometry, with 25 % of those able to be tested failing in at least one ear. Notably, neither type nor degree of impairment had any significant bearing on CNT or failure rates for tympanometry or TEOAE screening. Conclusions: Findings of the present investigation lend support to the review of hearing screening programs for children in special schools, with TEOAEs presenting as a potential alternative procedure. Further examination of the performance measures of protocols incorporating TEOAEs would now be advantageous. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Efficient {{transfer}} of sound {{by the middle}} ear ossicles is essential for <b>hearing.</b> Various <b>pathologies</b> can impede the transmission of sound and thereby cause conductive hearing loss. Differential diagnosis of ossicular disorders can be challenging since the ossicles are normally hidden behind the tympanic membrane (TM). Here we describe {{the use of a}} technique termed optical coherence tomography (OCT) vibrography to view the sound-induced motion of the TM and ossicles simultaneously. With this method, we were able to capture three-dimensional motion of the intact TM and ossicles of the chinchilla ear with nanometer-scale sensitivity at sound frequencies from 0. 5 to 5 kHz. The vibration patterns of the TM were complex and highly frequency dependent with mean amplitudes of 70 - 120 nm at 100 dB sound pressure level. The TM motion was only marginally sensitive to stapes fixation and incus-stapes joint interruption; however, when additional information derived from the simultaneous measurement of ossicular motion was added, it was possible to clearly distinguish these different simulated pathologies.

40|$|Tinnitus {{is highly}} complex, diverse, and {{difficult}} to treat, {{in part due to}} the fact that the underlying causes and mechanisms remain elusive. Tinnitus is generated within the auditory brain, however, consolidating our understanding of tinnitus pathophysiology is difficult due to the diversity of reported effects and the variety of implicated brain nuclei. Here, we focus on the inferior colliculus, a midbrain structure that integrates the vast majority of ascending auditory information and projects via the thalamus to the auditory cortex. The IC is also a point of convergence for corticofugal input and input originating outside the auditory pathway. We review the evidence, from both studies with human subjects and from animal models, for the contribution the inferior colliculus makes to tinnitus. Changes in the IC, caused by either noise exposure or drug administration, involve fundamental, heterogeneous alterations in the balance of excitation and inhibition. However, differences between <b>hearing</b> loss-induced <b>pathology</b> and tinnitus-related pathology are not well understood.

5000|$|According to the Library of Congress, about 1.6 million {{children}} in Russia need access to special education. Despite legal rulings that allow children {{to attend school}} and mandate that specialized education be available, most do not receive a public education. Advances, however, {{have been made to}} provide rehabilitation services according to disability. Eight schools exist that serve individuals with the following disabilities: severe retardation, various ranges of blindness and deafness, as well as severe motor problems. [...] The Library of Congress reports that [...] "In 2006, Russia had 1,373 boarding schools for 170,000 children with speech, <b>hearing,</b> and language <b>pathology,</b> vision impairment, mental retardation, skeletal diseases, and tuberculosis; and 1,946 day schools for 236,000 disabled students." [...] Primarily, though, children are placed into institutions at an early age. Since 1993, the Ministry of Education made a recommendation regarding the creation of the availability of classes for children with learning disabilities, but this sort of social change is still in progress.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{well-documented}} that persons with Down syndrome are particularly susceptible to hearing loss and middle ear <b>pathology.</b> <b>Hearing</b> loss associated with Down syndrome is usually late-onset and progressive in nature, deeming the regular practices of universal newborn hearing screening insufficient. The authors have carried out hearing screening and diagnostic assessment on schoolchildren with Down syndrome, in both special schools and mainstream schools, {{in two different}} nations {{in the past few}} years. The prevalence of hearing loss in these school-age populations, as well as the common degree, nature and underlying <b>pathology</b> of <b>hearing</b> loss/middle ear disorders, were investigated. This chapter presents discussion of the developmental implications of such hearing impairment for schoolchildren with Down syndrome, in addition to its influence on learning. Technological options for hearing and middle ear screening are explored, culminating in feasible and practical screening and surveillance protocols for this population. Finally, the authors discuss medical and audiological treatment options and outline recommendations for meeting the audiological rehabilitation needs of children with Down syndrome...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{systematically}} {{review and}} analyse experimental outcomes of studies exploring {{the impact of}} tinnitus upon cognitive function and their implications for clinical management of invasive tinnitus. DESIGN : A systematic and descriptive review. STUDY SAMPLE : Eighteen studies were identified investigating the impact of tinnitus on cognitive function. RESULTS : The 18 studies evaluated cognitive function using 24 different objective behavioural tests, nine electrophysiological recordings, one oculomotor test, and one self-report questionnaire. The studies spanned 18 years and revealed numerous interactions potentially contributing to the cognitive difficulties frequently reported by people with invasive tinnitus. The studies indicate a clear association between tinnitus and aspects of cognitive function, specifically the executive control of attention. CONCLUSIONS : Tinnitus impairs cognitive function by way of impact upon executive control of attention. Clinical management of patients reporting tinnitus and cognitive difficulties requires {{an understanding of the}} reciprocal relationship between tinnitus and cognitive function, with additive effects of anxiety, depression, and somatic cognitive bias. Further study is required to establish the impact of advancing age, hearing loss, anxiety, depression tinnitus duration, and distress upon cognitive function in people with invasive tinnitus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Accessibility of {{audiometry}} is {{hindered by}} {{the cost of}} sound booths and shortage of hearing health personnel. This study investigated the validity of an automated mobile diagnostic audiometer with increased attenuation and real-time noise monitoring for clinical testing outside a sound booth. DESIGN : Attenuation characteristics and reference ambient noise levels for the computer-based audiometer (KUDUwave) was evaluated alongside the validity of environmental noise monitoring. Clinical validity was determined by comparing air and bone conduction thresholds obtained {{inside and outside the}} sound booth (23 subjects). Test-retest reliability was established for a sub-group of 11 subjects. RESULTS : Improved passive attenuation and valid environmental noise monitoring was demonstrated. Clinically, air conduction thresholds inside and outside the sound booth, corresponded within 5 dB or less > 90 % of instances (mean absolute difference 3. 3 ± 3. 2 SD). Bone conduction thresholds corresponded within 5 dB or less in 80 % of comparisons between test environments, with a mean absolute difference of 4. 6 dB (3. 7 SD). Threshold differences were not statistically significant. Mean absolute testretest differences outside the sound booth was similar to those in the booth. CONCLUSION : Diagnostic pure tone audiometry outside a sound booth using automated testing, improved passive attenuation, and real-time environmental noise monitoring demonstrated reliable <b>hearing</b> assessments.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) in gold miners {{of different ages}} and occupation types were examined and the incidence of tinnitus, vertigo/balance problems and nausea were determined. The results indicate that as a subject group these had symmetrical bilateral, mild hearing loss in the frequencies below 2000 Hz deteriorating to a moderate sloping hearing loss in the frequencies above 2000 Hz, and the loss did not demonstrate the expected “notch” at 4000 Hz that is usually found in NIHL. The average deterioration in the pure tone thresholds of gold miners was 3. 5 dB at 500 Hz; 2. 75 dB at 1000 Hz, 15. 37 dB at 2000 Hz, 19. 12 dB at 3000 Hz; 20. 87 dB at 4000 Hz and 14. 16 dB at 6000 Hz for every ten years of age. The pattern of hearing loss varies for the different occupation types with machine operators being the most severely affected. The majority of tinnitus sufferers were in the age range 30 - 60 years and 57. 8 % were in the under 60 years old category, while in the over 60 years the incidence was 4. 8 %. The incidence of vertigo and nausea {{were found to be}} 27 % in this population. The results of this study will equip the audiologist to better deal with diagnostic testing, successful hearing aid fitting and aural rehabilitation of this population. The study highlights the need for greater awareness and the imparting of detailed information to gold miners about the impact of noise on their <b>hearing.</b> Dissertation (MCommunication <b>Pathology)</b> [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

Samples: Three samples were used in this validation study. The first was composed of 335 students with an average age of 9. 75 years (SD = 1. 2) from Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais State), Brazil, where the full spectrum of reading ability was assessed. The second two samples were from S&atilde;o Paulo city (S&atilde;o Paulo State), Brazil, where only children with reading difficulties were recruited. The first S&atilde;o Paulo sample was labeled &ldquo;SP-screening&rdquo; and had n = 617, {{with a mean age of}} 9. 8 years (SD = 1. 0), and the other sample was labeled &ldquo;SP-trial&rdquo; and had n = 235, with a mean age of 9. 15 years (SD = 0. 05). Methods: Results were obtained from a latent class analysis LCA, in which two latent groups were obtained as solutions, and were correlated with direct reading measures. Also, students&rsquo; scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale and on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire tested the discriminant validation. Results: Latent groups of readers underlying the EACOL predicted all direct reading measures, while the same latent groups showed no association with behavior and intelligence assessments, giving concurrent and discriminant validity to EACOL, respectively. Conclusion: EACOL is a reliable screening tool which can be used by a wide range of professionals for assessing reading skills.
