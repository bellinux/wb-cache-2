Simon writes: [...] "What was the most horrible summer {{in the life of a}} young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life." [...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's final remarks reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Guardian, critic Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} name Francis Iles, noted that the two minor {{grammatical}} errors he spotted were [...] "likely to spoil no one's enjoyment" [...] of the novel as he considered that On Her Majesty's Secret Service was [...] "not only up to Mr. Fleming's usual level, but perhaps <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> above it." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer Maurice Richardson pondered {{if there had been}} [...] "a deliberate moral reformation" [...] of Bond. However, he notes Bond still has his harder side when needed. Richardson also thought that [...] "in reforming Bond Mr. Fleming has reformed his own story-telling which had been getting very loose". Overall he thought that [...] "O.H.M.S.S. is certainly the best Bond for several books. It is better plotted and retains its insane grip until the end".|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone named [...] "Single Ladies" [...] {{the best}} song of 2008, and wrote, [...] "The beat... is irresistible and exuberant, the vocal hook is stormy and virtuosic." [...] "Single Ladies" [...] ranked as the second-best {{song of the}} 2000s decade in the magazine's 2009 readers' poll, and Rolling Stone critics placed it at number 50 {{on the list of}} the 100 Best Songs of the Decade. [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was placed at number two on MTV News' list of The Best Songs of 2008; James Montgomery called it [...] "hyperactive and {{supercharged}} in ways I never thought possible. It's epic and sexy and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> sad." [...] "There is absolutely zero chance Beyoncé ever releases a single like this ever again", Montgomery concluded. Time magazine critic Josh Tyrangiel, who called the song [...] "ludicrously infectious", ranked it as the seventh-best song of 2008. Douglas Wolf of the same publication placed it at number nine on his list of the All-Time 100 Songs.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave a more mixed review, {{suggesting}} that Spears [...] "frequently sounds disconnected, <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bored" [...] throughout the record, whereas Blackout was a [...] "relentless, risky album {{made by a}} woman whose obituary was apparently being prepared by Associated Press." [...] A writer for The Independent gave a negative review, opining that Spears' vocal delivery sounded emotionless in mid-tempo and ballad-paced tracks. Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson shared a similar sentiment, {{suggesting that}} the album's [...] "self-actualization" [...] gave off a [...] "hollow" [...] feel through {{the majority of the}} record. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times felt that Circus served as a [...] "bang-up job" [...] of stating that [...] "Spears is still a young woman trying to manage an impossible situation." [...] Writing for NME, Hamish MacBain was disappointed that [...] "Spears is quite simply rubbish at being sexy", adding that Circus is the [...] "umpteenth attempt to turn the perceived chaos of Britney's transition to adulthood – she's 27 next week! – into sleazy, raunchy, dirrty adult-pop product." ...|$|E
500|$|David Quantick in The Word {{commented that}} [...] "musically, Seduction is awe-inspiring {{in the way}} the Maels {{perfectly}} meld their current style – intense, repetitive beats and melodies (there's <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of squelching techno here) and caustic, snappy lyrics – with the demands of an actual musical." [...] He called the album an [...] "amazing record", a [...] "commissioned piece that not only does what it's been asked to do, but transcends the brief and creates a genuinely exciting piece of music in its own right." [...] Andy Gill in The Independent gave The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman a maximum rating of five stars and included the record among his 20 albums of the year: [...] "Sharply scripted, with that sly, knowing touch so typical of Sparks, it's also scored with scrupulous intelligence, the arrangements drawing on a range of apt influences, from Kurt Weill to jazz, pop and rock, and the orchestrations ingeniously duplicitous, wistful and sinister, as the action dictates. It may well {{turn out to be the}} pinnacle of Sparks' career, and certainly has an ambition well beyond the usual remit of popular culture." ...|$|E

500|$|About Ocean's writing, Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent {{stated that}} the [...] "strength of his songwriting {{is his ability to}} make the {{unfamiliar}} feel intensely personal, as if you're a friend that has long known all the particulars of his relationships." [...] He continued, [...] "Thinking About You" [...] is also more primal, though. The yearning in his falsetto is almost palpable as he flips gender roles and admits that he's been [...] "thinking about forever," [...] while simultaneously questioning if the [...] "girl" [...] even had that kinda thing on her mind." [...] Erika Ramirez of Billboard wrote that the track [...] "gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility, as he intertwines the parallel styles of soul, R, jazz and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of funk." [...] The song has been described as incredibly personal in nature, the [...] "sort of thing that's best sung by the person who wrote it." [...] The track telepathically serenades the person who took Ocean's virginity, and in the [...] "motel room of memories Frank talks eternal love, breaking into a sublime Maxwell-esque falsetto that makes a good case for restoring the style to contemporary mainstream R" ...|$|E
500|$|Panjaa {{received}} largely {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The movie was criticised for {{its lack of}} story and weak screenplay, though it was praised for its stylish presentation. Rediff gave a two stars, said [...] "Panjaa is let down by a weak script. Panjaa also reminds one of Pawan Kalyan's own earlier movie, Balu. The {{second half of the}} film lags a bit. There doesn't seem to be much originality in the story telling. On the whole, Panjaa is nothing extraordinary and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> disappointing". [...] rated two stars, noted [...] "The main drop down in the film is Pawan's character design. His getup and being a yesman to a gangster aren't in kilter with his nursery business. First half is morose and second half is emotion overdose. On a whole, Panjaa hits badly on the expectations of audience". Deccan Chronicle gave two stars says [...] "The much-hyped action thriller lacks the adrenaline of a tight and creative script and one feels let down when stepping out of the theatre". A gangster film with mafia backdrop, It got mixed reviews but its title song, Panjaa, was the song of the year.|$|E

Also for The Hindu, Malathi Rangarajan wrote, [...] "Let's celebrate the figment of [...] imagination {{that has made the}} housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of The Telegraph called the film [...] "a winner from the first frame to the last" [...] and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made [...] "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called Eega the [...] "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter [...] "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave Eega four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was [...] "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called Eega an [...] "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" [...] that [...] "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".|$|E

500|$|This transcendency thesis {{has also}} been applied to scriptural interpretation. When {{discussing}} {{the path to the}} attainment of Nirvana, in some passages in the Tipiṭaka merit is rejected. For example, in the Padhāna Sutta, the Bodhisatta (the Buddha Gotama to be) is tempted by Māra to give up his self-torture practices to do meritorious acts instead. The Bodhisatta replies that <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of merit is no use to him (...) [...] Some scholars, supporting the transcendency thesis, have interpreted this to mean that merit can only lead to happiness and progress within Saṃsāra, but does not lead to Nirvana, and must in fact be discarded before attaining Nirvana. Marasinghe believes, however, that the word merit in this passage refers to merit in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical sense, connected with rituals and sacrifice, and the lay life. Another example often quoted in this context is the simile of the raft, which states that both dhamma and adhamma should be let go of in order to attain liberation. Whereas the term adhamma in the text clearly refers to evil views, the meaning of dhamma is subject to different interpretations. Considering that no other similar passage {{can be found in the}} Tipiṭaka, Keown believes that only this passage is not enough to base the transcendency thesis on.|$|E
500|$|Rhythm Killers {{was well}} {{received}} by contemporary critics. In a review for The Philadelphia Inquirer, Ken Tucker remarked that having mastered reggae, Sly and Robbie proved they could perform funk music just as well. Steve Hochman from the Los Angeles Times hailed {{it as one}} of 1987's best records from any genre because of how Sly and Robbie drew on the funk's past 20 years, [...] "from Sly & the Family Stone through George Clinton, along the way throwing in reggae, rap and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of Rossini." [...] In Rolling Stone, Gavin Edwards called it [...] "a thirty-five-minute dance party full of surprises and strange noises", writing that it [...] "sounds like the Great Missing DJ Set—albeit one played by live musicians with perfect telepathy." [...] i-D magazine's Simon Witter said it was the most entertaining and exceptionally conceived dance album of the year, while Stereo Review called it one of the best dance records in some time because the duo's creative yet accessible urban dance music showed how to combine the best parts of older music with contemporary recording techniques. In a negative review, Greg Taylor from The Sydney Morning Herald criticized the music as [...] "wallpaper" [...] undermined by a gaudy hip hop production. John Leland of Spin wrote that while Rhythm Killers may be ambitious and successful as a [...] "dialogue on the crosscultural elasticity of the funk", it lacked vigor as actual funk music and never got beyond its concept and [...] "into the funk". In The New York Times, Palmer found the musical ideas innovative and its concept [...] "a worthy one"—that [...] "funk is the [...] of contemporary dance music"—but he observed an excess of disordered effects and funk-derived sounds on what were otherwise expressive rhythm tracks.|$|E

Dave Kehr said that [...] "For all its shoddiness, the film manages, just barely, to achieve its ignoble goals -- it delivers what it promises". James Kendrick gave the film a 3 out of 4, calling it [...] "a campfire boogeyman story designed to {{do little more than}} build tension and deliver a few well-timed shocks, which it does with precision and <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of artistry". Kevin Carr said that [...] "what makes the movie work is that the slasher genre hadn't been set in stone yet, and some choices that director Sean S.
