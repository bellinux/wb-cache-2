40|$|The sediments {{collected}} from RH-wing tank, engine <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> <b>element,</b> and the fuel pumping system of an aircraft {{were sent to}} the laboratory for analysis. The sediments {{collected from}} RH wing tank and <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> were found to be rich in carbon and oxygen with varying amount of other elements such as Ca, S, K, Na, Si, Al, Fe, Cr and Ti. The components of the fuel pumping system were found to be discoloured and they had brownish yellow appearance. There were scales/deposits all over the surface. Examination revealed that the deposits were mainly fibrous in nature and had the composition similar to that mentioned above. Pitting was observed in isolated places on the components of the fuel pumping system. Compositional analysis showed presence of corrodant like Cl to an extent of 1. 6 wt% inside the pits. A detailed analysis of the problem is presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} {{of metal and}} ceramic layers {{can be useful in}} many different application fields as solid oxide <b>fuel</b> cells, <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> in medical engineering or for wear-resistant components. The most promising, cost-effective and especially the way with the highest degree of freedom in regard to the design is using a combined shaping (co-shaping) and sintering (co-sintering). However, differences in densification behavior during co-sintering can lead to stresses and defects as cracks, delaminations or cambering of the composite. The presentation will show the adaption of the co-sintering behavior of ceramic and metallic materials using a high energy milling (HEM) step to influence the sintering behavior of the metallic powders. The change of the sintering behavior can be related with a change in particle size, specific surface area and crystallite size. Co-sintering results of composites produced by different shaping technologies consisting of yttria stabilized zirconia and an iron chromium alloy using the starting powder in comparison to the powder modified by HEM are shown...|$|R

50|$|Fuel {{contaminants}} such as {{dirt and}} water {{are often more}} problematic in diesel engines than in petrol engines. Water can cause serious damage, due to corrosion, to the injection pump and injectors; and dirt, even very fine particulate matter, can damage the injection pumps due to the close tolerances that the pumps are machined to. All diesel engines will have a <b>fuel</b> <b>filter</b> (usually much finer than a filter on a petrol engine), and a water trap. The water trap (which is sometimes part of the <b>fuel</b> <b>filter)</b> often has a float connected to a warning light, which warns when {{there is too much}} water in the trap, and must be drained before damage to the engine can result.

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R
