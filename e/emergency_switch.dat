40|$|A {{new type}} of a {{demountable}} and gas-permeable high voltage insulation was developed for the cable-in-conduit conductor connections of the superconducting Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) magnet system. These connections are situated within the cryovacuum space of the machine. Normal operation voltages are very low {{so that they do}} not need to be considered separately with respect to electrical insulation. On the other hand, in case of an <b>emergency</b> <b>switch</b> off the maximal voltage between two conductor joints might reach around 3 kV. Again, the normal operation cryovacuum is by far sufficient as an electrical insulator for this voltage too. However, in case of a vacuum failure which might occur simultaneously with or might even trigger a fast coil discharge, the gas pressure could reach the conditions of the 'Paschen minimum' which is characterized by a low breakdown voltage. In the worst case the leak woulder occur for instance between the cryovacuum space and the helium system leading to the minimal helium breakdown voltage of #approx# 160 V even for large electrode distances. The gas-permeable high voltage insulation was tested with regard to dc voltage strength and to gas flow for He below atmospheric pressure. Experiments were performed around the Paschen minimum region at ambient as well as LN_ 2 temperatures. The results show that this type of insulation has sufficient strength for the specified test voltage of 12 kV under all vacuum conditions. The gas flow investigations proved that the flow resistance and the ability to hold helium will hinder neither the pumping of the W 7 -X cryostat nor the leak tests. This work shows the principal applicability of the proposed insulation system. Further investigations would be needed for better physical understanding and for optimization. However, the development is so far advanced that one could start to build an insulation prototype for W 7 -X. A patent application was filed for this gas-permeable and dismountable high voltage insulation which is suitable also for other large superconducting magnets with cable-in-conduit conductors. (orig.)

40|$|Envision {{the future}} {{disaster}} recovery worker relying on mobile devices {{to work in}} a disaster setting. This recovery worker requires and benefits from a great number of provided services, for instance, to navigate, communicate, and map the environment. However, he faces adverse networking and computing conditions, characterized by the obstructed or destroyed geographical region, the overloaded or destroyed communication infrastructure, and the density and movement of involved recovery workers. We call such surroundings harsh environments. The present thesis strives to enable recovery workers to consume versatile (cloud) services on top of a resilient communication infrastructure. A service is a software component, i. e., an application, that provides a distinct functionality to accessing users. Thereby, three key challenges have to be faced that also define the three fields of research: (1) improving the resilience of the communication infrastructure, (2) designing a system capable of service provision, and (3) conceiving detailed simulation models and tools to investigate such systems in harsh environments. In each field of research, we contribute and evaluate novel approaches that work together to achieve the main goal of this thesis: mobile service provision in harsh environments. First, we contribute CityMesh, a resilient emergency communication infrastructure created by interconnecting wireless routers from private households and public institutions found in urban areas. The resulting decentralized mesh network is based on the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN standard and outperforms the existing TETRA standard in terms of data throughput, openness, and failure resilience. Furthermore, we present our research methodology to evaluate the feasibility of our concept by collecting data about wireless routers, enhancing the data accuracy using multilateration, and constructing and analyzing CityMesh networks. We show that network topologies in five selected cities rely on router locations specific to the respective city. Furthermore, we demonstrate that private routers are crucial to create a resilient CityMesh network. To realize the CityMesh concept, we propose to install an <b>emergency</b> <b>switch</b> into wireless routers. This switch could be triggered by eligible authorities in case of a disaster. Second, we present the core contribution of our thesis: the peer-to-peer service overlay concept that fulfills the requirements of harsh environments. To ensure high quality service consumption, the most crucial system components are service discovery (enables service consumers to access a requested service) and service placement (relocates a service in the network topology to increase service quality). Based on simulations, we demonstrate that our conceived hop count placement approach outperforms {{the state of the art}} placement approach in terms of consistent service quality for all service consumers. Furthermore, we show that latency is not a suitable quality metric for service placement. We also demonstrate that three state of the art service discovery approaches designed for mobile ad-hoc networks are not capable of handling service mobility introduced by service placement. Moreover, a naive request flooding approach performs best in terms of discovery performance and data traffic efficiency when exposed to peer mobility and frequent service migrations. Finally, we present our real-world experiment setup PeerMoS and contribute four concepts for smooth and efficient service migration. Third, we contribute our integrated simulation framework DisVis to investigate the effectiveness of communication systems in realistic harsh environments. Especially in disaster recovery scenarios, the movement of recovery workers depends on the terrain, the current disaster situation, the mission strategy of respective recovery workers, and the orders received from the command centers. Hence, DisVis builds upon an OpenStreetMap-based world model and a fine-grained agent-based mobility and communication model. We adjust the rule sets and parameters of our models with results from our survey targeted at experts from first response departments. As opposed to other state of the art mobility simulators, DisVis provides an online interface to connect our framework with state of the art network simulators, such as PeerfactSim. KOM. ...|$|E

40|$|Electricity Distribution Networks are {{normally}} scattered over large geographical areas. Such distribution networks are a complex networked collection of circuits consisting of primary feeders, thousands of substations, hundreds of switching stations {{and thousands of}} overhead poles all linked via switches and cables. Unlike other utilities, electricity distribution circuits are static in position but dynamic in power and flow direction. Therefore, to a control engineer, {{it is not the}} geographical location of the device which is important but rather the status of the whole circuit or device and where it is feeding from and what it is feeding. A distribution network is normally drawn or digitized using a graphics package. Systems to process the required network operations are programmed to carry out many of the control centre operations such as adding new stations, retiring old stations, tracing the flow of a given circuit, isolating a station for maintenance, isolating a complete circuit for maintenance, redirecting the flow of electricity, Speed of display of these schematic diagrams and the speed by which the system responds to the commands to carry out the switching operations and then redrawing the circuits correctly and showing the correct status of switches and circuits is of vital importance. Schematically drawn networks coupled with a relational database can be very slow to respond to the <b>emergency</b> <b>switching</b> requirements.

40|$|The paper completes {{ascertainment}} of electrical-supply scheme {{reliability for}} the auxiliaries {{of a nuclear}} power plant. Thereat the author considers the system behavior during the block normal operation, carrying out current maintenance, and capital repairs in combination with initiating events. The initiating events for reactors include complete blackout, i. e. the loss of outside power supply (normal and reserve); <b>emergency</b> <b>switching</b> one of the working turbogenerators; momentary dumping the normal rating {{to the level of}} auxiliaries with seating the cutout valve of one turbo-generator. The combination of any initiating event with the repairing mode in case of one of the system elements failure should not lead to blackout occurrence of more than one system of the reliable power supply. This requirement rests content {{with the help of the}} reliable power supply system self-dependence (electrical and functional) and the emergency power-supply operational autonomy (diesel generator and accumulator batteries). The reliability indicators of the power supply system for the nuclear power plant auxiliaries are the conditional probabilities of conjoined blackout of one, two, and three sections of the reliable power supply conditional upon an initiating event emerging and the blackout of one, two, and three reliable power-supply sections under the normal operational mode. Furthermore, they also are the blackout periodicity of one and conjointly two, three, and four sections of normal operation under the block normal operational mode. It is established that the blackout of one bus section of normal operation and one section of reliable power-supply system of the auxiliaries that does not lead to complete blackout of the plant auxiliaries may occur once in three years. The probability of simultaneous power failure of two or three normal-operation sections and of two reliable power-supply sections during the power plant service life is unlikely. </p...|$|R
