40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{forces on}} small {{particles in the}} solar system are examined, and the resulting orbital evolution of interplanetary and circumplanetary dust is considered. An expression is derived for the effects of radiation pressure and Poynting-Robertson drag on small, spherical particles using the energy and momentum transformation laws of special relativity, and numerical examples are presented to illustrate that radiation pressure and Poynting-Robertson drag are only important for particles within a narrow size range. The orbital consequences of these radiation forces are considered both for heliocentric and planetocentric orbiting particles, and the coupling between particle sizes and dynamics is discussed. A qualitative derivation is presented for the <b>differential</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect,</b> which is due to the differential Doppler shifting of radiation from approaching and receding solar hemispheres, and the Yarkovsky effect, which is important for rotating meter-to kilometer-sized particles, is briefly described...|$|E
40|$|Data {{from several}} {{different}} observation techniques {{are used to}} estimate the columnar electron content of the plasmasphere. The estimate {{is based upon the}} subtraction of the ionospheric electron content from the total content along the radio path from ground to the geostationary satellite ATS- 6. The Radio Beacon Experiment on this satellite allows a very accurate determination of the total electron content up to the height of the satellite. For the ionospheric electron content (ground to appr. 2000 km) the following techniques are used: (1) Faraday effect on the ATS- 6 signals, (2) <b>differential</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> on the signals of the low-orbiting NNSS satellites, (3) combination of bottomside and topside ionograms, and (4) extrapolation of bottomside ionograms. It is shown that the combination of group delay and Faraday effect data on the ATS- 6 RBE signals provide the most reliable estimates of the columnar electron content of the plasmasphere. Data from low-orbiting satellites support this conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{and analysis of}} blazar sources provide strong evidence for (i) the presence of significant periodicities in their lightcurves and (ii) the occurrence of helical trajectories in their radio jets. In scenarios, where the periodicity is caused by <b>differential</b> <b>Doppler</b> boosting <b>effects</b> along a helical jet path, both of these facts may be naturally tied together. Here we discuss four possible driving mechanisms for the occurrence of helical trajectories: orbital motion in a binary system, Newtonian-driven jet precession, internal jet rotation and motion along a global helical magnetic field. We point out that for non-ballistic helical motion the observed period may appear strongly shortened due to classical travel time effects. Finally, the possible relevance of the above mentioned driving mechanisms is discussed for Mkn~ 501, OJ 287 and AO 0235 + 16.

40|$|Periodicities in blazar light curves may {{be related}} to helical trajectories in extragalactic radio jets by <b>differential</b> <b>Doppler</b> {{boosting}} <b>effects.</b> We consider ballistic and non-ballistic (i. e., radial) trajectories and discuss three possible periodic driving mechanisms for the origin of helical jet paths, namely, orbital motion in a binary black hole system (BBHS), jet precession, and intrinsic jet rotation. It is shown that precessional-driven ballistic motion is unlikely to result in observable periods of less than several tens of years. We demonstrate that for non-ballistic helical motion the observed period is generally strongly shortened relative to the real physical driving period because of light-travel time effects. Internal jet rotation may thus account for observed periods P_ obs≤ 10 days. Periodicity due to orbital-driven (non-ballistic) helical motion, on the other hand, is usually constrained to periods of P_ obs≥ 10 days, while Newtonian-driven precession is unlikely to be responsible for periodicity on a timescale P_ obs≤ 100 days but may well be associated with periods of P_ obs≥ 1 yr.

40|$|International audienceThis {{communication}} aims at presenting an algorithm that estimates {{location and}} speed vector of a dolphin emitting a whistle. This algorithm requires a single hydrophone and applies when direct, bottom-reflected and surface-reflected paths are available. It {{is well known}} that multipath echoes make it possible to locate a source with a single hydrophone. This applies to both clicks and whistles. For moving sources, whistles instantaneous frequency laws are scaled by Doppler effect which is a contraction for approaching sources or an expansion for receding sources. The different propagation times and Doppler effects for the different paths are exploited to estimate source location and speed vector. First, we propose to explain how Doppler affects differently the echoes of an emitted whistle. Then we demonstrate how differential Doppler effects existing between bottom-reflected (resp. surface-reflected) and direct paths are used to estimate source speed. Finally, we propose an algorithm that extracts the <b>differential</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> based on the use of time-frequency tools such as high-order ambiguity functions, warping operators and wide-band ambiguity functions. Our algorithm is successfully applied and validated on simulated data, tank measurements and real whistles of common dolphins recorded in Bay of Biscay, France...|$|E

We demonstrate that the rotational <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> in LHMs is unreversed, which is {{significantly different from the}} linear <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect.</b> The physics underlying this intriguing effect is the combined contributions of negative phase velocity and inverse screw of wave-front. In the normal dispersion region, the rotational <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> induces a upstream energy flow but a downstream momentum flow.

40|$|A fault {{diagnosis}} strategy {{based on the}} wayside acoustic monitoring technique is investigated for locomotive bearing {{fault diagnosis}}. Inspired by the transient modeling analysis method based on correlation filtering analysis, a so-called Parametric-Mother-Doppler-Wavelet (PMDW) is constructed with six parameters, including a center characteristic frequency and five kinematic model parameters. A <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> eliminator containing a PMDW generator, a correlation filtering analysis module, and a signal resampler is invented to eliminate the <b>Doppler</b> <b>effect</b> embedded in the acoustic signal of the recorded bearing.
