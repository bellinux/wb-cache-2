While one battalion seized the bridge, the other two battalions would establish defensive positions to the north and south. They would then hold the bridge until relieved by the advance of XIII Corps, part of the Eighth Army which <b>had</b> <b>landed</b> on the south eastern coast three days previously.|$|E
