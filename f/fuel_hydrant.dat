50|$|In 2014, a <b>fuel</b> <b>hydrant</b> {{system and}} an {{aircraft}} refueling terminal were completed. The <b>fuel</b> <b>hydrant</b> system {{was built by}} China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) {{at a cost of}} USD$7 million, while the refueling terminal was constructed by a Dubai-based construction company at a cost of USD$31 million. Previously, fuel had to be transported by bowser from tanks at Hambantota Port, sometimes resulting in flight delays.|$|E
50|$|A hydrant coupler {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} fueling equipment which opens and allows fuel to flow through the hydrant cart into the aircraft. A hydrant coupler needs 60lbs of air pressure to open up the pit valve to allow the flow of <b>fuel.</b> <b>Hydrant</b> couplers run off a pressure fueling system consisting of fuel and air pressure.|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{impacts of}} {{airports}} {{are similar to}} those of many industries, though their operations expand over a very large area. Most international impact assessment studies and environmental management programmes have been giving less focus on the impacts to soil and groundwater than desirable. This may be the result of the large attention given to air and noise pollution, relegating other environmental descriptors to a second role, even when the first are comparatively less relevant. One reason that contributes to such ‘‘biased’’ evaluation is the lack of systematic information about impacts to soil and groundwater from airport activities, something the present study intends to help correct. Results presented here include the review of over seven hundred documents and online databases, with the objective of obtaining the following information to support environmental studies: (i) which operations are responsible for chemical releases?; (ii) where are these releases located?; (iii) which contaminants of concern are released?; (iv) what are the associated environmental risks? Results showed that the main impacts occur as a result of fuel storage, stormwater runoff and drainage systems, <b>fuel</b> <b>hydrant</b> systems, fuel transport and refuelling, atmospheric deposition, rescue and fire fighting training areas, winter operations, electrical substations, storage of chemical products by airport owners or tenants, and maintenance of green areas. A new method for ranking environmental risks of organic substances, based on chemical properties, is proposed and applied. Results show that the contaminants with the highest risks are the perfluorochemicals, benzene, trichloroethylene and CCl 4...|$|E
50|$|Cavotec's airport {{fuelling}} systems include Pantographs, Loading Arms, High Point / Low Point Pit Assembly pits, Commercial <b>Fuel</b> <b>Hydrants,</b> Vault Access Pit Covers and Fuel Isolation Valve Pit Assembly.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{goal of the}} program is to install underground <b>fuel</b> <b>hydrants</b> at airports. These would eliminate the need for fuel trucks, an important source of mobile emissions. The Voluntary Airport Low Emission Program was established under the Vision 100 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act of 2003.|$|R
50|$|Among {{other aspects}} of the project, when completed, are the design of remote {{aircraft}} stands complete with airfield ground lighting and <b>hydrant</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Skytanking {{provides}} {{a full range}} of aviation fuelling services. The company services around 1.4 million aircraft a year, with annual throughput exceeding 15 billion cubic metres of jet fuel (as at: June 2017). Besides into-plane fuelling, its range of services also covers the operation of aviation <b>fuel</b> storage and <b>hydrant</b> systems, as well as the planning, financing and construction of these facilities. Its customers include airlines, airports, and oil companies. Skytanking is represented at 69 airports in 13 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa (as at: June 2017).|$|R
