Curs acadèmic 2013 - 2014 The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that teaching English through literature in the EFL classroom can work. But the most interesting part is that it is addressed to a specific group of students that is serving <b>judicial</b> <b>admission</b> measures, so they have a lack of motivation towards school, and the teachers’ work in this centre is more complicated. For this reason, I have created a didactic unit based on the novel Jane Eyre, because they can feel identified with some of the episodes that the main character experiences in her life. Furthermore, as Jane Eyre is a biography, it is also a point in favour, due to their interest in this kind of novels. Something really surprising for me, when I was doing my internship, was the fact that some of the students read Jane Eyre as a freereading option at the beginning of the academic course. Moreover, I have chosen a graded book because it can motivate them to continue reading a novel that they can understand and follow, due to its easy vocabulary and grammar constructions that are adapted to them. The kind of activities that we can find in the didactic unit are dynamic and easy to complete, because there is not a unique correct answer, so they can be creative and express their own ideas and opinions towards the novel. These are divided into three different sections: pre-reading activities, while-reading activities and post-reading activities. They foster the improvement of the four main communicative skills which are the reading, speaking, listening and writing. The results of the implementation are explained at the end of the paper, so we will see how students worked and if we can confirm the main points that are defended here. Finally, it is important to mention, that this didactic unit will be used as a complement to their daily English lessons, and not as an alternative to them...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} a prosecutor’s {{development of new}} and bizarre theories, particularly in cases involving confession evidence, to explain away exculpatory DNA results. In Juan Rivera’s case, the prosecutor’s theory for why sperm found inside the 11 -year-old victim {{on the day she}} was murdered did not belong to Rivera was that she had sex with someone before Rivera came along and raped (but did not ejaculate) and murdered her. The unnamed-lover theory is used so often by prosecutors that it has a moniker: “the unindicted co-ejaculator. ” In the case of the Dixmoor Five, teenagers convicted of the rape and murder of a 14 -year-old girl were exonerated after DNA from semen found on the victim’s body was linked to a man with a lengthy record of sexual assault and armed robbery. However, the state’s attorney accepted the possibility that the convicted rapist wandered past an open field and had sex with the deceased 14 -year-old victim as a means of validating the teenagers’ confessions. The article explores strategies to prevent cases like Rivera’s, that are based on a prosecutor’s logic-defying theory of guilt, from moving forward. Although prosecutors enjoy largely unfettered discretion, they must account for their actions at different stages of the criminal proceedings before bringing cases to trial. During the investigation phase, recording interrogations provides a measure of prosecutorial accountability. During the charging phase, acknowledging confirmation bias will guard against decisions to proceed in the face of contradictory exculpatory evidence. Potential judicial solutions, such as the doctrines of judicial estoppel and <b>judicial</b> <b>admission</b> and the proposed reform of criminal summary judgment, are advanced as additional means of preventing a case based upon a logicdefying theory of guilt from proceeding to trial. This article examines the question of prosecutorial accountability through the lens of Juan Rivera’s case. Rivera spent almost twenty years in prison and underwent three trials before a court vacated his conviction, holding that the prosecutor’s theory of guilt, in the face of exculpatory DNA results, was “unreasonable” and “improbable. ...|$|E
