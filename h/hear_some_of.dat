25|$|Generally in February {{through to}} April, a parade and concert series {{inspired}} by New Orleans' Fat Tuesday party is held within Universal Studios Florida. The event features merchandise {{especially for the}} celebration and is held usually on Friday and Saturday nights. Every event night guests will <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Louisiana's bands performing blues, and Zydeco. An after party occurs in the French Quarter at Universal CityWalk. It is included with park admission.|$|E
25|$|On 24 June 1965, Jarry Park {{hosted the}} great show on Saint John Baptiste Day, (La Saint-Jean Baptiste), the French-Canadian annual celebration day. Since 1977 {{it is now}} officially called Quebec's National Holiday, (La fête {{nationale}} du Québec). That year, Jarry Park was chosen to present the most important event of the celebrations. 40,000 people came to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Québec's most acclaimed singers; namely Pauline Julien, Clémence Desrochers, Jean-Pierre Ferland, Christine Charbonneau, Hervé Brousseau, Les Cailloux, Pierre Calvé, Renée Claude et Pierre Létourneau.|$|E
25|$|In August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair {{took place}} in Bethel, New York, which for many, {{exemplified}} the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Carlos Santana, Sly & The Family Stone, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred {{in other parts of}} the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.|$|E
50|$|Many of the comedic {{elements}} of the show are recurrent and understandable at first <b>hearing.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> the show's jokes have stemmed from topical discussions, and others are based on malapropisms that have occurred on the show.|$|R
50|$|It took {{almost a}} year before the band started <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> their songs played on air by one or two radion {{stations}} in the city. This gave the band a new impetus to be more aggressive in what they were doing.|$|R

500|$|Jones {{had little}} {{difficulty}} in persuading his boss, Roy Featherstone, and Ron White, authoriser of EMI recordings, to allow Barrett to record {{with the company}} again. In April 1969, the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material, while reworking the 1968 recordings. Jones would later explain the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again: [...] "What was decided was {{to see what was}} the strength of Syd's new material, and plan accordingly. If it worked, then, O.K. we'd do an album. If not, we'd call it a day..." [...] In a meeting at Barrett's flat in Earls Court, unsure of Jenner's production technique, Jones asked to <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the previous year's tapes; Barrett played him [...] "Swan Lee", [...] "Late Night", [...] "Rhamadam", [...] "Lanky (Parts One and Two)" [...] and [...] "Golden Hair". Of these, [...] "Swan Lee" [...] had no vocals, but Jones saw potential in the song; [...] "Late Night" [...] did have vocals and, Jones remarked, [...] "a certain charm"; while [...] "Golden Hair" [...] was [...] "great". After the playbacks, Barrett performed several songs on guitar for Jones: [...] "Opel" [...] and [...] "Clowns and Jugglers" [...] (both attempted during the sessions with Peter Jenner), and the newly written [...] "Terrapin" [...] and [...] "Love You".|$|E
2500|$|Several of Desmond's lines, such as, [...] "All right Mr. DeMille, I'm {{ready for}} my close-up," [...] and [...] "I am big, it's the {{pictures}} that got small!" [...] are often quoted. Much of the film's wit is delivered through Norma Desmond's deadpan comments, which are often followed by sarcastic retorts from Gillis. Desmond appears to not <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these comments, as she is absorbed by her own thoughts and in denial, and so some of Gillis's lines are heard only by the audience, with Wilder blurring {{the line between the}} events and Gillis's narration. Gillis's response to Desmond's cry that [...] "the pictures got small" [...] is a muttered reply, [...] "I knew something was wrong with them". Wilder often varies the structure, with Desmond taking Gillis's comments seriously and replying in kind. For example, when the two discuss the overwrought script Desmond has been working on, Gillis observes, [...] "They'll love it in Pomona." [...] "They'll love it everyplace," [...] replies Desmond firmly.|$|E
2500|$|Thirdly, {{the writing}} {{sessions}} {{were affected by}} Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled {{with it in the}} past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, [...] "Where Do We Go From Here" [...] addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track [...] "God Damn Me" [...] was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to wake him up {{to make sure he was}} still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating [...] "I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe when I <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> it because a lot of the lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There’s a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had been a little bit more clear headed." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{not unusual}} for an {{electronics}} student, on <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the specs of these devices, to conclude that they could not have been capable of reproducing speech. Yet they do, and with a sound that can not be mistaken for anything else.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014 Visconti {{produced}} and arranged several tracks on Marc Almond's album The Dancing Marquis. Almond {{has wanted to}} work with Visconti since <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Visconti's earliest production work with T-Rex and David Bowie, stating [...] "It was a dream to work with Tony".|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] he {{said with}} a moan. [...] "Each step now is {{carrying}} us lower. I remember <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the old hands say the abandoned drifts were a hundred feet or so farther down the hill. We must be considerably below the deepest shaft." ...|$|R

2500|$|In the Gospel of Luke, Herod Antipas <b>hears</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the stories}} {{surrounding}} Jesus Christ. Some tell Herod that Jesus is John the Baptist (whom Herod had executed) [...] {{come back to}} life. Others tell him that Jesus is Elijah. Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.|$|R
50|$|During Fry's time in Italy he was {{introduced}} to the record producer Vincenzo Micocci. On <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Fry's songs, Micocci signed him to record label IT Dischi, a subsidiary of RCA. Dreaming with Alice was recorded by Fry and a band of session musicians in Rome over a three-day period in the summer of 1971. Following the recording session Fry toured Italy supporting singer Lucio Dalla.|$|R

50|$|No reason {{has ever}} been given for the guilty plea, and despite giving it, Knight still refused to accept {{responsibility}} for her actions. At the sentencing hearing, Knight's lawyers requested that Knight be excused to avoid <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the facts, but the application was refused. When Timothy Lyons took the stand and described the skinning and decapitation, Knight became hysterical and had to be sedated.|$|R

50|$|A tone of 226 Hz is {{generated}} by the tympanometer into the ear canal, where the sound strikes the tympanic membrane, causing vibration of the middle ear, which in turn results in the conscious perception <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> this sound is reflected back and {{picked up by the}} instrument. Most middle ear problems result in stiffening of the middle ear, which causes more of the sound to be reflected back.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{charge was}} brought to trial separately. At {{the trial of the}} first charge in 1973, Morgentaler was defended by Claude-Armand Sheppard. Sheppard {{presented}} the [...] "defence of necessity"—as a doctor, Morgentaler had a duty to safeguard the life and health of the women who came to him for abortions, which outweighed his duty to obey the law. After <b>hearing</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> those women as witnesses, the jury acquitted him.|$|R
