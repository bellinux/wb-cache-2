40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{reliability}} problems {{have become a}} critical subject in power modules. Understanding design weakness and failure mechanisms of thick wire bond are two critical steps in managing the risk of wire bond <b>heel</b> <b>crack</b> which is the topic of this thesis. Although this thesis does not target {{a specific type of}} power modules, we note that thick wire bond <b>heel</b> <b>crack</b> failures occur in Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). In fact, our aim is to understand failure mechanism in 300 μm thick wire bonds with different geometries and materials. Since these wires experience harsh environmental conditions and high load transients, the wires undergo repetitive flexural movement which causes <b>heel</b> <b>crack</b> due to fatigue. For the purpose of understanding this failure mechanism, two experimental setups are built and utilized. The first experimental setup loads the wires using constant currents and observes the response using a scanning laser vibrometer to measure the displacement. The second experimental setup applies repetitive prescribed displacement to the first foot of the wire and detects fatigue failure using a Wheatstone bridge. It is realized that wires have different displacement property depending on their geometry and material. Maximum displacements are observed for Al-H 11 instead of CuCorAl and PowerCu...|$|E

40|$|Wire bonding {{is still}} the {{dominant}} interconnection technology for power semiconductors in power modules, e. g. for automotive or photovoltaic applications. In the past, many research activities {{have occurred in the}} field of reliability of power modules, where the life time of the complete module is affected by bond wire lift offs, <b>heel</b> <b>cracks</b> and other failures. Less effort was spent for investigating the degradation process at the wire bond itself. This paper addresses a new approach and focuses on the investigation of the cracks in the interface region between the die and the wire by using the shear test. These cracks form after several thousand temperature swings due to CTE mismatch and ultimately lead to wire bond lift off. New results of active power cycling with different temperature amplitudes and medium temperatures will be discussed. Shear tests have been carried out in regular intervals to monitor the degradation of the 400 m wire bonds on power MOS-FETs. It wa s found out that the rate of the shear force reduction was mostly dependent on the amplitude of the temperature cycling. A significant effect of different medium temperatures could not be identified. These results will {{contribute to the development of}} an enhanced life time model for heavy wire bonds on power semiconductors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{reliable}} {{performance of}} power electronic modules {{has been a}} concern for many years due to their increased use in applications which demand high availability and longer lifetimes. Thick Al wire bonding is a key technique for providing interconnections in power electronic modules. Today, wire bond lift-off and <b>heel</b> <b>cracking</b> are often considered the most lifetime limiting factors of power electronic modules {{as a result of}} cyclic thermomechanical stresses. Therefore, it is important for power electronic packaging manufacturers to address this issue at the design stage and on the manufacturing line. Techniques for the non-destructive, real-time evaluation and control of wire bond quality have been proposed to detect defects in manufacture and predict reliability prior to in-service exposure. This approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of lifetime prediction for the manufactured product. In this thesis, a non-destructive technique for detecting bond quality by the application of a semi-supervised classification algorithm to process signals obtained from an ultrasonic generator is presented. Experimental tests verified that the classification method is capable of accurately predicting bond quality, indicated by bonded area as measured by X-ray tomography. Samples classified during bonding were subjected to both passive and active cycling and the distribution of bond life amongst the different classes analysed. It is demonstrated that the as-bonded quality classification is closely correlated with cycling life and can therefore be used as a non-destructive tool for monitoring bond quality and predicting useful service life...|$|R
40|$|The rise of 'surf style' in {{mainstream}} fashion in the 1990 s made enormous profits for businesses like Quiksilver and Billabong which had begun life as specialist sportswear suppliers to a niche market. Since then the look has become ubiquitous, and now, {{just as the}} wearing of military style {{is not confined to}} the armed forces, 'surf style' is worn {{in and out of the}} water by surfers and non-surfers alike. But this is a look which can not be reduced to the superficial use of hibiscus flower motifs and surf-related slogans: it is typified by the surfing body. The surfing body, clothed in brands that convey subcultural authenticity or naked and wearing only sun bleached hair or tribal tattoos came into being in the late 1980 s. Against a background of economic growth in the West, a new youth culture emerged. Working visas to the antipodes for under 26 s were available along with, in the UK, a student grants and readily available casual work at home to finance the trip and on arriving, to venture into the Pacific Rim. The 1990 s gap year phenomenon was born, and with it, the surfing body. <b>Heels</b> <b>cracked</b> by salt water and sandals, hair knotted by the sea, the surfing body signified conspicuous leisure as clearly as the crinoline-wearing bourgeois wife's of the 19 th century. No wonder then that products aimed at creating its simulacra in chilly buttoned-up Britain were so eagerly marketed and consumed. This paper will explore some of the issues around social class and aspiration inherent in the pursuit of the surfing body, examining the gendered consumption of a fashionable look which embodies both activity and idleness...|$|R

40|$|Lameness {{has been}} {{incorrectly}} labeled as a “cow {{and not a}} sow” concern, and this has possibly arisen due {{to the majority of}} sows being far more stationary over their productive lifetime compared to dairy cows. Therefore, the objectives of this study were record hoof lesion frequency, proportion, type and severity from sows housed in gestation stalls during a one month period. A total of 30 sows were used (Yorkshire [n = 3], Duroc [n = 14] and Yorkshire x Duroc crosses [n = 13]). All sows were individually housed in stalls that had concrete flooring and manure fell into a holding pit. Sows were feed at 0600 h once a day a commercially available ground feed. Caretakers observed all sows twice daily, at 0600 h and 1600 h. Hoof lesion and severity was scored (medial and lateral toes, dew claws and the sole) and recorded once a week by a single observer using the FeetFirst lesion scoring guide produced by the FeetFirst™ Team. Lesion severity was scored as, one (mild), two (moderate) and three (severe) which occurred on any anatomical area of the hoof (toes, dew claw, heel and sole). Lesion severity scores was reported numerically (actual number of hooves involved) and presented as a proportion {{of the total number of}} hooves in the study. Lesion type was defined as toe growth, dew claw, heel overgrowth and erosion, <b>heel</b> sole <b>crack,</b> white line, cracked wall horizontal and cracked wall vertical (FeetFirst™ Team, 2009).

50|$|Mahmoud reappeared in the St. James's Palace Stakes {{over one}} mile at Royal Ascot {{in which he}} was beaten five lengths by Rhodes Scholar, a colt who had been {{withdrawn}} from the Derby on account of the hard ground. No excuse was offered by Mahmoud's connections for his defeat, although some observers felt that he had not fully recovered from his exertions at Epsom. At Newmarket two weeks later, the Derby form did receive a boost however, when Taj Akbar defeated the American Triple Crown winner Omaha in the Princess of Wales's Stakes. After his run at Ascot Mahmoud had problems with a <b>cracked</b> <b>heel</b> which kept him off the racecourse until the autumn. In September he ran in the third leg of the English Triple Crown, the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster. He looked a likely winner early in the straight but faded in the closing stages of the mile and three quarter race and finished third behind the 20/1 outsider Boswell, beaten three and three-quarter lengths.

60|$|These words {{produced}} {{the same effect}} upon Jonathan as though a douche of cold water had suddenly been flung over him. He began instantly to struggle to free himself, and that with a frantic and vehement violence begotten at once of terror and despair. So prodigious were his efforts that more than once he had nearly torn himself free, but still the powerful arms of his captor held him as in a vise of iron. Meantime, our hero's assailant made frequent though ineffectual attempts to thrust a hand into the breeches' pocket where the ivory ball was hidden, swearing the while under his breath with a terrifying and monstrous string of oaths. At last, finding himself foiled in every such attempt, and losing all patience at the struggles of his victim, he endeavored to lift Jonathan off of his feet, as though to dash him bodily upon the ground. In this he would doubtless have succeeded had he not caught his <b>heel</b> in the <b>crack</b> of a loose board of the wharf. Instantly they both fell, violently prostrate, the captain beneath and Jonathan above him, though still encircled in his iron embrace. Our hero felt {{the back of his}} head strike violently upon the flat face of the other, and he heard the captain's skull sound with a terrific crack like that of a breaking egg upon some post or billet of wood, against which he must have struck. In their frantic struggles they had approached extremely near the edge of the wharf, so that the next instant, with an enormous and thunderous splash, Jonathan found himself plunged into the waters of the harbor, and the arms of his assailant loosened from about his body.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} floor type on sow welfare with particular focus on lameness, claw lesions (CL), and injuries. The study used 164 gilts housed in groups of 8 from AI to 110 d of pregnancy in pens with concrete (n = 84) slatted floor left uncovered or covered by 10 -mm rubber slat mats (n = 80) through 2 parities. Lameness (0 = normal to 5 = severe), limb (0 = normal to 6 = severe) and body (0 = normal to 5 = severe) lesions, and manure on the body (MOB; score 0 to 2) were recorded at AI, 24 to 72 h postmixing, between 50 and 70 d of pregnancy, and 2 wk before farrowing. Claw lesions (score 0 = normal to 3 = severe) were recorded at AI and between 50 and 70 d of pregnancy. The dirtiness and wetness of the floors was scored weekly (score 0 = clean to 4 = > 75 % of the pen soiled/wet). Data from {{the first and second}} parities were analyzed separately. Sows were categorized as nonlame (score = 2). Median (M-e) scores were calculated for CL and body and limb lesions and were classified as {{less than or equal to}} the median or greater than the median lesion scores. Sows on rubber slat mats had a reduced risk of lameness during both parities (P < 0. 01) compared with sows on concrete. They also had an increased risk of scores greater than the median for toe overgrowth (Me = 2 and Me = 3 in the first and second parity, respectively) and <b>heel</b> sole <b>crack</b> (HSC; M-e = 3) during both parities (P < 0. 01) and for cracks in the wall (CW; M-e = 4) and white line damage (WL; M-e = 4; P < 0. 01) in the first and second parity, respectively. There was a reduced risk of lameness in sows with scores greater than the median for HSC (P = 0. 05) in the first parity and WL (M-e = 3; P < 0. 01) and CW (Me = 3; P < 0. 05) in the second parity. Wounds (M-e = 3) and severe lesions (M-e = 0) on the limbs with scores greater than the median were associated with an increased risk of lameness (P < 0. 01) in the first and second parity, respectively. Sows on rubber slat mats had a reduced risk of scores greater than the median for swellings (M-e = 4) and wounds (P < 0. 01) during both parities. Pens with rubber slat mats were dirtier than uncovered pens (P < 0. 01); however, there was no association between MOB and flooring type. There was also no association between body lesion score and flooring type. In this study, CL were not associated with an increased risk of lameness. Therefore, even though rubber slat mats were associated with an increased risk of CL, they improved the welfare of group housed sows by reducing the risk of lameness and limb lesions...|$|R
