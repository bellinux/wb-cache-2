40|$|This {{investigation}} examined two hypotheses {{derived from}} Schneirla's (1965) theory; (1) the neonatal avis is under proximal stimulus control, and tactile stimulation should, therefore, facilitate the following response, (2) {{the transition from}} proximal to distance stimulus control should be facilitated when proximal stimulation occurs in conjunction with distance stimulation of the embryo. Two experiments indicated that tactile contact facilitated both the initiation and maintenance of the following response in young Coturnix. Another set of experiments was designed to investigate the level of embryonic activity prior to or after two types of intraovular mechanical stimulation, <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> or shaking. The results indicated that Leghorn chicken embryos, on days 13 through 16 of incubation, made a geotaxic response to <b>egg</b> <b>rotation,</b> and that frequency and amplitude of embryonic movements increased after both types of mechanical stimulation. Amplitude and frequency increased {{to a greater extent}} after <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> than after egg shaking. The last set of experiments paired auditory and mechanical stimulation of the embryo and assessed later effects of this stimulation on neonatal following. Murre embryos, subjected to embryonic auditory stimulation after <b>egg</b> <b>rotation,</b> exhibited stronger following as neonates than when this stimulation was given prior to rotation. When following scores were equated for different levels of activity between subjects, following was still stronger in the stimulation after rotation condition. Another experiment using chicken embryos, indicated that the effect of pairing an auditory stimulus with two types of mechanical stimulation was to enhance following in the presence of this auditory stimulus regardless of which type of mechanical stimulation occurred, or when the auditory stimulation occurred. The results of these experiments are interpreted as being consistent with Schneirla's hypothesis that the early approach responses of the neonate avis are directed by proximal stimulation...|$|E

30|$|A simple glass UV {{irradiation}} chamber was designed with four UV-C, 15 -W germicidal lamps (Philips, Amsterdam, Holland). Two lamps on the dorsal side and {{two on the}} ventral side were fixed {{at a distance of}} 27 [*]cm from the center, fine threads passed across the center where the egg trays were placed for irradiation. The threads were connected to a vortex mixture in order to create vibration for the <b>egg</b> <b>rotation.</b> The lamps were switched on for half an hour before the experiment to stabilize the energy of the UV rays (Onozato and Yamaha [1983]). Egg tray surface was measured with a UV meter (Ultra-Violet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA, USA) for dosage calculations.|$|E
40|$|SummaryWhole-tissue {{rotations}} {{have recently}} been recognized as a widespread morphogenetic process important for tissue elongation [1 – 4]. In Drosophila ovaries, elongation of the egg chamber involves a global rotation of the follicle epithelium along the anterior-posterior axis [5]. Individual egg chambers rotate either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction; however, how the symmetry of egg chambers is broken to allow rotation remains unknown. Here we show that at the basal side of follicle cells, microtubules are preferentially aligned perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis of the egg chamber. Microtubule depolymerization stalls <b>egg</b> chamber <b>rotation</b> and <b>egg</b> chamber elongation. The preferential alignment of microtubules and <b>egg</b> chamber <b>rotation</b> depend on the atypical cadherin Fat 2 and the planar polarized Fat 2 localization depends on intact microtubules. Moreover, by tracking microtubule plus-end growth in vivo using EB 1 ::GFP, we find that microtubules are highly polarized in {{the plane of the}} follicle epithelium. Polarization of microtubules precedes the onset of <b>egg</b> chamber <b>rotation</b> and predicts the direction of rotation. Our data suggest a feedback amplification mechanism between Fat 2 localization and microtubule polarity involved in breaking symmetry and directing <b>egg</b> chamber <b>rotation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Global tissue {{rotation}} {{was proposed}} as a morphogenetic mechanism controlling tissue elongation. In Drosophila ovaries, global tissue <b>rotation</b> of <b>egg</b> chambers coincides with egg chamber elongation. <b>Egg</b> chamber <b>rotation</b> was put forward to result in circumferential alignment of extracellular fibers. These fibers serve as molecular corsets to restrain growth of egg chambers {{perpendicular to the}} anteroposterior axis, thereby leading to the preferential egg chamber elongation along this axis. The atypical cadherin Fat 2 is required for <b>egg</b> chamber elongation, <b>rotation,</b> and the circumferential alignment of extracellular fibers. Here, we have generated a truncated form of Fat 2 that lacks the entire intracellular region. fat 2 mutant egg chambers expressing this truncated protein fail to rotate yet display normal extracellular fiber alignment and properly elongate. Our data suggest that global tissue rotation, even though coinciding with tissue elongation, is not a necessary prerequisite for elongation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims {{to design and}} develop a force air system of eggs {{incubator}} to incubate various types of eggs through a conveyor rotating system. This incubator was equipped with temperature and humidity sensors to measure and control the condition in the incubator. The incubator body was fabricated by stainless steel that provides less bacterial cross contamination between the incubator and the hatched chicks. It was designed to automatically change the parameters to the suitable condition to fit {{the various types of}} eggs. Direct current geared motor with low speed was used to rotate chained steel mat at the bottom and automatically change the position of egg to avoid the embryo sticks onto the shell. The entire elements were controlled by microcontroller devices to process the data from sensors and execute the control element of the machine. LabVIEW system was applied for temperature and humidity data recording. The evaluation of the shaft for egg turning system was analysed. The safety factor was determined at 5. 88 by manual calculation and 9. 6 by software simulation respectively. This indicated that the safety factor of the shaft has achieved the required standard which must be higher than 0. 99. The test run experiment on quail eggs, showed the stable temperature in incubation chamber of 37. 5 oC and 49. 86 % of relatively humidity (RH) were achieved. Therefore, the usage of conveyor instead of turning 45 o for <b>eggs</b> <b>rotation</b> system has shown the potential to replicate natural hatching and produce higher hatching rate of 94. 17 %. This machine also provides an accurate temperature and humidity condition in the incubator as well as less bacterial cross contamination...|$|R
30|$|Rotation of {{the eggs}} to expose the animal pole to {{radiation}} from the UV lamp yielded better results of complete genome inactivation. Bongers et al. ([1995]) stirred the eggs of C. gariepinus in a synthetic ovarian fluid while exposing under UV irradiation and reported high yields of androgenetic haploid. The stirring did not negatively interfere with hatching but increased {{the efficiency of the}} UV treatment. Similar results were obtained in common carp, C. carpio using the same method of <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> (Bongers et al. [1994]). Similarly, Arai et al. ([1995]) exposed M. anguillicaudatus eggs to a UV source from the upper and lower sides to get maximum exposure. The same methodology was adapted for H. fossilis by placing the eggs in HBSS which was more successful and also reduces the time of eggs in the UV chamber. This chamber has made it possible to achieve more effective inactivation by ensuring that all {{of the eggs}} received equal irradiation. Moreover, the experiment was carried out in a complete dark chamber, which in turn prevents the photoreactivation of the inactivated chromosomes.|$|E
40|$|Avian {{incubation}} {{is influenced}} by three basic factors: temperature, humidity, and <b>egg</b> <b>rotation.</b> The incubation temperature can significantly affect {{the development of an}} individual before hatching as well as after it. In natural conditions the incubation temperature is maintained by a parent trying to stabilize it at the developmental optimum. The parents must also provide their own needs during incubation, which results in temperature fluctuations. Although the incubation temperature is species-specific, its mean varies between 30 řC and 40 řC across all avian taxa. Lower temperatures but still within the optimum range cause reduced hatchability and prolongation of incubation period. Higher temperatures within the optimum range shorten incubation period and also reduce hatchability. Incubation temperature affects also the weight of an individual, its body proportions, metabolism, survival after hatching, and possibly also reproduction success (fitness). A detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which temperature affects the embryo development and its features is necessary, among others, to optimize incubation methods in artificial incubators.

40|$|Mongolia. These {{were later}} {{included}} in the ootaxon Gobioolithus major. Here we recognize the larger avian eggs of Sa-bath as a distinct ootaxon, Styloolithus sabathi, oogen. et oosp. nov. These eggs {{differ from those of}} Gobioolithus in being larger (70 by 32 mm) and more elongate. Microscopically, the shell bears a third layer (possible external zone) thicker than the mammillary layer and nearly as thick as the second layer (possible squamatic zone); the continuous layer (in-cluding layers two and three) to mammillary layer thickness ratio is 3. 1 : 1. Within the clutch, the tightly spaced eggs stand with their long axes steeply inclined. Adult remains are associated with two clutches, suggesting an incubation mode similar to that of troodontid maniraptorans, where adults sat atop largely buried eggs. S. sabathi provides evidence that relative egg size in Mesozoic non-ornithuromorph birds had increased markedly from the non-avian theropod condition in oviraptorids and troodontids, but had not yet reached the modern egg-adult proportions of Neornithes. Sediment-bound upright eggs appear common to Enantiornithes and more basal avians, suggesting that like non-avian theropods, these birds lacked chalazae, the chords of albumen allowing <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> in modern birds. Absence of this simple structure may have restricted these basal birds to ground nesting in areas with appropriate substrates and not permitted the type of nesting diversity found in Neornithes. Neornithes are the only Mesozoic clade of Dinosauria to nest completely free o...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{orientation}} of unfertilized eggs and the righting of eggs after grey crescent formation do not affect the axes, attention here is directed toward a comparative study of the initial rotation of the fertilized <b>egg,</b> the so-called <b>rotation</b> of orientation (R-of-O). The goal of the investigation {{is to determine the}} timing and dynamics of the R-of-O (as distinct from inversion rotations), to confirm prior observations, and to examine the influence of gravity compensation at periods that might be crucial. Gravity compensation for 1 hr during the R-of-O is found to yield fewer abnormalities. It is hypothesized that it changes the axes and that return to normal conditions permits regulation. Longer exposure is found to yield more abnormalities, perhaps by perturbing both the action of the aster and regulation...|$|R

Based on our measurements, {{in addition to the}} storage time, the pH value and storage temperature of liquid egg samples significantly affect (p < 0. 01) the viable cell count, but any inhibitory effect of preservatives (Na benzoate, K sorbate mixture) on microbial growth could not be clearly detected. Using the secondary polynomial model which was adjusted to our data, the measurements were defined very well; therefore it is hoped that our results will afford real help in estimation of the microbiological condition of liquid whole egg products which are preserved by various methods...|$|R
25|$|In Xenopus oocytes, β-catenin is {{initially}} equally localized to all {{regions of the}} egg, but it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. Fertilization of the <b>egg</b> causes a <b>rotation</b> of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the Frizzled and Dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally {{under the influence of}} Wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. It will eventually translocate to the nucleus to bind TCF3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. This signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. If this region is surgically removed from the embryo, gastrulation does not occur at all. β-Catenin also plays {{a crucial role in the}} induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates gastrulation. Inhibition of GSK-3 translation by injection of antisense mRNA may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. A similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: While the avian egg {{is formed}} in the oviduct, it acquires its shell {{membranes}} and shape in the isthmus and the calcified shell in the shell gland/uterus. However, in domestic species not all eggs are laid pointed end first, {{which led to the}} suggestion that <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> can occur in the oviduct prior to laying producing the blunt end first. However, not all studies were in agreement as to which end the pointed or the blunt-comes out first. Here, opportunistic observation of laying behaviour in domestic geese and ducks was carried out. 89. 47 % of the single yolked (SY) goose eggs were laid pointed end first. Goose age and dimensions did not influence the orientation of the egg, though the 12 blunt end first eggs were heavier and wider. 85. 52 % of the SY duck eggs were laid pointed end first. However, in double yolked (DY) duck eggs evidence was presented showing that the yolks closer to the airspace (blunt end) tend to be heavier (Salamon and Kent, 2013 a) and had higher levels of fertilization (Salamon and Kent, in press) consistent with the yolk at the blunt end of the egg being ovulated first and suggests that the blunt end of these large eggs was caudal in the oviduct during egg formation. Questions remain to be answered. Key words: Domestic goose, domestic duck, double yolked egg, egg laying, egg orientatio...|$|E
40|$|An unusual trace {{containing}} eggs of the 50 kg-plus theropod dinosaur, Troodon formosus, {{represents one of}} the best preserved dinosaur nests. This unique specimen (MOR 963) represents the actual nest structure and the direct product of Troodon behavior. The trace comes from the Campanian, Late Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana, and consists of a bowl-shaped depression with an internal area of similar to 1 m(2) surrounded by a distinct rim. A clutch of 24 tightly-placed eggs sat in the center and both nest and clutch show bilateral symmetry about a north-south axis. The trace occurs within a moderately well-developed micritic paleosol. A physically and chemically distinct mudstone covered the nest and represents overbank deposition. The nest protected the eggs by creating a suitable micro-environment during the lengthy egg-laying and incubation periods. Clutch and nest size, shape, and symmetry and low organic carbon of the overlying mudstone suggests brooding rather than incubation with vegetative cover, although the latter cannot be ruled out. The nest probably played no role in the post-hatching care of precocial Troodon young. Reproductive traits indicated by MOR 963 show that Troodon possessed plesiomorphies shared with crocodilians (some burial of eggs and lack of <b>egg</b> <b>rotation),</b> apomorphies shared with birds (open nests, exposed eggs, and incubation by a brooding adult), but also at least one unusual feature (steeply-inclined eggs) not found in either extant archosaur group.

40|$|The role of {{prenatal}} auditory stimulations in {{the development}} of the postnatal approach response in young nidifugous birds is well known. However most of the studies in this area treat these stimulations as passive events. The purpose of this experimental series is to establish a link between prenatal stimulations and concomitant modifications of embryonic environment (warming and egg turning). Chicks were thus tested in a situation in which they could choose between two pure tones, one of which was or was not prenatally associated with these two stimuli. All chicks of the four groups used here were artificially incubated at the laboratory. After hatching, one-day-old subjects were placed three times a day for 3 days in a situation of choice between two pure tones (HFT = 1000 Hz or LFT = 500 Hz, of 200 ms duration played back every 3 seconds). The operant response (crossing over one of the two active zones  allows the subject to hear either HFT or LFT. Number and duration of passings over each active zone were recorded. Results of the first control experiment showed that from the first test day naive chicks displayed a spontaneous preference for the low frequency pure tone. Another group of chicks was prenatally stimulated with HFT. This did not significantly affect the initial preference. In a third group, prenatal stimulations were repeatedly associated with modifications of the embryo's environment, i. e., warming and <b>egg</b> <b>rotation.</b> Results showed that the expression of the spontaneous preference for LFT was significantly delayed.   The fourth group confirmed the specificity of this effect. The contribution of such nonobvious prenatal learning to the development of the approach response is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCorticosterone, {{the main}} stress hormone in birds, mediates {{resource}} allocation, allowing animals {{to adjust their}} physiology and behaviour {{to changes in the}} environment. Incubation is a time and energy-consuming phase of the avian reproductive cycle. It may be terminated prematurely, when the parents' energy stores are depleted or when environmental conditions are severe. In this study, the effects of experimentally elevated baseline corticosterone levels on the parental investment of incubating male Adélie penguins were investigated. Incubation duration and reproductive success of 60 penguins were recorded. The clutches of some birds were replaced by dummy eggs, which recorded <b>egg</b> temperatures and <b>rotation</b> rates, enabling a detailed investigation of incubation behaviour. Corticosterone levels of treated birds were 2. 4 -fold higher than those of controls 18 days post treatment. Exogenous corticosterone triggered nest desertion in 61 % of the treated birds; consequently reducing reproductive success, indicating that corticosterone can reduce or disrupt parental investment. Regarding egg temperatures, hypothermic events became more frequent and more pronounced in treated birds, before these birds eventually abandoned their nest. The treatment also significantly decreased incubation temperatures by 1. 3 °C and lengthened the incubation period by 2. 1 days. However, number of chicks at hatching was similar among successful nests, regardless of treatment. Weather conditions appeared to be particularly important in determining the extent to which corticosterone levels affected the behaviour of penguins, as treated penguins were more sensitive to severe weather conditions. This underlines the importance of considering the interactions of organisms with their environment in studies of animal behaviour and ecophysiology...|$|R

The effects of ultraviolet light (UV) at 254 nm on indigenous eggshell surface aerobic bacteria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, gram positive bacteria as well as inoculated Salmonella typhimurium chicken and E. coli O 157 :H 7 were evaluated. Various UV application methods and exposure times were utilized. Initial experiments evaluated the effects of UV light combined with individual <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> on indigenous bacterial populations using a minimal UV intensity of 10. 8 mW/cm? and exposure time for the eggs was 0. 75 min and 9 revolutions. This experiment was replicated 5 times. Significant log?? reductions were reported in almost all trials with different media. Experiments were also conducted in order to determine an appropriate exposure time that would be applicable in a commercial environment. Eggs were inoculated with inoculums of marker strains of Salmonella typhimurium chicken and E. coli O 157 :H 7 and exposed to minimal UV intensities of 10 mW/cm? for either 2, 6, and 10 minutes using the flat treatment or 0. 75 min: 9 revolutions and 3 min: 9 revolutions using the roller treatment. Two replicates for each bacterial isolate were performed. Optimal exposure times based on log?? reduction results identified times of flat: 6 min and roller: 3 min: 9 revolutions. Two experiments were also conducted in the field using both UV application methods (minimum UV intensity of 10 mW/cm 2 for roller: 3 min: 9 revolutions; flat: 6. 5 min) in order to evaluate reductions of indigenous bacterial populations and several hatchery parameters. Significant reductions of bacterial populations, percent pipped eggs and cull poults were seen on the UV treated eggs compared to the control.

40|$|During {{the year}} before launch, female frogs will be tested every 3 months for the {{quantity}} and quality of eggs produced. Two weeks or more prior to launch, male and female frogs will be transported to the John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC). During the few weeks before launch, groups will be periodically tested for egg quality to assure that the frogs have adapted to the KSC laboratory environment. About 27 hours before launch, four females will be placed in a damp foam-lined box, called the Adult Frog Box (AFB), through which 100 cc/min of air wil be circulated. The AFB will be lowered into the Spacelab and loaded into the Frog Environmental Unit (FEU) during the final pre-launch preparations. A sperm suspension, for use in flight to fertilize the eggs, will also be prepared and loaded during the pre-launch period. The sperm suspension, together with a kit of syringes containing Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG), will be stored in a refrigerator aboard the shuttle until needed in flight. On the first day of flight, the AFB will be transferred from the FEU to the General Purpose Work Station (GPWS), which is a type of glove box specially designed to allow the crew to use chemicals and biological materials during the flight without contaminating the shuttle/Spacelab environment. Inside the GPWS the four adult frogs will be injected with the HCG hormone and returned to the FEU. Approximately 16 hours after injection, ovulation should have taken place and 15 to 20 eggs from each frog will be placed on each of two egg baskets and covered with sperm for 10 minutes. The egg baskets are inserted into acrylic egg chambers and 50 ml of 'pond water' (20 percent strength Modified Ringers solution (is added. One of the chambers from each frog will be placed on a centrifuge within the FEU and rotated to simulate normal terrestrial gravity (1 g). The remaining chambers are incubated under microgravity conditions within the FEU. Forty minutes after fertilization, the four chambers exposed to 1 g will be removed and observed within the GPWS using a dissecting microscope and camera system. On the basis of <b>egg</b> <b>rotation</b> and egg appearance, the 'best' and 'second best' frogs will be selected to contribute additional eggs. Using the two best frogs, 22 egg chambers will be loaded with eggs and fertilized. Eleven chambers wil be incubated at microgravity and eleven will be incubated on the centrifuge. At various times during the flight, chambers will be removed from the FEU and transferred to the GPWS where a formaldehyde-based fixative will be injected in order to preserve important developmental stages for in depth study following the flight. Five of the 22 chambers plus the eight fertilization test chambers will be returned to Earth with live tadpoles. The swimming behavior of these free swimming tadpoles will be examined within several hours of landing and some will be fixed for a detailed analysis of their inner ear, the otolity, the animals 'balance system. ' Lychakov and Vinikov reported an increase in otolith size in tadpoles that developed (but were not fertilized) in space. Live tadpoles from the SL-J flight will be raised through metamorphsis for studies of maturation including an analysis of the effects of space flight on their ability to produce normal progency. Following the flight, the fixed embryos will be serially sectioned and stained using procedures that were developed for this experiment. The embroys fixed at the 2 - 4 cell stage will be examined for the distribution of cytoplasmic contents, including the various classes of yolk platelets, and the location and shape of the cleavage furrows. The gastrulae will be assessed for the normality of the complex cellular rearrangements that constitute blastopore formation and involution, i. e., the differentiation of the embryo into its specialized body parts. Using a new procedure, the gastrulae will be bleached which will enable the initial sperm entry point (SEP) to be located. The correlation between the SEP and the dorsal lip of the blastopore will be determined. Under normal terrestrial conditions it was shown that the SEP typically is located on the side of the egg opposite the future dorsal side of the embryo. The neurulae will be examined for the normality and completeness of the neural plate and archenteron expansion. The tadpole stages will be used to study the allometry and morphology of the various organ systems...|$|E
