40|$|Arabidopsis was {{transformed}} with double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) constructs designed to silence three putative callose synthase genes: GLUCAN SYNTHASE–LIKE 5 (GSL 5), GSL 6, and GSL 11. Both wound callose and papillary callose were absent in lines transformed with GSL 5 dsRNAi {{and in a}} corresponding sequence-indexed GSL 5 T-DNA insertion line but were unaffected in GSL 6 and GSL 11 dsRNAi lines. These data provide strong genetic evidence that the GSL genes of higher plants encode proteins that are essential for callose formation. Deposition of callosic plugs, or papillae, at sites of fungal penetration is a widely recognized early response of host plants to microbial attack and has been implicated in impeding entry of the fungus. Depletion of callose from papillae in gsl 5 plants marginally enhanced the penetration of the <b>grass</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> fungus Blumeria graminis on the nonhost Arabidopsis. Paradoxically, the absence of callose in papillae or haustorial complexes correlated with the effective growth cessation of several normally virulent powdery mildew species and of Peronospora parasitica.

40|$|Different formae speciales of the <b>grass</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> fungus Blumeria graminis undergo basic-compatible or basic-incompatible (nonhost) {{interactions}} with barley. Background resistance in compatible interactions and nonhost resistance require common genetic and mechanistic elements of plant defense. To build resources for differential screening for genes that potentially distinguish a compatible from an incompatible interaction {{on the level}} of differential gene expression of the plant, we constructed eight dedicated cDNA libraries, established 13. 000 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences and designed DNA macroarrays. Using macroarrays based on cDNAs derived from epidermal peels of plants pretreated with the chemical resistance activating compound acibenzolar-S-methyl, we compared the expression of barley gene transcripts in the early host interaction with B. graminis f. sp. hordei or the nonhost pathogen B. graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively. We identified 102 spots corresponding to 94 genes on the macroarray that gave significant B. graminis-responsive signals at 12 and/or 24 h after inoculation. In independent expression analyses, we confirmed the macroarray results for 11 selected genes. Although the majority of genes showed a similar expression profile in compatible versus incompatible interactions, about 30 of the 94 genes were expressed on slightly different levels in compatible versus incompatible interactions...|$|E
40|$|Non-host {{resistance}} of barley to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), an inappropriate forma specialis of the <b>grass</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> fungus, {{is associated with}} formation of cell wall appositions (papillae) at sites of attempted fungal penetration and a hypersensitive cell death reaction (HR) of single attacked cells. Penetration resistance and HR are also typical features of race-non-specific and race-specific {{resistance of}} barley to the appropriate Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), raising {{the question of whether}} genotypic differences in the cellular response of barley to Bgt are delectable. First, we analysed fungal penetration frequencies and HR in different barley accessions known to show altered non-host resistance. In genotypes with limited resistance to inappropriate cereal rust fungi, we concomitantly detected low penetration resistance to Bgt and significant differences of HR rates during attack from Bgt. Second, we tested barley mutants known to show altered host responses to Bgh. The rar 1 -mutation that suppresses many types of race-cultivar-specific resistances did not influence the non-host response of the Bgt-isolate used in this study. However, mutants of Ror 1 and Ror 2, two genes required for full race non-specific penetration resistance of mlo-barley to barley powdery mildew fungus, exhibited altered defence response to Bgt, including higher frequencies of fungal penetration. On these mutants, growth of the inappropriate fungus was arrested subsequent to penetration by HR. Together, the data show that barley defence response to the wheat powdery mildew fungus is determined by similar factors as race-specific and race-non-specific resistance to appropriate Bgh...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Protein effectors of {{pathogenicity}} are {{instrumental in}} modulating host immunity and disease resistance. The <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> pathogen of <b>grasses</b> Blumeria graminis causes {{one of the}} most important diseases of cereal crops. B. graminis is an obligate biotrophic pathogen and as such has an absolute requirement to suppress or avoid host immunity if it is to survive and cause disease. Results Here we characterise a superfamily predicted to be the full complement of Candidates for Secreted Effector Proteins (CSEPs) in the fungal barley <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> parasite B. graminis f. sp. hordei. The 491 genes encoding these proteins constitute over 7 % of this pathogen’s annotated genes and most were grouped into 72 families of up to 59 members. They were predominantly expressed in the intracellular feeding structures called haustoria, and proteins specifically associated with the haustoria were identified by large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics. There are two major types of effector families: one comprises shorter proteins (100 – 150 amino acids), with a high relative expression level in the haustoria and evidence of extensive diversifying selection between paralogs; the second type consists of longer proteins (300 – 400 amino acids), with lower levels of differential expression and evidence of purifying selection between paralogs. An analysis of the predicted protein structures underscores their overall similarity to known fungal effectors, but also highlights unexpected structural affinities to ribonucleases throughout the entire effector super-family. Candidate effector genes belonging to the same family are loosely clustered in the genome and are associated with repetitive DNA derived from retro-transposons. Conclusions We employed the full complement of genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses as well as structural prediction methods to identify and characterize the members of the CSEPs superfamily in B. graminis f. sp. hordei. Based on relative intron position and the distribution of CSEPs with a ribonuclease-like domain in the phylogenetic tree we hypothesize that the associated genes originated from an ancestral gene, encoding a secreted ribonuclease, duplicated successively by repetitive DNA-driven processes and diversified during the evolution of the <b>grass</b> and cereal <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> lineage. </p...|$|R

The section on ?Host-Parasite Interactions? covers the dynamic recent developments in <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> research and provides insight into how the new information may be exploited to limit the devastating worldwide impact of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> These chapters focus on disease resistance with detailed discussions of both inherent and induced resistance in host plants, the chain of host defense responses leading to resistance, and the genetic, molecular, biological, and physiological bases of resistant interactions. Chapters within the ?Populations? section present information on epidemiology and population genetics of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> in both agricultural and natural plant pathosystems. These chapters detail complexities of genetic interactions between host resistance and parasite virulence. In ?Control Methods?, chapters cover breeding for resistance in the face of rapidly emerging virulent mildew races, the development and use of fungicides with strategies to minimize mildew resistance, alternative controls employing biological agents and other environmental manipulations, and the potential for developing transgenic plants with built-in resistance. Contributions highlight the increasing complexity and sophistication of attempts to manage <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> in the field and glasshouse and outline the evolution of strategies used to combat these devastating diseases.

Podosphaera xanthii (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) is the plant pathogenic fungus that causes <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on cucurbits, such as cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, cucumber and squash. Development of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on melons is favored by moderate temperatures and relative humidity, succulent plant growth and reduced light intensity {{brought about by}} a dense plant canopy. Existing products as well as materials under development were evaluated and compared for efficacy in management of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on cantaloupe in a field trial conducted {{during the spring of}} 2006 at the Yuma Valley Agricultural Center. A high level of disease had developed when disease severity data was recorded at crop maturity (Jun 15). Among treatments, the degree of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> control ranged from 0 to 100 %. Among tested products, several are registered for use in Arizona for control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on melons. Using a mixture of products or rotating among efficacious fungicides with different modes of action is important to minimize the development of insensitivity in the pathogen population to {{one or more of these}} active ingredients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>Mildew</b> is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and more destructive disease in nature. Chemical control of fungal pathogens is a routine method for management of this disease. One cannot rely on chemical control permanently as it is not ecofriendly. Nature has solved this problem by providing biocontrol agents. During routine survey of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> disease from a World Heritage Site – Kas Plateau, (Dist-Satara, M. S, India) mycophagous behavior of Illeis cincta on Dalbergia sisso and Xanthium strumarium {{has been reported in}} natural conditions. The bionomics of Illeis cincta with <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> has been discussed in this paper. Larval stages of I. cinacta are voracious feeders of anamorphs of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> disease than that of adults. Increase in natural population of mycophagous insect may help in reduction of anamorphs of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> This will definitely lower down further spread of disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A Bacillus sp. BS 061 {{significantly}} reduced disease incidence of gray mold and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> To identify the active principle, the culture filtrate was partitioned between butanol and water. The antifungal activity against B. cinerea {{was evident in}} the butanol-soluble portion, and active substances were identified as cyclic lipopeptides, iturin A series, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) and mass analysis. Interestingly, antifungal activity against <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> was observed in the water-soluble portion, suggesting that cyclic lipopeptides have no responsibility to suppress <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> This finding reveals that biocontrol agents of Bacillus origin suppress gray mold and <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> through the secretion of different bioactive substances...|$|R
40|$|The most {{frequent}} fungus species known as <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews,</b> causing the diseases of forest trees, were studied. Among forest woody species, oaks are especially susceptible to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> attack, and among them pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L) is highly endangered. This paper reports 49 species of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> However, Microsphaera alphitoides {{has the greatest}} significance in forest economy, causing the decline of seedlings in nurseries and also aggravating the natural regeneration of pedunculate oak. This fungus, together with gypsy moth and honey fungus (Armillaria mellea) participates in the dying of old oak trees. <b>Powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> can be successfully controlled by fungicides, and sulphur fungicides Karatan and Rubigan are especially effective...|$|R

40|$|Triticale (xTriticosecale) is the {{intergeneric}} hybrid {{between the}} female parent wheat {{and the male}} parent rye. With {{the expansion of the}} triticale growing area, <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> emerged on this new host and has become a significant disease on triticale. Recent research demonstrated that this "new" <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on triticale has emerged through a host range expansion of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> of wheat. Moreover, this expansion occurred recently and multiple times at different locations in Europe. An effective and environmentally sensitive approach to controlling <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> involves breeding crop plants for resistance. The main goal {{of this study was to}} identify the presence of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> resistance in commercial triticale cultivars. First, the avirulence (AVR) genes and gene complexity carried by this new <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> population on triticale were characterized. Virulence was identified for all the resistance genes evaluated in the present study, and virulence frequencies higher than 50 % were recorded on the genes Pm 3 f, Pm 5 b, Pm 6, Pm 7, Pm 8, and Pm 17. Using molecular markers, the presence of resistance genes Pm 3 f and Pm 17 was identified in certain triticale cultivars. The triticale cultivars were also evaluated for the presence of quantitative resistance at adult plant growth stages in a 2 -year field experiment. Despite the high disease pressure, cultivars highly resistant at the adult-plant growth stages were identified. Because 'Grenado' also showed effective race-specific resistance, this cultivar could be of high value for breeding for durable resistance to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Altogether, this study reveals valuable information on the presence of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> resistance in commercial triticale cultivars, which can be used in breeding programs in triticale. Additionally, this study underscores the need to broaden the base of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> resistance in triticale through introgression and deployment of new sources of mildew resistance, including quantitative resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{darkness}} on <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> development was evaluated {{in the present}} study. Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Erysiphe pisi and Sphaerotheca cucurbitae were incubated under various light conditions. The formation of haustoria and appressoria on hyphae and the elongation of hyphae were suppressed drastically by incubation in the continuous dark condition. Development of the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> was delayed by incubation in the continuous light condition. These suppressive effects of light conditions were consistent among the three <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> investigated. B. graminis incubated in the continuous dark condition formed only primary haustoria that were larger in size than those formed in regular light conditions (12 h light/ 12 h dark), while E. pisi and S. cucurbitae formed secondary haustoria in the continuous dark condition. Re-irradiation of the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> incubated in the continuous dark condition led to recovery of development of the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> Treatment of host plants with glucose and sucrose reversed the suppressive effect of darkness and promoted development of the <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} reduced growth of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildews</b> under continuous dark or light condition might be due to loss of nutrients, such as carbohydrates, from host cells under these conditions. On red, green, yellow and blue light re-irradiation following incubation in the continuous dark condition, the formation of secondary haustoria by B. graminis was observed, although the number of haustoria per colony was significantly smaller than that by white light re-irradiation. Black blue light (310 to 410 nm) did not induce the formation of secondary haustoria. Taken together, this study demonstrated that light conditions affect <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> development, suggesting that light conditions are indispensable for the infection of host plants by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on melons is {{an annual}} disease problem in Arizona. Sphaerotheca fuliginea is the plant {{pathogenic}} fungus that causes <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> of cucurbits, which include cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, cucumber and squash. When environmental conditions are favorable, disease incidence and severity can reach economically significant levels. Factors that favor development of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on melons include moderate temperatures and relative humidity, succulent plant growth, and reduced light intensity {{brought about by}} a dense plant canopy. Potential new fungicides were evaluated and compared to existing chemicals for control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> of cantaloupe in a field trial conducted {{during the spring of}} 1999 at the Yuma Agricultural Center. A high level of disease had developed by crop maturity (June 29). On nontreated plants 43 % of the upper leaf surface was covered by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> whereas the level on the underside of leaves was 78 % [...] All of the 34 different treatments significantly reduced the level of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on both sides of leaves, compared to nontreated plants. The best treatments among those tested with respect to disease control on the underside of leaves, where disease control is more difficult than on the tops of leaves, included Topsin+Trilogy, Benlate, Benlate+Trilogy, Quadris, A 815, Topsin+Microthiol, and Topsin. The potential availability of new chemistries for management of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> of cantaloupe and other cucurbits could help improve overall control of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> as well as the implementation of fungicide resistance management strategies, which strive to minimize the risk of resistance development by the pathogen to these compounds...|$|R
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> of pecan, {{caused by}} Microsphaera ulni, results in {{discoloration}} of pecan shucks, but {{its effects on}} yield and quality of kernels are not known.

The fungus continued to be active throughout the summer. However, results of a field test comparing diseased and healthy nuts from two varieties of pecans indicate that <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> did not affect nut weight or quality. Whole nut weights, kernel weights, color ratings or percentage of discarded nuts were not significant between paired clusters of nuts that were treated with fungicides and remained disease free and untreated nuts that were infected with <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Although shucks may have a high percentage of area covered by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> results from this trial indicate that fungicide treatments are not warranted...|$|R
