5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that the subsidy had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for <b>elastic</b> <b>demand,</b> social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from the subsidy and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
25|$|To {{show this}} relationship, {{suppose that the}} market price of a product is $1.00, and that a $0.50 tax is imposed on the product that, by law, is to be {{collected}} from the seller. If the product has an <b>elastic</b> <b>demand,</b> a greater portion of the tax will be absorbed by the seller. This is because goods with <b>elastic</b> <b>demand</b> cause a large decline in quantity demanded for a small increase in price. Therefore, in order to stabilize sales, the seller absorbs more of the additional tax burden. For example, the seller might drop {{the price of the}} product to $0.70 so that, after adding in the tax, the buyer pays a total of $1.20, or $0.20 more than he did before the $0.50 tax was imposed. In this example, the buyer has paid $0.20 of the $0.50 tax (in the form of a post-tax price) and the seller has paid the remaining $0.30 (in the form of a lower pre-tax price).|$|E
25|$|The tonnage of the {{returning}} ships rose by 125 percent in this period. However, the Company's {{revenues from the}} sale of goods landed in Europe rose by only 78 percent. This reflects the basic change in the VOC's circumstances that had occurred: it now operated in new markets for goods with an <b>elastic</b> <b>demand,</b> in which it had to compete on an equal footing with other suppliers. This made for low profit margins. Unfortunately, the business information systems of the time made this difficult to discern for the managers of the company, which may partly explain the mistakes they made from hindsight. This lack of information might have been counteracted (as in earlier times in the VOC's history) by the business acumen of the directors. Unfortunately by this time these were almost exclusively recruited from the political regent class, which had long since lost its close relationship with merchant circles.|$|E

We introduce the equilibrium definition with <b>elastic</b> <b>demands</b> based on Wardrop’s principles when there are some internal relationships between different kinds of goods which transported through the same traffic network. Moreover, we also prove that the equilibrium conditions of this problem with <b>elastic</b> <b>demands</b> can be equivalently expressed as a system of evolutionary variational inequalities. By using the fixed point theory and projected dynamic system theory, we get the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equilibrium problem with <b>elastic</b> <b>demands.</b> Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate our results...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC market structure. First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds marginal costs, The MC firm maximizes profits where marginal revenue = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's demand curve is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds marginal costs. The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with excess capacity. That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this equilibrium condition occurs where the perfectly <b>elastic</b> <b>demand</b> curve equals minimum average cost. A MC firm’s demand curve is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the demand curve will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is excess capacity.|$|E
2500|$|The long-run {{characteristics}} of a monopolistically competitive market are almost {{the same as a}} perfectly competitive market. [...] Two differences between the two are that monopolistic competition produces heterogeneous products and that monopolistic competition involves a great deal of non-price competition, which is based on subtle product differentiation. [...] A firm making profits in the short run will nonetheless only break even in the long run because demand will decrease and average total cost will increase. [...] This means in the long run, a monopolistically competitive firm will make zero economic profit. This illustrates the amount of influence the firm has over the market; because of brand loyalty, it can raise its prices without losing all of its customers. This means that an individual firm's demand curve is downward sloping, in contrast to perfect competition, which has a perfectly <b>elastic</b> <b>demand</b> schedule.|$|E
