5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands {{to know how to}} restore Mulder to his own body. Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call and set up a meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder.</b> As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E

5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> that recorded basic {{information about the}} aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|The ICAO investigation, led by Caj Frostell, did {{not have}} the {{authority}} to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted. Consequently, the investigation {{did not have}} access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret). A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of Boeing and Litton (the manufacturer of the navigation system).|$|E
5|$|The French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) {{opened an}} {{investigation}} into the crash; it was joined by its German counterpart, the Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation (BFU), and was assisted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hours after the crash, the BEA sent seven investigators to the crash site; these were accompanied by representatives from Airbus and CFM International. The cockpit voice recorder, which was damaged but still usable, was recovered by rescue workers and was examined by the investigation team. The following week, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin announced that the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder,</b> which was blackened by fire but still usable, had also been found. Investigators isolated 150 sets of DNA, which were compared with the DNA of the victims' families.|$|E

5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing {{of the train}} was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by Brazil's Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, CENIPA). Data from the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{responsibility for}} investigating the incident lay with the Air Accident Investigation Board/Norway (AAIB/N), although {{the investigation and}} report was a close cooperation with the Interstate Aviation Committee {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Federal Air Transport Agency. AAIB/N had the primary responsibility for investigations at the crash site, cooperation with the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, and writing the report. IAC was responsible for handling the investigations in Russia, the reading of the cockpit voice recorder, the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder,</b> the relationship with Vnukovo Airlines and a test flight. Both agencies agreed that English was to be the language of the final report; English is one of the ICAO languages.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E
5|$|The VOR/DME {{system was}} {{tested by the}} Civil Aviation Administration on 7 May and found to be working correctly. AIBN {{established}} a base of operations at the hangar at Brønnøysund Airport and used a helicopter to freight {{the pieces of the}} wreck there and bodies to Trondheim University Hospital for identification. Technical investigations started on 9 May. The aircraft was equipped with a flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> and a cockpit voice recorder. Both were found intact and were decoded at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom. Improper use of the microphone made it difficult to hear the captain's voice, but it was possible to reconstruct the conversations and line of events. A memorial service was held on 10 May and was attended by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. The last Home Guard personnel concluded their work on 11 May and the police concluded their investigations at Torghatten on 13 May.|$|E

40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{describes the}} methodologies {{to be used}} within the SAMOVAR project to assess the effects of installing <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> in vehicles. By way of introduction, the general principles guiding the project are outlined, together {{with the role of}} the different types of vehicle <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> to be studied. Three activities are discussed. The first relates to the assessment of the effects on accident rates of installing recording devices in fleets of commercial vehicles. The statistical and procedural requirements are described, and the importance of the feedback process within the organisation is emphasised. The critical issue of sample size is discussed at some length, as well as the analyses procedures to be employed. The second study is designed to be complementary, in that it uses Journey <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> in order to provide behavioural data {{that can be used to}} provide both an explanation for any changes in accident rates, and also some indication of the effects of the devices over time. The third study is again concerned with accident data, but this time on a disaggreated level, being concerning with the use of Accident <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> in the process of accident reconstruction in order to obtain detailed information on the dynamics of the accident situation...|$|R

5|$|The flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> stopped {{recording}} at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed {{one second}} {{later by the}} cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E
