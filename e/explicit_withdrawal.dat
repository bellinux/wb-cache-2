2500|$|In general, BDSM play {{is usually}} {{structured}} {{such that it}} is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent during a scene; for example, by using a safeword that was agreed on in advance. Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a [...] "safe symbol" [...] such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an <b>explicit</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law, since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see Legal status). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning ("this is getting too intense") rather than <b>explicit</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all. This is sometimes the case for [...] "punishment scenes" [...] between master/slave couples or for some extreme or edgeplay scenes which may include abductions, rape play, or interrogation. This scene dynamic may be referred to as [...] "consensual nonconsent". In some scenes or relationships, it may be impossible for consent to be withdrawn {{in the middle of a}} scene, or the bottom may have the ability to revoke consent for a relationship as a whole, but not for a particular scene.|$|E

40|$|The {{scalability}} of BGP routing is a {{major concern}} for the Internet community. Scalability is an issue in two different aspects: increasing routing table size, and increasing rate of BGP updates. In this paper, we focus on the latter. Our objective is to characterize the churn increase experienced by ASes in different levels of the Internet hierarchy as the network grows. We look at several “what-if ” growth scenarios that are either plausible directions {{in the evolution of the}} Internet or educational corner cases, and investigate their scalability implications. In addition, we examine the effect of the BGP update rate-limiting timer (MRAI), considering both major variations with which it has been deployed. Our findings explain the dramatically different impact of multihoming and peering on BGP scalability, identify which topological growth scenarios will lead to faster churn increase, and emphasize the importance of not rate-limiting <b>explicit</b> <b>withdrawals</b> (despite what RFC- 4271 recently required). 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} attrition rates {{over the first}} four years of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, a longitudinal national panel sample of New Zealand adults. We report the base rate and covariates for the following four distinct classes of respondents: <b>explicit</b> <b>withdrawals,</b> lost respondents, intermittent respondents and constant respondents. A multinomial logistic regression examined an extensive range of demographic and socio-psychological covariates (among them the Big-Six personality traits) associated with membership in these classes (N = 5, 814). Results indicated that men, Māori and Asian peoples {{were less likely to be}} constant respondents. Conscientiousness and Honesty-Humility were also positively associated with membership in the constant respondent class. Notably, the effect sizes for the socio-psychological covariates of panel attrition tended to match or exceed those of standard demographic covariates. This investigation broadens the focus of research on panel attrition beyond demographics by including a comprehensive set of socio-psychological covariates. Our findings show that core psychological covariates convey important information about panel attrition, and are practically important to the management of longitudinal panel samples like the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study...|$|R

40|$|Community {{and rights}} are intimately linked with both {{environmental}} legal and urban considerations. Perhaps {{the most significant}} locus of convergence is the representability of either {{with regard to the}} environment. Thus, both legal and ecological community debates centre around the community's ability to speak for the unspeakable, while rights are often seen as one of the vehicles for such representation. This is indeed the beginning of this chapter's debate, whose adequacy for the kind of considerations put forth in this book will, however, be thoroughly disputed. While recording the importance of ecological and humanistic nostalgia towards community, this chapter attempts to construct a notion of community that does not fit in what seemingly is the panacea for our ecological woes. In doing this, the text performs a very <b>explicit</b> <b>withdrawal</b> - indeed, a withdrawal from Luhmann's writings. This is a departure tout court: from Luhmann's preference not to deal with community, as well as from Luhmann's poetics of language. This is not coincidental: {{it is not possible to}} talk about the absence of community in autopoiesis, mainly because, to some extent, autopoiesis is predicated on the absence of community. Any observation of community would depart from the Luhmannian focus on the social. Hence, autopoietic terminology will have to be enriched in order to shift its epistemological stare towards these excluded territories, which refer, not to the internalised and domesticated absence of community with which each system deals, but to the kind of community with which the system is to remain unfamiliar. This chapter, therefore, departs from Luhmann's opinions and language, but not, I would like to think, from autopoiesis as such. In fact, the withdrawal is here presented as an operation of autopoiesis in more ways than one. Thus, the withdrawal is itself conceptualised as the location of community. In its departure from nostalgia and its couching in social rather than conscious terms, community - or rather, its absence - becomes autopoietically operationalised. Following the discussion on risk, community is discussed here as another example of the continuum/rupture form, especially in its location on the very movement between outside and inside. At the same time, community develops the form in ways risk does not. Thus, community is connected to the messianic, which, however, does not arrive in the guise of future risk, but as a fractal reiteration of the form in the folds of the present. The connection of community with the environmental concept of inter-generational equity occurs on the basis of a present, transient recursivity, thus semiologising community as absence. This absence is further employed in the domain of environmental rights. The paradoxicality of rights is explored and a locus standi of absence is adumbrated, in resonance of unutterance and withdrawal from collectivity. In search of the location of environmental rights, the discussion returns to autopoiesis with a conceptualisation of community as the circularity of observation on the basis of blind spot. Community is connected to rights, not through the collective, but through the absence of the collective as a representational entity that 'speaks' for nothing except its withdrawal...|$|E

First, {{language in the}} drafted preamble appeared to Harriman to prohibit {{the use of nuclear}} weapons in self-defense, which Harriman insisted be clarified. Harriman additionally demanded that an <b>explicit</b> clause concerning <b>withdrawal</b> from the agreement be added to the treaty; Khrushchev believed that each state had a sovereign right to withdraw, which should simply be assumed. Harriman informed Gromyko that without a clause governing withdrawal, which he believed the US Senate would demand, the US could not assent.

A Church source commented: [...] "From the Roman Catholic side there was no failure to appreciate the aims and objects to promote which this council exists, but the Vatican was not satisfied with some of the ways and means adopted by the council in pursuit of those aims." ...|$|R
