5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
25|$|On March 26, 2004, Austin {{allegedly}} assaulted {{his girlfriend}} Tess Broussard during a dispute at his Texas home, {{according to a}} San Antonio Police Department report. Broussard claimed that Austin grabbed her, and she began struggling with him, who eventually threw her to the ground. Broussard landed on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and later told officers she had injured her right hand. Broussard provided a written statement to police, who photographed her injuries.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{heard the}} crash, and knew an {{eastbound}} passenger train {{was due in}} Moingona about midnight, stopping shortly before heading east over the Des Moines River and then Honey Creek. She found the surviving crew members and shouted that she would get help, having to cross the Des Moines River bridge along the way. Although she started with a lantern, it went out, and she crawled the span on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> with only lightning for illumination. Once across, she had to cover about two miles on ground to the Moingona depot to sound the alarm. She then led a party back to rescue two of the crew members. Edgar Wood, perched in a tree, grasped a rope thrown to him, and came ashore hand-over-hand. Adam Agar couldn't be reached until the floodwaters began to recede. Pat Donahue's corpse was eventually found in a cornfield a quarter mile downstream from the bridge, but A.P. Olmsted was never found. The passenger train was stopped at Scranton, with about 200 aboard.|$|E

500|$|Mikami was {{indifferent}} to the main character's gender. During the early creation process, he left the decision to his staff, who ultimately chose a female character. Because P.N.03 {{takes place in a}} space colony, Mikami wanted Vanessa's country of origin to be ambiguous. To that end, she was given a combination of French, German, and English names. Vanessa's movements were animated freehand, without motion capture technology. The designers posed Vanessa crouched on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to resemble a jaguar, as an homage to the Jaguar title. The staff integrated rhythmic motions to her maneuvers to emulate dancing and to make her appear stylish. Kobayashi wanted Vanessa to be a [...] "cool and sexy mercenary with a tough exterior that hides her dark past." [...] In retrospect, he was proud of the character's style and movements.|$|E

[...] In another cartoon in The New Yorker, a patient {{looks up at the}} masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, [...] "Wait a minute! How do I know you're not George Plimpton?" [...] A feature in Mad Magazine titled [...] "Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton" [...] spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square {{in the middle of the}} night, and spending a day with Jerry Lewis.|$|E
2500|$|According to the prosecution, Knox had {{attacked}} Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged {{her head against}} a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, [...] "You acted the goody-goody so much, now {{we are going to}} show you. Now you're going to be forced to have sex!" [...] The prosecution theorized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her on <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment.|$|E

60|$|Mrs Boffin seated Bella on {{the large}} ottoman, and seated herself beside her, and John her husband seated himself {{on the other side}} of her, and Mr Boffin stood beaming at every one and {{everything}} he could see, with surpassing jollity and enjoyment. Mrs Boffin was then taken with a laughing fit of clapping <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> clapping <b>her</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> rocking herself to and fro, and then with another laughing fit of embracing Bella, and rocking her to and fro--both fits, of considerable duration.|$|R

He squatted up and sat staring at the footmarks of the great bear as {{they came to the}} gully--they were as wide as his head and twice as long. Then he jumped up and went along the cliff face until the ledge was visible. Here he sat down for some time thinking, while Eudena watched him. Presently she saw the bears had gone.|$|R

50|$|In 1969, EblÃ© married fellow painter Dan Campanelli {{and they}} made their living from {{teaching}} art classes and selling paintings. In 1976, they bought a stone farmhouse in New Jersey which was abandoned and had no electricity. As {{they were unable to}} obtain financing and had no savings, they restored the building themselves with hand tools. EblÃ©-Campanelli abandoned <b>her</b> wheelchair for <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> refinished the floors, while Dan worked on the sagging structure. They pressed grapes in an antique fruit press, making their own wine; EblÃ©-Campanelli canned 400 jars of fruit annually; and she spun fleece from their Dorset sheep into yarn for projects. Their work and home was featured in Colonial Homes in the March/April 1981 issue and Country Living Magazine in April 1985. That same year, the New Jersey Network produced a PBS program on their artwork and life for television.|$|R
40|$|A 58 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to ourrheumatology ward for evaluation andtreatment of seronegative polyarthritis.

On admission, she com-plained of fatigue, along with severe bilateral joint pain <b>and</b> swelling of <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> elbows <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> She also had symptoms of severe Raynaud syndrome affecting <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Examination showed symmetric synovitis of her wrists, elbows <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> {{as well as most}} metacarpophalangeal and proximal interpha-langeal joints, but was otherwise normal. Blood tests showed normochromic normocytic anemia with elevated inflammatory parameters (erythro-cyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level). Rheumatoid factors, and antiâ€“cyclic citrul-linated peptide and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Hand radiographs (Figure 1) showed striking sclerosis of the terminal phalanges; this sclerosis was not seen in other surveyed bones including those of the elbows, pelvis, <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> feet, nor was there evidence of calcinosis. This finding was diagnosed as terminal phalangeal osteosclerosis, a normal variant. The patient also had classic seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. The radiographic appearance of the osteosclerosis was probably enhanced by severe osteopenia related to the patientâ€™s rheumatoid arthritis and previous corticotherapy. Terminal phalangeal osteosclerosis is a local-ized and sporadic form of endosteal bone forma-tion occurring typically in the distal phalanges 1 and is not pathognomonic of any disease. Its specific location differentiates it from general-ized endosteal new-bone formation (e. g., in adult sickle cell disease). A similar radiographic appearance may be found with superimposed calcinosis over the tuft, as seen occasionally in connective tissue disease. Although terminal phalangeal osteosclerosis was initially believed to be related to and more prevalent in collagen vascular diseases, 2 later reports failed to support this association. 3, 4 Terminal phalangeal osteosclerosis should be re-garded as a normal and common variant, 1 with more than 50 % of the population over 44 years of age showing some evidence of this condition. ...|$|R
6000|$|Late one {{afternoon}} Ralph stepped along the Strand {{to an interview}} with a lawyer upon business. The afternoon light was almost over, and already streams of greenish and yellowish artificial light were being poured into an atmosphere which, in country lanes, would now have been soft with the smoke of wood fires; and {{on both sides of the}} road the shop windows were full of sparkling chains and highly polished leather cases, which stood upon shelves made of thick plate-glass. None of these different objects was seen separately by Denham, but from all of them he drew an impression of stir and cheerfulness. Thus it came about that he saw Katharine Hilbery coming towards him, and looked straight at her, as if she were only an illustration of the argument that was going forward in his mind. In this spirit he noticed the rather set expression in her eyes, and the slight, half-conscious movement of her lips, which, together with her height and the distinction of her dress, made her look as if the scurrying crowd impeded her, and her direction were different from theirs. He noticed this calmly; but suddenly, as he passed <b>her,</b> his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> began to tremble, and his heart beat painfully. She did not see him, and went on repeating to herself some lines which had stuck to her memory: [...] "It's life that matters, nothing but life--the process of discovering--the everlasting and perpetual process, not the discovery itself at all." [...] Thus occupied, she did not see Denham, and he had not the courage to stop her. But immediately the whole scene in the Strand wore that curious look of order and purpose which is imparted to the most heterogeneous things when music sounds; and so pleasant was this impression that he was very glad that he had not stopped her, after all. It grew slowly fainter, but lasted until he stood outside the barrister's chambers.|$|R

60|$|Queen Elizabeth {{herself was}} not inaptly {{represented}} by her namesake of Hardwicke, the Queen of Hallamshire, {{sitting on her}} great white mule at the door, sideways, with her feet on a board, as little children now ride, and attended by a whole troop of gentlemen ushers, maidens, prickers, and running footmen. She was {{a woman of the}} same type as the Queen, which was of course enough to stamp her as a celebrated beauty, and though she had reached middle age, her pale, clear complexion and delicate features were well preserved. Her chin was too sharp, and there was something too thin and keen about her nose and lips to promise good temper. She was small of stature, but she made up for it in dignity of presence, and as she sat there, with her rich embroidered green satin farthingale spreading out over the mule, her tall ruff standing up fanlike on her shoulders, her riding-rod in <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> master of the horse standing at her rein, while a gentleman usher wielded an enormous, long-handled, green fan, to keep the sun from incommoding her, she was, perhaps, even more magnificent than the maiden queen herself might have been in her more private expeditions. Indeed, she was new to her dignity as Countess, having been only a few weeks married to the Earl, her fourth husband. Captain Talbot did not feel it derogatory to his dignity as a gentleman to advance with his hat in his <b>hand</b> to kiss <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> put a <b>knee</b> to the ground as he invited her to alight, an invitation his wife heard with dismay as she reached the door, for things were by no means yet as they should be in the hall.

Already she had almost reached them, when of a sudden, {{and for an instant}} only, the moon shone out between two thick clouds, {{revealing}} her, though indistinctly, to the eyes of the guard. Now Sihamba was wearing a fur cape made of wild dog's hide, and, crouched as she was upon <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> half-hidden, moreover, by a tuft of dry grass, the man took her to be a wild dog or a jackal, and the hair which stood out round her head for the ruff upon the animal's neck.|$|E
