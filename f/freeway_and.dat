5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway (Harbor <b>Freeway)</b> <b>and</b> Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena <b>Freeway)</b> <b>and</b> Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island <b>Freeway</b> <b>and</b> Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along the former East By-Pass (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica <b>Freeway)</b> <b>and</b> the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale <b>Freeway</b> <b>and</b> Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E

5|$|SR52 {{is part of}} the California <b>Freeway</b> <b>and</b> Expressway System and is {{eligible}} for the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is not a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans. SR52 {{is not part of the}} National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The entire route is known as both the Soledad <b>Freeway</b> <b>and</b> the San Clemente Canyon Freeway. In 2013, SR52 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 69,000 at the eastern terminus with SR 67, and 103,000 between Convoy Street and SR163, the lowest and the highest AADT for the highway, respectively.|$|E

5|$|After exit6, Route4 {{passes the}} Rhode Island Army National Guard base {{to the east}} and to the Hunt River to the west. Route4 {{northbound}} interchanges with Route403 at exit7; Route403, or the Quonset Freeway, is a four-lane, limited access <b>freeway</b> <b>and</b> spur route of Route4 that serves the Quonset Business Park and the village of Davisville. Heading southbound, exit7 is split into exit7B, which serves the Quonset <b>Freeway,</b> <b>and</b> exit7A, which serves Route402 (Frenchtown Road), another spur route connecting the highway to US1 and Route2. After exit7, Route4 continues northward as a six-lane expressway, passing farmlands to the west and entering a suburban region of East Greenwich. The highway crosses under an overpass at Middle Road before interchanging with Route401, the freeway's final spur, at another partial cloverleaf interchange. Exit8 is also used to access Route2 and I-95 south, which has no direct freeway connection with Route4 north. Shortly after exit8, the Route4 designation ends and the mainline of the highway defaults onto I-95 north.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a parclo {{interchange}} with US 60 was {{to start}} in late 2014. Construction of the El Mirage interchange is to start 2016.

The remaining segment which ends at the newly completed stack interchange with I-10 has already been upgraded to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|From the {{crossing}} south of Davison, I-96 runs parallel to Grand River Avenue southeasterly with eight lanes total. The two run together {{as far as}} the interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) near Bishop Park. I-96 turns more south-southeasterly there through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's southeastern side. I-96 terminates at an interchange that connects it to I-75 (Fisher <b>Freeway)</b> <b>and</b> to the Ambassador Bridge.|$|E

5|$|On {{the east}} side of town, M-55 leaves the <b>freeway</b> <b>and</b> turns east again running through the Pere Marquette State Forest along Watergate Road. When the highway meets M-66, M-55 joins M-66 and runs north through farmland. As the two {{highways}} approach Lake City, they run along the shore of Lake Missaukee and through downtown. M-55 turns east again along Houghton Lake Road, separating from M-66 north of the central business district. This section of trunkline passes through mixed farm and wood lands that transitions to mostly forests near Merritt. The road crosses the Muskegon River and follows Lake City Road into the outskirts of Houghton Lake. M-55 passes over the US127 <b>freeway</b> <b>and</b> enters Houghton Lake Heights. There the highway runs southeasterly along the shores of Houghton Lake into downtown Houghton Lake. M-18 briefly joins M-55 through Prudenville on {{the east side}} of the lake, and M-55 follows West Branch Road as it continues east toward Interstate 75 (I-75).|$|E
