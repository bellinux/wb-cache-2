Methods A single-centre, unblinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted. One hundred and twenty older adults were randomly allocated to two groups: the control group (n =  60, one-leg standing balance exercise, 12 min/d) or the intervention group (n =  60, force platform training with <b>functional</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation,</b> 12 min/d).

Medial–lateral and anterior–posterior maximal range of sway with eyes open and closed, the Berg Balance Scale, the Barthel Index, the Falls Efficacy scale-International were assessed at baseline and after the 3 -month intervention. A fall diary was kept by each participant during the 6 -month follow-up.

Effectiveness of gait {{training}} {{using an}} electromechanical gait trainer, {{with and without}} <b>functional</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation,</b> in subacute stroke: a randomized controlled trial. Objective: To compare the therapeutic effects of conventional gait training (CGT), gait training using an electromechanical gait trainer (EGT), and gait training using an electromechanical gait trainer with <b>functional</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> (EGT-FES) in people with subacute stroke. Design: Nonblinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: Rehabilitation hospital for adults. Participants: Fifty patients were recruited within 6 weeks after stroke onset; 46 of these completed the 4 -week training period. Intervention: Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 3 gait intervention groups: CGT, EGT, or EGT-FES. The experimental intervention was a 20 -minute session per day, 5 days a week (weekdays) for 4 weeks. In addition, all participants received their 40 -minute sessions of regular physical therapy every weekday as part of their treatment by the hospital. Main Outcome Measures: Five-meter walking speed test, Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS), Berg Balance Scale, Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC), Motricity Index leg subscale, FIM instrument score, and Barthel Index. Results: The EGT and EGT-FES groups had statistically significantly more improvement than the CGT group in the 5 -m walking speed test (CGT vs EGT, P=. 011; CGT vs EGT-FES, P=. 001), Motricity Index (CGT vs EGT-FES, P=. 011), EMS (CGT vs EGT, P=. 006; CGT vs EGT-FES, P=. 009), and FAC (CGT vs EGT, P=. 005; CGT vs EGT-FES, P=. 002) after the 4 weeks of training. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the EGT and EGT-FES groups in all outcome measures. Conclusions: In this sample with subacute stroke, participants who trained on the electromechanical gait trainer with body-weight support, with or without FES, had a faster gait, better mobility, and improvement in functional ambulation than participants who underwent conventional gait training.

40|$|Abstract Background Neuromuscular <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> {{is widely}} used for muscle {{strengthening}} in clinical practice and for preventative purposes. However, there are few reports {{on the effects of}} <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> on the immune response of the organism, and even those mainly describe the changes observed immediately after the electrotherapeutic procedures. The objective of our {{study was to examine the}} possible immunological consequences of moderate low-frequency transcutaneous neuromuscular <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> for quadriceps muscle strengthening in healthy individuals. Methods The study included 10 healthy volunteers (5 males, 5 females, mean age 37. 5 [*]years). At the beginning and after a two-week <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> program, muscle strength was measured and peripheral blood was collected to analyse white blood cells by flow cytometry for the expression of cell surface antigens (CD 3, CD 19, CD 4, CD 8, CD 4 / 8, DR/ 3, NK, Th reg, CD 25 [*]+[*]CD 3 +, CD 25 [*]+[*]CD 4 +, CD 25 [*]+[*]CD 8 +, CD 69 [*]+[*]CD 3 +, CD 69 [*]+[*]CD 4 +, CD 69 [*]+[*]CD 8 +) and phagocytosis/oxidative killing function. Results Muscle strength slightly increased after the program on the dominant and the nondominant side. No statistically or clinically significant difference was found in any of the measured blood and immune cells parameters as well as phagocytosis and oxidative burst function of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes one day after the program. Conclusions The program of transcutaneous low-frequency <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> slightly strengthened the quadriceps femoris muscle while producing no changes in measured immunological parameters.

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> (FES) {{is one of}} good {{rehabilitation}} {{tools in}} helping paraplegic patients to regain their abilities to walk. FES-assisted paraplegic walking efficiency can be quantitatively evaluated by analyzing the handle reaction vector (HRV). For this purpose, a dynamometer walker system was recently developed. In the system, a cable was used to transmit sensing data from the walker to a PC for calculating HRV. The cable may interfere the moving of the walker to result in inconvenience or a failure of paraplegic walking, even new hurts to the paraplegic patients. To avoid this problem, a wireless data transmission system is proposed in this paper, which mainly uses two CRM 2400 modules for wireless data sending and receiving, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} time course of {{arterial}} adaptations during 6 weeks of <b>functional</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> (FES) training and 6 weeks of detraining {{in subjects with}} spinal cord injury (SCI). DESIGN: Intervention study (before-after trial). SETTING: University medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer sample of 9 subjects with SCI. INTERVENTIONS: Six weeks of twice weekly FES cycling and 6 weeks of detraining. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vascular characteristics were measured by plethysmography (baseline and peak blood flow of the thigh) and echo Doppler (diameter of the femoral artery and flow-mediated dilation [FMD]). RESULTS: After 2 weeks of FES training, arterial characteristics changed significantly; there was an increase in baseline and peak blood flow, an increase in femoral artery diameter, and a decrease in FMD of the femoral artery. Detraining reversed baseline and peak thigh blood flow, vascular resistance, and femoral diameter toward pretraining values within 1 week. However, detraining did not restore the FMD of the femoral artery, even after 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of hybrid FES training (4 exercise bouts) is sufficient to improve peak leg blood flow and arterial diameter, and to normalize FMD.

Moreover, none of the selected articles suggested a treatment strategy which takes account of the various aetiologies in genu recurvatum. On the basis of some of the reviewed articles and our own clinical experience, we propose an aetiology-specific treatment strategy for genu recurvatum patients. In a broad patient population, this categorization could form the basis for testing the specificity of each treatment method {{as a function of the}} cause of genu recurvatum. This approach could help confirm the clinical indications and identify the most appropriate treatment for each patient...|$|E
40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stimulation</b> is a {{new method}} for dynamic {{rehabilitation}} of paralyzed muscles. The output of such prosthetic devices needs to be modulated by some index of the muscle movement. In facial paralysis {{a measure of the}} muscle contractions of the normal contralateral side seems to be an appropriate input. In the rabbit, we simultaneously measured the compound action potential of the buccal branch of the facial nerve, the electromyogram of the zygomaticus major muscle, and the muscle twitch tension through strain gauge. The compound action potential, electromyogram, and strain gauge each had a sigmoidal relationship to stimulus intensity. The compound action potential peak-to-peak amplitude was found to have a linear correlation to the peak twitch tension of the corresponding facial muscle. The eiectromyogram response, although more variable, also had a linear correlation with muscle contraction. The possibility of predicting the contraction of facial muscles before they actually occur is discussed in the context of available and future functional electric rehabilitation models.
