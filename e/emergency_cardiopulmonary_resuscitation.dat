Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation can double or triple the victim’s chance of survival from ventricular fibrillation sudden cardiac arrest (1). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation plus defibrillation within three to five minutes of collapse can produce survival rates as high as 49 % to 75 % (2, 3, 4).

40|$|The diploma paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of the development of resuscitation in the world and current recommendations for resuscitation by the European Resuscitation Council. Also included is a description of basic diagnosis of a sudden cardiac arrest, providing vital functions, including the use of alternative materials and the problems of resuscitation in hospitals. Providing effective resuscitation is reflected in the quality of care provided, which is much emphasized nowadays, especially for the accreditation of medical facilities and the creation of standards for nursing care. The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine and compare the extent of knowledge of nurses in the inpatient departments of <b>emergency</b> <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> at two hospitals, one of which uses a standard resuscitation. Another objective is to create a resuscitation standard for nurses at inpatient departments, submit it to involved nurses for assessment and to determine to what extent the created resuscitation standard contributes to the work of nurses who have not used it yet. The first research question is: How do nurses view the newly created standard? The second research question is: Will nurses appreciate the contribution of the created standard? A given hypothesis implies a greater knowledge of nurses who use the resuscitation standard, than nurses who do not use it. The first phase used a quantitative survey using the questionnaire technique; skills and knowledge of nurses were mapped at two medical facilities, one of which uses a resuscitation standard valid for the entire facility. The questionnaire included 34 items, 21 questions dealt with the knowledge of nurses surveyed, and 13 questions mapped demographic data, work organization and the respondents workplace experiences with resuscitation. Based on the results of the quantitative survey, the hypothesis has been confirmed. The results also unveil weaknesses in the training of medical personnel at both hospitals and the surveyed nurses knowledge. In the second phase of the survey, nurses who did not have a resuscitation standard were presented with the resuscitation standard version for assessment. The assessment of the standard was carried out with qualitative survey using semi-standardized interviews with senior nurses at nursing stations. These nurses assessed the presented resuscitation standard positively; they welcome its presence and see its benefits in improving nursing care...|$|E

Main outcome measures: The knowledge and attitudes towards <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Results: Among the 1013 respondents, only 214 (21 %) {{reported that they had}} received <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> training. The majority (72 %) of these trained respondents had had their latest training more than 2 years earlier. The main reasons for not being involved in <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> training included lack of time or interest, and "not necessary".

40|$|Purpose of study: To {{determine}} the effects of ageing and training experience on attitude towards performing basic life support (BLS). Methods: We gave a questionnaire to attendants of the courses for BLS or safe driving in authorised driving schools. The questionnaire included questions about participants' backgrounds. The questionnaire explored the participant's willingness to perform BLS in four hypothetical scenarios related to early <b>emergency</b> call, <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) under their own initiative, telephone-assisted compression-only CPR and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED), respectively. Results: There were significant differences in gender, occupation, residential area, experience of BLS training, and knowledge of AED use among the young (17 - 29. y, N= 6122), middle-aged (30 - 59. y, N= 827) and elderly (> 59. y, N= 15, 743) groups. In all four scenarios, the proportion of respondents willing to perform BLS was lowest in the elderly group. More respondents in the elderly group were willing to follow the telephone-assisted instruction rather than performing CPR under their own initiative. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed ageing as an independent factor related to negative attitude in all scenarios. Gender, occupation, resident area, experience with BLS training and knowledge about AED use were other independent factors. Prior BLS training did not increase willingness to make an emergency call. Conclusion: The aged population has a more negative attitude towards performing BLS. BLS training should be modified to help the elderly gain confidence with the essential elements of BLS, including making early emergency calls. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite {{advances}} in medical care, survival to discharge and full neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest remains less than 20 % after <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> An alternate approach to traditional <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> is extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> which places patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and provides immediate cardiopulmonary support when traditional resuscitation has been unsuccessful. We report {{the results from}} extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> at the Thomas Jefferson University. METHODS: Between 2010 and June 2014, 107 adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures were performed at the Thomas Jefferson University. Patient demographics, survival to discharge, and neurologic recovery of patients who underwent extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> were retrospectively analyzed with institutional review board approval. RESULTS: A total of 23 patients (15 male and 8 female; mean age, 46 ± 12 years) underwent extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> All patients who met criteria were placed on 24 -hour hypothermia protocol (target temperature 33 °C) with initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The mean duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 6. 2 ± 5. 5 days. Nine patients died while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from the following causes: anoxic brain injury (4), stroke (4), and bowel necrosis (1). Two patients with anoxic brain injury on extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> donated multiple organs for transplant.

40|$|Question under study:There are no {{data on the}} {{preparedness}} {{of medical}} students {{at the time of}} their graduation to handle a cardiac arrest. The aim of the present study was to compare the per-formance in <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> of medical students {{at the time of their}} graduation with that of experienced general practitioners. Methods: 24 teams consisting of three medical students and 24 teams consisting of three general practitioners were confronted with a scenario of a simulated witnessed cardiac arrest. Analysis was performed post-hoc using video recordings ob-tained during the simulation. Results: Medical students diagnosed the car-diac arrest as quickly as general practitioners. Medical students were less likely to call for help in the initial phase of the cardiac arrest (14 / 24 vs 21 / 24; P = 0. 002); had less hands-on time during the first 180 seconds of the arrest (52 ± 33 sec vs 105 ± 39 sec; P < 0. 0001); delayed the first defibril-lation (168 ± 78 vs 116 ± 46 sec, P < 0. 007); and showed less directive leadership (4 / 24 vs 14 / 24 teams, P < 0. 007). The technical quality of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation provided by medical stu-dents was partly better, but for no parameter worse, than that provided by general practitioners.

40|$|Background. There are two {{competing}} {{theories of the}} mechanism of blood flow during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> The "cardiac pump " theory postulates that blood flows because the heart is squeezed between the sternum and the spine. The "thoracic pump " theory postulates that blood flows from the thorax because intrathoracic pressure exceeds extrathoracic vascular pressure and that flow is restricted to the venous-to-arterial direction because of venous valves that prevent retrograde flow at the thoracic inlet. To determine which mechanism is operative during actual <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> 20 patients were imaged with transesophageal echocardiography during resuscitation. Methods and Results. Transesophageal two-dimensional and pulse Doppler echocardiography was begun within 7 minutes of initiation of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> In the 18 patients who could be analyzed, the mitral valve opened during the release phase (diastole) and closed during the compression phase (systole) of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> Mitral velocity-time integral measured 8 ± 3 cm during diastole. There was compression of right and left ventricular cavities with significant reduction in measured left ventricular volume during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> In five patients, mitral regurgi-tation was present. Conclusions. Transesophageal echocardiography performed during actual cardiopulmonary resuscita-tion showing mitral valve opening during cardiac release, reduction of ventricular cavity size with compression, and atrioventricular regurgitation support the cardiac pump theory of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> This study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography during <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation.</b> (Circulation 1993; 88 : 534 - 542...|$|R

30|$|According to International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, use of ECMO {{should be}} {{considered}} in children with cardiac arrest refractory to conventional <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> if cardiac arrest occurred in a highly monitored setting and the necessary support equipment and expertise are available to implement the technique rapidly [126]. In a series of 682 patients with a median age of 3  months (ELSO registry) treated with extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> [127], the survival rate after discharge was 38  %. This study suggests that a pH <  6.9 prior to ECMO is significantly associated with death within 72  h or a poor neurological prognosis. The meta-analysis performed by Tajik and Cardarelli [128] of 37 studies (288 patients) including case reports and observational pediatric studies on patients with cardiac arrest treated with extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> showed that survival rate was very variable: It ranged from 0 to 100  % in small centers that had low numbers of patients and from 6 to 79  % for the larger cohorts. Matos et al. [116] demonstrated that morbidity and mortality increase if <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts > 15  min and that conventional resuscitation reaches its limits with a likelihood of survival of 41  % for <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasting 1 – 15  min, but only 12  % if <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts > 35  min. The neurological prognosis of survivors is good and reaches 70  % when <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts < 15  min and 60  % if CPR lasts < 35  min. The survival of children undergoing cardiac surgery is 38.5  % if <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> lasts > 35  min and ECMO is used, but drops to 16.7  % if ECMO is not used (p <  0.0001). Turek et al. [120] reported that if ECMO was implemented within 40  min using a previously prepared circuit, neurological complications were decreased by 52  % (p <  0.04) compared with the conventional method (> 40  min). However, no decrease in the mortality rate was observed. In a series of 42 children treated with extracorporeal <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation,</b> Delmo-Walter et al. [112] showed a difference of mortality depending on the duration of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> prior to implementation of ECMO: 30  ±  1.3  min vs. 46  ±  4.2  min (p =  0.003). The faster the limits of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> are recognized, the earlier ECMO should be initiated, thereby limiting mortality and organ lesions [129].|$|R

40|$|Objectives - To {{determine}} {{factors associated}} with <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> being attempted after cardiac arrest from myocardial infarction, in or outside hospital, and estimate short term and long term survival rates. Design - Descriptive cross sectional and cohort study. Setting - Community based register of all suspected heart attacks and sudden cardiac deaths in Lower Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia. Subjects - 4924 men and women aged 25 - 69. Main outcome measures - Rates of attempted <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> and survival after successful resuscitation. Results-Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted in 41 % of cases of cardiac arrest after myocardial infarction outside hospital and 63 % of cases in hospital. Survival rates at 28 days were 12 % and 39 % respectively. Among the survivors, although 41 % had another myocardial infarction (or coronary death), 81 % of both groups were still alive two years later. Younger and better educated people {{were more likely to}} receive <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in either setting, and being married predicted <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> being attempted outside hospital. Younger age predicted better survival rates after attempted resuscitation in hospital. Conclusions - The reasons for better education to predict <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> being attempted need explanation. The higher survival rate after <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> in hospital compared with outside hospital and the good long term prognosis for survivors in both settings suggest that attempts to improve success of <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>resuscitation</b> outside hospital may be worth while...|$|R
