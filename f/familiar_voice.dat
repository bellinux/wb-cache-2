25|$|He was a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> on BBC TV's cricket {{coverage}} from 1984 through to 1994 firstly as a summariser then {{moving on to}} commentating in 1988. David Gower joined the team in 1994 and eventually replaced Bannister the following summer, but Bannister continued to commentate on Natwest Trophy and Sunday League games until 1999, and had a full role at the BBC's coverage of the 1999 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
500|$|The next day, 28 November, {{was busy}} for 609 Squadron. Several scrambles and alerts came through against Bf 109s. The last came at {{approximately}} 15:30 Greenwich Mean Time. Dundas {{was once again}} piloting X4586. Two squadrons, 152 Squadron and 609 made contact with Bf 109s from Jagdgeschwader 2 ("fighter wing 2"), led by the most successful German ace of the war thus far — Helmut Wick. Minutes after contact had been made and the battle joined, Flight Lieutenant Fieldsend heard the <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> of Dundas shout [...] "I've finished a 109—Whoopee!". Squadron Leader Robinson congratulated Dundas but nothing was heard from Dundas, or his wingman Pilot Officer Paul A. Baillon, flying R6631.|$|E
500|$|Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{wrote that}} it is [...] "a ridiculous {{collection}} of sound effects (police sirens, gunshots) and imposing menace that's actually pretty fun {{in a kind of}} slightly unhinged way." [...] Neil McCormick of The Telegraph wrote that the song is [...] "a solid techno groove and one of the album's odder and most interesting tracks." [...] Stern commented that the song [...] "is not only the highlight of the record, but a highlight of Madonna's career." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "it's the album's boldest, most experimental track, and it's marred only by a just-off vocal performance that renders her very <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> a bit anonymous, and a halfhearted attempt at a dub-step bass drop." [...] Nick Levine of BBC Music called it [...] "a preposterous piece of pop schlock." ...|$|E

60|$|Late in {{the evening}} the sound of carriage-wheels was audible on the drive; and Sir Patrick, opening {{the door of his}} room, heard the <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> in the hall.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} an individual from their voice is a widespread ability with a long evolutionary history. Yet, the perceptual representation of <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> is ill-defined. In two experiments, we explored the neuropsychological processes involved {{in the perception of}} voice identity. We specifically explored the hypothesis that <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> (trained-to-familiar (Experiment 1), and famous voices (Experiment 2)) are represented as a whole complex pattern, well approximated by the average of multiple utterances produced by a single speaker. In experiment 1, participants learned three voices over several sessions, and performed a three-alternative forced-choice identification task on original voice samples and several “speaker averages,” created by morphing across varying numbers of different vowels (e. g., [a] and [i]) produced by the same speaker. In experiment 2, the same participants performed the same task on voice samples produced by familiar speakers. The two experiments showed that for famous voices, but not for trained-to-familiar voices, identification performance increased and response times decreased {{as a function of the}} number of utterances in the averages. This study sheds light on the perceptual representation of <b>familiar</b> <b>voices,</b> and demonstrates the power of average in recognizing <b>familiar</b> <b>voices.</b> The speaker average captures the unique characteristics of a speaker, and thus retains the information essential for recognition; it acts as a prototype of the speaker...|$|R
2500|$|After {{working for}} several years as a labour mediator, {{columnist}} and broadcaster, in 1984 Lewis was appointed Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, {{on the advice of}} Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Lewis served at the post until 1988. In the 1980s, he became a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> appearing [...] with Dalton Camp and Eric Kierans as part of a weekly political panel on Peter Gzowski's CBC Radio show, Morningside.|$|E
2500|$|Several years later, while {{hosting a}} Fourth of July picnic for the community, Celie hears a car horn and a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> from her childhood. It is Nettie singing the {{clapping}} song they sang years ago. They both run {{to each other}} and hug with Celie's children right behind them all grown up. After learning that Mister and Shug have made the reunion possible, Celie thanks them and God for reuniting her with her sister ("The Color Purple [...] ").|$|E
2500|$|Harvey died on February 28, 2009, {{at the age}} of 90 at a {{hospital}} in Phoenix, Arizona, surrounded by family and friends. No cause of death was announced. In response to his father's death, his son, Paul Harvey Jr., said, [...] "millions have lost a friend". At the time of his death, he had less than two years left on his ten-year contract. Former President George W. Bush issued a statement on Harvey's death, calling Harvey: [...] "a friendly and <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> in the lives of millions of Americans." ...|$|E

60|$|While {{he gazed}} in silence at the {{exciting}} and almost bewildering scene, his attention {{was attracted to}} a group of men, among whose vociferating tones he thought he distinguished <b>familiar</b> <b>voices.</b>|$|R
60|$|They heard <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> {{call and}} saw some {{young people from}} their coulé, and so clambered up where they sat. The boards were narrow and the seats low, but nobody minded that, for {{that was part of}} the circus.|$|R
60|$|Bridge was off {{his horse}} the instant that the <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> sounded in his ears.|$|E
60|$|Her manner {{suddenly}} changed. It was a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> speaking. Her maid, {{who stood}} in the background, watched and wondered.|$|E
6000|$|... "After this, an {{agreeable}} {{surprise was}} {{in store for}} me. The <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> of good Mr. Gallilee applied for admission--through the keyhole! ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, {{there they}} were Uncle Alec {{swinging}} his hat like a boy, with Phebe smiling and nodding {{on one side and}} Rose kissing both hands delightedly on the other as she recognized familiar faces and heard <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> welcoming her home.|$|R
60|$|As {{he stood}} {{leaning against a}} tree-box by the curb, dragged down once more by that dreaded feeling of detachment, he heard <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> close beside him. Leaning forward, he saw Eliphalet Hopper and Mr. Cluyme. It was Mr. Cluyme who was speaking.|$|R
40|$|While {{audiovisual}} {{integration is}} well known in speech perception, faces and speech are also informative with respect to speaker recognition. To date, audiovisual integration in the recognition of familiar people has never been demonstrated. Here we show systematic benefits and costs for the recognition of <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> when these are combined with time-synchronized articulating faces, of corresponding or noncorresponding speaker identity, respectively. While these effects were strong for <b>familiar</b> <b>voices,</b> they were smaller or nonsignificant for unfamiliar voices, suggesting that the effects depend on the previous creation of a multimodal representation of a person's identity. Moreover, the effects were reduced or eliminated when voices were combined with the same faces presented as static pictures, demonstrating that the effects do not simply reflect the use of facial identity as a “cue” for voice recognition. This is the first direct evidence for audiovisual integration in person recognition...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{there was}} another scuffle by the door, the sharp report of a pistol and then that strangely <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> called out again: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay! ay!' and {{he looked}} at his master for {{explanation}} from the stronger and more <b>familiar</b> <b>voice.</b> 'I be deaf, you see, ma'am.' ...|$|E
60|$|I was staggered. I held my peace, {{and the two}} stood {{watching}} me. Then I heard footsteps approaching us, and a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E
50|$|Military Members {{and their}} {{families}} use these sound recordings for comfort whenever they need reassurance from those <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> of those they love. Soldiers carry these recordings with them downrange. Families cherish them as wonderful memory triggers, and people's lives are captured in small audio snapshots of their voices, as for instance as children grow up and their voices change month-to-month and year-to-year.|$|R
6000|$|I really cannot {{tell you}} how truly and tenderly I feel your letter, and how gratified I am by its contents. Your truth and {{attachment}} are always so precious to me that I cannot get my heart out on my sleeve to show it you. It is like a child, and, {{at the sound of}} some <b>familiar</b> <b>voices,</b> [...] "goes and hides." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, as {{the soft}} voice crooned on to lull the weary woman to a fitful sleep, Emil {{for a little}} while forgot his burden in a dream of Plumfield. He saw them all, heard the <b>familiar</b> <b>voices,</b> felt the grip of {{welcoming}} hands, and seemed to say to himself: 'Well, they shall not be ashamed of me if I never see them any more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Lucille," [...] a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> exclaimed, [...] "why this alarm? Is it your nerves or your {{eyesight}} {{which is}} failing you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, as Brace ceased speaking, Fred heard a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> shouting, and {{an instant}} later Sam Thorpe had grasped him by the hand.|$|E
60|$|Miss Letitia's voice {{interrupted}} her. Dull, low, rapidly muttering, it was unlike, shockingly unlike, the <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> of her aunt. It said strange words.|$|E
40|$|Damjanovic and Hanley (2007) {{showed that}} episodic {{information}} is more readily retrieved from familiar faces than <b>familiar</b> <b>voices,</b> {{even when the}} two presentation modalities are matched for overall recognition rates by blurring the faces. This pattern of performance contrasts with the results obtained by Hanley and Turner (2000) who showed that semantic information could be recalled equally easily from familiar blurred faces and voices. The current study used the procedure developed by Hanley and Turner (2000) and applied it to the stimuli used by Damjanovic and Hanley (2007). The findings showed a marked decrease in retrieval of occupations and names from <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> relative to blurred faces even though the two modalities were matched for overall levels of recognition and rated familiarity. Similar results were obtained in Experiment 2 in which the same {{participants were asked to}} recognise both faces and voices. It is argued that these findings pose problems for any model of person recognition (e. g., Burton, Bruce, & Johnston, 1990) in which familiarity decisions occur beyond the point at which information from different modalities has been integrated...|$|R

5000|$|Phonagnosia (from Ancient Greek φωνή phone, [...] "voice" [...] and γνῶσις gnosis, [...] "knowledge") {{is a type}} of agnosia, or loss of knowledge, that {{involves}} a disturbance in the recognition of <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> and the impairment of voice discrimination abilities in which the affected individual does not suffer from comprehension deficits. Phonagnosia is an auditory agnosia, an acquired auditory processing disorder resulting from brain damage, other auditory agnosias include cortical deafness and auditory verbal agnosia also known as pure word deafness.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{voice in}} the hail--a <b>familiar</b> <b>voice,</b> though {{strained}} a little and hoarse; Mills' decorous greetings, agitated but fervent. And then--Major Richard Felstead! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mother had}} moaned {{in her sleep}} and moved. The sound of the <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> seemed to calm her again. She was quiet once more.|$|E
60|$|He sat up {{suddenly}} with a start. The inner {{door of the}} room had opened and was softly closed again. A <b>familiar</b> <b>voice</b> addressed him.|$|E
60|$|Duane stole {{through the}} bushes and trees, and when nearing the porch he heard loud, angry, <b>familiar</b> <b>voices.</b> Longstreth and Lawson were quarreling again. How Duane's lucky star guided him! He had no plan of action, but his brain was equal to a hundred lightning-swift evolutions. He meant to take any risk rather than kill Longstreth. Both {{of the men were}} out on the porch. Duane wormed his way {{to the edge of the}} {{shrubbery}} and crouched low to watch for his opportunity.|$|R
5000|$|Set in East London, where Smith herself lived, A Brief History of Timewasting {{concerned}} {{the struggle of}} a single woman to fill the day, helped by her inept, sugar-loving, live-in builder Chris (Chris Neill), morbid elderly neighbour Betty (Margaret John), and Cab driver Worra (Femi Elufowoju Jr). Supporting roles were played by Jeremy Hardy and Martin Hyder. Many <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> from Radio 4, including then-chief announcer Peter Donaldson, Thought for the Day regular Rabbi Lionel Blue, and Woman's Hour stalwart Jenni Murray appeared as themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{disorders}} of the STS {{have been}} documented in which patients fail to recognize a certain stimulus, but still exhibit subcortical processing of the stimulus, {{this is known as}} an agnosia. Pure auditory agnosia (agnosia without aphasia) is found in a patients who can't identify non-speech sounds such as coughing, whistling, and crying but have no deficit in speech comprehension. Speech agnosia is known as an incapability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production, and reading ability. Patients show a recognition of the familiarity of a word, but are not able to recall its meaning. Phonagnosia is characterized as an inability to recognize <b>familiar</b> <b>voices,</b> while having other auditory abilities. Patients exhibited a double dissociation with either an inability to match names or faces with a certain famous voice, or to discriminate <b>familiar</b> <b>voices</b> from unfamiliar ones. Visual agnosia can be broken into separate disorders in regard to what is being recognized. [...] An inability to recognize written words is known as alexia or word blindness, while an inability to recognize familiar faces is known as prosopagnosia. Prosopagnosia has been shown to have a similar double dissociation as phonagnosia in that some patients show an impairment of memory for familiar faces while others show impairment when discriminating familiar faces from unfamiliar ones.|$|R
