5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} {{blood from the}} inferior thyroid arteries. The inferior parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, from either the ascending branch of the inferior thyroid arteries or the thyroid ima artery. The <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|E
5|$|The infrahyoid muscles lie {{in front}} of the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. Behind the outer wings of the thyroid lie the two carotid arteries. The trachea, laryngx, lower pharynx and {{esophagus}} all lie behind the thyroid. In this region, the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> pass next to or in the ligament.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thyroid</b> ima <b>artery</b> {{was first}} defined by German anatomist Johann E. Neubauer {{in the year}} 1772. Hence, it was named the <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> of Neubauer. The artery {{originates}} lower than the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> so it {{is also known as}} the lowest <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|R
25|$|The arteries {{supplying}} the thymus are {{branches of the}} internal thoracic, and <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> with branches from the superior <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> sometimes seen. The branches reach the thymus and travel with the septa of the capsule into the area between the cortex and medulla, where they enter the thymus itself.|$|R
25|$|The chief {{communications}} {{outside the}} skull take {{place between the}} superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> and the deep cervical artery and the descending branch of the occipital artery; the vertebral artery {{takes the place of}} the internal carotid artery within the cranium.|$|R
5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} leading causes of medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a third lobe present called the {{pyramidal}} lobe. When present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. The presence of this lobe ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. It was shown to more often arise from the left side and occasionally separated. The pyramidal lobe is also known as Lalouette's pyramid. The pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the thyroglossal duct which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent. Small accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in the adult. A small horn {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes, usually close to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> is called Zuckerkandl's tubercle.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
30|$|The thyroid is an high vascularized gland which receive {{arterial}} {{blood from the}} superior and <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> Therefore a careful hemostasis is crucial {{in order to avoid}} some complications as hematomas and/or seromas that sometimes may cause a potentially lethal asphyxia (Rosato et al. 2004). The use of the conventional technique requires more time to perform an adequate haemostasis.|$|R
50|$|The esophageal arteries {{four or five}} in number, {{arise from}} the front of the aorta, and pass obliquely {{downward}} to the esophagus, forming a chain of anastomoses along that tube, anastomosing with the esophageal branches of the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> above, and with ascending branches from the left inferior phrenic and left gastric arteries below. These arteries supply the middle third of the esophagus.|$|R
40|$|Background. The end-diastolic {{velocity}} (EDV) of <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> reflects {{peripheral blood}} flow resistance. Objective. The {{aim was to}} evaluate EDV correlations with other Doppler sonography parameters and with clinical and biochemical variables {{in a sample of}} patients with hypothyroidism caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT). Methods. A sample of 48 CAT hypothyroid patients receiving treatment with stable doses of levothyroxine was selected. The participants underwent clinical evaluation and measurement of serum thyrotropin (TSH), total triiodothyronine (T 3), total thyroxine (T 4), free T 4, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO), and antithyroglobulin antibodies (anti-Tg) and Doppler sonography. Results. The EDV of the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> (ITA-EDV) was strongly and positively correlated with the peak systolic velocity of the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> (ITA-PSV, r= 0. 919), thyroid volume (r= 0. 711), and thyroid visual vascularization pattern (TVP, r= 0. 687). There was no correlation between ITA-EDV and the clinical variables, hormones, anti-TPO, or anti-Tg. Conclusion. The strong correlation of ITA-EDV with ITA-PSV, TVP, and volume suggests that increased vascularization in CAT may be associated with a reduction in thyroid blood flow resistance, possibly due to an angiogenesis-induced increase in the total vascular cross-sectional area of the parenchyma...|$|R
25|$|The common carotid usually {{gives off}} no branch {{previous}} to its bifurcation, but it occasionally gives origin to the {{superior thyroid artery}} or its laryngeal branch, the ascending pharyngeal artery, the <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery,</b> or, more rarely, the vertebral artery.|$|E

500|$|The <b>thyroid</b> ima <b>artery</b> (thyroidea ima artery, arteria thyroidea ima, <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> of Neubauer or {{the lowest}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery)</b> is an artery {{of the head}} and neck. It is an {{anatomical}} variant that, when present, supplies blood to the thyroid gland primarily, or the trachea, the parathyroid gland and the thymus gland (as thymica accessoria) in rare cases. It has also been reported to be a compensatory artery when {{one or both of the}} <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> are absent and in a few cases the only source of blood to the thyroid gland. It varies in origin, size, blood supply, and termination, and occurs in only 3–10% of the population. Because of the variations and rarity, it [...] may lead to surgical complications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background {{in recent}} years, an {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} application of selective embolization of <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> (SETA) in the treatment of thyroid diseases is observed. In the present report, we analyse the value, safety and possible indications for preresective SETA in cases of large toxic goitres. Patients and method the study group comprised 10 patients with large toxic goitre (thyroid volume 254 ± 50 mL), including one patient with cervicomediastinal goitre and one patient with anti-thyroid drug intolerance in state of overt thyrotoxicosis. All the patients underwent SETA of the superior and/or <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries,</b> followed by thyroidectomy, performed up to thirty-six hours after SETA (23. 1 ± 11 h). After embolization, selective angiographies of <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> were performed to ensure that the targeted arteries had been completely occluded. Results and conclusion in all the patients, SETA decreased blood flow through the thyroid. Preresective SETA reduced blood loss during and after thyroidectomy and decreased the operating time, but the differences were too small to justify routine applications of preresective SETA as an adjunct to surgical treatment of toxic goitre. On the other hand, SETA is a safe and minimally-invasive technique, which may become an attractive option for quick preparation to surgery in selected patients with toxic goitre, who present anti-thyroid drug intolerance or refuse radioactive iodine treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|The thyroid {{has many}} {{anatomic}} variations. Zuckerkandl's tubercle (ZT) is the posterior extension of lateral lobes. ZT has a {{relation with the}} recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN). RLN lateral to ZT is an uncommon occurrence. This paper presents two cases of this uncommon situation. A 60 -year-old female patient with large multinodular goiter was treated with total thyroidectomy. A 69 -year-old male patient with follicular neoplasm was treated with total lobectomy. The <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> and the recurrent laryngeal nerves were identified with usual lateral approach. A left ZT was found in case 1 and a right ZT in case 2. Distal parts of the RLNs were displaced laterally by enlarged ZTs in both cases. Grade 3 ZTs composed of thyroid tissue were placed between the trachea and the RLNs. The ZT is a common anatomic feature of the thyroid. Close relation of the tubercle with the RLN is an important surgical entity. The enlarged ZT seldom pushes the nerve laterally. The knowledge of the anatomy of ZT and its relation with the RLN including all variations is mandatory for safe thyroid operations...|$|R
500|$|It differs in {{size and}} ranges from as small as {{accessory}} thyroid arteries {{to the size of}} primary thyroid vessels. The diameter of the lumen of the artery ranges from [...] The artery may be present as an accessory thyroid artery but sometimes appears to compensate for incompetence or absence of one or more main thyroid vessels. Since it begins from below the thyroid gland and ascends upwards, it is mostly associated with absence or reduced size of the inferior thyroid arteries. In such cases, it is known as the accessory <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery.</b> In rare cases, the artery has been seen to be compensating for absence of one or both superior thyroid arteries.|$|E

Background. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (CAT) frequently alters thyroid vascularization, likely {{as a result of}} the autoimmune process. Objective. To evaluate the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the thyroid vascularization of patients with hypothyroidism induced by CAT using color Doppler ultrasound parameters. Methods. In this randomized clinical trial, 43 patients who underwent levothyroxine replacement for CAT-induced hypothyroidism were randomly assigned to receive either 10 sessions of LLLT (L group, n = 23) or 10 sessions of a placebo treatment (P group, n = 20).

40|$|BackgroundNot enough {{information}} has been gathered regarding the parameters of color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU) for evaluating diffuse thyroid disorders in Taiwan. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare the CDU parameters between the right and left <b>inferior</b> <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries</b> (ITAs), and to investigate which CDU parameters can differentiate between euthyroid and hyperthyroid glands. Patients and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed data from patients who had undergone CDU to image thyroid disorders from December 2003 to April 2004 in order to analyze the CDU parameters {{that can be used to}} evaluate bilateral ITA. The mean age of the patients was 40. 8 ± 16. 6 years (range, 10 — 72 years). The female to male distribution was 2. 2 : 1 (43 females and 20 males). The ITA of patients with normal thyroid, simple goiter and autoimmune thyroid disease were scanned with CDU. The parameters evaluated included pulsatility index (PI), resistive index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PSV), blood volume flow (VF) and diameter (Diam) of ITA. We then evaluated the relationships among these parameters between the right and the left ITAs and differences in parameters between patients with euthyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Significant parameters were analyzed by the t test and simple linear regression. ResultsThere was good Pearson's correlation among all parameters (PI, RI, PSV, VF and Diam) (p 0. 05). These same results were seen in patients with euthyroidism (30 patients) and hyperthyroidism (27 patients), except that Diam of ITA had poor correlation between both sides in the hyperthyroid group. The CDU parameters of ITA were higher in patients with hyperthyroidism than in those with euthyroidism. ConclusionThere were no significant differences in CDU parameters between the right and left ITAs. However, all parameters had higher values in patients with hyperthyroidism than in those with normal thyroid function. Therefore, we conclude that unilateral ITACDU can be used to evaluate diffuse thyroid disorder. A large-scale study is needed to investigate which CDU parameters can be used to differentiate between euthyroid and hyperthyroid status in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 61 -year-old male patient with chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease and a large cervicomediastinal multinodular hyperfunctioning goiter that made thyroidectomy a daunting task, especially considering the risk of intraoperative bleeding. The preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scan showed the right thyroid lobe very deeply rooted in the mediastinum, below the horizontal plane passing through the aortic arch. The thyroid mass imprinted the arterious and venous innominate trunks. To avoid a median sternotomy and remove the enlarged thyroid through a cervical approach alone, we decided to reduce the goiter in volume preoperatively by embolizing the <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> We embolized the superior and inferior left, and the <b>inferior</b> right <b>thyroid</b> <b>arteries.</b> We spared the superior right <b>thyroid</b> <b>artery</b> because its blood supply contributed little to thyroid perfusion. After embolization, the patient was treated with antithyroid agents and corticosteroid drug therapy. At the same time, severe leukocytosis developed, thyroid hormone values increased, and a CT scan obtained 7 days after embolization showed the thyroid unchanged in volume. We therefore discharged the patient and were waiting for his laboratory blood chemical findings to return to normal. Thirty days later the patient was readmitted to hospital, and a new CT scan showed that the thyroid mass had diminished to half its initial volume. We could therefore perform a total thyroidectomy through a cervical approach alone. The only problem arose in dissecting tight right inferior laryngeal nerve adhesions to the thyroid capsule, probably sequelae of postembolization thyroiditis. Even though preoperative thyroid-artery embolization cannot be considered a routine technique in cervicomediastinal goiter surgery, in a rare patient who presents with a voluminous goiter such as the one we describe here, it is a useful procedure...|$|R
