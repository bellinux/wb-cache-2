5|$|During the First World War, an Army Remount Service depot {{was located}} nearby, with Shirehampton station {{handling}} the goods traffic, {{with up to}} 60 wagons per day inbound, mostly containing <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> sawdust for the horses.

30|$|The commonest {{symptoms}} {{associated with}} inhalation of fluoropolymer-based waterproofing sprays include non-productive cough and dyspnea, {{often accompanied by}} flu-like symptoms (Vernez et al. 2006; <b>Hays</b> <b>and</b> Spiller 2014). The illness develops rapidly, usually within minutes to hours (Vernez et al. 2006; <b>Hays</b> <b>and</b> Spiller 2014). Similar to the case reported herein, there is one previous report of DAH resulting from inhalation of a waterproofing spray (Fukui et al. 2011). Laboratory studies generally reveal evidence of acute inflammation such as leukocytosis and elevated serum CRP (<b>Hays</b> <b>and</b> Spiller 2014). In one previous case report, marked hypocalcemia was observed in the patient, which was attributed to the binding activity of fluoride to cations, such as calcium (Bracco and Favre 1998). Serious outcomes and death are uncommon (Vernez et al. 2006; <b>Hays</b> <b>and</b> Spiller 2014). Most victims, even those that present DAH, like our patient, improved with supportive care, with or without corticosteroid and inhaled β 2 adrenergic agonist therapy (Vernez et al. 2006; Fukui et al. 2011; <b>Hays</b> <b>and</b> Spiller 2014).|$|R

5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1852, Birkenhead docked {{briefly at}} Simonstown, near Cape Town. Most {{of the women}} and {{children}} disembarked along with a number of sick soldiers.

5|$|Boston {{lacked a}} regular supply of fresh meat, and many horses needed hay. On May 21, Gage ordered {{a party to}} go to Grape Island, in the outer harbor, and bring hay to Boston. When the Continentals on the {{mainland}} noticed this, they took alarm, and the militia were called out. As the British party arrived, they came under fire from the militia. The militia set fire to a barn on the island, destroying 80 tons of <b>hay,</b> <b>and</b> prevented the British from taking more than 3 tons.|$|E
5|$|Dr Eric Underwood {{began his}} {{research}} at Avondale in the mid-1930s also utilising the sheep flocks. Underwood's initial research was into {{the effects of}} sulfur on wool growth, he followed that research with investigations into botulism in sheep during 1935. These experiments were {{the first of many}} by Underwood over the next 30 years. During the 1940s he studied the nutritional value of <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> pasture for sheep, the ongoing results from these Studies in Cereal Hay production in Western Australia were published in the Journal of Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering <b>hay,</b> <b>and</b> carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E

5|$|John Milton Hay {{was born}} in Salem, Indiana, on October 8, 1838. He was the third son of Dr. Charles <b>Hay</b> <b>and</b> the former Helen Leonard. Charles Hay, born in Lexington, Kentucky, hated slavery {{and moved to the}} North in the early 1830s. A doctor, he practiced in Salem. Helen's father, David Leonard, had moved his family west from Assonet, Massachusetts, in 1818, but died en route to Vincennes, Indiana, and Helen {{relocated}} to Salem in 1830 to teach school. They married there in 1831. Charles was not successful in Salem, and moved, with his wife and children, to Warsaw, Illinois, in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Many {{members of}} the {{garrison}} tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships to escape the siege. The situation was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, the garrison was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> straw.|$|E
5|$|Marysville's economy {{historically}} {{relied on}} lumber production and agriculture, including {{the cultivation of}} strawberries, <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> oats. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Marysville was not adversely impacted unlike other cities in the county and country because of its diverse industries, including sawmills, grain mills, a tannery, a fertilizer plant, and a berry packing plant. The city's largest employer in the early 1950s, the Weiser Lumber Company, was destroyed in a fire on May 6, 1955, causing $300,000 in damage. The lumber mill at the site was later acquired by Welco Lumber, who closed the plant in 2007.|$|E

5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version he recalled the way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through <b>hay</b> <b>and</b> soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876.|$|E

5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or <b>hay,</b> <b>and</b> the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Kenneth Clarke, {{then the}} Secretary of State for Transport, stated that, since {{the route of}} the M3 was then fixed as far as Bar End, to the north of St. Catherine's Hill, that its route from there to Compton would undergo a fresh study, {{specifically}} stating that the Winchester Bypass should continue to be operational during construction of any new road, and that environmental matters were a key concern. By February 1983, consulting engineers Mott <b>Hay</b> <b>and</b> Anderson had submitted a recommendation to complete the M3 through Twyford Down. Following the completion of the motorway to Bar End in the summer of 1985, the junction at Hockley was the only set of traffic lights between London and Southampton.|$|E
