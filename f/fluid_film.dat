40|$|Not {{only are}} thin <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> of {{enormous}} importance in numerous practical applications, including painting, {{the manufacture of}} foodstuffs, and coating processes for products ranging from semi-conductors and magnetic tape to television screens, {{but they are also}} of great fundamental interest to mathematicians, physicists and engineers. Thin <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> can exhibit a wealth of fascinating behaviour, including wave propagation, rupture, and transition to quasi-periodic or chaotic structures. More details of various aspects of thin-film flow {{can be found in the}} recent review articles by Oron, Davis and Bankoff (1997) and Myers (1998), and in the volumes edited by Kistler and Schweizer (1997) and Batchelor, Moffatt and Worster (2000) ...|$|R

30|$|With the {{development}} of the manufacturing technique, the spectral transmittance of a translucent film can be accurately measured by a spectrophotometer. Based on the film transmission principle, the method for measuring the extinction coefficient of magnetic fluids can be established. The procedure of our method is as follows: first, two magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> with different thicknesses are prepared. The spectral transmittance of these films can be accurately measured using a spectrophotometer. Then, based on the film transmission principle, two transmittivity equations of the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> with regard to the optical constant of the magnetic fluid are established. Finally, by solving the two equations, the extinction coefficient of the magnetic fluid can be obtained.|$|R

50|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> {{can be described}} by the following system of exact nonlinear Hamiltonian equations which, in that respect, are a complete analogue of Euler's inviscid equations of fluid dynamics.

50|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>film</b> {{lubrication}} is the {{lubrication regime}} in which, through viscous forces, the load is fully {{supported by the}} lubricant within the space or gap between the parts in motion relative to one another object (the lubricated conjunction) and solid-solid contact is avoided.|$|E
50|$|It may be {{regarded}} as proportional to gravity forces divided by viscous forces. The Galilei number is used in viscous flow and thermal expansion calculations, for example to describe <b>fluid</b> <b>film</b> flow over walls. These flows apply to condensors or chemical columns.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, fluid films display rich dynamic properties. They can undergo {{enormous}} deformations {{away from the}} equilibrium configuration.

50|$|<b>Fluid</b> <b>films,</b> such as soap films, are {{commonly}} encountered in everyday experience. A soap film can be formed by dipping a closed contour wire into a soapy solution {{as in the}} figure on the right. Alternatively, a catenoid can be formed by dipping two rings in the soapy solution and subsequently separating them while maintaining the coaxial configuration.|$|R
40|$|The surface {{structure}} of converging thin <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> displays self-similar behavior, as {{was shown in}} the work by Diez et al [Q. Appl. Math 210, 155, 1990]. Extracting the related similarity scaling exponents from either numerical or experimental data is non-trivial. Here we provide two such methods. We apply them to experimental and numerical data on converging <b>fluid</b> <b>films</b> driven by both surface tension and gravitational forcing. In the limit of pure gravitational driving, we recover Diez' semi-analytic result, but our methods also allow us to explore the entire regime of mixed capillary and gravitational driving, up to entirely surface tension driven flows. We find scaling forms of smoothly varying exponents up to surprisingly small Bond numbers. Our experimental results are in reasonable agreement with our numerical simulations, which confirm theoretically obtained relations between the scaling exponents.
