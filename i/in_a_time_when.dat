5|$|Bordagaray gained {{publicity}} {{through the}} press through his colorful personality and various gimmicks. He appeared in bit parts {{in movies and}} grew a mustache <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> baseball players {{were expected to be}} clean shaven. He has been inducted into the Brooklyn Dodgers Hall of Fame, the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> many crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction {{would result in the}} death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E

5|$|Obi-Wan's Adventures is an {{isometric}} action-adventure {{video game}} with side-scrolling sections. Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, the game takes place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the fictional Galactic Republic is in imbalance {{as a result}} of the antagonistic Trade Federation and the evil Sith Lord's plans to take over. In the game, the player controls the Star Wars character Obi-Wan Kenobi, a young Jedi apprentice, during the events of the film Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} notable uses of this meaning is found in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Emerald City in this story {{is a place where}} {{everyone}} wears tinted glasses that make everything appear green. According to the populist interpretation of the story, the city’s color is used by the author, L. Frank Baum, to illustrate the financial system of America in his day, as he lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> America was debating the use of paper money versus gold.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{peculiar}} fact {{associated with the}} episode was a letter by Senator Hillary Clinton and Representative John M. McHugh addressed to show character Josh Lyman, concerning the closing of an upstate New York army base. Josh {{points out that the}} deep-snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively useless <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> most wars take place in desert terrain. Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue-in-cheek response pointing out flaws in Lyman’s reasoning.|$|E

5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters {{can go from}} one time to another. Characters can come into the building from any time, but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even end up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{society was}} highly stratified. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> famine was commonplace and social {{hierarchies}} were often brutally enforced, food {{was an important}} marker of social status {{in a way that}} has no equivalent today in most developed countries. According to the ideological norm, society consisted of the three estates of the realm: commoners, that is, the working classes—by far the largest group; the clergy, and the nobility. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical, with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes, bishops and their subordinates, such as priests. One was expected to remain in one's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was displayed not just by rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices, and displayed refined table manners; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette. Even dietary recommendations were different: the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.|$|E

25|$|By the 1810s, {{the first}} labour {{organizations}} {{to bring together}} workers of divergent occupations were formed. Possibly the first such union was the General Union of Trades, {{also known as the}} Philanthropic Society, founded in 1818 in Manchester. The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> trade unions were still illegal.|$|E
25|$|Another song whose essence is {{undoubtedly}} in the title. Mina Harker is the intended bride of Bram Stoker's infamous Count Dracula. The lyrics {{in this case}} are set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> Mina is irrevocably lost {{to him and he}} is pining for his immortal beloved. This song is a blend of gothic romance and balls-to-the-wall thrash.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, McVagh {{left the}} {{presidency}} of the Northern Union to come to Canada as the editor of the Canadian Watchman Magazine. In 1923, he became president of the Eastern Canadian Union Conference and continued on with his work as editor. This saved the organization the expense of one position <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> finances were strained.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 1956, it was {{announced}} that the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics would be awarded to Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain.

Despite the festivities, the atmosphere in the lab was unhealthy.|$|E
25|$|Through her stories, Kate Chopin wrote {{a kind of}} {{autobiography}} {{and described}} her societies; {{she had grown up}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> her surroundings included the abolitionist movements before the American Civil War, and their influence on freedmen education and rights afterward, as well as the emergence of feminism. Her ideas and descriptions were not reporting, but her stories expressed the reality of her world.|$|E

25|$|He also {{designed}} the Al Jolson tomb in Hillside Memorial Park, to which Jolson's body was moved in 1951. The tomb and fountain is prominently {{visible from the}} adjacent San Diego Freeway. It is perhaps a fitting tribute to both Williams and Jolson that he was chosen to design Jolson's resting place, as Jolson {{had a long history}} of supporting African-American entertainers, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> that was controversial.|$|E
25|$|Though Tissot's {{ideas are}} now {{considered}} conjectural at best, his treatise {{was presented as}} a scholarly, scientific work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> experimental physiology was practically nonexistent. The authority with which the work was subsequently treated – Tissot's arguments were even acknowledged and echoed by luminaries such as Kant and Voltaire – arguably turned the perception of masturbation in Western medicine {{over the next two}} centuries into that of a debilitating illness.|$|E
25|$|The Saint {{has many}} partners, though none last {{throughout}} the series. For {{the first half}} until the late 1940s, the most recurrent is Patricia Holm, his girlfriend, who {{was introduced in the}} first story, the 1928 novel Meet the Tiger in which she shows herself a capable adventurer. Holm appeared erratically throughout the series, sometimes disappearing for books at a time. Templar and Holm lived together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> common-law relationships were uncommon and, in some areas, illegal.|$|E
