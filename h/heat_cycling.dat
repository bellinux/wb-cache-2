50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty {{to crank the engine}} when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to <b>heat</b> <b>cycling.</b>|$|E

40|$|Duct leakage {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major source of energy loss in residential buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations (both physical measurements and visual observations) of duct systems have shown that these seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. In this study, three test methods were used to test the longevity of duct sealants: simple heating, <b>heat</b> <b>cycling</b> and combined pressure and <b>heat</b> <b>cycling</b> (aging). The most advanced method was the "aging " test, developed to evaluate the longevity of duct sealants by alternatively blowing hot (75 °C) and cold (- 5 °C) air through test sections, with the apparatus cycling between hot and cold air quickly. The temperatures and cycle length were chosen to accelerate the aging process of the duct seals. The aging apparatus was able to test eight samples at a time, with the test samples constructed from standard duct fittings. The results of these tests were used to evaluate different sealants relative to each other, so that recommendations regarding duct sealants may be developed. Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with rubber adhesive) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants.

During each intervention, a cuff inflated to 60 mm Hg was placed on 1 arm to unilaterally manipulate the shear rate stimulus. In the noncuffed arm, antegrade flow and shear increased similarly in response to each intervention (ANOVA; P< 0. 001, no interaction between interventions; P= 0. 71). Baseline flow-mediated dilation (4. 6 %, 6. 9 %, and 6. 7 %) increased similarly in response to <b>heating,</b> handgrip, and <b>cycling</b> (8. 1 %, 10. 4 %, and 8. 9 %, ANOVA; P< 0. 001, no interaction; P= 0. 89).

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of probiotic supplementation on bone health of egg-laying and meat-type chickens. Dietary supplementation of a multi-species based probiotic reduced the percentage of shell-less eggs beginning at 4 wk following treatment and increased tibial and femoral bone mineral density in egg-laying hens at 7 wk post-treatment. Similarly, bone mineralization accrual of the tibia and femur was improved in broilers subjected to daily <b>cycling</b> <b>heating</b> episodes fed the same probiotic for 6 wk. Broilers consuming the probiotic also had a lower incidence of lameness as characterized by an improved gait score and longer latency to lie. The effects of a single-species based probiotic fed to broilers beginning at 1 d of age on bone health were investigated. Bone mineral densities of the tibia and femur were increased at 43 d of age. Concomitantly, serum calcium concentrations were increased at 14 d of age, serotonin levels were up-regulated in the raphe nuclei, and the catecholamine concentrations of NE and DA were down-regulated in the hypothalamus at 43 d of age. With the exception of bone mineral density, the bone health of probiotic-fed broilers was maintained under elevated temperature as indicated by larger bones and higher bone mineral content of the tibia and femur at 43 d of age accompanied by reduced plasma concentrations of TNF-?, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Dietary inclusion of probiotics is a useful strategy for improving skeletal health in chickens under both normal and elevated ambient temperature. Probiotics enhance intestinal absorption of nutrients like calcium and may reduce sympathetic activity, thus improving mineralization of bone.

Especially for power electronics, where high voltages and currents lead to high temperatures because of power losses, it is important to know these loads for failure analysis and lifetime prediction. One opportunity to measure these is to replace the device with a surface structured test chip and use strain gauges to determine the stresses.

In parallel with a normalised CEM II mortar (water-to-cement ratio (W/C) of 0. 5), a CEM V-cement-based concrete, used in nuclear waste storage applications, is studied. For normalised mortar, gas retention is evidenced, depending on the sample size (scale effect), water saturation level Sw, and heating rate. For dry normalised mortar, permeability may be divided by two during heating. In conjunction with thermo-gravimetry analysis (TGA) results, such evolution is attributed to the dehydration of C–S–H around 150 °C. Indeed, mass loss after <b>heat</b> <b>cycling</b> is substantially higher than that due to free water release solely: mortar loses structural, bound water during the process. For partially-saturated and long mortar samples, a gas retention phenomenon is recorded when heating at a rate of ca. 4. 9 °C/min. Our analysis is that free water inside the macropores, as well as bound water released from the C–S–H, dilates or vaporizes, and obstructs the interconnected porous network. Due to moisture clogging, no more gas is allowed through the material pore network: a so-called gas retention phenomenon occurs. Most interestingly, although loosing structural water like normalised mortar, yet over a wider temperature range, dry CEM V concrete displays good temperature resistance, as its permeability remains constant during heating. For highly partially-saturated concrete, a gas retention effect is recorded. As a conclusion, observed phenomena at the laboratory scale testify of potentially strong gas retention effects upon engineering structures subjected to temperature gradients over time. Indeed, quite low temperature rises (and heating rates) are able to induce moisture clogging inside partially-saturated materials. It is also concluded that cement-based material composition, i. e. bound water release ability, is influential in gas transport phenomena under temperature...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of kinematically constrained thermal <b>cycling</b> (<b>heating,</b> isothermal holding and cooling) on the recovery stress in annealed nickel titanium wire was investigated. A 4 % pre-strained nickel titanium wire was heated to temperatures (150, 200, 250 and 300 °C) {{much higher than the}} austenite finish temperature. It was observed that the maximum recovery stress obtained at different conditions decreases significantly after the first thermal cycle and reduces gradually with further increasing the number of thermal cycles. It was also seen that the recovery stress increases with time during isothermal holding at 150 °C. During isothermal holding at other temperatures, the recovery stress shows an exponential decrease, and the decrease rate of the recovery stress depends on the isothermal holding temperature. The higher isothermal holding temperature is the more the recovery stress decreases. The decrease rate reduces with increasing the number of thermal cycles. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of thin Fe-Cr-Al {{heating element}} strips was investigated {{with respect to}} the oxidation limited life times and geometrical changes during resistance and furnace heating. For this purpose, isothermal and cyclic oxidation tests varying in their total exposure time and cycle duration were performed in the temperature range 1050 - 1200 degrees C. Specimens subjected to rapid cyclic, resistance heating revealed shorter life times than calculated for specimens subjected to isothermal exposure. The life times were found to increase with increasing cycle duration and hence decreasing number of cycles for a given time at temperature. This life time decrease is related to an "hour glass" waviness of the specimens, which develops during prolonged thermal cycling. The development of this plastic deformation also occurred during furnace <b>heated,</b> thermal <b>cycling</b> tests. A two-step mechanism is introduced combining an oxidation kinetics related time to the onset of significant waviness with an enhancement of this waviness {{as a result of a}} ratcheting effect. The latter seems to strongly depend on the number of cycles and on the plastic deformation generated during each cycle rather than on the total time at temperature. The development of an "hour glass" waviness leads to an enhanced aluminium depletion due to an increase of the specimen surface area. Additional deformation phenomena like "hot tube" or "corkscrew" behaviour occur during the resistance heating tests. These are related to a temperature gradient that develops over the specimen width due to the poor aspect ratio of the specimens...|$|R
40|$|Heat removal {{in metal}} {{structures}} {{is often the}} limiting factor in high power, high frequency microwave tube devices. As higher critical heat flux cooling techniques are found, the operating power of the microwave device may be increased if other limiting factors are not of importance. Larger output powers may be realized for brief periods in time {{at the expense of}} operating in a pulsed power and/or pulsed cooling mode. During these brief periods, temporary temperature fluctuations {{on the walls of the}} microwave tube will be realized. It is hypothesized that the temperature fluctuations and to a much lesser extent temperature gradients may influence secondary electron emission resulting from primary electrons colliding with the microwave wall. Low energy primary electrons, that penetrate the microwave wall, experience the collective effects of the electrons (plasmons) in the conduction band of the metal. It is anticipated that the surface and bulk temperature of the metal wall influences the ability for plasmons to interact with the primary electron in the scattering process. Further, aging effects resulting from <b>heat</b> stress <b>cycling</b> of the metal cavity may alter the state of the cavity walls leading to changes in the secondary electron emission properties. Pulsed, low energy (1 keV), low beam currents are used to examine collectively the change in the spatial distribution profile of secondary electrons as the sample cools without significantly modifying or stressing the surface of the sample under test. SEE distribution profiles will be presented for a metal target at room temperature and in transient cooling mode with peak temperatures on the order of 390 deg K...|$|R
