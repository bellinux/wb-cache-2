25|$|Hasidic Judaism is {{a branch}} of Orthodox Judaism that {{promotes}} spirituality and joy through the popularisation and <b>internalisation</b> of Jewish mysticism as the fundamental aspects of the Jewish faith. Hasidism comprises part of contemporary Ultra-Orthodox Judaism, alongside the previous Talmudic Lithuanian-Yeshiva approach and the Oriental Sephardi tradition.|$|E
25|$|In invertebrates, {{just as in}} Drosophila, {{the binding}} of Hedgehog to PTCH leads to <b>internalisation</b> and {{sequestration}} of the ligand. Consequently, in vivo the passage of hedgehog over a receptive field that expresses the receptor leads to attenuation of the signal, an effect called ligand-dependent antagonism (LDA). In contrast to Drosophila, vertebrates possess another level of hedgehog regulation through LDA mediated by Hh-interacting protein 1 (HHIP1). HHIP1 also sequesters hedgehog ligands, but unlike PTCH, it {{has no effect on}} the activity of SMO.|$|E
25|$|The {{second section}} of the Hasidic text the Tanya, by Schneur Zalman of Liadi (Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah-Gate of Unity and Faith), brings the mystical Panentheism of the founder of Hasidism, the Baal Shem Tov, into {{philosophical}} explanation. It explains the Hasidic interpretation of God's Unity {{in the first two}} lines of the Shema, based upon their interpretation in Kabbalah. The emphasis on Divine Omnipresence and immanence lies behind Hasidic joy and dveikut, and its stress on transforming the material into spiritual worship. In this <b>internalisation</b> of Kabbalistic ideas, the Hasidic follower seeks to reveal the Unity and hidden holiness in all activities of life.|$|E
25|$|One of Castoriadis' many {{important}} contributions to social theory {{was the idea}} that social change involves radical discontinuities that cannot be understood in terms of any determinate causes or presented as a sequence of events. Change emerges through the social imaginary without strict determinations, but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as revolution. Any knowledge of society and social change can exist only by referring to (or by positing) social imaginary significations. Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of modernity centered on the principal categories of social institutions and social imaginary significations; in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the radical imagination and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former. (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of the radical imaginary can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.) However, the social imaginary cannot be reduced or attributed to subjective imagination, since the individual is informed through an <b>internalisation</b> of social significations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} towards the <b>internalisation</b> of the {{printing}} {{of the newspaper}} was taken on 5 October 1908, approximately {{two years after the}} setting up of the company, when the board launched a subscription for a daily edition of Sinn Féin. In spite of the reluctance of his friends to take such a financial risk, the astute Griffith was aware of a shift in Irish reading habits and was convinced that there was a market for a new daily newspaper. At the same time, the weekly Sinn Féin was finding it difficult to defend itself against attacks from its daily competitors.|$|E
2500|$|Confucius's {{political}} thought {{is based upon}} his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through [...] "rites" [...] (lǐ) and people's natural morality, and not by using bribery and coercion. He explained {{that this is one}} of the most important analects: [...] "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good." [...] (Translated by James Legge) in the Great Learning (...) [...] This [...] "sense of shame" [...] is an <b>internalisation</b> of duty, where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in Legalism.|$|E
2500|$|Hasidic Judaism, meaning [...] "piety" [...] (or [...] "loving kindness"), is {{a branch}} of Orthodox Judaism that {{promotes}} spirituality through the popularisation and <b>internalisation</b> of Jewish mysticism as the fundamental aspect of the faith. It was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov as a reaction against overly legalistic Judaism. His example began the characteristic veneration of leadership in Hasidism as embodiments and intercessors of Divinity for the followers. Opposite to this, Hasidic teachings cherished the sincerity and concealed holiness of the unlettered common folk, and their equality with the scholarly elite. The emphasis on the Immanent Divine presence in everything gave new value to prayer and deeds of kindness, alongside Rabbinic supremacy of study, and replaced historical mystical (kabbalistic) and ethical (musar) asceticism and admonishment with optimism, encouragement, and daily fervour. This populist emotional revival accompanied the elite ideal of nullification to paradoxical Divine Panentheism, through intellectual articulation of inner dimensions of mystical thought.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{indicates}} that the more corporal punishment children receive, {{the more likely they}} are as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. Children who are spanked more as children are more likely as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general. A number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with [...] "higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses", even when controlling for other factors. While these associations do not prove causation, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. According to research, corporal punishment of children predicts weaker <b>internalisation</b> of values such as empathy, altruism, and resistance to temptation. According to researcher Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba, it should therefore not be surprising that corporal punishment [...] "consistently predicts increased levels of antisocial behavior [...] as well as dating violence".|$|E
2500|$|Author Richard Webster {{comments}} in A Brief History of Blasphemy (1990) that [...] "internalised censorship {{played a significant}} role in the handling" [...] of Monty Python's Life of Brian. In his view, [...] "As a satire on religion, this film might well be considered a rather slight production. As blasphemy it was, even in its original version, extremely mild. Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK. Once again a blasphemy was restrained – or its circulation effectively curtailed – not by the force of law but by the <b>internalisation</b> of this law." [...] On its initial release in the UK, the film was banned by several town councils – some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries, or had not even seen the film. A member of Harrogate council, one of those that banned the film, revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film, and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the Nationwide Festival of Light, a grouping with an evangelical Christian base, of which they knew nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Understanding the sefirot {{throughout}} Jewish mysticism {{is achieved}} by their correspondence to the soul of man. This applies to the outer, Kabbalistic structure of the sefirot. It applies even more to their inner dimensions, which correspond to inner psychological qualities {{in the perception of}} man. Identifying the essential spiritual properties of the soul gives the best insight into their Divine source, and in the process reveals the spiritual beauty of the soul. In Hasidic thought these inner dimensions of the sefirot are called the Powers of the Soul (...) [...] Hasidism sought the <b>internalisation</b> of the abstract ideas of Kabbalah, both outwardly in joyful sincerity of dveikus in daily life, acts of loving-kindness and prayer; and inwardly in its profound new articulation of Jewish mystical thought, by relating it to the inner life of man. Articulation of the sefirot in Hasidic philosophy is primarily concerned with their inner dimensions, and exploring the direct, enlivening contribution of each in man's spiritual worship of God. Kabbalah focuses on the esoteric manifestations of God in Creation, the vessels of Divinity. Hasidut looks at the lights that fill these vessels, how the structures reveal the Divine essence, and how this inwardness can be perceived. This difference {{can be seen in the}} names of these two stages of Jewish mysticism. [...] "Kabbalah" [...] in Hebrew is derived from [...] "kabal" [...] (to [...] "receive" [...] as a vessel). [...] "Hasidut" [...] is from [...] "chesed" [...] ("loving-kindness"), considered the first and greatest sefirah, also called [...] "Greatness", the wish to reveal and share. The names of the sefirot come from Kabbalah, and describe the Divine effect that each has upon Creation, but not their inner qualities. Hasidic thought uses new descriptive terms for the inner dimensions of the sefirot: ...|$|E

50|$|CD63 is {{extensively}} and variably glycosylated and the EC2 region contain three potential N-linked glycosylation sites (N130, N150, and N172). Mutants N130A and N150A {{were similar}} to hCD63Wt with respect to intracellular localisation and <b>internalisation.</b> However, the hCD63N172A mutant showed a mainly cell surface localisation and low <b>internalisation.</b> Expression of a mutant lacking all three glycosylation sites was very unstable. It was speculated that the reduced <b>internalisation</b> of CD63N172A {{might be due to}} changes in its interaction with cell surface molecules. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed some evidence of a protein (100kDa) associating with CD63N172A, but this was not consistent. However, an association between CD63Wt and β2 integrin (CD18) was shown by co-internalisation of these proteins. Interactions with CD63 may therefore affect the trafficking and function of β2 integrins.|$|E

In addition, the key idea of <b>internalisation</b> was originally introduced by Vygotsky as [...] "the internal reconstruction of an external operation."

50|$|Multi-monoubiquitination can mark transmembrane {{proteins}} (for example, receptors) {{for removal}} from membranes (<b>internalisation)</b> and fulfil several signalling roles within the cell. When cell-surface transmembrane molecules are tagged with ubiquitin, the subcellular localization of the protein is altered, often targeting the protein for destruction in lysosomes. This {{serves as a}} negative feedback mechanism because often the stimulation of receptors by ligands increases their rate of ubiquitination and <b>internalisation.</b> Like monoubiquitination, lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains also has {{a role in the}} trafficking some membrane proteins.|$|E

50|$|One {{thing that}} may affect what an {{individual}} internalises are role models. Role models often {{speed up the process}} of socialisation and encourages the speed of <b>internalisation</b> as if someone an individual respects is seen to endorse a particular set of norms, the individual {{is more likely to be}} prepared to accept, and so internalise, those norms. This is called the process of identification. <b>Internalisation</b> helps one define who they are and create their own identity and values within a society that has already created a norm set of values and practices for them.|$|E
