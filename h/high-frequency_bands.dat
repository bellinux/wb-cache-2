30|$|According to {{sampling}} theory [41], {{the decrease}} of sampling frequency {{will result in}} aliasing problem for <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band.</b> On the other hand, when the bandwidth of signal is narrow, higher downsample ratio or lower sampling frequency is allowed without aliasing problem. When applying the generic subsample algorithm for video compression, for high-variation sequences, the aliasing problem occurs and leads to considerable quality degradation because the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band</b> is messed up. Papers [42, 43] hence propose adaptive subsample algorithms to solve the problem. They employed the variable subsample pattern for spatial <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band,</b> that is, edge pixels. However, the motion estimation is used for interframe prediction and temporal <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band</b> should be mainly treated carefully. Therefore, we determine the subsample ratio by the interframe variation. The interframe variation can be characterized by the motion-level of content. The ZMVC {{is a good sign}} for the motion-level detection because it is feasible for measurement and requires low computation load. The high ZMVC means that the interframe variation is low and vice versa. Hence, we can set high subsample ratio for high ZMVCs and low subsample ratio for low ZMVCs. Doing so, the aliasing problem can be alleviated and the quality can be frozen within an acceptable range.|$|R

For example, naming a picture following a strongly constraining temporal context is faster than naming a picture after a weakly constraining temporal context. We used sentences as naturalistic stimuli to manipulate expectations on upcoming pictures without prior training. Here, using intracranial recordings from the human hippocampus we found more power in the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band</b> prior to high-expected pictures than weakly expected ones. We applied pattern similarity analysis on the temporal pattern of hippocampal <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band</b> activity in single hippocampal contacts. We found that greater similarity {{in the pattern of}} hippocampal field potentials between pre-picture interval and expected picture interval in the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band</b> predicted picture-naming latencies.

30|$|Kim et al. [27] have {{proposed}} a frequency adaptive line compression (FALC) method with decreased complexity comparing to existing compression methods. Instead of using bit planes of RGB data, FALC method uses whole coefficients of discrete wavelet transforms of YCuCv color space data. After four levels of wavelet transforms, the original data are transformed into four <b>high-frequency</b> <b>bands</b> and one low-frequency band. Then, selective zero-zone quantization is performed in the four <b>high-frequency</b> <b>bands.</b> For the low-frequency band, predictive coding removes redundancy. Data from each frequency band are then compressed with a variable length coding (VLC) method based on Huffman coding. The compression ratio of FALC surpasses 3 : 1 with a visually lossless condition. However, further improvement is needed to actively reduce more power in IoT-applied environments.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  5, the {{barometric}} efficiencies of the Baodi and Zuojiazhuang wells {{decrease with increasing}} frequency from the intermediate- to the <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band,</b> which {{may be due to}} the wellbore storage effect (Rojstaczer 1988 a). We can therefore suppose that the wellbore storage effect exists in the two wells. The phases at low frequencies are stable and close to zero and decrease with increasing frequency from the low- to the intermediate-frequency band, which also indicates that the wellbore storage effect might exist. In the intermediate-frequency band (0.5 – 8  cpd), the influence from the Earth tide is remarkable, and the barometric responses are therefore unstable. In the relatively <b>high-frequency</b> <b>band</b> (f >  6  cpd), the signal-to-noise ratio in the water level may be low and the barometric signals are relatively weak, and so the phases in the high-frequency range vary in a disorderly manner.
