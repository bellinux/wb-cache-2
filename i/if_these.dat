5|$|Some {{confusion}} {{still exists}} {{as to what}} treatments a patient may receive in hospice care.

5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even <b>if</b> <b>these</b> are not gregarious.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. <b>If</b> <b>these</b> orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action.
