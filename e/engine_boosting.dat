This technology has the potential to facilitate downsizing of automotive engines in order to yield benefits in terms of their transient performance, the fuel consumption and emissions output. This review investigates the benefits and drawbacks of series and parallel turbocharging arrangements. Since the effectiveness of using the boosting technology crucially depends on the control scheme applied, developments in the modelling and control approaches used in single-stage, series and parallel turbocharging are also examined. In comparison with single-stage turbocharging, using several turbochargers in series or parallel can provide a faster transient response without compromising the fuel consumption, while also having the potential to provide higher boost pressures. Novel non-linear and robust control approaches have demonstrated improvements in performance and robustness over traditional approaches used in commercial engine control relying on separate control loops for the different engine variables...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{automotive}} industry {{has been involved in}} {{the development and implementation of}} CO 2 reducing concepts such as the engines downsizing, stop/start systems as well as more costly full hybrid solutions and, more recently, waste heat recovery technologies. These latter include ThermoElectric Generator (TEG), Rankine cycle and Electric Turbo Compound (ETC) that have been practically implemented on few heavy-duty application but have not been proved yet as effective and affordable solutions for the automotive industry. The paper deals with the analysis of opportunities and challenges of the Electric Turbo Compound for automotive light-duty engines. In the ETC concept the turbine-compressor shaft is connected to an electric machine, which can work either as generator or motor. In the former case the power can satisfy the vehicle electrical demand to drive the auxiliaries or stored in the batteries. In the latter case the electric motor can assist the turbine and speed up the compressor when requested. Potentially the ETC offers great opportunity for better performance and emissions control, nevertheless its management needs to be carefully set, being strongly dependent on transient operation. In the paper the benefits achievable by the electric turbo compound have been analyzed by a comprehensive powertrain model. The model considers in-cylinder processes by a steady-state approach and simulates the ETC dynamics, accounting for the mutual interactions of <b>engine</b> <b>boosting,</b> exhaust temperature and pressure, auxiliaries demand and motor/generator management. The simulations have been carried out against generic and standard driving conditions (i. e. EUDC, FTP) and several ETC management strategies, assuming as reference a small Diesel passenger car. The results evidence that significant improvement of fuel economy and CO 2 reduction can be achieved by suitable management of ETC operation, depending on engine speed and load and auxiliaries demand...|$|E
40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>boosting</b> via {{turbocharging}} is {{a method}} to increase the engine power output with minimal or no increase in engine parasitic, frictional and pumping losses. Turbocharging in conjunction with engine down-sizing and down-speeding allows a reduction of engine fuel consumption, while maintaining a high engine power output. However, turbocharging introduces a lag in engine transient response, caused by the finite amount of time required by the turbocharger to accelerate, which has to be minimized. Electric turbocharger assistance consists of coupling an electric motor/generator to a standard turbocharger. The scope of the motor/generator {{is to increase the}} power available to accelerate the rotor assembly, so that the time to boost is reduced. The motor/generator could also be utilized to brake the turbocharger to control boost and avoid over-speeds, thus replacing the conventional waste-gate. Furthermore, electric assistance allows turbocompounding to be implemented. Turbocompounding improves the engine efficiency by utilizing the turbine and motor/generator to recuperate additional exhaust flow energy. In this thesis, the electric turbocharger assistance impact on the turbocharger and engine performance is studied. An electrically assisted turbocharger prototype has been developed by industrial partners and it has been tested by the author of this thesis. The performance of the turbocharger turbine and motor/generator has been characterized over the full speed range and the impact of the electric assistance on the turbine flow has been investigated experimentally. It has not been possible to characterize the turbine up to choking conditions, so the data has been extrapolated via a mean-line model. The performance data obtained has been utilized to generate a model of the assisted turbocharger, which has been coupled to a one-dimensional model of a non-highway 7 -litre diesel engine. This model has been utilized to study the impact of electric turbocharger assistance on the engine transient performance. The electrical machine characterization revealed that the switched reluctance motor/generator operates efficiently up to a speed of 135, 000 rev/min, {{making it one of the}} fastest running switched reluctance machines of this size.

40|$|Engine {{downsizing}} with a turbocharger {{has become}} popular {{these days in}} automotive industries. Downsizing the engine lets the engine operate in a more efficient region, and the <b>engine</b> <b>boosting</b> compensates for the power loss accompanied by downsizing. However, the use of high boost in a downsized engine is limited by knock. Changing operating parameters such as spark timing has shown {{to be effective in}} avoiding knock. However, those strategies usually deteriorate efficiency of the engine. Another method to suppress knock without lowering efficiency is to use knock resistant fuels. Among them ethanol has gotten a large attention due to its renewable characteristics. About 13. 3 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in 2012, and about 99 % of them are used as fuel added to gasoline. However, the optimal use of ethanol in a spark ignited engine as a knock suppressing additive is not well quantified. Also, operation limitations of a knock free engine are not well known. The objective of this project was to determine the knock onset engine operating conditions and to explore the potential of a direct injection of ethanol enhanced fuels. An engine with a turbocharger was used to measure efficiencies of the engine over the wide range of operating points. Speed range was chosen from 1500 rpm to 3000 rpm in which vehicle is usually driven in the driving cycle. Then, knock onset of different ethanol-gasoline blends, from 0 % ethanol to 85 % ethanol contents with 91 RON gasoline, were determined. Generated engine fuel consumption maps with knock onset limits were utilized in a vehicle driving simulation tool. In a simulation, the consumption of gasoline and knock suppressing fuels was determined in different driving cycles. Finally, effects of downsizig and spark retard on ethanol fraction in the fuel were determined. by Young Suk Jo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Aggressive engine downsizing, {{variable}} {{compression ratio}} {{and use of the}} Atkinson cycle are being combined to improve fuel economy by up to 40 percent relative to port fuel injected gasoline engines, while maintaining full engine power. Approach Engine downsizing is viewed by US and foreign automobile manufacturers {{as one of the best}} options for improving fuel economy. While this strategy has already demonstrated a degree of success, downsizing and fuel economy gains are currently limited. With new {{variable compression ratio}} technology however, the degree of engine downsizing and fuel economy improvement can be greatly increased. A small variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has the potential to return significantly higher vehicle fuel economy while also providing high power. Affordability and potential for near term commercialization are key attributes of the Envera VCR engine. VCR Technology To meet torque and power requirements, a smaller engine needs to do more work per stroke. This is typically accomplished by boosting the incoming charge with either a turbo or supercharger so that more energy is present in the cylinder per stroke to do the work. With current production engines the degree of <b>engine</b> <b>boosting</b> (which correlates to downsizing) is limited by detonation (combustion knock) at high boost levels. Additionally, the turbo or supercharger needs to be responsive and efficient while providing the needed boost. VCR technology eliminates the limitation of engine knock at high load levels by reducing compression ratio to {approx} 9 : 1 (or whatever level is appropriate) when high boost pressures are needed. By reducing the compression ratio during high load demand periods there is increased volume in the cylinder at top dead center (TDC) which allows more charge (or energy) to be present in the cylinder without increasing the peak pressure. Cylinder pressure is thus kept below the level at which the engine would begin to knock. When loads on the engine are low the compression ratio can be raised (to as much as 18 : 1) providing high engine efficiency. It is important to recognize that for a well designed VCR engine cylinder pressure does not need to be higher than found in current production turbocharged engines. As such, there is no need for a stronger crankcase, bearings and other load bearing parts within the VCR engine. The Envera VCR mechanism uses an eccentric carrier approach to adjust engine compression ratio. The crankshaft main bearings are mounted in this eccentric carrier or 'crankshaft cradle' and pivoting the eccentric carrier 30 degrees adjusts compression ratio from 9 : 1 to 18 : 1. The eccentric carrier is made up of a casting that provides rigid support for the main bearings, and removable upper bearing caps. Oil feed to the main bearings transits through the bearing cap fastener sockets. The eccentric carrier design was chosen for its low cost and rigid support of the main bearings. A control shaft and connecting links are used to pivot the eccentric carrier. The control shaft mechanism features compression ratio lock-up at minimum and maximum compression ratio settings. The control shaft method of pivoting the eccentric carrier was selected due to its lock-up capability. The control shaft can be rotated by a hydraulic actuator or an electric motor. The engine shown in Figures 3 and 4 has a hydraulic actuator that was developed under the current program. In-line 4 -cylinder engines are significantly less expensive than V engines because an entire cylinder head can be eliminated. The cost savings from eliminating cylinders and an entire cylinder head will notably offset the added cost of the VCR and supercharging. Replacing V 6 and V 8 engines with in-line VCR 4 -cylinder engines will provide high fuel economy at low cost. Numerous enabling technologies exist which have the potential to increase engine efficiency. The greatest efficiency gains are realized when the right combination of advanced and new technologies are packaged together to provide the greatest gains at the least cost. Aggressive engine downsizing with variable compression ratio and use of the extended Atkinson cycle can provide large fuel economy gains that are exceptionally cost effective. Analysis indicates that a 2. 2 L supercharged Envera VCR engine can match the torque of a larger V 8 engine at 2000 rpm. The VCR engine's high torque value at low engine speed is beneficial for maintaining the driving feel and responsiveness of the larger V 8 engine. The Envera VCR engine will attain high efficiency at {approx} 100 Nm primarily due to the combination of engine down-sizing and use of the Atkinson cycle. Qualitatively the fuel economy gain realized from down-sizing from a V 8 to an Atkinson-cycle I- 4 is about twice as large as the benefits from down-sizing from a V 8 to a Turbo V 6 when evaluated at 100 Nm 2000 rpm...|$|E
