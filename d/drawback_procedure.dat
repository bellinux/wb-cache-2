50|$|The {{two main}} {{biological}} sources for cancer secretomics are cancer cell line supernatants and proximal biological fluids, the fluids {{in contact with}} a tumor. Cancer cell line supernatant is an attractive source of secreted proteins. There are many standardized cell lines available and supernatant is much simpler to analyze than proximal body fluid. But {{it is unclear whether}} a cell line secretome is a good representation of an actual tumor in its specific microenvironment and a standardized cell line is not illustrative of the heterogeneity of a real tumor. Analysis of proximal fluids can give a better idea of a human tumor secretome, but this method also has its <b>drawbacks.</b> <b>Procedures</b> for collecting proximal fluids still need to be standardized and non-malignant controls are needed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} approximate multidimensional functions using the Sweeping Hinge Algorithm (SHA) {{in combination with the}} Truncated Hinging Hyperplanes (THH) as approximation units. The paper focuses on the real learning problems where some noise is present in the available examples.

Fair simulations contribute to support the good behavior of this purely constructive method against the noise. 1 INTRODUCTION The two major <b>drawbacks</b> learning <b>procedures</b> suffer from in presence of noise can be roughly classified as follows: 1.

40|$|Abstract — The {{computation}} of the maximun {{loading point}} (MLP) {{is crucial to}} power systems operation and control, There are several methodologies proposed to compute it. The continuation load flow (CLF) is very robust, widely known to draw PV curves, and can be also used for computing the MLP. However it has some <b>drawbacks,</b> the <b>procedure</b> may diverge for some cases {{and it is very}} conservative for some networks, taking many iterations. Other efficient technique using nonlinear programming (NLP) has been proposed recently. This method presents clear advantages due to the orientation of the process in direction to the MLP. This paper presents a method based on the CLF and NLP. The idea is to compute the MLP taking some features of the CLF combined with characteristics of NLP. With this combination the MLP can be evaluated with more accuracy and efficiency. Simulations for different systems including IEEE test systems are shown to evaluate the performance of the method. Some comparisons of the methodologies are also shown. Index Terms — Power system security, voltage stability, maxi-mum loading point, nonlinear programming...|$|R

30|$|A steady {{procedure}} {{that can be}} used to calculate the piezomagnetic field is as follows: first, the spatial distribution of the initial magnetization is assumed by using magnetic survey data; next, the change in magnetization, due to the piezomagnetic effect at each point, is calculated; finally, changes in the magnetic field generated by different parts of the crust are integrated to obtain the magnitude of the entire piezomagnetic field (e.g., Oshiman et al., 1997; Nishida et al., 2004). A <b>drawback</b> of this <b>procedure</b> is the non-uniqueness of solutions in the potential theory. Even in the case that the magnetic field generated by the initial magnetization is completely known, the explicit distribution of the initial magnetizations cannot be determined uniquely. Consequently, the resultant piezomagnetic field is not determined uniquely. This result means that the observed changes in the magnetic field are not directly converted to changes in stress.|$|R

30|$|In {{existing}} literature, while incorporating N- 1 constraints into transmission expansion {{models is}} common practice [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], embedding constraints of short circuit currents into transmission expansion planning models is not thoroughly discussed. Since short circuit currents have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power grid planning models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power grid planning project, instead of embedding constraints in the grid planning model, short circuit currents are calculated after determining {{the power grid}} planning result. This is an open-loop approach in which short circuit currents are checked manually. Once the short circuit currents are excessive, the power grid planning result needs modifying according to artificial experience.
