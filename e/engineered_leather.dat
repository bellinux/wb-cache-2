5000|$|Leeds Bridge {{cast iron}} {{designed}} (1820), built {{after his death}} by the resident <b>engineer</b> G. <b>Leather</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{established}} in the 1830s, under the powers of the Dunham Bridge Act 1830, when a group of local businessmen built the original cast iron construction. It was a four-span cast-iron structure by the civil <b>engineer,</b> George <b>Leather</b> (1786-1870).|$|R
50|$|It {{received}} the Royal Assent on 21 May 1801, and work commenced immediately with William Jessop as <b>engineer,</b> George <b>Leather</b> as resident <b>engineer,</b> and joint contractor with Benjamin Outram. The line started at a wharf on the Thames at Wandsworth, and ascended gently through Tooting and Mitcham to Pitlake Mead in Croydon. There was a branch from {{near the site}} of the Mitcham Junction to oil-cake mills at Hackbridge, and a number of spurs to mills and works.|$|R
50|$|John Towlerton Leather {{was born}} in Beeston Park, Yorkshire on 30 August 1804. He trained under his uncle George <b>Leather,</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Aire and Calder Navigation, and of the Goole docks. In 1829 he began his own {{practice}} in Sheffield, and became engineer of the Sheffield Waterworks in 1833.|$|R
50|$|After its construction, Worsbrough Reservoir was {{extended}} in 1826. The shareholders of the Dearne and Dove Canal {{had wanted to}} build a completely new reservoir near Wentworth Castle, on the Stainborough Dike, but the House of Lords committee imposed certain conditions on the scheme, and the company withdrew the bill rather than accept the conditions. Instead the <b>engineer</b> George <b>Leather</b> suggested raising the water level of the existing reservoir by 4.5 ft, and this was carried out. It increased the surface area by 20 acre. Although the Worsbrough Branch of the canal was closed to traffic in 1906, due to subsidence from coal mining, the reservoir continued to serve its function, as the closed branch was still used as a water feeder for the main canal. In order to comply with the Reservoirs Safety Act, two new spillways were constructed in 1984.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the trade}} above Haddlesey, around four-fifths {{travelled}} via Selby, {{with the rest}} using the lower Aire. The <b>engineer</b> George <b>Leather,</b> writing in 1822, noted that the route to Goole via Selby was {{much better than the}} lower Aire, but that it still suffered from problems. These included the size and depth of the canal, the provision of only one lock between the canal and the river, and that there were no docks at Selby, suitable for the brigs and other vessels that used the river. Meanwhile, the Aire and Calder were facing the prospect of rival schemes to provide canals parallel to the rivers. The Aire and Dun Canal was proposed in 1817, to run from Knottingley to Newbridge on the Dutch River, with a branch to Doncaster on the River Don Navigation, while the Went and Wakefield Canal would join the Barnsley Canal at Cold Hiendley to the River Don above Newbridge. To head off the competition, the Aire and Calder proposed a new cut from Knottingley to Goole, which included the provision of a cut at Bank Dole to maintain the connection to the Selby Canal. A petition was presented to Parliament in late 1819, {{and as a result of}} opposition, clauses were inserted to maintain the lower Aire and the Selby Canal, and to ensure parity of tolls on the new cut and the old routes.|$|R
50|$|A refuge harbour {{had been}} {{suggested}} in 1794, however parliamentary approval was not granted until 1844. Construction {{of the modern}} harbour began in 1845 when the Royal Navy established a base at Portland for replenishment of the fleet. The new base at Portland {{was to be the}} first naval anchorage specifically designed for the new steam navy. The construction of the initial two breakwaters - the southern pair - began in 1849, after HRH Prince Albert laid the foundation stone on 25 July 1849. They were designed by engineer James Meadows Rendel, and the work carried out under civil <b>engineer</b> John Towlerton <b>Leather,</b> with Rendel as engineer in chief (until his death in 1856), and John Coode as resident engineer. The two southern breakwaters were declared complete by HRH Edward the Prince of Wales on 10 August 1872. The construction work had become Dorset's greatest tourist attraction, and the country's most expensive public project.|$|R
5|$|Fowler {{was born}} in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land {{surveyor}} John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton <b>Leather,</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather's uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway surveys. From 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George <b>Leather</b> as resident <b>engineer</b> on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway {{when it opened in}} 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a consulting engineer in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He {{became a member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Boadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons.|$|R
50|$|The current Fort Gilkicker was {{constructed}} between the years 1863 and 1869 at Stokes Bay, Gosport. Its {{purpose was to}} defend the deep water anchorage at Spithead {{and to protect the}} western approach to Portsmouth harbour. The fort was begun by a contractor who failed in November 1863 early in the stages of the construction and a renowned civil <b>engineer,</b> John Towlerton <b>Leather</b> who was already involved {{in the construction of the}} great sea forts at nearby Spithead, was asked to complete the Fort at Gilkicker. His yard was nearby at Stokes Bay, the site of which eventually became the Stokes Bay Submarine Mining Establishment. The new Fort Gilkicker was conceived as a curvilinier fort for twenty six guns on one level firing through armoured embrasures with a barrack closing the rear. It faced in a more easterly direction that its predecessor and its principal role was to direct fire on Sturbridge Shoal and to the flanks were to bear upon Spithead and Stokes Bay. The design for the fort was altered slightly and it was completed in 1871 for twenty two guns in casemates with five heavier guns in open positions on the roof.The estimated cost of Fort Gilkicker in 1869 was £61,395, the actual cost on completion being £58,766.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} new {{investigation}} into how surface topography and friction affect human touch–feel perception. In contrast with previous work based on micro-scale mapping of surface mechanical and tribological properties, this investigation {{focuses on the}} direct measurement of the friction generated when a fingertip is stroked on a test specimen. A special friction apparatus was built for the in situ testing, based on a linear flexure mechanism with both contact force and frictional force measured simultaneously. Ten specimens, already independently assessed in a 'perception clinic', with materials including natural wood, <b>leather,</b> <b>engineered</b> plastics and metal were tested and the results compared with the perceived rankings. Because surface geometrical features are suspected to {{play a significant role}} in perception, a second set of samples, all of one material, were prepared and tested in order to minimize the influence of properties such as hardness and thermal conductivity. To minimize subjective effects, all specimens were also tested in a roller-on-block configuration based upon the same friction apparatus, with the roller materials being steel, brass and rubber. This paper reports the detailed design and instrumentation of the friction apparatus, the experimental set-up and the friction test results. Attempts have been made to correlate the measured properties and the perceived feelings for both roughness and friction. The results show that the measured roughness and friction coefficient both have a strong correlation with the rough–smooth and grippy–slippery feelings...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of 11 March 1864, {{assisted}} by a strong south-western gale, the newly built dam, known as the Dale Dyke Dam in Bradfield Dale near Low Bradfield on the River Loxley, collapsed while it was being filled for the first time. An estimated 3 million cubic metres (700 million imperial gallons) of water swept down the Loxley Valley, through Loxley Village and on to Malin Bridge and Hillsborough, where the River Loxley joins the River Don. The flood continued south down the Don into Sheffield centre, around the eastward bend of the Don at Lady's Bridge, then to Attercliffe, past the sites of what later became Don Valley Stadium, Sheffield Arena and Meadowhall Centre, and on to Rotherham. A wall of water moved swiftly down the valley, destroying everything in its course. The centre of the town, situated on {{the hill to the}} south, escaped damage, but the densely populated district of the Wicker, around the new railway viaduct (constructed by the Manchester and Sheffield Railway), was completely destroyed. The company's consultant <b>engineer,</b> John Towlerton <b>Leather,</b> was one of a family of worthy Yorkshire engineers who were involved in such work. His uncle, George Leather, had been responsible for reservoirs around Leeds and Bradford, and one of these was the scene of a dramatic collapse, in 1852, when 81 people died. John <b>Leather</b> and resident <b>engineer</b> John Gunson were working closely together during the construction of the dam. Leather designed the dam and oversaw its construction whereas Gunson directed and supervised the construction of the dam. Gunson was on site {{the night of}} the collapse and stated that there was a concerning crack in the outer slope of the embankment. Gunson convinced himself that the crack was not harmful but still took the precaution of opening up the valves on the middle of the embankment to allow more water through. This failed to prevent the crack from worsening.|$|R
