40|$|Laboratory-scale {{experiments}} simulating {{the injection}} {{of fresh water}} into brine in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) cavern were performed at Sandia National Laboratories for various conditions of injection rate and small and large injection tube diameters. The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code FLUENT was used to simulate these experiments to evaluate the predictive capability of FLUENT for brine-water mixing in an SPR cavern. The data-model comparisons show that FLUENT simulations predict the mixing plume depth reasonably well. Predictions of the near-wall brine concentrations compare very well with the experimental data. The simulated time for the mixing plume to reach the vessel wall was underpredicted for the small <b>injection</b> <b>tubes</b> but reasonable for the large <b>injection</b> <b>tubes.</b> The difference in the time to reach the wall is {{probably due to the}} three-dimensional nature of the mixing plume as it spreads out at the air-brine or oil-brine interface. The depth of the mixing plume as it spreads out along the interface was within a factor of 2 of the experimental data. The FLUENT simulation results predict the plume mixing accurately, especially the water concentration when the mixing plume reaches the wall. This parameter value is the most significant feature of the mixing process because it will determine the amount of enhanced leaching at the oil-brine interface...|$|E

It is known that a 15 ~ 25 MW spallation target is required for a practical 1000 MWth ADS. The design of a 20 MW spallation target is very challenging because more than 60 % of the beam power is deposited as heat in a small volume of the target system. In the present work, a numerical design study was performed to obtain the optimal design parameters for a 20 MW spallation target for a 1000 MWth ADS. A dual <b>injection</b> <b>tube</b> was proposed for {{the reduction of the}} LBE flow rate at the target channel.

40|$|Thrust {{chambers}} for {{liquid propellant}} rocket engines include three principal components. One of these components is an injector which contains {{a plurality of}} injection elements to meter the flow of propellants at a predetermined rate, and fuel to oxidizer mixture ratio, to introduce the mixture into the combustion chamber, and to cause them to be atomized within the combustion chamber so that even combustion takes place. Evolving from these injectors are tube injectors. These tube injectors have injection elements for injecting the oxidizer into the combustion chamber. The oxidizer and fuel must be metered at predetermined rates and mixture ratios in order to mix them within the combustion chamber so that combustion takes place smoothly and completely. Hence tube injectors are subject to improvement.

40|$|The {{discharge}} {{characteristics of}} two similar injection valves {{operated by a}} single-cylinder fuel-injection pump were determined with an apparatus that measured the quantity of fuel discharged from each valve during every 0. 5 degrees of pump rotation. It was found that similar discharges took place from the two valves at all pump speeds when the valve-opening pressures, the nozzle-orifice diameters, and the injection-tube lengths were the same for both valves. Under these conditions, the effects of changing the pump speed, the pump throttle setting, or the nozzle orifice diameter were {{very similar to those}} occurring with a single-injection valve. By a proper selection of discharge-orifice areas and valve-opening pressures it was possible to obtain a great many combinations of discharge quantities, discharge rates, and injection timings for the two valves.

40|$|A newly {{patented}} process for slicing silicon wafers that has distinct advantages over methods now widely used is described.

The new system uses a multiple or ganged band saw, arranged and spaced so that each side, or length, segment of a blade element, or loop, provides a cutting function. Each blade is maintained precisely in position by guides as it enters and leaves each ingot. The cutting action is performed with a conventional abrasive slurry composed of diamond grit suspended in an oil- or water-based vehicle. The distribution system draws the slurry from the supply reservoir and pumps it to the <b>injection</b> <b>tubes</b> to supply it to each side of each ingot.

Often referred to as "quick quench," the mixing occurs with chemical conversion and substantial heat release.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the influence of upstream turbulence on discrete-hole film cooling of a model blade in confined cross flow is presented and discussed. A model blade and test section were designed and constructed. A system for constant-temperature hot-wire anemometry was implemented. A microcomputer-based data acquisition, control, and processing system was designed and implemented. The model blade was a blunt body with a semicircular leading edge, a flat after body, and a tapered trailing edge. Local heat transfer coefficients without injection of a secondary fluid were determined using a thin-film technique. In the film cooling studies, two rows of discrete injection holes at $ pm$ 30 $ sp circ$ from the stagnation line were used. The <b>injection</b> <b>tubes</b> were oriented normal {{to the surface of the}} model blade and were coplanar with the primary flow velocity vector. Nominal turbulence intensities of 0. 7 %, 9. 8 %, and 14. 4 % at a location 1. 3 diameters upstream of the stagnation line on the semicircular leading edge of the model blade were investigated.

40|$|Vertical flow {{filters and}} {{vertical}} flow constructed wetlands are established wastewater treatment systems and {{have also been}} proposed {{for the treatment of}} contaminated groundwater. This study investigates the removal processes of volatile organic compounds in a pilot-scale vertical flow filter. The filter is intermittently irrigated with contaminated groundwater containing benzene, MTBE and ammonium as the main contaminants. The system is characterized by unsaturated conditions and high contaminant removal efficiency. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the contribution of biodegradation and volatilization to the overall removal of benzene and MTBE. Tracer tests and flow rate measurements showed a highly transient flow and heterogeneous transport regime. Radon- 222, naturally occurring in the treated groundwater, was used as a gas tracer and indicated a high volatilization potential. Radon- 222 behavior was reproduced by numerical simulations and extrapolated for benzene and MTBE, and indicated these compounds also have a high volatilization potential. In contrast, passive sampler measurements on top of the filter detected only low benzene and MTBE concentrations. Biodegradation potential was evaluated by the analysis of catabolic genes involved in organic compound degradation and a quantitative estimation of biodegradation was derived from stable isotope fractionation analysis. Results suggest that despite the high volatilization potential, biodegradation is the predominant mass removal process in the filter system, which indicates that the volatilized fraction of the contaminants is still subject to subsequent biodegradation. In particular, the upper filter layer located between the <b>injection</b> <b>tubes</b> and the surface of the system might also contribute to biodegradation, and might {{play a crucial role in}} avoiding the emission of volatilized contaminants into the atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|The work {{carried out}} during the PhD was {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} high-density polarized gas targets used in high-energy physics. The thesis is related to the PAX experiment, which aims to produce a beam of polarized anti-protons, by means of spin-filtering with a polarized atomic target. In order to obtain the densities required by high-energy particle physic, gaseous targets are a combination of an Atomic Beam Source and a storage cell. The possibility to improve the various components of the ABS and the storage cell has been evaluated, through dedicated systematic studies, using the facilities available in “Spinlab” of Universit´a di Ferrara. The attenuation of a collimated beam passing through the rest gas of a vacuum system has been studied; different nozzle geometries have been tested (comparing the measured data with the data calculated by simulation programs); design and tests of an new kind of injection tube with internal fins (with the aim of decreasing the conductance of the storage cell without diminishing the acceptance and thus to increase the integrated target thickness). Estimation of the attenuation coefficients and total cross sections have been derived from the measurements of the attenuation of a hydrogen or deuterium beam. This quantities are important for projecting new ABS and to improve the existing ones. A favorable nozzle geometry (called “trumpet”) that increases the beam intensity has been derived from simulations and experimental tests. Tests on the <b>injection</b> <b>tubes</b> with fins did not give positive results when applied to the PAX storage cell geometry; however a azimuthal motion of the atoms of a focused beam emerged from the measurements, a motion that until now has been completely neglected...|$|E

The aquifer has a relatively low permeability and the gradient is very small resulting in an estimated groundwater velocity of approximately 10 m per year.

Multilevel monitoring wells were installed at different distances around the injection point, along with temperature sensors and devices specifically developed to detect magnetic particles via measurement of electromagnetic susceptibility. Groundwater samples were taken before the injection and during several months after the injection.
